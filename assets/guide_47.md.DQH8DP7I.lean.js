OBJECTIVE To determine whether hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for poor outcome in the acutely ill, and to assess the potential of exogenous albumin administration for improving outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, but whether this association is causal has remained unclear. Trials investigating albumin therapy to correct hypoalbuminemia have proven inconclusive. METHODS A meta-analysis was conducted of 90 cohort studies with 291,433 total patients evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis and, separately, of nine prospective controlled trials with 535 total patients on correcting hypoalbuminemia. RESULTS Hypoalbuminemia was a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcome. Each 10-g/L decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay respectively by 28% and 71%, and increased resource utilization by 66%. The association between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcome appeared to be independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. Analysis of dose-dependency in controlled trials of albumin therapy suggested that complication rates may be reduced when the serum albumin level attained during albumin administration exceeds 30 g/L. CONCLUSIONS Hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Further well-designed trials are needed to characterize the effects of albumin therapy in hypoalbuminemic patients. In the interim, there is no compelling basis to withhold albumin therapy if it is judged clinically appropriate.

Write an article based on this summary: – A majority of Americans don't believe America is being made great again after nearly six months of President Trump in the Oval Office, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll that finds the president's approval rating slumping to 36%—down from 42% in April. Some 58% of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing, an increase of five points, with 48% saying they \\"disapprove strongly,\\" notes the Post. Highlights from the poll: The Post compares Trump's approval rating to his predecessors at this point in their first terms: Former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush each held 59% approval ratings, while Bill Clinton had slumped to a record low 43% in late June. Some 48% of Americans think the country's leadership in the world has weakened; 27% say it is stronger and 23% say it's about the same. Americans' view of Trump's handling of the economy goes in the president's favor, with 43% approving and 41% disapproving. Another silver lining for Trump: 52% think he's interfering in investigations into Russian election meddling, down from 56% last month. Some 50% of those surveyed prefer ObamaCare, while 24% prefer Republicans' plans to replace it. (Those plans have stalled in the Senate.)

The poll shows Trump's approval rating at a dismal 36%, a drop from 42% in April. With 58% of Americans disapproving of Trump's performance, up by five points since the previous poll, it raises concerns about public perception of the current administration. Compared to his predecessors at this stage in their first terms, Trump's approval ratings are significantly lower. Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush both boasted 59% approval ratings, while Bill Clinton held a record low of 43% in late June of his first term. These numbers suggest that the public is losing faith in the leadership and direction of the country under President Trump. The poll also reveals that 48% of Americans think the country's leadership in the world has weakened, with only 27% believing it has grown stronger, and 23% seeing no change. In regards to Trump's handling of the economy, there is a small positive shift, with 43% approving and 41% disapproving of his economic policies. Other aspects of the Trump administration have had mixed reactions among the public. The number of people who believe he's interfering in investigations into Russian election meddling went down from 56% last month to 52%. When it comes to healthcare, 50% of those surveyed prefer ObamaCare, while only 24% are in favor of the Republicans' plans to replace it, which have currently stalled in the Senate. Public trust in Trump's ability to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin remains low, with 32% of Americans trusting him a good or great amount, 48% not trusting him at all, and 18% having \\"just some\\" trust in his negotiation skills. In terms of the overall progress on Trump's agenda, only 38% say he is making significant progress, while 55% believe he's not. Despite these negative numbers for Trump's administration, Democrats have their struggles as well. Only 37% of those polled say that the Democratic party stands for something, while 52% view the party as merely a stand against Trump. This result highlights the need for both parties to reevaluate their values and goals in order to restore public confidence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

India encountered big problems with extinction during the following years. Which country had more species go extinct? Hint: One of the main causes of extinction is introduction of exotic species into an environment. These exotic and new species can also be called invasive species or non-native species . These non-native species, being new to an area, may not have natural predators in the new habitat, which allows their populations to easily adapt and grow. Invasive species out-compete the native species for resources. Sometimes invasive species are so successful at living in a certain habitat that the native species go extinct ( Figure below ). The answer is:","completion":"India had more species go extinct due to the introduction of exotic species into their environment. As mentioned in the hint, one of the main causes of extinction is the introduction of exotic species, also known as invasive species or non-native species, into an environment. These non-native species often do not have natural predators in the new habitat, allowing their populations to easily adapt and grow. Invasive species can out-compete the native species for resources such as food, water, and shelter. This competition can lead to the decline or even extinction of the native species in the affected area. In this scenario, India decided to introduce several exotic species into their environment, which can significantly disrupt the ecosystem and put the native species at risk. The invasive species can prey on the native species, compete with them for resources, introduce new diseases, or even hybridize with them, leading to a loss of genetic diversity. On the other hand, Singapore was very protective of its native species and worked towards preserving its ecosystem. By not introducing non-native species into the environment, Singapore reduced the potential risks and negative impacts associated with exotic species. This approach helped Singapore maintain a more stable and sustainable ecosystem, where the native species could continue to thrive. Therefore, it can be concluded that India, which introduced several exotic species into their environment, experienced bigger problems with extinction during the following years when compared to Singapore, which was more protective of its native species."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Federal Communications Commission was a 2014 U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit case vacating portions of the FCC Open Internet Order 2010 that the court determined could only be applied to common carriers. The court ruled that the FCC did not have the authority to impose the order in its entirety. Because the FCC had previously classified broadband providers under Title I of the Communications Act of 1934, the court ruled that the FCC had relinquished its right to regulate them like common carriers. The case was largely viewed as a loss for network neutrality supporters and a victory for the cable broadband industry. Of the three orders that make up the FCC Open Internet Order 2010, two were vacated (no blocking and no unreasonable discrimination) and one was upheld (transparency). Judge David S.

Yellow gumballs. This was awful for Stan, just awful. He had loved Sheila for a long time, fought for her heart, believed in their love until finally she had come around. They were about to kiss for the first time and then this: yellow gumballs. Stan went to a group to try to accept that Sheila was gone. It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in California. After several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs. He did this because he believed in capitalism, he loved capitalism. He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon's stock price, he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America like blood staining through a handkerchief, he loved how everything could be tracked and mirrored in numbers. When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio; and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila. On the night before the IPO of gumballs.com, Sheila came to Stan in a dream. She was standing in a kiddie pool; Stan and his brothers and sisters were running around splashing and screaming; she had managed to insert herself into a Super-8 home movie of Stan's family, shot in the late 70's. She looked terribly sad. \\"Sheila, where are you?\\" Stan said. \\"Why did you leave me, why did you become gumballs?\\" \\"The Ant King has me,\\" Sheila said. \\"You must rescue me.\\" What did Stan sell in his new shop?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Where would George and Helene go to leave messages for each other? A common convention in the early decades of newspaper and magazine film reviews was to describe in the write-up the entire storyline including, in a substantial number of instances, the ending, thus unintentionally enabling subsequent generations of readers to reconstruct a lost film's contents. True to form, those who evaluated Seven Faces, such as Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times, did go into considerable detail regarding plot twists, as related herein below.Papa Chibou, the elderly caretaker of Musée Pratouchy, a Parisian wax museum, feels a strong kinship with the figures, particularly with that of Napoleon. He spots at the waxworks a romantic young couple, Georges, a lawyer, and Helene, the daughter of a stern judge who disapproves of his daughter's choice and forbids her to see Georges. Papa Chibou suggests to them that they can still stay in touch, without disobeying her father's directive not to speak with each other, by placing secret personal messages in the pockets of Napoleon's uniform. However, a missing letter and confusion in communication causes Georges to arrive at the mistaken conclusion that Helene has redirected her affections towards a foolish young man, who is unworthy of her and excessively preoccupied with his stylish personal appearance and elegant clothing. The answer to this question is:","completion":"George and Helene would go to the Musée Pratouchy, a Parisian wax museum, to leave messages for each other.

Elizabeth I forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the Netherlands in 1539, the Papal States in 1547 and in Paris in 1548.

It is a dream laboratory where researchers are at work studying dreamers. Their findings have discovered that everyone dreams from three to seven times a night, although in ordinary life a person may remember none or only one of his dreams. While the subjects--usually students--sleep, special machines record their brain waves and eye movements as well as the body movements that signal the end of a dream. Surprisingly, all subjects sleep soundly. Observers report that a person usually fidgets before a dream. Once the dream has started, his body relaxes and his eyes become more active, as if the curtain had gone up on a show. As soon as the machine shows that the dream is over, a buzzer wakens the sleeper. He sits up, records his dream, and goes back to sleep--perhaps to dream some more. Researchers have found that if the dreamer is wakened immediately after his dream, he can usually recall the entire dream. If he is allowed to sleep even five more minutes, his memory of the dream will have disappeared.

Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them.

Given the following context: The attribution of the panel reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now thought to have been completed c. 1438–40, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.Attempts to date it have undergone similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel was believed to be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan. answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who is credited with very few works?

He later discovers that the reason for this is that the couple had a daughter who recently died from cancer and looked like Emily. Later, when David visits Laura, she nervously and ambiguously implies that her husband has begun abusing her in response to their child's death, emotionally and perhaps even physically. David meets Elizabeth Young (Elisabeth Shue), a local woman, and her niece, Amy, who is roughly the same age as Emily.

On the underside of the sink, hold each line in place with a washer and nut. You may need someone to hold the faucet still as you tighten these to where the line enters the sink. Make sure the sink is level and straight before tightening the lines. Flip over the drain strainer and place it on your counter. Roll the putty between your fingers to make it malleable, then spread it around the strainer’s rim. Press the strainer into the drain. Slip the rubber gasket over the bottom of the drain under the sink. Place the threaded flange over it. Secure the flange and drain in place by tightening some washers and a nut in the holes on the flange. Towel away any putty left in the sink. These parts come packaged with the drain, although you can always purchase them separately. Locate the water supply lines coming out from the wall. Slip a metal connector over each one and plug a faucet line into the connector’s other end. Tighten the fastener with an adjustable wrench to hold the lines together. The top part of the garbage disposal unit most likely fits over the bottom of the drain and is held by a fastener you screw on. Next, attach the dishwasher hose to a small spout on the garbage disposal unit or the pipes and hold it in place with a hose clamp. Read your owner’s manual or search the manufacturer’s website for more information on how to install the garbage disposal. The drain pipe should run from the drain to the floor.

Can we draw the following conclusion? The Grand Prix des Frontières was held at a street circuit","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the Grand Prix des Frontières was held at a street circuit in Chimay, Belgium. This historic motor race was created by Jules Buisseret, who played a crucial role in the establishment of the circuit in the town of Chimay. The unique street circuit provided a challenging environment for drivers and offered exciting racing for spectators. The first Grand Prix des Frontières event was held in 1929, marking the beginning of a long-lasting tradition in the world of motor racing. The race attracted drivers and teams from various countries, showcasing their skills and competing for the title. The Chimay street circuit comprised public roads, with a layout that evolved over time. In its early years, the circuit was approximately 10.9 km (6.8 miles) long, and featured a combination of tight corners, high-speed straights, and elevation changes. Over the years, the circuit underwent several modifications to address safety concerns and keep the event relevant. By 1958, the length of the track was reduced to 6.3 km (3.9 miles) in order to provide a safer and more manageable course. As the Grand Prix des Frontières grew in popularity, it attracted some prominent names from the world of motorsport. The race served as an opportunity for up-and-coming drivers to prove themselves against more experienced racers, and it often featured various categories of vehicles competing during the event, including sports cars, single-seaters, and touring cars. Some notable winners of the race include Olivier Gendebien, who won four times in the 1950s, and Jacky Ickx, who recorded his first major win in 1965. Unfortunately, by the late 1960s and early 1970s, safety concerns regarding street circuits in general began to surface. The aftermath of several high-profile accidents in motorsport led to a shift in focus toward more secure racing environments. Consequently, the Grand Prix des Frontières was no longer deemed appropriate as concerns for driver, spectator, and public safety intensified. The final event was held in 1972, bringing an end to the 43-year legacy of the Grand Prix des Frontières at the Chimay street circuit. While the race was discontinued, the circuit itself continued to host various forms of motorsport events for some time. Today, the classic Chimay street circuit has become part of the region's history and is remembered as a vital chapter in the story of motor racing. In conclusion, the Grand Prix des Frontières, organized by Jules Buisseret, was indeed held at a street circuit in Chimay, Belgium. From its beginnings in 1929 to its discontinuation in 1972, this event provided thrilling competition on a challenging and historic circuit, leaving an indelible mark on the world of motorsport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (later known as the Pre-Raphaelites) was a group of English painters, poets, and critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The three founders were joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form the seven-member \\"brotherhood\\". Their principles were shared by other artists, including Marie Spartali Stillman and Ford Madox Brown. - A priest or priestess (feminine) (from Greek \\"presbýteros\\" through Latin \\"presbyter\\", \\"elder\\", or from Old High German \\"priast\\", \\"prest\\", from Vulgar Latin \\"provost\\" \\"one put over others\\", from Latin \\"praepositus\\" \\"person placed in charge\\"), is a person authorized to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities. They also have the authority or power to administer religious rites; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a deity or deities. Their office or position is the priesthood, a term which also may apply to such persons collectively. - Charles Robert Darwin, (12 February 1809 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist and geologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. - A sobriquet is a nickname, sometimes assumed, but often given by another. Distinct from a pseudonym that is assumed as a disguise, it usually is a familiar name, familiar enough such that it may be used in place of a real name without the need of explanation. This salient characteristic is of sufficient familiarity that the sobriquet may become more familiar than the original name. - John William Waterhouse (April 6, 1849 February 10, 1917) was an English painter known for working in the Pre-Raphaelite style. He worked several decades after the breakup of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which had seen its heyday in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to his sobriquet \\"the modern Pre-Raphaelite\\". Borrowing stylistic influences not only from the earlier Pre-Raphaelites but also from his contemporaries, the Impressionists, his artworks were known for their depictions of women from both ancient Greek mythology and Arthurian legend. - The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States, from the 1890s to the 1920s.

It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - Charles Kingsley (12 June 1819 23 January 1875) was a broad church priest of the Church of England, a university professor, social reformer, historian and novelist.

He was a friend and correspondent with Charles Darwin. - The Working Men's College (or WMC), is among the earliest adult education institutions established in the United Kingdom, and Europe's oldest extant centre for adult education. Founded by Christian Socialists, at its inception it was at the forefront of liberal education philosophy. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy.

Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Broad church is a term referring to latitudinarian churchmanship in the Church of England in particular and Anglicanism in general. The term is often used to refer to secular political organisations, meaning that they encompass a broad range of opinion. - Hypatia (\\"Hupatía\\"; born 35070; died 415), often called Hypatia of Alexandria, was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher in Egypt, then a part of the Byzantine Empire.

President Barack Obama's decision to take executive action on immigration won praise from the religious community Sunday, when a leader of the U.S. Catholic Church endorsed the move. \\"The bishops of the United States -- we're very much in favor of action being taken to protect people who need to come out of the shadows,\\" newly appointed Archbishop of Chicago, Blase Cupich, said Sunday on CBS' \\"Face the Nation.\\" \\"It's been too long of a time for people to wait for comprehensive immigration reform,\\" he continued. \\"And so we see this as an important first step hopefully to jump start what's happening.\\" Cupich, the ninth Archbishop of Chicago, is Pope Francis' first American appointed archbishop. His position generally reflects what the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops have called for in the past: a path to citizenship and government autonomy over the law enforcement process at the border. Over the past week, Republicans have been quick to slam the President for taking unilateral action, with some going as far as comparing him to a monarch or an emperor. On Sunday, Cupich said it's important for the President to compromise with Congress -- including the Republican-led House which has stalled on an immigration bill for the past 15 months. \\"I think it's very important that this be done very carefully but we applaud it as good first step,\\" Cupich said. \\"More needs to be done.

Craig became a criminal not an attorney.. [b]. Brett became a criminal not an attorney..","completion":"[b]. Brett became a criminal not an attorney. Craig studied hard for the bar exam but Brett didn't. Craig was determined to become a successful attorney. He dedicated endless hours to understanding and memorizing complex legal concepts and structures. As the date of the exam approached, his confidence in his ability to pass grew. He had always admired the power of the law and the impact a proficient attorney could have on the lives of their clients. For Craig, becoming an attorney was not just a profession; it was a calling. Brett, on the other hand, didn't share Craig's passion for the law. He cared very little about the bar exam or its implications on his future. As time went by, he began to resent the life he had hastily chosen. Brett decided that he didn't want to become an attorney like his parents and siblings. He wanted to take control of his own destiny and make his mark on the world in a different way. As Craig continued to prepare for the bar exam, Brett began exploring other avenues of interest. Eventually, he found himself associating with a group of individuals who were involved in criminal activities. Brett admired their fearlessness and the excitement they brought into his life. The mundane routine of attending law school paled in comparison to the thrill he experienced as he became involved in illegal activities. In an ironic twist of fate, Brett's world collided with Craig's in the courtroom. While Craig had successfully passed the bar exam and was now an attorney who fought against criminals, Brett was standing trial for his involvement in organized crime. The judge's attempts to make Brett see the error of his ways fell on deaf ears, and he was ultimately convicted and sentenced to several years in prison. As Brett sat in his prison cell, he couldn't help but ponder what could have been if he had chosen a different path. He thought about Craig, who was making a difference in the world through his legal expertise. Unlike Brett, Craig did not let his family legacy pressure him into becoming an attorney. Craig genuinely believed in the power of the law and applied his intelligence and dedication to the pursuit of justice. On the other hand, Brett had succumbed to his own doubts, and his fear of not being able to live up to expectation led him down a dangerous path. Despite the stark contrast in their choices and outcomes, the story of Craig and Brett serves as a reminder that life is full of uncertainties, and the path you choose plays a significant role in shaping your future. Pursuing a fulfilling career, following one's passions, and understanding the consequences of our actions are crucial elements in determining the course of one's life."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Targeted by U.S. airstrikes: The secretive al-Qaeda cell was plotting an ‘imminent attack’ In addition to a broader campaign of airstrikes against Islamic State targets across Syria on Monday night, the United States also pounded a little-known but well-resourced al-Qaeda cell that some American officials fear could pose a direct threat to the United States. The Pentagon said in a statement early Tuesday that the United States conducted eight strikes west of Aleppo against the cell, called the Khorasan Group, targeting its “training camps, an explosives and munitions production facility, a communications building and command and control facilities.” Army Lt. Gen. William C. Mayville Jr., director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later told reporters that the group was in the “final stages of plans to execute major attacks against Western targets and potentially the U.S. homeland.” He added, “We believe the Khorasan Group was nearing the execution phase of an attack either in Europe” or the United States, having attempted to recruit Westerners who can more easily enter the target countries. Mayville said the group was hit by ship-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles during the first of three waves of attacks early Tuesday. The attacks bring broader attention to the group of clandestine al-Qaeda operatives, which U.S. officials first warned about last week. The group “has established a safe haven in Syria to develop external attacks, construct and test improvised explosive devices and recruit Westerners to conduct operations,” the Pentagon said. The mission of the Khorasan, led by longtime al-Qaeda leader Muhsin al-Fadhli, appears to be different than other militant groups operating in Syria. Its objective in Syria isn’t to overthrow Bashar al-Assad, or accumulate land and resources like Islamic State. Rather, its members have come from Pakistan, Yemen and Afghanistan to exploit the flood of Western jihadists who now have skin in the fight — and possess very valuable passports. According to the Associated Press, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri dispatched the group to recruit those Western fighters, who have a better chance of escaping scrutiny at airports and could place bombs on planes. James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said late last week that “in terms of threat to the homeland, Khorasan may pose as much of a danger” as the Islamic State. The New York Times then reported that the group posed a “more direct threat” to the United States and Europe than the Islamic State. “The group’s repeated efforts to conceal explosive devices to destroy aircraft demonstrate its continued pursuits of high-profile attacks against the West, its increasing awareness of Western security procedures and its efforts to adapt to those procedures that we adopt,” Nicholas Rasmussen, deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center, recently said, referring to al-Qaeda’s bombmaking branch in Yemen. But beyond such intent, little is known of Khorasan. Even now, it’s unclear how many members Khorasan has, how long it’s been in existence, or what its core message is. Its low profile provides a sharp contrast to the flamboyance of the Islamic State, which operates with an almost pathological desire for attention, publishing graphic-heavy magazines and flooding social media with images of carnage. What is known of Khorasan barely extends beyond its leader, a notorious al-Qaeda operative whom President George W. Bush mentioned in a 2005 speech. U.S. officials have tracked Fadhli for at least a decade, and he is cited by both the United Nations and the State Department as having participated in al-Qaeda plots. The State Department, calling Fadhli a “senior facilitator and financier,” put out a 7 million reward for information about his location in 2012. “He has assisted al-Qaeda in moving multiple operatives from Pakistan via Iraq and Turkey to destinations in Europe, North Africa and Syria,” a State Department release said, “and [he] is believed likely to continue moving experienced al-Qaeda operatives to reinforce and gain influence in those areas.” Fadhli’s rise through the al-Qaeda ranks was both and meteoric and startling. Born on April 24, 1981, in Kuwait, he ascended so quickly that he knew of the Sept. 11 attacks when he was barely 20 and was then tapped for additional responsibilities and terror plots, American officials said. He eventually connected with some of the most notorious terrorists of the past generation, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq. “He was the bodyguard and second-in-command for a leader in the al-Qaeda network and fought for al-Qaeda in the north of Afghanistan,” the United Nations reported. “Al-Fadhli also fought against Russian forces in Chechnya, where he trained in the use of firearms, anticraft guns and explosives. Al-Fadhli was a facilitator connected with the al-Zarqawi groups in Iraq, providing support to fighters there.” But where he appeared to show his true worth to the group was in his fundraising and organizational skills. He allegedly raised money for an October 2002 attack on a French ship off the coast of Yemen, killing one crew member and disgorging 50,000 barrels of crude oil that inundated 45 miles of coastline. And soon, he had stitched together an “extensive network” of Kuwaiti jihadist donors, according to the State Department. Following a stint in a Kuwaiti prison for funding terrorist activities, he landed in Iran, where he was soon leading an Iranian al-Qaeda cell, according to the Treasury Department. In that position, he “facilitate[d] the travel of extremists to Afghanistan or Iraq via Iran,” it said. “In addition to providing funding for al-Qaeda activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan, [Fadhli's] network is working to move fighters and money through Turkey to support al-Qaeda affiliated elements in Syria.” And now, officials said, he’s trying to do the reverse: Move Western jihadists out of Syria, where Khorasan thrives off chaos. There’s “an unholy mix of people in Iraq and Syria right now,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) of the House Intelligence Committee told AP. “They can combine in ways that could pose a greater threat than their individual pieces. And that’s something we worry about.” Updated from Monday’s editions at 7:16 a.m. and 1:52 p.m. Tuesday. is a foreign affairs writer at the Washington Post.

Summarize this article: Share This Story Tweet Share Share Pin Email While Donald J. Trump refuses to release his federal tax returns, saying his tax rate is “none of your business,” a USA TODAY analysis found Trump’s businesses have been involved in at least 100 lawsuits and other disputes related to unpaid taxes or how much tax his businesses owe. Trump’s companies have been engaged in battles over taxes almost every year from the late 1980s until as recently as March, the analysis of court cases, property records, and other documents across the country shows. At least five Trump companies were issued warrants totaling more than 13,000 for late or unpaid taxes in New York state just since Trump declared his candidacy in June 2015, according to state records. This spring, as Trump flew to campaign rallies around the country aboard his trademark private jet, the state of New York filed a tax warrant to try to collect 8,578 in unpaid taxes from the Trump-owned company that owns the Boeing 757. The company has since paid that tax bill. As recently as last week, Trump said he was “willing to pay more” taxes personally and that “taxes for the rich will go up somewhat” if he becomes president. But the lawsuits and other tax-related disputes show a different reality for his businesses. They illustrate a pattern of systematically disputing tax bills, arguing for lower property assessments, and in some cases not paying taxes until the government takes additional action. At least three dozen times, Trump companies’ unpaid tax bills have forced the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance to go to local courts to get liens against his properties to try to collect overdue bills. New Jersey also had to go to court for a lien to collect a Trump company’s unpaid tax bill. Eventually, those disputes were resolved, and his companies paid some amount of taxes. The disputes surrounding Trump’s business taxes are uncharted territory for the presidential nominee of a major party. The GOP’s 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, also had extensive business interests as the leader of a private-equity fund. But Trump has a network of complicated real estate and other investments, and some of the tax disputes are ongoing. “You have to ignore us to end up with a tax warrant. We try to work with taxpayers to resolve the debt, long before it becomes a warrant.” Geoff Gloak, spokesman for the state Department of Taxation and Finance Trump has acknowledged that he tries to pay as little taxes as possible, and the public records across the country shed light on how he does it. In documents rarely seen by the public, Trump's businesses regularly minimize the value of his properties for tax purposes. Publicly, including in his presidential financial disclosure report, Trump’s team declares many of those same properties are worth tens of millions of dollars more. He’s fought tax collectors to lower the assessed values of his luxury golf courses in Briarcliff, N.Y., and Jupiter, Fla. Yet on his presidential financial disclosure report, he valued each at more than 50 million. USA TODAY’s examination of Trump’s track record as a business taxpayer found not just court actions, but dozens of additional tax disputes with local authorities that didn’t reach the courthouse in states including New York, Nevada, Florida and New Jersey. In some cases, Trump’s businesses have disputed tax assessments; in others, they have simply not paid the tax bill until after the government took additional action. CLOSE Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump claimed to make over 550 million in less than a year and a half, but Hillary Clinton doesn't seem impressed. Time Ignored New York bills In New York, for example, there are dozens of tax warrants against Trump businesses. Tax warrants are filed only after the state has exhausted all other options to collect what’s owed. “You have to ignore us to end up with a tax warrant,” said Geoff Gloak, spokesman for the state Department of Taxation and Finance. “We try to work with taxpayers to resolve the debt, long before it becomes a warrant.” If the tax warrant is ignored, the state can choose to take the matter to court – and in some cases has. In addition to the five tax warrants since his announcement, there are additional New York state tax warrants dating to the years before Trump became a candidate, including 1,580 in unpaid taxes in 2010 for Trump Mortgage, his failed mortgage venture, and 1,747 in unpaid taxes in early 2015 against Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, once known as the troubled Trump University, which was later paid.

(Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) Among other tax disputes involving Trump entities: Trump Mortgage owes federal taxes from 2006 and 2007 totaling more than 4,800, according to two federal tax liens filed in New York. Trump’s businesses have sued the New York City Tax Commission 55 times from the mid-1990s through 2011, disputing the city’s property assessment values on everything from apartment complexes once owned by his father to his core buildings and companies. Trump-related companies have become embroiled in disputes over sales taxes owed to New York state and New York City. Tax warrants on file in New York County court found that over the past 27 years, Trump entities owed about 300,000 in back taxes, which were eventually paid. The battles can save Trump millions of dollars. In 2006, Trump won a ruling on his 58-story headquarters at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan. It was the sixth time since 1999 that his appeals against the Tax Commission reached the courtroom, records show. The net result was about a 10% reduction over 10 years on the building — worth about 3 million to Trump. Alan Garten, general counsel to the Trump Organization, said he was unaware of the particulars of the tax warrant cases. He said disputes can arise over how one calculates sales-tax liabilities. “It happens all the time,” he said. “And some of the charges could have been mistaken.” Real estate developers often appeal assessments, and Morris Ellison, a commercial real estate tax attorney based in Charleston, S.C., said it’s difficult to compare one organization’s volume of property tax appeals vs. another’s. Garten said the companies do what any property owners have the right to do: challenge their property’s assessment to make sure they are fairly taxed. “We are a business, and we are in the business of making money,” he said. “Why should it be any different if we think the assessment is incorrect? It would be irresponsible if we didn’t. It’s got to be fair.” Trump has been particularly aggressive by any measure, acknowledging it’s part of his business strategy. “I fight like hell to pay as little as possible,” he said at a New York news conference announcing his own tax plan in September. “I fight like hell always, because it’s an expense. And you know, I feel ... and I fight. I have the best lawyers and the best accountants, and I fight, and I pay. But it’s an expense.” Conflicting accounts of worth Trump’s boasts about his wealth have sometimes undercut his attempts to slash his taxes. In 1985, Trump scooped up Mar-a-Lago, the opulent estate built by Marjorie Merriweather Post in Palm Beach, Fla., for 10 million, bragging in his 1989 book, The Art of the Deal, that it was a sweet deal, worth far more than he paid. When the property was assessed at 11.5 million and later 17 million, Trump objected. Litigation dragged on until 1993 over the tax bills. A settlement hinged on Trump agreeing not to develop the Mar-a-Lago land into individual lots, said Jay Jacknin, outside counsel for Palm Beach County’s appraisal’s office. Last year, the county assessed the property at about 20 million — though Trump’s federal financial disclosure form values it at “more than 50 million.” Similarly, just up the road in Jupiter, Fla., Trump bought the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club and Spa in 2012 for a reported 5 million, then renovated it. For the past three years, his team has appealed the assessed value, of 13.7million as of 2015. In his financial disclosure forms, Trump claims that the course on 285 acres is worth “more than 50 million” and that it throws off more than 12 million in revenue. In Westchester County, N.Y., Trump has taken an aggressive approach toward the town of Ossining regarding the taxable value of Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor. The battle gained national prominence, after an investigation in September 2015 by The Journal News, which is part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, of the club’s audacious bid to slash its taxable value by 90%. Town Assessor Fernando Gonzalez valued the 140-acre complex at 14.3 million (a valuation since increased to 15.1 million) — but Trump’s team countered that it was worth 1.4 million. For perspective, a three-bedroom villa built at Trump National’s 16th hole on a separate tax parcel sold in 2005 for 2.4 million and was recently on the market for almost 2 million.

He is questioning what some in town consider a lowball tax grievance filed by Trump's camp over the taxable value of the development. (Photo: Joe Larese/The Journal News) Trump’s claimed value would slash the 471,000 in taxes he owes to the town, village county and its school district to 47,000. Residents are outraged. “What he’s claiming is way off,” said Briarcliff Manor homeowner Steve Cohen. “I see people playing there. The club looks fabulous. It certainly isn’t falling into disrepair.” The Trump team’s lowball valuation follows a pattern similar to other assessment battles. His camp’s estimate appears to be a mere opening bid in a negotiation. Trump’s attorney, Jeff Rodner, acknowledges that he is sure the property is worth more than the 1.4 million. “Maybe it’s worth 12 million, maybe 13 million,” Rodner told The Journal News. “Now, my value is my opinion until it’s proven otherwise.” The Briarcliff property is among 20 developments on Trump’s financial disclosure report that he values at “more than 50 million” — accounting for 1 billion of his net worth that Trump claims totals 10 billion.

During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic..., can you guess it ?

The sentence \\"Однако такой синхронизации добиться будет непросто\\" translates to \\"However, achieving such synchronization will not be easy\\" in English. Russian is an East Slavic language, which is the official language of Russia and is also spoken in several other countries, such as Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine as a minority language. With over 258 million speakers, Russian is the largest native language in Europe and the eighth most spoken language in the world. The Russian language uses the Cyrillic alphabet, which consists of 33 letters. It was created during the 9th century, based on the script used for Old Church Slavonic, which was the liturgical language of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Cyrillic script has since been adapted for various other languages, including Bulgarian, Serbian, and Mongolian. Russian grammar is quite complex, with a high degree of inflection in both nouns and verbs. This means that the endings of words change in different contexts to indicate their grammatical function, such as case, mood, tense, and aspect. Russian has six cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, and prepositional) that show the relationship between words in a sentence. The Russian language has a rich literary heritage, with notable authors such as Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Anton Chekhov, and Alexander Pushkin, who have made significant contributions to world literature. In addition to its literary significance, Russian is also an important language in science, technology, and international diplomacy. Learning Russian can be quite challenging for English speakers, largely due to its complex grammar, the Cyrillic alphabet, and the differences in vocabulary. However, learning Russian can be rewarding because it provides access to a rich cultural and historical heritage, as well as increased understanding of the politics, society, and culture of Russia and other Eastern European countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - vase - shelf - park - garden - windowsill Explain why a human would choose \\"vase\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would likely choose \\"vase\\" as the best option to display a flower on a table because of various practical, aesthetic, and functional reasons that make a vase an ideal choice for showcasing flowers. First and foremost, a vase is specifically designed to hold and display flowers. It's a container that typically has a narrowed neck, which allows the flowers to be displayed in an appealing manner, with their stems supported and blooms fanned out. The narrow design also enables efficient water usage, ensuring the flowers stay fresh for a more extended period. Furthermore, the variety of shapes, sizes, and styles available for vases means that there is a suitable option for different types of flowers, bouquets, and table settings. In comparison to the other options provided, a vase is the most fitting choice to display a flower on a table. A shelf is also a viable option but typically isn't situated on a table, and its primary function is to hold objects rather than showcasing them. Therefore, placing flowers on a shelf might go unnoticed and not receive the same attention as a vase placed on a table. Parks and gardens are outdoor settings, making them unsuitable options for displaying a single flower on a table. While they may provide a beautiful, natural environment for flowers to grow and be appreciated, they do not cater explicitly to placing a flower on a table. Lastly, a windowsill is also not an ideal choice to display a flower on a table, as windowsills are usually narrow ledges on the edges of windows. Although some people may choose to put a vase with flowers on a windowsill to enjoy natural light and enhance the aesthetics of their living space, it still doesn't directly address the question of displaying a flower on a table. In conclusion, a vase is the best option for displaying a flower on a table due to its purposeful design to hold and showcase flowers while providing support and prolonging their freshness. The other choices - shelf, park, garden, and windowsill – do not offer the same level of practicality and functionality as a vase specifically tailored for table flower display."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A huge spillage of mash potato brought a major road to a standstill as emergency services desperately tried to clear up the unusual incident. Motorists were urged to avoid the A64 near Malton, North Yorkshire, after it was left covered in food when a lorry accidentally shed its load. The lorry dropped just over a quarter of its contents on the carriageway at about 3.30pm yesterday, which resulted in thousands of drivers being stuck in huge traffic jams. Police were forced to close the road after the lorry shed its load of instant mash potato on the A64 in North Yorkshire. Officers said the lorry shed about a quarter of its load in the incident which caused huge tailbacks. The lorry was travelling westbound towards York, before the road becomes a duel carriageway, when the incident happened. One witness, who wished not to be named, said: ‘It was like a sea of white. ‘I was about a mile away from where it happened but I could still see it. ‘At first I just didn't know what it was. I heard it was mash potato, but I am not sure whether it was mashed before or after the spillage. ‘It was a big disturbance for the area, and I think the only diversion for drivers would be down country lanes. ‘The road was closed for hours and hours.’ Motorists were urged to avoid the A64 near Malton, North Yorkshire following the incident (stock image) North Yorkshire Police said the road was closed after the incident created unsafe driving conditions. A spokesman said: ‘Instant mash is covering the road and cars have skidded as a result of the mash swelling up.’ Highways Agency crews and firefighters also attended the scene and the road was closed in both directions for several hours while the carriageway was cleared. Nobody was injured in the incident and the road was later re-opened on Saturday evening. It is the second time this month that a lorryload of mashed potato has led to traffic chaos. Twenty firefighters along with police and an ambulance were called to Henley Bridge in Henley-on-Thames following a report that a lorry had crashed and spilled its load. Initially, it was feared there had been a toxic chemical spill, but it later turned out to be mashed potato that was due to be used in animal feed.

A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

The customer directly mentions that the scan tool they purchased would not communicate with their 1989 turbocharged and intercooled Chrysler LeBaron. This indicates that the primary function they expected from this product was not met due to the lack of compatibility with their vehicle. 3. Furthermore, the review elaborates on the extent of this compatibility issue by saying, \\"Chrysler sold quite a few cars with this engine and it was completely left out of the programming.\\" This statement emphasizes the customer's perception that the product is inadequately equipped to cater to a significant market segment, further contributing to their dissatisfaction with the product. 4. Finally, the review concludes with the customer stating, \\"I won't buy another Actron product.\\" This is a strong indication that the customer's experience with the product has left them unwilling to continue purchasing products from the same brand in the future, exemplifying their overall dissatisfaction with the product in question. Based on the points mentioned above, it is evident that the customer who left this review was indeed dissatisfied with the product they purchased. Their negative experience primarily stems from the scan tool's inability to communicate with their specific vehicle, as well as the perceived oversight in the product's programming to accommodate a significant number of Chrysler vehicles. This, in turn, has resulted in the customer being uninterested in purchasing any more Actron products, further illustrating their dissatisfied state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"The original city plan was designed to allow for easy travel and to keep residences separated by open space that would help prevent the spread of fire.\\" a good answer to the question \\"How many public parks did Penn plan?\\"","completion":"No, the answer you provided does not directly answer the question about the number of public parks planned by Penn. The statement you provided gives a general idea about the intentions behind the city planning, such as easy travel and prevention of the spread of fire, but it doesn't mention the number of public parks. To answer the question \\"How many public parks did Penn plan?\\", we need to provide information about William Penn's plan for the city of Philadelphia, which was established in 1682. Penn's plan was unique and innovative, as it aimed to create a well-ordered and spacious city. His design, known as the \\"Greene Countrie Towne\\" plan, incorporated five public squares, or parks, strategically placed throughout the city to provide its inhabitants with access to open green spaces. These five public squares were Center Square (now the site of Philadelphia City Hall), Northeast Square (renamed Franklin Square), Northwest Square (renamed Logan Square), Southeast Square (renamed Washington Square), and Southwest Square (renamed Rittenhouse Square). Each square covered an area of approximately eight acres and served as recreational and gathering spaces for the surrounding neighborhoods. Penn's vision was to ensure that the urban environment included natural elements, promoting physical and mental well-being among its residents. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question, \\"How many public parks did Penn plan?\\" is five public squares. Penn's city plan incorporated these squares into Philadelphia's layout to facilitate easy travel, provide open green spaces for its residents, and support a more pleasant, healthier living environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A. stay here B. present C. being here D. come back E. come here The best answer is","completion":"The best answer is D. come back. The sentence refers to the act of someone throwing a stick away and, because of the dog, the stick would always come back. This indicates that the dog is engaged in a game of fetch, where it retrieves the thrown stick and brings it back. Fetch is a common game played between dogs and their owners, which often helps strengthen their bond and allows dogs to exercise and hone their retrieval instincts. A. stay here - This choice is incorrect because the stick wouldn't stay as it is mentioned that the dog is responsible for it, which implies movement or action on the dog's part. B. present - This term does not convey the intended meaning of the stick being retrieved by the dog, as it suggests the stick is simply \\"there\\" rather than brought back by the dog. C. being here - Similar to option A, \\"being here\\" implies static presence, not the dynamic act of coming back after being thrown away. E. come here - While this answer is close to the correct one, \\"come here\\" implies the stick moves on its own or that the subject is being directed to \\"come here\\" rather than being retrieved by the dog. \\"Come back\\" better reflects the back-and-forth nature of a game of fetch between the dog and the person throwing the stick."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The question: Rosemary asks BBC Radio 4's PM programme \\"Would the UK have its fishing waters returned to the pre-EU status if we vote to leave?\\" Reality Check verdict: It depends on what kind of agreements the UK makes with the EU and whether it would allow foreign vessels to access its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Common Fisheries Policy also aims to ensure that fishing and aquaculture across the EU are \\"environmentally, economically and socially sustainable\\". A 2016 House of Commons Library paper suggests that were the UK to leave the EU, the resulting status of its fishing waters would depend on whether the UK would allow access by foreign vessels to its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Outside the EU, an EEZ extends 200 nautical miles (370km) off a country's coastline, giving the state the authority to exploit and control the fish resources within this zone. The House of Commons Library notes that if the UK allowed access to foreign vessels as part of the exit negotiations, it would have to \\"maintain a very close working relationship with the EU to enable the monitoring of landings and to co-ordinate on wider regulation in the sector\\". \\"It would also have to agree some kind of mechanism for agreeing catch limits,\\" it adds. When Greenland voted to leave the then European Economic Community in 1982, much of the negotiations focused on fisheries agreements. In the end, Greenland was given tariff-free access to the EEC market for fisheries products. In return, it allowed continued European access to its waters. On the other hand, the UK could decide to exclude foreign vessels and assume full responsibility for fisheries in its EEZ. In that case, the House of Commons Library says, \\"there would be a number of implications for the UK and the management of fisheries in the area\\".

A 2016 House of Commons Library paper suggests that the resulting status of the UK's fishing waters after leaving the EU would be contingent on whether the UK allows foreign vessels into its EEZ. The EEZ functions outside the EU, extending 200 nautical miles (370 km) off a country's coastline, giving the state the authority to exploit and control fish resources within that zone. If the UK were to allow foreign vessels access during the exit negotiations, it would need to maintain a close working relationship with the EU to monitor landings and coordinate sector-wide regulations. Moreover, a mechanism for agreeing catch limits would have to be established. The situation in Greenland could provide a possible parallel as, after voting to leave the European Economic Community in 1982, much of the negotiated focus was on fisheries agreements. Eventually, Greenland was granted tariff-free access to the EEC market for fisheries products, but it continued to allow European access to its waters. Alternatively, the UK could decide to exclude foreign vessels and assume full responsibility for fisheries in its EEZ.

Zell Bryan Miller (February 24, 1932 - March 23, 2018) was an American author and politician from the U.S. state of Georgia. A Democrat, Miller served as lieutenant governor from 1975 to 1991, 79th Governor of Georgia from 1991 to 1999, and as U.S. Senator from 2000 to 2005. Miller was a conservative Democrat. In 2004, he supported Republican President George W. Bush against the Democratic nominee John Kerry in the presidential election. Miller was elected governor of Georgia in 1990, defeating Republican Johnny Isakson (who later became his successor as U.S. Senator) after defeating Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and future Governor Roy Barnes in the primary. Miller campaigned on the concept of term limits and pledged to seek only a single term as governor. He later ran for and won re-election in 1994. James Carville was Miller's campaign manager. In 1991, Miller endorsed Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas for President of the United States. Miller gave the keynote speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City. In two oft-recalled lines, Miller said that President George H. W. Bush \\"just doesn't get it,\\" and he remarked of a statement by Vice President Dan Quayle: As governor, Miller was a staunch promoter of public education. He helped found the HOPE Scholarship, which paid for the college tuition of Georgia students who both established a GPA of 3.0 in high school and maintained the same while in college, and who were from families earning less than 66,000 per year.

Write a summary based on this article: Robert and his brother Michael Meeropol, children of accused spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, are asking President Obama to pardon their mother. EASTHAMPTON – The decades-long saga of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, executed in 1953 on charges of being Soviet spies, is taking a new turn, with their sons asking President Obama to formally exonerate their mother, citing recently disclosed proof she was framed. Brothers Michael and Robert Meeropol plan to submit their request to Obama after the election, detailing how the prosecution faked evidence that sent her to the electric chair. It is their hope that Obama will act on the case, one of the numerous requests for pardons and clemency on his desk before he leaves office. Advertisement The effort is part of the brothers’ four-decade quest to uncover the truth about their parents’ sensational case that occurred at the height of the Cold War, anti-Communist hysteria. “It is an object lesson in government misconduct. It is a perversion of the judicial process for political purposes and that’s incompatible with a functioning democracy,” Robert Meeropol said in an interview Tuesday in the Easthampton offices of the family’s Rosenberg Fund for Children.

Sign up for more newsletters here The brothers’ efforts received a large audience Sunday with a “60 Minutes” story that resulted from a exhaustive review of historical documents that all but prove Ethel Rosenberg was not a spy. The family aims to capitalize on publicity generated by the two-part television segment to mobilize supporters. So far, 13,000 people have signed a petition calling for the exoneration of Ethel Rosenberg, and the hope is to have 50,000 signatures before submitting it to the White House, according to Robert’s daughter Jennifer Meeropol, executive director of the Rosenberg Fund, which provides grants for education, counseling, and other services for children of activists. AP Ethel and Julius Rosenberg are shown during their 1951 trial for espionage in New York City. To that end, the Rosenberg Fund is hosting a conference call Thursday night for supporters who want to learn more about the case and find out how they can help. Advertisement Efforts to reach a White House spokesman for comment about the Rosenberg case were unsuccessful. Convicted of stealing atomic secrets to give to the Soviet Union, the Rosenbergs were put to death three years after police arrested Julius Rosenberg in the family’s Knickerbocker Village apartment, on Manhattan’s lower East Side, while their 3- and 7-year-old sons looked on. The boys, later adopted by the Meeropol family, lived in relative anonymity until they took up their parents’ cause. In 1975, they filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act. That suit and the actions that followed it, Robert Meeropol said, were always “a quest for the truth, and we’ll let the chips fall where they may.” In 2008, those chips led the brothers to stop believing their father was entirely innocent of spying, although they steadfastly maintain he did not give any nuclear secrets to the Soviets, as the government contended, and therefore was unjustly executed. Their mother was a different story. Her brother, David Greenglass, whose trial testimony helped convict her, admitted in a 2001 televised interview that he lied on the witness stand to protect his wife, Ruth Greenglass. He said he was coached to lie by prosecutor Roy Cohn, best known for his association with Senator Joseph McCarthy and his unbridled hunt for Communist sympathizers. Then last year, grand jury testimony unsealed after Greenglass’ death corroborated the claim because his grand jury statement did not match his trial testimony. In their quest to prove their mother was not a spy, the brothers point to the fact that she did not have a KGB code name, while Ruth Greenglass did, and a communication from the KGB to someone in the United States stating Ethel Rosenberg “does not work,” a phrase signifying she was not a spy. “The government knew that at the time of the trial,” said Michael Meeropol, referring to the fact that his mother was not actually a spy. Rather, her prosecution was a “lever against her husband” to get him to confess to spying, according to government documents. “We’re talking about a deliberate plot to execute somebody who didn’t do the things they were executing her for,” said Robert Meeropol, 69, an Easthampton resident. Michael Meeropol, a retired professor from Western New England University, said they specifically are not seeking a presidential pardon. “A pardon is weird because it implies guilt,” he said. Rather, the brothers want a proclamation similar to one issued in 1977 by then Governor Michael Dukakis in the notorious Sacco and Vanzetti case. Dukakis declared the pair had been unjustly executed in 1927 for murders they did not commit, proclaiming “any stigma and disgrace should be forever removed” from their names and those of their descendants. “A presidential proclamation is a perfect way to reaffirm the belief and rule of law and also to right a wrong,” said Michael Meeropol, who now lives in Cold Spring, New York. “It would be a way of reminding people that every once in a while, our system of justice goes awry, especially in politically charged times.” Craig F. Walker/Globe Staff Robert Meeropol and his daughter Jennifer Meeropol posed for a portrait at the Rosenberg Fund For Children in Easthampton. Georgetown University law professor David Vladeck, who handled litigation on behalf of Rosenberg historians that resulted in the unsealing of the grand jury documents, says there is no evidence that Ethel Rosenberg was a spy, even though she may have known that her husband was. And he does not think people should be as concerned about whether she’s innocent as they should about whether she was unjustly convicted. “The question is was she wrongfully convicted based on information that prosecutors had reason to believe was false, and the answer is I don’t think there is evidence to convict her of the crime she was convicted of,” he said. “I think the Meeropol boys have a strong claim that their mother was railroaded.” The Meeropol family sees what happened to their parents and grandparents as a cautionary tale, and their campaign to correct the injustice not merely personal. “My brother and I are doing this not just for our family, but for our country,” Michael said. ||||| Ethel Rosenberg sat in a car as she started her trip to Sing Sing prison, April 11, 1951. US Deputy Marshal Sarah Goldstein was with her. Ethel Rosenberg died June 19, 1953, executed by her government for a crime she did not commit. In what became the most notorious spy case of the Cold War, Rosenberg and her husband Julius were tried, convicted, and sentenced to death in 1951 for conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union. The Supreme Court voted against a stay of execution. Crowds gathered outside New York’s Sing Sing prison to celebrate their deaths. President Dwight Eisenhower issued a statement that said the Rosenberg executions were “a grave matter. But even graver is the thought of the millions of dead whose deaths may be directly attributable to what these spies have done.” Ethel Rosenberg was not a spy. Advertisement She was the mother of two young sons, Michael and Robert, a devoted wife, a native New Yorker who once aspired to be an opera singer. She was also a Communist who believed, as many postwar American leftists did, that socialism could better address society’s ills. Rosenberg was likely aware of her husband’s illicit activities, but there has never been definitive evidence that she collaborated with or aided the Soviet Union in its pursuit of atomic secrets. She was a victim of false testimony, prosecutorial misconduct, and a government too eager to cement its unyielding stance on Communism.

Sign up for more newsletters here It is time for Ethel Rosenberg to receive a presidential pardon. In 1995, declassified files bolstered the long-held belief that Ethel Rosenberg should not have been arrested, let alone put to death. The Venona transcripts, decades-old Soviet documents collected and deciphered by the National Security Agency, provided irrefutable proof that Julius was a spy for the Soviet Union, revealing his code names and the depth of his involvement. Yet Ethel is mentioned only once, as being politically active and knowing about her husband’s activities. Then, in 2008, Morton Sobell, the Rosenbergs’ codefendant, who served 18 years for espionage, admitted he had been a Soviet spy. He also implicated Julius Rosenberg, but made clear that Ethel was not a participant. Sobell told The New York Times, “She knew what he was doing, but what was she guilty of? Of being Julius’s wife.” In the “better dead than Red” fervor of 1950s America, that was close enough. With the nation hell-bent on purging Communists and their sympathizers, careers were ruined, lives were shattered, and families were torn apart. Thousands filled arenas for raucous anti-Communist rallies. The US military produced propaganda films like “How To Spot a Communist.” Midcentury America collapsed into its own hysterical version of the 17th century Salem witch trials Advertisement One month after FBI agents swarmed the Rosenbergs’ small New York apartment to arrest Julius, Ethel Rosenberg was taken into custody. The Rosenbergs’ older son, Michael Meeropol, who was 7 at the time, believes authorities used his mother in an effort to force his father to name names. During a recent “60 Minutes” interview, Meeropol called his mother “collateral damage,” and said what the government did was akin to “putting a gun to her head and saying to [Julius] ‘Talk or we’ll kill her.’ ” In essence, Ethel Rosenberg was used as a hostage. When her husband did not deliver what the government wanted, she was executed. Two men were mostly responsible for Ethel’s death. Her brother, David Greenglass, an Army sergeant who stole intelligence secrets from the Los Alamos, N.M., laboratory, cut a deal with the government for a reduced sentence. To save his wife, Ruth, who was a recruitment intermediary, he gave false testimony that implicated his sister. Greenglass, who died in 2014, expressed no regrets over the decision that sealed his sister’s fate. Then there was the federal prosecutor who, Greenglass claimed, pressured and encouraged him to commit perjury — Roy Cohn. After making his name as the fierce anti-Communist acolyte who helped condemn the Rosenbergs, Cohn became chief counsel to demagogue Senator Joseph McCarthy. Years later, Cohn was the mentor and ruthless protector of a young man from Queens already riding his real estate magnate father’s coattails and money, but eager to establish himself as a power broker in Manhattan and beyond. That man is now President-elect Donald Trump. It is inconceivable that Trump would ever betray Cohn’s memory and pardon the woman his mentor fought so hard to put in the electric chair. Advertisement On the day of Rosenbergs’ executions, Rabbi Irving Koslowe, Sing Sing prison’s Jewish chaplain, asked Julius if he would reveal any of his coconspirators. He refused, and was executed. Then, as Koslowe recalled decades later in a CNN interview, he posed the same question to Ethel, reminding her that her death would render her sons as orphans. “I came back and told her her husband was dead. Did she have anything to say to me, a name, to stay the execution?” Koslowe said. “She said, ‘No, I have no names to give, I’m innocent,’ and she was far more stolid than he.” The first jolt of electricity did not kill her. Bob Considine, an International News Service reporter who witnessed the executions, said, “She died a lot harder. Believing she was dead, the attendants had taken off the ghastly strappings, electrodes, black belts and so forth. These had to be readjusted again, and she was given more electricity, which started again kind of a ghastly plume of smoke that rose from her head and went up against the skylight overhead.” Nearly five minutes after she was first placed in the electric chair, Ethel Rosenberg was pronounced dead. In a final letter to her sons, she wrote, “Always remember that we were innocent and could not wrong our conscience.” Michael Meeropol, now 73 and retired, was an economics professor at Western New England University in Springfield. Robert Meeropol, 69, founded the Rosenberg Fund for Children, based in Easthampton, Mass., where he lives. President Obama has issued the fewest pardons — 70, so far — of any two-term president since George Washington. During an August press conference, Obama said that by the end of his presidency, his number of pardons would be “roughly in line with what other presidents have done.” His predecessor, George W. Bush, granted 189 pardons. Obama has been far more generous with commutations. As of Nov. 4. Obama has issued more than 1,000 commutations, including 324 life sentences, many for minor drug offenders who got scooped up by draconian sentencing laws. As the Obama administration winds down, there are still more than 13,000 petitions for presidential pardons and commutations. To be “roughly in line” with Bush, Obama would need to issue more than 100 pardons in less than two months which, given how deliberative he’s been, seems unlikely. Ethel Rosenberg’s sons have campaigned and launched a petition through the Rosenberg Fund for Children for their mother’s exoneration. This may be her last, best chance to be pardoned. Recent Republican evocations of Japanese-American internment camps and talk of reviving the House Un-American Activities Committee to fight terrorism are worrisome reminders that this nation may again turn darkly toward a series of injustices in the name of justice. More than ever, what happened to Ethel Rosenberg, wrongly branded as a traitor and sent to her death because of her political beliefs, should haunt America. Throughout his tenure, Obama has shown extraordinary compassion to hundreds of men and women by commuting their harsh sentences; it is time for him to bestow on Ethel Rosenberg a similar act of presidential mercy and historical reparation. ||||| Two men orphaned in a high-profile Cold War espionage case will appear outside the White House on Thursday to deliver a letter and packet of documents to President Barack Obama. Robert and Michael Meeropol seek an exoneration for their mother, Ethel Rosenberg, and have urged Obama to act before he leaves office. Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, husband and wife, were electrocuted at Sing Sing prison in Ossining, New York, in 1953 after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage. The two were accused of passing secrets about the atomic bomb to the Russians in what was known as \\"the trial of the century.\\" \\"The fear of the McCarthy era led to Ethel Rosenberg's unjust conviction and execution,\\" Robert Meeropol told The Republican. \\"We're not asking for a pardon, because she was not guilty. We're asking for a proclamation that she was wrongly convicted, and wrongly executed.\\" Grand jury testimony, KGB files, witness statements and court documents made public in recent years show that a key witness lied on the stand, that credible evidence against their mother did not exist and that prosecutors charged Ethel, an activist and housewife, as a lever to convict her husband, her supporters say. The brothers for decades waged a legal battle to release all government records in the case. \\"Ethel's conviction for conspiracy to commit espionage was built on false evidence created by government prosecutors -- including the now-infamous lawyer to Joseph McCarthy and Donald Trump, Roy Cohn,\\" the two said in a recent statement. Robert and Michael were respectively 6 and 10 years of age when their parents were executed. The brothers took the surname of their adoptive parents. The Meeropols have gained broad support for their effort. More than 40,000 people, including well-known figures such as Michael Moore, Angela Davis and Noam Chomsky, signed an online petition in support of exoneration. The Boston Globe recently asked Obama to take action. \\"Ethel Rosenberg died June 19, 1953, executed by her government for a crime she did not commit,\\" a Nov. 24 editorial reads. The Springfield Republican has also supported the exoneration effort in its editorial pages. Robert and Michael Meeropol, now 69 and 73, recently made their case on \\"60 Minutes\\" in an interview with Anderson Cooper. The Meeropols in 2008 were forced to conclude that their father was a spy. However, they maintain that he never passed atomic secrets. They say Ethel Rosenberg was not a spy, and was sent to her death after she refused to talk. As for Julius Rosenberg, they say justice was unequally served, that Soviet spies who did pass information about the bomb received modest jail sentences after talking to prosecutors and naming names. \\"If we believe in justice, we must show the world that when our government fakes evidence and kills people, it will eventually be held accountable,\\" said Robert Meeropol. Sixty-three years ago, the young brothers from the Lower East Side approached the White House and tried to deliver a letter to President Eisenhower, asking him to stop the execution. Days later, their parents were killed. On Thursday, they plan to try again, but with a different mission. \\"There is no more fitting time than the present for President Obama to set the record straight and make this statement about the dangerous effects of government overreach and mass hysteria,\\" said Michael Meeropol. The brothers on Thursday will bear a letter of support from U.S. Rep. James McGovern, D-Worcester, who represents the state's 2nd Congressional District. Robert Meeropol, who founded the non-profit Rosenberg Fund for Children, lives in Easthampton. Michael Meeropol, a former faculty member at Western New England University, lived in Wilbraham and moved from the Pioneer Valley upon his retirement. ||||| Robert and Michael Meeropol – who took the name of their adoptive parents following the execution – believe it is their last chance to clear their mother’s name. They fear Mr Trump will have little sympathy for their case, given his personal links to the late Roy Cohn, who was a junior prosecutor in the Rosenberg case. Should Mr Obama accede to their request, it would be the first time that the United States has admitted that the federal government has wrongly executed one of its citizens. The Rosenberg case came in 1953 at the height of the McCarthy era when the loyalty of thousands of Americans was called into question. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The children of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, who were executed in 1953 on charges of being Soviet spies, are requesting that President Obama pardon their mother.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Problem Solver: Conflicting PepsiCo letters cause confusion over life insurance benefit May 16, 2013|Jon Yates' \\"What's Your Problem?\\" Patricia Schaefer, daughter-in-law of Jean Nieth, sought the help of What's Your Problem to resolve the question over the life insurance benefit. (Taylor Glascock, For the Chicago Tribune) Jean Nieth worked 32 years at Wilson Sporting Goods, much of that time making golf clubs at the company's River Grove plant. When she retired in 1973 at age 59, she was given a pension and health insurance benefits. It wasn't until more than three decades later that she was told she also had a company-paid life insurance policy. By then, Wilson had been bought and later resold by PepsiCo. In 2004, PepsiCo sent Nieth a letter saying it administered her \\"Retiree Basic Life Insurance\\" benefit, which entitled her loved ones to 5,000 when she died. Nieth's daughter-in-law, Patricia Schaefer, said she called PepsiCo the following year and a company representative confirmed the life insurance benefit. But in January 2007, PepsiCo sent Nieth another letter saying the first letter was incorrect — she was not eligible for the policy. Last year, Nieth died at age 97. Confused about whether the family was entitled to the 5,000 insurance payment, Schaefer began calling Wilson and PepsiCo. No one, she said, could tell her if the life insurance policy was valid. After trying to get clarification for almost a year, Schaefer finally received a letter from PepsiCo in April, which was simply a copy of the letter from 2007 saying Nieth was ineligible for the benefit. Worried she was getting the runaround, Schaefer wrote to What's Your Problem? this month. \\"If the insurance never existed, why did they ask her to update the beneficiary in 2004 and confirm it to me in 2005 over the telephone?\\" the Prospect Heights resident asked. \\"Something just doesn't seem right.\\" The Problem Solver called Molly Wallace, a spokeswoman for Wilson, who said her company did not provide a death benefit like the one PepsiCo wrote about in the 2004 letter to Nieth. \\"It was their benefits communication and their mistake,\\" Wallace said in an email. \\"Her issue has to be with PepsiCo.\\" The Problem Solver also called Aurora Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for PepsiCo. After some research, Gonzalez said Nieth was not eligible for the life insurance benefit. \\"First, apologies to the Nieth family for the challenges in getting their benefits question answered,\\" Gonzalez said in an email. \\"Based on our review, Jean Nieth was not eligible for life insurance benefits under PepsiCo's plans because she retired at age 59. Hourly employees from the Wilson division were only eligible for life insurance if they retired at age 65 or later.\\" Gonzalez said the 2004 letter was sent in error, and the follow-up letter that was sent in 2007 was correct. \\"We are sorry for the confusion but hope this answers the Nieth family's question,\\" Gonzalez wrote. Schaefer said she really can't argue with PepsiCo if it says her mother-in-law was ineligible. \\"If that's the case, though, why didn't they tell me this right up front when I called?\\" she said. \\"They could have sent me (that explanation) back in May (2012), and I would have stopped calling.\\" Schaefer said she believes her mother-in-law earned the 5,000 benefit. \\"It was hard work, I'll tell you,\\" she said. \\"Thirty-two years of service, but it wasn't enough. It doesn't seem fair, but if that's the rule, that's the rule.\\"","completion":"Jean Nieth, who worked at Wilson Sporting Goods for 32 years, was informed by PepsiCo in 2004 that she was entitled to a company-paid life insurance policy worth 5,000 upon her death.

When Nieth passed away at age 97, her daughter-in-law Patricia Schaefer sought clarification from PepsiCo regarding the life insurance policy.

Fact 2: Foods contain nutrients that provide people with necessary energy and essential nutrients. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What does an animal require to grow and heal?\\" with the following options: - pH - food - fats - bamboo - death - sodium - lies - jealousy The answer is:","completion":"Food. To provide a thorough explanation, let's break down the given facts and the possible answer options provided. Fact 1 states that an animal requires nutrients to grow and heal. This means that whatever the animal consumes must contain substances that can help in their growth, repair, and overall well-being. Fact 2 explains that foods contain nutrients, providing people with necessary energy and essential nutrients. This fact emphasises the importance of consuming the right foods to obtain the required nutrients and energy. Now, let's evaluate the answer options based on the given facts: - pH: pH refers to the acidity or alkalinity of a substance. While pH might affect the availability of certain nutrients in the environment or food, it is not a requirement in itself for animals to grow and heal. - Food: As mentioned in Fact 2, food contains nutrients necessary for growth, repair, and overall well-being. This option aligns with both fact statements and therefore, is the correct answer. - Fats: Fats are a type of nutrient found in some foods, providing energy and other functions for the body. While fats are essential for certain life processes, it is just one component of a nutrient-rich diet that an animal requires to grow and heal. - Bamboo: Bamboo is a specific food source for certain animals, such as pandas. However, it does not encompass the variety of nutrients that all animals require for growth and healing. - Death: Death is not related to an animal's growth and healing process. It does not meet the criteria set by the facts provided. - Sodium: Sodium is a mineral that animals need for various functions, but again, it is only one component of the necessary nutrients for overall animal growth and repair. - Lies: Lies have no biological relevance to the growth and healing process for animals, making this an unrelated choice. - Jealousy: Jealousy is an emotional response and does not pertain to the physical nourishment that animals need for growth and healing. Based on the given facts, the correct answer is food. Animals require food to grow and heal, as it provides them with the necessary nutrients and energy for their overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:I read this background article the other day: The classical explanation of gravity is that a force of attraction acts at a distance between two objects and the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. The objects move toward each other due to this force of attraction. Einstein’s new concept of gravity states that matter (mass) causes the space around the matter to curve and also distorts time. A straight line through this curved space would also be curved in order to be a straight line. I am facing a new situation today: Rob is an amateur astronomer. Recently, he detected four asteroids, asteroid A, asteroid B, asteroid C, and asteroid D. Asteroid A and asteroid B are of the same mass, but asteroid A is farther from the earth than asteroid B. Asteroid C and asteroid D are at the same distance form the earth, but asteroid C has more mass than asteroid D. He also figured out that all of these asteroids have less mass than earth. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In clssical theory, if Rob needs to find out the object with stronger gravitational pull, which one would he choose, earth or asteroid A? A:","completion":"In the classical theory of gravity, as described by Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, the force of attraction (gravitational force) between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, the gravitational force (F) can be represented as follows: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 where: - F is the gravitational force - G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2) - m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects - r is the distance between the centers of the two objects Now, let's analyze the situation presented in the question. We have Earth, asteroid A, and asteroid B. We are given the following information: - Asteroid A and asteroid B have the same mass - Asteroid A is farther from the Earth than asteroid B - All the asteroids have less mass than Earth To find out which object has a stronger gravitational pull, let's compare the gravitational force between Earth and asteroid A, and Earth and asteroid B. Let mE be the mass of Earth, mA be the mass of asteroid A (and asteroid B, since they have the same mass), rA be the distance between Earth and asteroid A, and rB be the distance between Earth and asteroid B. The gravitational force between Earth and asteroid A (FA) is: FA = G * (mE * mA) / rA^2 And the gravitational force between Earth and asteroid B (FB) is: FB = G * (mE * mA) / rB^2 Since the masses of both asteroids and Earth are the same, we can focus on the distance factor (which is inversely proportional to the gravitational force) to make a comparison. We are given that rA > rB (i.e., asteroid A is farther from Earth than asteroid B). Therefore, the gravitational force between Earth and asteroid A is weaker compared to the gravitational force between Earth and asteroid B. In other words, FB > FA. To answer the original question regarding which object has a stronger gravitational pull according to the classical theory, Rob would choose Earth as the object with stronger gravitational pull rather than asteroid A. This is because asteroid A has less mass than Earth and is farther from Earth than asteroid B, which implies that the gravitational force between Earth and asteroid A is indeed weaker than that between Earth and asteroid B."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

South Koreans... (Associated Press) After liberal candidate Moon Jae-in (Moon Jay-in) conceded victory in a close race, Park said she will become \\"a president of promise.\\" Huge crowds lined up throughout the day, braving frigid weather to choose between Park and Moon, the son of North Korean refugees. Both candidates steered away from outgoing President Lee Myung-bak's (lee myuhng bahk) policies, including, most strikingly, his hard-line stance on North Korea. Turnout was the highest in 15 years, and some analysts thought that might lift Moon, who is more popular with younger voters. Despite moving to the center, however, Park was carried by her conservative base of mainly older voters who remember with fondness what they see as the firm economic and security guidance of her dictator father, the late President Park Chung-hee. Park will become the first woman to lead a country that still struggles with widespread sexism, and analysts said her victory would partly erase the bias that women can't thrive in South Korea's tough political world. Park says she is open to dialogue with North Korea but calls on Pyongyang to show progress in nuclear dismantlement for better relations with Seoul. Ties between the Koreas plummeted during Lee's term. Many voters blame the tension over the last five years for encouraging North Korea to conduct nuclear and missile tests _ including a rocket launch by Pyongyang that outsiders call a cover for a banned long-range missile test. Some also say ragged North-South relations led to two attacks blamed on Pyongyang that killed 50 South Koreans in 2010. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Lucy Williamson: \\"She's going to have to try and bring the country together\\" South Korea's President-elect, Park Geun-hye, has said her victory will help the country's economy recover. Ms Park, the daughter of former dictator Park Chung-hee, defeated her liberal rival Moon Jae-in. She will be South Korea's first female leader. Votes are still being counted, but Mr Moon has admitted defeat. Turnout was high in a poll dominated by economic and social welfare issues. Ms Park, 60, will replace her party colleague Lee Myung-bak. He is stepping down as the law requires after his five-year term. Analysis Park Geun-hye's win means that South Korea now has its first female president. In a country where rapid modernisation exists alongside ancient Confucian values, many people are saying her election will prompt real social change. Ms Park has already served as South Korea's first lady, after her mother was killed in the 1970s. Now she's won a stint in her father's role, she'll face loud demands to reform the big family conglomerates he created, whilst protecting the country's modern economy from the effects of the global slowdown. Supporters of her liberal rival, Moon Jae-in, have accused Ms Park of belonging to the past, and of having little understanding of the rough and tumble of modern democratic government. Combined figures from the networks released after polls closed gave Ms Park 50.1% of the vote over Mr Moon's 48.9%. \\"This is a victory brought by the people's hope for overcoming crisis and economic recovery,\\" she told supporters in the capital Seoul. Economic growth has fallen to about 2% after several decades in which it averaged 5.5%. With the country having split almost equally along party lines, the BBC's Seoul correspondent Lucy Williamson says Ms Park will have to work hard to improve relations with her detractors. Father's legacy From the moment polls opened at 06:00 on Wednesday (21:00 GMT on Tuesday), millions of South Koreans queued to cast their ballots despite freezing temperatures. Ms Park's supporters, wearing red party scarves, cheered as poll figures emerged. Both bolstered and dogged by the legacy of her father, who built South Korea's economy while crushing dissent, she apologised in September for human rights abuses under his administration. Mr Moon of the Democratic United Party is a former human rights lawyer who served under former President Roh Moo-hyun. He was briefly jailed by Ms Park's father in the 1970s. Park Geun-hye Daughter of former President Park Chung-hee Served as South Korea's first lady after her mother was murdered by a North Korean gunman in 1974 First elected to the national assembly in 1998 First bid for the presidency in 2007 Unmarried Has promised to redistribute wealth, reform big conglomerates and seek greater engagement with North Korea Profile: President-elect Park Geun-hye Both candidates put forward broadly similar policies, promising to boost social welfare spending, close the gap between the rich and poor and rein in the family-run giant conglomerates known as chaebol. The issue of North Korea did not feature heavily in the campaign despite its recent rocket launch. Both candidates promised more engagement with Pyongyang - though in Ms Park's case, more cautiously than her rival. Ties between the two Koreas deteriorated during Mr Lee's term. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Park Geun-hye was elected as South Korea's first female president on December 19, 2012, representing the ruling-party candidate. Park's election marks a possible shift towards greater engagement with North Korea.

Article: (CNN) Iranian President Hassan Rouhani addressed the country Sunday night after several days of anti-government protests that have rocked the nation. Rouhani's remarks came after the state-run media outlet IRIB reported that Iranian officials had temporarily restricted access to social media apps Instagram and Telegram, which have been used by Iranians to share news about the protests. \\"We are a free nation,\\" Rouhani said in his prerecorded speech on state broadcaster IRINN. \\"And according to the constitution and citizen rights, the people are free to express their criticism and even their protests,\\" he said. \\"But,\\" Rouhani continued, \\"criticism should not be accompanied with violence or vandalizing public property.\\" Rouhani also acknowledged the economic and social hardships some Iranians face. The demonstrations, which have erupted against a backdrop of rising food and gasoline prices , began Thursday in the northeastern city of Mashhad before spreading to other cities. Those included Tehran, Kermanshah, Arak, Qazvin, Khorramabad, Karaj and Sabzevar, according to state-run media outlet IRNA, which cited First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri. Protests were ongoing Sunday, the fourth day of demonstrations, according to videos circulating on social media that originated in Tehran and other parts of the country. Earlier on Sunday, the Iranian Interior Minister Rahmani Fazli issued a stern warning that protesters who cause public disorder would \\"pay the price\\" after the demonstrations reportedly turned deadly. \\"The events and occurrences of the last few days have preoccupied, saddened and hurt our beloved people,\\" semi-official news agency ILNA quoted Fazli as saying, before adding \\"those who destroy public properties, create chaos, lawlessness and insecurity in our society, will be held legally responsible and must answer for their behaviors and pay the price for it.\\" Social media has been a tool for protesters Social media has been a vital resource for Iranians participating in the protests -- described as the largest public display of dissent in Iran since the 2009 Green Movement. While independent media coverage from inside the country has been limited, protesters have taken to apps like Telegram, which offers public channels for users in addition to encrypted messaging, to share information and videos of protests and clashes. Official media outlets have provided few details about the ongoing demonstrations. Earlier on Sunday, Interior Minister Fazli said the misuse of social networks by some individuals was \\"causing violence and fear,\\" and that \\"such behavior will be smashed,\\" according to IRNA. Telegram's CEO had previously tweeted that Iranian authorities had blocked access to Telegram for \\"the majority of Iranians\\" after the company refused to shut down peaceful protesting channels. Protests turn deadly Two people were killed Saturday during protests in Doroud city, in the Lorestan province of western Iran, according to semi-official news agency Mehr News. On Sunday, Mehr News quoted Habibollah Khojastehpour, the deputy governor of Lorestan, as confirming the deaths but denying security forces were to blame. Several videos circulated on social media showed various people apparently injured during protests in the city. The videos purportedly showed injured people lying on the ground and being carried away from the protest, as well as being treated in a local hospital. In some of the video, gunshots can be heard.

Protesters were fired upon and five people were shot, the source said. According to Mehr, Khojastehpour said fire was not directed toward or into the crowds by the military, security or police forces. \\"Clashes occurred with individuals who had taken to the streets, heeding calls by the enemies of the system,\\" Khojastehpour is quoted as saying. \\"The objective was to conclude this gathering peacefully but given the presence of the aforementioned individuals and groups, this tragedy unfortunately occurred that resulted in the killing of two individuals who were present at the clashes.\\" 'Death to the dictator' In a rare display of public dissent, some protesters directed their ire at Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to some videos on social media. CNN has not independently verified the authenticity of the footage. In another video also circulating on social media, Iranians can be overheard chanting \\"We don't want an Islamic Republic\\" and \\"Death to the dictator.\\" The video purports to show demonstrators in the western city of Khorramabad. In addition to these anti-government slogans, chants of \\"Death to the Revolutionary Guards\\" can also be heard in another video posted on social media. CNN is unable to independently verify the authenticity of those videos. One resident told CNN of witnessing a protester tearing down a poster of Khamenei near Tehran University on Saturday. In Tehran, protesters have been temporarily arrested for participating in \\"illegal demonstrations,\\" according to Mohsen Hamadani, Tehran deputy governor in charge of security affairs, as reported by semi-official ILNA. About 200 people were arrested between Revolution Square and Valiasr Square in Tehran on Saturday, ILNA reported, for \\"attempting to destroy public property and attack police,\\" according to Ali Azghar Nasserbakt, the deputy commander of Tehran Security. Some have been released, he said, though he didn't provide a specific number. On Saturday, 80 people were detained in the nearby city of Arak, according to a government official, as reported by Mehr News Agency. \\"A number of individuals intended to enter into and damage government locations,\\" the government official, who was not identified by Mehr, is quoted as saying. The official added that protesters were not able to enter the government buildings, \\"and the city is under control.\\" Mehr added that at least three people were lightly injured. US-Iran war of words President Donald Trump has voiced his support for anti-government protesters in several tweets throughout the weekend, sparking a war of words with the Iranian government. \\"Iran, the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis, has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate,\\" he wrote late Sunday. \\"Not good!\\" Iran, the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis, has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate.

Iranian officials have pointed to foreign intervention as being behind the protests. During Sunday's televised remarks, Rouhani accused Trump of creating problems for Iranians, saying he had \\"always been acting against the people from the first day he entered the White House.\\" \\"He has been constantly creating problems for us, nonstop and continuously for the Iranian nation,\\" he said. Relations between Washington and Tehran have long been tense, with the Trump administration critical of what it sees as Iran's growing regional influence and alleged involvement in conflicts including Yemen and Syria. ||||| In this photo taken by an individual not employed by the Associated Press and obtained by the AP outside Iran, anti-riot Iranian police prevent university students to join other protesters over Iran weak...

A wave of spontaneous protests over Iran's weak... (Associated Press) TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Two protesters taking part in demonstrations roiling Iran were killed at a rally overnight, a semi-official news agency reported Sunday, the first deaths attributed to the ongoing protests. The demonstrations, which began Thursday over the economic woes plaguing Iran, appear to be the largest to strike the Islamic Republic since the protests that followed the country's disputed 2009 presidential election. In Doroud, a city some 325 kilometers (200 miles) southwest of Tehran, in Iran's western Lorestan province, protesters gathered for an unauthorized rally that lasted into the night Saturday, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. Mehr quoted Habibollah Khojastepour, the security deputy of Lorestan's governor, as saying the illegal gathering ignited clashes. The two protesters were killed in the clashes, he said. \\"The gathering was to be ended peacefully, but due to the presence of the (agitators), unfortunately, this happened,\\" Khojastepour was quoted as saying. He did not offer a cause of death for the two protesters, but said \\"no bullets were shot from police and security forces at the people.\\" Videos circulating on social media late Saturday appeared to show fallen protesters in Doroud as gunshots sounded in the background. The Associated Press could not immediately verify the footage. Thousands have taken to the streets of cities across Iran, beginning on Thursday in Mashhad, the country's second-largest city and a holy site for Shiite pilgrims. The protests in the Iranian capital, as well as President Donald Trump tweeting about them, raised the stakes. It also apparently forced state television to break its silence on Saturday, acknowledging it hadn't reported on the protests on orders from security officials. At least 50 protesters have been arrested since Thursday, authorities said Saturday. State TV said some protesters chanted the name of the U.S.-backed shah, who fled into exile just before Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution and later died. On Sunday, the semi-official ILNA news agency reported that authorities have arrested some 80 protesters in the city of Arak, some 280 kilometers (173 miles) south of Tehran. Iran's economy has improved since its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which saw Iran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the end of some international sanctions. Tehran now sells its oil on the global market and has signed deals to purchase tens of billions of dollars' worth of Western aircraft. That improvement has not reached the average Iranian, however. Unemployment remains high, and official inflation has crept up to 10 percent again. A recent increase in egg and poultry prices by as much as 40 percent, which a government spokesman has blamed on a cull over avian flu fears, appears to have been the spark for the economic protests. While the protests have sparked clashes, Iran's hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and its affiliates have not intervened as they have in other unauthorized demonstrations since the 2009 election. Some analysts outside of Iran have suggested that may be because the economic protests initially just put pressure on the administration of President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate whose administration struck the nuclear deal. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has spoken out following a string of anti-government protests instigated by economic unrest.

The credit portion of the Financial crisis of 2007-2010 did not affect the Czech Republic much, mostly due to its stable banking sector which has learned its lessons during a smaller crisis in the late 1990s and became much more cautious. As a fraction of the GDP, the Czech public debt is among the smallest ones in Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, unlike many other post-communist countries, an overwhelming majority of the household debt - over 99% - is denominated in the local Czech currency. That's why the country wasn't affected by the shrunken money supply in the U.S. dollars. However, as a large exporter, the economy was sensitive to the decrease of the demand in Germany and other trading partners. In the middle of 2009, the annual drop of the GDP for 2009 was estimated around 3% or 4.3%, a relatively modest decrease. The impact of the economic crisis may have been limited by the existence of the national currency that temporarily weakened in H1 of 2009, simplifying the life of the exporters.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief.

Ireland began this campaign bidding for an unprecedented third consecutive Six Nations triumph but Saturday's defeat in France leaves them winless after two matches. Having seen their World Cup hopes comprehensively dashed at the quarter-final stages by Argentina it has been a tough few months for the men in green, so what is going wrong with Joe Schmidt's side? Media playback is not supported on this device I am not so certain that Ireland are trying to do anything different after the World Cup to be brutally honest, although it's been difficult for the past two weekends because it has rained on both occasions. Ireland did some things well against France but I was a little bit annoyed they didn't take a kick at goal early on. They should have, they didn't, and you need to take your chances when you are inside the opposition 22. Ireland spent a lot of time there in the first half and didn't take their opportunities. France spent 15 minutes in Ireland's 22 in the second half and got away with a converted try. That won the game. I don't know whether it was intentional or not, and you could say anything retrospectively, but France having their two normal starting props - Rabah Slimani and Eddy Ben Arous - on the bench to come on with 35 minutes to go was a game-changer. Whether that becomes a trend you don't know. I think in part Guy Noves was trying to give them a bit of a rocket because they were a bit lazy last week against Italy at the scrummage. But this week it was different - the scrummage was the reason France won the game. There was a mad statistic from the first weekend that France had 20 offloads against Italy, and Ireland only had two against Wales. This week it was similar - France had 17 to Ireland's one. I think that is actually too many for France - they are kind of pointless offloads with no benefit to them. For Ireland, that is too few. When is a good offload a good offload? Well, you need to calculate the risk. My belief is that Ireland don't have enough players running for the positive break. When a player gets in around the back of a side or gets over the gain line and looks to pop a pass, there should be a guy ready to run at 100 miles an hour on his shoulder. There also needs to be a guy to run and make the ruck if he doesn't offload it. Ireland are putting the guy into the ruck but not the supporting runner looking for the offload. You do two of those a game and that could be two tries, although that is a very simplistic way of looking at it. In the World Cup one of the favourite things I analysed was New Zealand scrum-half Aaron Smith. When he passed the ball off the scrum he immediately set off running in front of the backline from one side of the field to the other. He - and their other scrum-halves - do it on the chance that one of their wingers on the far side of the field gets tackled and they are there for the inside pass for the offload. New Zealand score so many tries under the posts from their scrum-half and it just comes from running a positive line. Media playback is not supported on this device If we have our full team on the field we will be very close and that's the truth of it. But Ireland have a ludicrous injury list - it's too many. A lot of our guys are a little bit over 30 and we are in a point of transition. Do you say, let's transition some younger guys? It's much easier to bring a young guy in when you have got a settled senior team and it's very hard to bring five guys in at once. We suffered against France because the scrum didn't hold up under pressure. But I think we would be having this conversation even if the scrum had held up because you want to see a bit more from the team. I think Ireland still tend to be a little bit slow bringing guys through at provincial level. That then makes it harder to bring people through at international level. In some ways it may be a simple case of having the right players on the field. The right players for me are the likes of Simon Zebo and Keith Earls because of their gas - their pure gas. They may never get the ball on the support lines that I would like to see but if they do it should be a try. Media playback is not supported on this device Ireland are a team in transition with a very tough year ahead of us. We have got a three-match summer tour to South Africa, and then Australia and New Zealand in the autumn - all following on from a World Cup year. We are still in a spot of World Cup fatigue. That, and the six-day turnaround from the Wales game, one less than France, makes it difficult. Am I totally despondent about where Ireland are? No, I am not. I think I am being realistic. I don't think Ireland overachieved last season in winning the Six Nations title. Ireland are used to winning now and want to do well all the time. I think circumstances, from injuries to the weather, have dictated that our game plan sometimes can be put under pressure if one facet of our game doesn't work. Keith Wood was talking to BBC Sport's Tom Reynolds. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The Irish national rugby team is experiencing a challenging period, with their Six Nations campaign not going as planned and being winless after two matches. Following their quarter-final defeat in the 2015 Rugby World Cup, questions have been raised about what is going wrong with Joe Schmidt's side. Factors contributing to their struggles include a lack of adaptation of tactics, injuries, and a need for transition with a younger and more dynamic squad. While Ireland's statistics against France show some positives, they need to capitalize on chances and improve their supporting runner positions during games. The team is in a transition period and needs to focus on bringing through younger players at both provincial and international levels to maintain a competitive edge. Despite the difficulties, there is no need for complete despondency. Ireland is still capable of achieving success, but they must address these issues to reach their full potential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Children with ADHD are often overwhelmed by what might seem like simple tasks. You can make it easier to achieve tasks by breaking them down into smaller steps, sometimes called \\"chunking.\\" Teachers don’t tell students they have a 10-page research paper with citations due in a month, then walk off and expect success. They pass out written instructions with the assignment chunked into milestones with deadlines. Students get feedback at every stage of the process. Parents can do the same with chores, establishing routines that reflect consistent instructions. For example, if your child is responsible for loading the dishwasher, you might break up the task in this way: First load all the plates on the bottom. Now load all glasses on the top. Next is silverware… and so on. To ensure the child heard and understood the instructions you gave, ask her or him to repeat back what you said. This allows you to verify that the child understood, so you can clarify if necessary. It can also help reinforce the task in the child's mind There are several types of reminders you can provide that can help a child with ADHD stay focused and on task. For cleanup tasks, you can create a system that uses color-coded bins or shelves. Written labels and pictures can also help the child remember what goes where at cleanup time. A checklist, day-planner, calendar, or chore-board can also be helpful for children struggling with focus issues. At school, try to organize a \\"homework buddy\\" to help remind the child of school tasks they need to accomplish. Young people in general don't have a very precise sense of time. Children with ADHD struggle with this even more. To help a child with ADHD follow instructions in a timely manner, its important to help with these clock issues. For example, set out a kitchen timer. Let the child know you'd like to see the task completed the before it beeps. Or, play some music the child is familiar with. Tell him or her you want the task completed before the music is over, or before a particular song ends. As the child accomplishes each step of the task, praise him or her. This will help build his or her self-esteem and sense of accomplishment. Providing praise at each step increases the chances of future successes, too. Making chores fun can help reduce the stress that an ADHD child may feel when taking on a new task. Here are a few ideas: Give instructions using silly voices. Try role-playing. Pretend to be a character from a book, movie or TV show, and/or invite your child to do so. For example, your child could dress up as Cinderella on chore day, while you play music from the movie. If the child starts to get stressed out, make the next chore a silly one, or assign a silly movement to do or sound to make while working. Don't be afraid to take a snack break if things get too rough.","completion":"The article discusses how breaking tasks into smaller steps, providing reminders, establishing routines, and making chores fun can help children with ADHD to manage and complete tasks more effectively, along with emphasizing the importance of feedback and praise at every stage to support their focus and self-esteem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was discovered in September 1998 by the California and Carnegie Planet Search team using the highly successful radial velocity method . The planet is at least 24 % more massive than Jupiter . The mean distance of the planet from the star is slightly more than Earth 's distance from the Sun. However , the orbit is very eccentric , so at periastron this distance is almost halved , and at apastron it is as distant as Mars is from the Sun. In 2000 , a group of scientists proposed , based on preliminary data from the Hipparcos astrometrical satellite , that the planet would have an inclination of 175.8 ° and a true mass of 18 times Jupiter making it a brown dwarf instead of a planet . However these measurements were later proved useful only for upper limits of inclination . If the planet orbits in the same plane as the claimed circumstellar disk , which seems a plausible assumption , it would have an inclination of 40 ° and an absolute mass of 2.2 times Jupiter , however later observations failed to confirm the disk 's existence . - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. - HD 210277 is a 7th magnitude star in the constellation of Aquarius. It is a yellow dwarf star (spectral type G0V) with a mass around 0.92 times that of our Sun. Since its distance is about 70 light years, it is not visible to the unaided eye. With binoculars it is easily visible. Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'constellation' with the subject 'hd 210277 b'.

The mask made the woman feel uneasy so she held the doll because the OPT: a). mask was scary. b). doll was scary.","completion":"The mask made the woman feel uneasy, so she held the doll because the mask was scary. As she stared at the peculiar mask, a wave of uneasiness washed over her. It was nearly impossible to identify what exactly was causing her discomfort, but the sinister grin stretched across the mask's face seemed to stare right back at her – tapping into her deepest fears and anxieties. In search of consolation, the woman glanced over at a nearby shelf, where her eyes fell upon a small, delicate doll. The doll's intricate porcelain features and lacey attire gave it an air of elegance and familiarity. In that moment, the woman felt inexplicably drawn to the doll, as if it held some sort of key to dispelling the unease that the mask had evoked within her. With great care, she embraced the doll, holding it close to her chest, in an effort to reclaim her sense of security. As she clutched the delicate doll, her breathing started to normalize, and her racing heart slowed down. The comfort brought on by the gentle presence of the doll was in stark contrast to the feeling of dread instilled by the mask. She tried to understand why the mask had such a powerful effect on her. Was it the twisted smile that seemed to mock her vulnerability, or perhaps the hollow, empty eyes that seemed devoid of empathy and warmth? The woman pondered the nature of fear and uneasiness that certain objects can instill in people. After all, both the mask and the doll were inanimate objects – unable to cause harm or exhibit malicious intent. Yet, something about the mask had triggered her primal instincts of danger, making her feel as if she was prey to a lurking, unseen threat. At the same time, the doll offered sanctuary – a familiar refuge away from those inexplicable fears. As she continued to hold the doll, the woman tried to face her fear head on. She fixed her gaze on the mask, challenging its power over her. Slowly, it seemed as if the mask was losing its menacing grip on her, and she began to feel more in control. The mask remained on the shelf, unmoving, as the woman mustered the courage to confront the irrational fear it generated. In the end, she realized that fear itself was often the greatest obstacle to overcome. It had the power to invoke a deep sense of uneasiness, oftentimes without warrant. The mask, while indeed frightening, was ultimately harmless. And, with the support of the doll to ground her, she found the strength to rise above her fear, and face the unsettling mask with newfound determination. Whether it was the apparent innocence of the doll, the sinister appearance of the mask, or simply the juxtaposition of these two objects, the woman gained a valuable insight. Fear has the power to both cripple and enlighten us. The key to conquering fear lies in embracing support and finding the courage to face and understand the root of our uneasiness. In doing so, we can triumph over the shadows that lurk within, and emerge stronger, wiser, and more resilient. Though the mask made the woman feel uneasy, the experience with the doll was a reminder that fear can be conquered and, ultimately, that the human spirit is far more powerful than any inanimate object."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Food for thought in the US Before I left for America, everyone warned me to watch my weight because it's easy to put on weight there. That's true. One thing I still cannot _ is the food and drink. Almost every American person loves sodas, especially those full of ice cubes. I remember the first day I came to my host family. When I asked them for a glass of hot water, they all looked at me and thought I was crazy! At my school there's no water dispenser but there's one in each classroom in China. All the American students drink water from taps outside the restrooms that are specially designed for drinking. The water is cold and the school doesn't have hot water. The most popular food here is hamburgers and French chips, which are junk food in China. Most students who eat at school prefer those to salads. They also eat lots of pizzas and hot dogs. As a result, you can always see some really fat people in school. Luckily, my host mom is really a great cook. She always makes food from different countries and eats a balanced meal every day. So I have a lot of fruit and vegetables. At my host family's home, they usually eat biscuits. These old-fashioned biscuits are low in fat and flavored with buttermilk, butter, and a bit of honey. Oh here comes the most interesting thing: the word \\"biscuit\\" in China actually means \\"cracker \\" here. Real biscuits are a kind of soft cake. I was also amazed by the rich kinds of food in American supermarkets and their reasonable prices. For example, one brand of yogurt has 20 kinds of flavors! You're sure to find one that you like.

Donald Montgomery Hutson (January 31, 1913 - June 26, 1997) was a professional American football player and assistant coach in the National Football League (NFL). He played as a split end and spent his entire eleven-year professional career with the Green Bay Packers. Under head coach Curly Lambeau, Hutson led the Packers to four NFL Championship Games, winning three: 1936, 1939, and 1944. Hutson has been honored in a variety of ways. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame as a charter member in 1951, and the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1968, also as an initial member. His number 14 was the first number retired by the Packers, in a public ceremony at a game at City Stadium on December 2, 1951. Hutson Street in the Packerland Industrial Park in Green Bay is named for him, and in 1994 the Packers named their new state-of-the-art indoor practice facility across the street from Lambeau Field the \\"Don Hutson Center.\\" Hutson was inducted as a charter member of both the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951, and Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963. His college career made him a unanimous choice for the Associated Press Southeast Area All-Time football team 1920-1969 era. Hutson is a member of the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame, inducted in 1972 along with his quarterbacks, Arnie Herber and Cecil Isbell. There is a park named after him in his hometown of Pine Bluff, Arkansas. On the occasion of his 75th birthday he performed the ceremonial coin toss of Super Bowl XXII to end the pregame ceremonies. Hutson was named to the NFL's 1930s All-Decade Team and 50th Anniversary Team in 1970, and in 1994 he was named to the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 1999, he was ranked sixth on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the highest-ranking Packer and the highest-ranking pre-World War II player. In 2012, the NFL Network named Hutson the greatest Green Bay Packer of all time. In 2005, the Flagstad family of Green Bay donated to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame an authentic Packers No. 14 jersey worn by Hutson. The jersey was found in a trunk of old uniforms in 1946 at the Rockwood Lodge, the Packers' summer training camp from 1946 to 1949, owned by Melvin and Helen Flagstad. The jersey, a rare NFL artifact valued at over 17,000, was donated by son Daniel Flagstad in memory of his parents. Hutson's most productive seasons were from 1942 to 1945, a time in which the NFL was severely depleted with many of its most talented players and prospective college athletes serving in the military during World War II. Hutson was classified I-A for the military draft, but had three daughters, so was able to avoid conscription. On the notion that Hutson exploited watered-down defenses, former Packers running back Paul Hornung responded as such: \\"I'm a believer. Am I a believer! You know what Hutson would do in this league today? The same things he did when he played.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Was he honored for anything else?","completion":"Yes, absolutely! Donald Hutson was honored in several ways. He was elected into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame and the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.

The Packers also named their fancy indoor practice field the \\"Don Hutson Center.\\" He's also in the College Football Hall of Fame and Pro Football Hall of Fame. Then we have his hometown, Pine Bluff, Arkansas, that has a park named for him. On top of that, he's on both the NFL's 1930s All-Decade Team and the 50th Anniversary Team from 1970, and the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team from 1994.

Charley (William Ragsdale) now believes that Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon), was nothing but a serial killer posing as a vampire. As a result, he comes to believe that vampires never existed.Charley, along with his new girlfriend, Alex Young (Traci Lind), go to visit Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), who is again a burnt-out vampire killer on Fright Night much to the chagrin of the boy-who-cried-wolf Charley. It is while visiting Peter's apartment that Charley sees four coffins being taken into a car. On the way out from Peter's apartment, Charley sees four strange people walk past him, into an elevator. Charley instantly becomes smitten with one of the four, the alluring Regine (Julie Carmen). Charley drives Alex back to her dorm room and begins to make out with her, only to pull away and see Regine staring back at him. A ticked-off Alex storms off, not realizing that something is following her. Another girl leaves the dorm as Alex enters, and she is followed and killed by one of Regine's henchmen, Belle. Alex, meanwhile, is unaware that Louie, another of Regine's posse, is scaling up the wall outside her window, but he is startled and falls when Alex inadvertently slams her window shut on his hands. Bozworth ( Brian Thompson), the third heavy, makes fun of Louie before consuming some bugs.Meanwhile, later that night Charley dreams that Regine comes to visit him, only for her to turn into a vampire and bite him. The next day Charley talks to his psychiatrist who assures him that what he dreamed was only natural. Alex finds Charley bowling, per doctor's orders, and Charley agrees to go to the symphony with her. On his way there however he sees his friend Richie (Merritt Butrick) with Regine and opts to follow him. Charley climbs up to a fire escape outside of Regine's apartment, only to be horrified when he sees Regine and Belle attack and drain Richie's blood. Charley runs off to find Peter, and the two of them arm themselves... Answer:","completion":"Given the plot of Fright Night Part II, we can derive several discussion points that would form the basis for engaging questions: 1. How does the concept of denial and disbelief in the supernatural, as demonstrated by Charley's initial belief that Jerry Dandridge was a serial killer posing as a vampire, impact the progression of the narrative? Do you think Charley's denial stems from fear or from a rational interpretation of events given the circumstances? 2. How does the introduction of Alex Young as Charley's new girlfriend add to the dynamics of the story? In what ways does her character deepen the emotional depth and stakes of the story? 3. What do the four coffins spotted at Peter's apartment signify? Given Charley's recent dismissal of vampire existence, how does this sighting alter or reinforce his perceptions? 4. The alluring Regine catches Charley's attention instantly. How does this attraction illustrate the dangers of enamorment and infatuation? 5. How do the experiences of Alex offer an additional layer of tension to the story? What role does her near encounter with Louie play in escalating the suspense? 6. Charley's nightmarish encounter with Regine draws him back into the world of vampires. How did it make you feel seeing Charley revisit his traumatic past throughout the movie? 7. Can you make a comparison between Peter Vincent's continuous determination to kill vampires and Charley's wavering belief in their existence? What does this dynamic tell about their characters? 8. The incident of Richie's attack opens a can of worms for Charley and forces him to face reality. How crucial is this event in terms of escalating the story's conflict? These critical thinking questions aim at triggering a deep dive into the multi-dimensional aspects of the movie's characters, plot, and themes.

When she sees a defenseless man being attacked by street thugs, she intervenes, but is surprised when the passive victim doesn't even bother to thank her.

When she brings him home to meet her parents and brother, he is almost non-verbal, except to tell her that he doesn't care for families. He learns that Patsy had another brother who was murdered for no known reason. Patsy's eccentric family is surprised when she announces their intention to wed, then amazed when their marriage ceremony conducted by the atheistic Rev.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: you could prove that movements are occurring even in the absence of a gradient. In a similar manner, there are analogous carrier systems that move hydrophobic molecules through water. Channel molecules sit within a membrane and contain an aqueous channel that spans the membrane’s hydrophobic region. Hydrophilic molecules of particular sizes and shapes can pass through this aqueous channel and their movement involves a significantly lower activation energy than would be associated with moving through the lipid part of the membrane in the absence of the channel. Channels are generally highly selective in terms of which particles will pass through them. For example, there are channels in which 10,000 potassium ions will pass through for every one sodium ion. Often the properties of these channels can be regulated; they can exist in two or more distinct structural states. For example, in one state the channel can be open and allow particles to pass through or it can be closed, that is the channel can be turned on and off. Channels cannot, however, determine in which direction an ion will move - that is determined by the ion gradient across the membrane. The transition between open and closed states can be regulated through a number of processes, including the reversible binding of small molecules to the protein and various other molecular changes (which we will consider when we talk about proteins). Another method of channel control depends on the fact that channel proteins are i) embedded within a membrane and ii) contain charged groups. As we will see cells can (and generally do) generate ion gradients, that, is a separation of charged species across their membranes. For example if the concentration of K+ ions is higher on one side of the membrane, there will be an ion gradient where the natural tendency is for the ions to move to the region of lower K+ concentration.222 The ion gradient in turn can produce an electrical field across the plasma membrane. As these fields change, they can produce (induce) changes... Q: What type of molecules sit within a membrane and contain an aqueous channel that spans the membrane’s hydrophobic region?

Given the question: SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government... How long will it take for North Korea, South Korea, and the US to come to a resolution? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. about an hour B. several years C. several months D. not enough information The answer is:","completion":"D. not enough information It is impossible to accurately predict the exact timeline for North Korea, South Korea, and the U.S. to reach a resolution due to the complex and unpredictable nature of diplomatic negotiations, especially in such a politically sensitive and volatile region. While some progress has been made, tensions and demands continue to shift and evolve, making it difficult to forecast a specific timeframe. There are several factors both promoting and impeding progress, such as the willingness of the involved leaders to engage in dialogue and find common ground, their often contrasting goals and priorities, the influence of domestic and international politics, and historical legacies and grievances stemming from the long-standing division between North and South Korea. Each of these factors contributes to the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing negotiation process and the potential for resolution. The history of negotiations between North Korea, South Korea, and the U.S. has been marked by periods of optimism and apparent progress, followed by setbacks and elevated tensions. At times, major breakthroughs seemed imminent, but various factors have led to stalemates or even escalations in hostilities. While each negotiation round brings unique circumstances and challenges, the overall pattern of fluctuating relations between these countries demonstrates the difficulty of reaching a comprehensive and lasting resolution. In the specific instance referenced in the question, the Trump-Kim summit in June 2018 raised hope that progress could be made toward denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. Despite the initial optimism following the meeting, the negotiation process has since shown limited results and slow progress. The situation remains tense, and ongoing efforts have not yet produced a definitive resolution. In conclusion, while it's possible that North Korea, South Korea, and the U.S. may eventually reach a resolution to their disputes, there is not enough information available to accurately predict when that might happen. Given the historical track record and the complex nature of the issues at play, predicting an exact timeline for resolution is inherently unreliable.

In this work, Lyly wrote, \\"The rules of fair play do not apply in love and war.\\" Step 3: Provide the answer based on my findings. Based on my findings, John Lyly can be credited with saying something similar to \\"everything is fair in love and war\\" in his work \\"Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit.\\" However, as is true with many proverbs, the phrase has evolved over time and is now commonly used in its current form \\"All is fair in love and war.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on \\"public defender says no proof on terrorism against shoe-bomb suspect\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Public Defender Asserts Lack of Evidence in Terrorism Case Against Shoe-bomb Suspect In a recent courtroom development, the public defender representing the suspect in an alleged shoe-bomb terrorism case has maintained there is insufficient evidence to warrant the charges. During a high-profile trial surrounding potential terrorism, the defense counsel has insisted that the prosecution has failed to present viable proof to establish a connection between the defendant and the alleged shoe-bomb plot. The suspect, apprehended by law enforcement officials earlier this year, faces serious allegations of conspiring to detonate a shoe-bomb in a crowded public place, causing mass casualties. However, the public defender argues that the evidence provided so far lacks tangible connections to the suspect's purported involvement in such a plan. In arguing for the dismissal of terrorism charges, the defense lawyer outlined several critical points. First, there is no concrete evidence linking the suspect to the recovered explosive device. Despite an extensive investigation, law enforcement has not managed to find any fingerprints, DNA, or other forensic evidence that could place the defendant at the scene, handling the shoe-bomb in question. Secondly, the public defender emphasized the absence of incriminating communications from the suspect. There are no records of phone calls, text messages, emails, or other forms of correspondence that outline the suspect's intentions or connection to the alleged terrorism plot. The lawyer argued that without evidence of communication regarding the scheme, it is impossible to claim the defendant played a role. Lastly, the defense attorney questioned the credibility of an essential witness. Prosecutors have relied heavily on this key witness's testimony, who claimed to have inside knowledge about the suspect's involvement in the plot. However, the defense lawyer pointed out that the witness has a history of lying to law enforcement in previous cases. Furthermore, the witness may have a personal vendetta against the suspect, casting doubt on their testimony's reliability. In conclusion, the public defender maintains that the absence of forensic evidence, incriminating communications, and credible witnesses render the terrorism charges against the shoe-bomb suspect baseless. The defense is seeking to have the charges dismissed, asserting that there is no clear proof linking their client to the alleged shoe-bomb incident, and thus cannot be prosecuted for terrorism under existing legal standards. The decision now lies with the presiding judge, who must determine if the case will proceed or not based on the arguments put forth by both the defense and prosecution."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Answer the following question: This article: Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.) In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose relationship with Shostakovich's was tender?, what is it ?

Background: The Joker is a fictional supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson who first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman (April 25, 1940), published by DC Comics. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design, while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman. In his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind. Context: The Joker was one of the few popular villains continuing to appear regularly in Batman comics from the Golden Age into the Silver Age, as the series continued during the rise in popularity of mystery and romance comics. In 1951, Finger wrote an origin story for the Joker in Detective Comics #168, which introduced the characteristic of him formerly being the criminal Red Hood, and his disfigurement the result of a fall into a chemical vat. By 1954, the Comics Code Authority had been established in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) was responsible for the rise in juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies. The character appeared less frequently after 1964, when Julius Schwartz (who disliked the Joker) became editor of the Batman comics. The character risked becoming an obscure figure of the preceding era until this goofy prankster version of the character was adapted into the 1966 television series Batman, in which he was played by Cesar Romero. The show's popularity compelled Schwartz to keep the comics in a similar vein. As the show's popularity waned, however, so did that of the Batman comics. After the TV series ended in 1968, the increase in public visibility had not stopped the comic's sales decline; editorial director Carmine Infantino resolved to turn things around, moving stories away from schoolboy-friendly adventures. The Silver Age introduced several of the Joker's defining character traits: lethal joy buzzers, acid-squirting flowers, trick guns, and goofy, elaborate crimes. Question: What were some of the Joker's character traits? Answer:","completion":"The Joker is a supervillain in Batman comics and has some unique character traits. Some of these traits include being a criminal mastermind, a goofy, thieving trickster, and using fun but dangerous gadgets like lethal joy buzzers, acid-squirting flowers, and trick guns. He also likes to plan goofy and elaborate crimes. In the past, he used to have more violent and scary tendencies, but later became more of a playful prankster."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Consider wearing light-colored outfits. Wear little makeup, if any. Maintain good hygiene. Maintain a neat appearance. Smile often.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Enhancing Your Lifestyle through Modest Dressing and Minimalism Introduction In today's fast-paced world where fashion trends change overnight and materialistic pursuits clutter our lives, it is easy to get caught up in the never-ending cycle of vanity. However, more and more people are now veering towards a more simplistic and modest lifestyle, in terms of dressing and grooming habits. This movement towards minimalism and modesty not only enhances your appearance but also promotes mental and emotional well-being. In this article, we will discuss the numerous benefits of adopting a simpler, more elegant, and humble look, and how it can bring about a positive impact on your life. 1. Altering Your Look When it comes to altering your look, the first step is to assess your wardrobe and make changes to its contents. Embrace neutral and light colors, such as whites, beiges, and pastels, which are easier on the eyes and project an aura of serenity. Opt for simple cuts and designs that flatter your body type without drawing excessive attention. In addition, invest in pieces made from ethically sourced and sustainable materials, reflecting your conscious choices for the environment. 2. Dressing Modestly Dressing modestly is not just about covering your body, but also about carrying yourself with dignity and respect. Modest outfits enable you to exude confidence without succumbing to societal pressures of flaunting your physicality. Refrain from clothing adorned with excessive studs, spikes, or other ostentatious embellishments. Instead, opt for elegant and timeless accessories that complement your outfit without overpowering it. 3. Minimal Makeup In line with the minimalist mindset, reduce the amount of makeup you use daily or even consider going makeup-free. Embrace your natural beauty and enhance your features with a light application of makeup, if absolutely necessary. This not only reduces skin problems associated with excessive makeup use but also saves time and money spent on cosmetic products. 4. Good Hygiene Maintaining good hygiene is crucial in projecting a well-groomed and healthy appearance. Shower regularly, brush and floss daily, and keep your nails trimmed and clean. Pamper yourself with occasional salon visits for haircuts, facials, or other grooming services to maintain a clean and polished appearance. 5. Neatness Along with hygiene, ensure your overall appearance is neat and tidy. Iron your clothes, polish your shoes, and organize your wardrobe to make dressing up each day more efficient and stress-free. Keeping your belongings organized not only helps in maintaining a neat appearance but also reflects a sense of discipline, orderliness, and respect for yourself. 6. Smile Often No accessory can beat the charm of a genuine and warm smile. Smiling reflects happiness, positivity, and approachability. It creates an inviting aura around you, encouraging people to engage with you. A genuine smile can work wonders in alleviating stress and anxiety, making you radiate positivity to those around you. Conclusion Adopting a more modest and minimalist lifestyle in terms of appearance goes far beyond just superficial changes. It signifies a mental and emotional transformation that fosters contentment, mindfulness, and gratitude. By dressing simply and modestly, maintaining good hygiene, sporting minimal makeup, and exuding a sense of genuineness through your smile, you cultivate an image of authenticity, dignity, and approachability. This, in turn, contributes to your personal growth, success, and happiness in a manner that sustains beyond fleeting fashion trends and societal expectations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Easier comprehension and learning: Children understand their mother tongue better, leading to more effective learning. 2. Preservation of culture: Using native languages in education helps preserve cultural identity and traditions. 3. Better communication between students and teachers: Using a familiar language reduces potential miscommunication. 4. Boosts confidence and self-esteem: Learning in one's mother tongue can boost children's confidence in expressing themselves. - Disadvantages: 1. Limited resources: Teaching materials and resources might be limited in regional languages compared to English. 2. Challenges in transitioning to English-medium schooling: Students may face challenges adapting to English as the medium of instruction in higher education. 3. Reduced competitiveness in a global economy: Students may face difficulties in English-speaking work environments or pursuing opportunities abroad. 4. Diverse linguistic landscape: India has numerous languages, and using all as mediums of instruction in their respective regions could create logistical challenges. Step 2: Consider how India would be today if English were not the medium of instruction in higher education. - Students may face more difficulty in accessing global opportunities due to limited English proficiency. - India might have a stronger focus on preserving and promoting native languages and cultures. - Indian industries that heavily rely on English, such as the IT and BPO sectors, might not have grown as rapidly. - The country may have been less influenced by Western culture. - International collaborations and research opportunities may have been more limited.

In logic and reasoning, \\"entailment\\" refers to a situation where the truth of one statement (Sentence 1) necessitates the truth of another statement (Sentence 2). However, in this case, Sentence 1 does not provide information that enables us to decisively ascertain the truth of Sentence 2. Although Sentence 1 explains that Annette passed a small, open-bladed penknife to him, it neither states nor implies the ownership of the penknife. The penknife could theoretically belong to either Annette or him, or it could belong to an entirely separate individual. The details given in Sentence 1 simply do not allow for a definitive conclusion regarding ownership. Therefore, just because Annette had the penknife and gave it to him does not mean the penknife belonged to her or him. It might have but it also might not have. So, we have to select option (ii). it is not possible to tell whether the penknife belongs to Annette or him based on the information provided by Sentence 1.

In Game 1 in San Antonio, the game was relatively close. Dallas managed to reach an 81-71 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1 at home, 85-90. However, the Mavs managed to force 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113-92, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, Manu Ginóbili managed to hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108-106 with 1.7 left, but a buzzer beater by Vince Carter gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2-1 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93-89 and later Game 5 at home 109-103, giving them a 3-2 lead.

Summarize this article: If you want your makeup to look natural and bright, you need to start with a glowing complexion. Start by washing your face with a gentle cleanser. Since your skin gets drier as you mature, a hydrating cleanser is likely your best choice. After you wash your face, use a soft towel to blot your face dry. Don't rub your face—this can stretch out your skin, especially in the delicate area around your eyes. Hydrated skin looks healthier, so use a lightweight face cream after you wash your face. This is especially important under your eyes—if your skin is dry, it will look saggy, which will emphasize any lines in the area. In addition, powder can settle into the creases around your eyes, making the area look heavy. During the day time, it's a good idea to use a moisturizer that contains sun protection if you don't use a separate product. Opt for a product with at least SPF 30. You may also want to use a separate lifting or firming eye cream at night. If you have a tube of product, squeeze out a very small amount onto your finger on a brush. If you have a tube of product, swipe a brush across the product. Either way, apply the primer or base to your eyelids just above your lashes, then blend it upward above your crease. This will give your eyeshadow something to adhere to. The skin on your eyelids thins as you get older, making them more translucent. That means they'll appear slightly purple, blue, or red. An eyeshadow primer or base will help cover that, creating a smooth canvas for your makeup while making you look more bright-eyed and refreshed. Make sure to apply the product lightly to ensure it doesn't crease. When you put on eyeshadow, small particles of pigment typically fall onto your cheeks and under your eyes. This is called eyeshadow fallout, and if you've already applied foundation and concealer, the fallout can get trapped. If you do your eyeshadow first, you can brush away the fallout before applying the rest of your makeup. Fallout can emphasize any dark circles under your eyes, making you look tired or ill.

(Associated Press) SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court said Monday it won't hear an appeal from the family on TV's \\"Sister Wives\\" challenging Utah's law banning polygamy. The decision ends the family's long legal fight to overturn a seldom used and unique provision of Utah's law that the Browns and other polygamous families contend has a chilling effect by sending law-abiding plural families into hiding because of fear of prosecution. The provision bars married people from living with a second purported \\"spiritual spouse\\" even if the man is legally married to just one woman, making it stricter than anti-bigamy laws in other states. The reality TLC cable channel TV show follows the lives of Kody Brown, his four wives and all their children. When it debuted in 2010, it was considered ground-breaking by offering viewers a glimpse into how a plural family navigates the unique complexities of the arrangement. Utah prosecutors say they generally leave polygamists alone but that they need the ban to pursue polygamists for other crimes such as underage marriage and sexual assault. Only 10 people were charged with violating the law between 2001 and 2011, prosecutors say. The Utah Attorney General's Office declined comment on the Supreme Court's denial of the case, which the justices issued without comment. The saga between the Browns and Utah officials began in September 2010 when the first episode aired of the TLC show, \\"Sister Wives.\\" A county prosecutor opened an investigation, leading the Browns to leave their longtime of Lehi, Utah, in 2011, to settle in Las Vegas where they still live today. That same year, the Browns filed a lawsuit calling the opening of the investigation government abuse. The case was closed without filing any charges. In 2013, the Browns scored a key legal victory when a federal judge in Utah ruled the law violated polygamists' right to privacy and religious freedom. But an appeals court in Denver decided last year that the Browns could not sue because they were not charged under the Utah law. It did not consider the constitutional issues. That ruling will now stand. The Brown's attorney, Jonathan Turley, said in a statement posted on his blog that he and the family are disappointed but not surprised because the high court is on a pace to hear less than 1 percent of the 7,500 appeals it is likely to receive this term. Turley emphasized that an appeals court ruling was not made based on the merits of the Browns' assertion that Utah's law violates their rights of speech and religion. \\"Our victory in Salt Lake City will remain as a cautionary decision for legislators who wish to marginalize or sanction this community in the future,\\" Turley said. \\"It has been a long road for all of us and it is not the end of the road. Plural and unconventional families will continue to strive for equal status and treatment under the law.\\" Kody Brown is legally married to Robyn Brown, but says he is \\"spiritually married\\" to three other women. They live together in a plural relationship and belong to a religious group that believes in polygamy as a core religious practice. Their show continues to air on TLC. About 30,000 polygamists live in Utah, according to court documents. The mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints abandoned the practice in 1890 and strictly prohibits it today. ___ This story has been corrected to show Kody Brown is now legally married to Robyn Brown, not Meri Brown. ||||| \\"Today is an Injustice to not be heard by SCOTUS,\\" the family tweeted on its account. \\"We suspect there will be many people everywhere demanding to be heard for Liberty.\\" Kristyn Decker, a former plural wife who runs an anti-polygamy group called Sound Choices Coalition, said she was grateful the Supreme Court won't hear the case. \\"Research (especially that done by Canada's Supreme Court), proves that polygamy is inherently harmful to women, children and to Society as a whole,\\" Decker wrote in a statement. \\"We hope those who've been raised to believe they must live polygamy to attain their salvation, or because of family tradition, will soon awaken to that nonsense and find genuine freedom and happiness.\\" After the Supreme Court's 2015 rulings that legalized gay marriage, some polygamists and libertarians believed polygamy was the next step in marriage rights. Some lawyers also thought the Browns represented the best chance in decades for polygamy to win in the courts because all five spouses were consenting adults with no taint of crimes such as sexual abuse or fraud. But the Browns' case was hampered by one problem — the Browns have never been prosecuted for bigamy. They contended the law on the books and a 2010 investigation by Lehi police were enough to constitute discrimination. The bigamy statute, when read broadly, could be used to prosecute unmarried couples who live together. Yet the statute, which makes polygamy a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, has been used only to prosecute polygamists. The Utah attorney general's office argued polygamy is inherently harmful to women and children and that the state has an interest in keeping it a crime if only as a way to help it prosecute more serious crimes within polygamous communities. In December 2013, federal Judge Clark Waddoups sided with the Browns and struck down the portion of Utah's bigamy statute focused on polygamy. (A portion dealing with having active, multiple marriage licenses remained.) Last April, an appeals court in Denver overturned that ruling. In finding the Browns lacked standing to file a legal challenge, a three-judge panel considered a policy by the Utah County attorney's office limiting polygamy prosecutions to cases which also include offenses like sexual abuse, fraud and underage marriage. Other county prosecutors and the Utah attorney general's office have similar policies. Ken Driggs, an Atlanta criminal defense attorney and legal historian who has written about fundamentalist Mormonism, said the best chance for the Supreme Court to take up polygamy is for prosecutors to charge consenting adults, and for the polygamists to show harm from that prosecution. However, Driggs said, it's unlikely any prosecutor will file charges against polygamists like the Browns for fear of an appeal. \\"I'm not going to say that no prosecutor would think about doing it,\\" Driggs said. \\"I'm saying they would not be successful in the long run.\\" The Browns' attorney was George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley. On his blog Monday, he again contended his clients had a \\"fundamental right to follow their own faiths so long as they did not harm others.\\" Turley also suggested Waddoups' ruling might yet have an impact. \\"Our victory in Salt Lake City will remain as a cautionary decision for legislators who wish to marginalize or sanction this community in the future,\\" Turley wrote. Janet Bennion, a professor of anthropology at Lyndon State College in Vermont who studies forms of marriage and supports the decriminalization of polygamy, framed the Supreme Court's decision in a broader political context. There is a populist movement in the United States and many countries to expand the definition of marriage, and that movement will eventually succeed. But it is slowed, Bennion said, by governments that enforce the concept of a nuclear family. \\"The reality is we are going to see an expansion of marriage,\\" Bennion said, \\"but not the protections they deserve.\\" The discussion of whether polygamy should be a crime in Utah still has an immediate focus. A bill filed in the Utah Legislature, where the 2017 session began Monday, clarifies polygamy is a felony. HB99, filed by Rep. Mike Noel, R-Kanab, amends the Utah bigamy statute to address concerns in Waddoups' ruling. A coalition of polygamists from across Utah have made plans to oppose it. Like the Browns' lawsuit, the Principle Rights Coalition is not seeking legal recognition of polygamy — just that the criminal penalties be removed. Kody Brown belongs to the Bluffdale-based church called the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB). Members believe in polygamy as a tenet. The family lived in Lehi and came to the attention of police there in 2010, when the TLC network launched a reality show that follows the family, called \\"Sister Wives.\\" At the time, Kody Brown was legally married to only his first wife, Meri. They later divorced, though their spiritual marriage remains and they continue living as husband and wife, and Kody legally married his fourth wife, Robyn. The Browns moved to Nevada after Lehi police began their investigation. Recent tabloid reports said Kody Brown had split with the AUB. Brady Williams, another polygamist and friend of Kody Brown, recently told The Salt Lake Tribune in a text that Kody \\"is still a member of the AUB with no intention of leaving.\\" The legal case was named \\"Brown v. Buhman\\" for Kody Brown and Utah County Attorney Jeff Buhman. ncarlisle@sltrib.com Twitter: @natecarlisle ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In a decision on January 24, 2017, the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from the polygamous family featured in the reality show \\"Sister Wives,\\" effectively upholding Utah's law banning polygamy.

In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Now, I have a new situation: An alien passing by Earth in a UFO to write a report on two random cities so that his government can better understand what the people of Earth are like. He first flies over Nillmar, a city in France, which uses burns coal as its main production of electricity. After observing Nillmar, the alien flies over to Springfield, a city in the United States, that decided to use nuclear power to fuel itself. After taking his notes, the alien leaves and is eager to report back to his superiors about what he discovered. Answer this question please: Does Springfield have more or less air pollution than Nillmar? Answer:","completion":"Springfield has less air pollution than Nillmar. This is because Springfield uses nuclear power for electricity production, which does not release air pollution unlike the burning of coal in Nillmar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size. \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\" While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores. The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added. For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \\"return to great power rivalries.\\" The Indian prime minister also insisted that \\"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\\" India is the world's largest democracy.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Let me begin again. I like life on the resort worlds -- always have and, after the upcoming mindwipe, always will. Last year, I rented a small house on Vega IV, a sea world, all islands and reefs and archipelagos, turquoise waters and aquamarine skies, sunrises like symphonies and sunsets like stars gone supernova. There's only one city: called Nuevo Acapulco in La Enciclopedia del Empirio de la Humanidad, it's N'apulco to the locals. The N'apulcans are mostly emigrants from Polaris II; the only difference between them and their Carribbean ancestors is that the ancestors fleeced NorAm tourists. Now the N'apulcans profit from their Hispanic siblings. I don't mean to sound cynical. I suppose I wish to show that I'm still capable of a certain authorial distance, a semblance of dispassionate observation. The following events may indicate otherwise. In fine tourist tradition, most homes on Vega IV are named. Mine was The Sleeping Flamingo, and its outer walls were coral pink. Were they mood-sensitive, they would have changed as I first viewed them. The rental agent, an attractive N'apulcan named Tasha Cortez, was not mood-sensitive either. She said, \\"It's beautiful, isn't it, Señor Flynn?\\" My instinct was to gesture curtly with a cupped hand that she lift the wind boat and take me elsewhere. But she was young and attractive (as I have said and may say again) and eager and so happy to be assisting the infamous Bernardo Flynn that I merely raised an eyebrow in mild scepticism.

This is because of the _____ friction of the smoother pool? (A) additional (B) reduced The answer to this question is:","completion":"The answer to this question is (B) reduced. In this scenario, the person experienced discomfort after being in a pool with a rough surface for a couple of days, while the smoother surface of the second pool was more comfortable on their feet. This implies that there is a difference in the level of friction between the two pool bottoms. Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of objects moving against each other. In this context, the friction in question is between the person's feet and the pool bottoms. A smooth pool bottom has less surface area in contact with the person's feet, resulting in reduced friction. Conversely, a coarse pool bottom increases the surface area in contact with the person's feet and generates more opportunities for interaction between the skin and the surface irregularities. This increased interaction generates more friction, which in turn can cause discomfort or even damage to the skin. Given the context that the person's feet felt better in the second pool with a smoother surface, it is logical to conclude that the reason behind this was the reduced friction in the smoother pool compared to the first one with a coarse bottom.

Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"Yes, this product review is undoubtedly negative. The reviewer has expressed dissatisfaction and shared several critical points concerning the product. To provide an in-depth analysis of the negative aspects mentioned in the review, let's break down the complaints step by step. 1. High pitched buzz: This issue might indicate a problem with the product's electrical components or a manufacturing defect. It can be annoying for the user and raises concerns about the product's quality and safety. 2. Intermittently stops providing power: Power fluctuations can severely affect the performance of the devices the product is intended to serve. In this case, the reviewer mentions that their computer experiences constant power switching between battery and wall power. Such instability could negatively impact the computer's performance, reduce the battery's lifespan, and even potentially damage the computer. Thus, the power supply's primary function – providing a stable power source – is not being fulfilled. 3. Difficult-to-wrap cord: A user-friendly design should ensure that cables are manageable and convenient to use. A cord that is difficult to wrap can be cumbersome and frustrating, making the overall experience of utilizing the product less enjoyable. The reviewer also expresses the desire to return the product through the warranty process, which suggests that they believe the issues they've encountered warrant customer support intervention. Additionally, they regret not spending more money to purchase a similar product from a different, possibly more reputable, brand (in this case, Apple). This further solidifies the reviewer's negative outlook on the product. In summary, the numerous problems highlighted by the reviewer, coupled with their dissatisfaction and preference for another brand, clearly demonstrate that this product review is negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the below context: Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation. Guess a valid title for it!

Which wavelengths would be longer, case A or case B? Hint: Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz respectively. IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light, but shorter than that of microwaves.

Given the question: Information: - Earl of Longford is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Ireland. - The Peerage of Ireland is a 19th century creation, and is different from the more ancient native Gaelic peerage used by Irish aristocracy from before the arrival of Christianity. The Gaelic system was disrupted by the English peerage in the early modern period by confiscations deemed illegal in Continental courts at the time. The latter system consists of those titles of nobility created by the English monarchs in their capacity as Lord or King of Ireland, or later by monarchs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The English ranks of the Irish peerage are Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount and Baron, whilst the Irish system uses Gaelic titles, in accordance with a genealogy of the Ard Rí (High King of Ireland) chronicled in numerous ancient manuscripts, including the Annals of the Four Masters. The Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland continues to exercise jurisdiction over its Peerage of Ireland, but not those peers whose titles derive from places located in what is now the Republic of Ireland. Importantly, Article 40.2 of the Irish Constitution forbids conference of titles of nobility by anyone but the Uatarán -- President of the Republic -- and a citizen may not accept titles of nobility or honour except with the prior approval of the Government. Gaelic titles of nobility, amongst the oldest in European history, remain the providence of individual clanna or families. Efforts are underway to accord these system with the laws of the Supreme Court of Ireland in friendly negotiation with English conventions and European law. - Thomas Pakenham , 2nd Earl of Longford KP ( 14 May 1774 -- 28 May 1835 ) , known as The Lord Longford between 1792 and 1794 , was an Anglo - Irish peer .

(Associated Press) RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The city of Norfolk has agreed to pay 4.9 million to four former sailors who were wrongly convicted of a woman's rape and murder based on intimidating police interrogations. A copy of the settlement agreement for the \\"Norfolk Four\\" was obtained by The Associated Press. The state also has agreed to pay 3.5 million. The payments close out a decades-long case that drew widespread attention as the men's innocence claims were backed by dozens of former FBI agents, ex-prosecutors and crime novelist John Grisham. \\"These guys can now put all this behind them and try to recoup their lives,\\" said Tony Troy, a lawyer who represented one of the sailors. The men — Eric Wilson, Danial Williams, Joseph Dick and Derek Tice — were pardoned by then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe last year of the 1997 rape and murder of Michelle Moore-Bosko. Moore-Bosko's husband found her stabbed and strangled body in their apartment in July of that year after returning from a week at sea. Williams, who lived in the same building, was quickly identified as a suspect because a neighbor told police he had a crush on the victim. Williams admitted to her rape and murder — the first of a series of confessions that the men, then-sailors at the Naval base in Norfolk, say were forced by police. DNA evidence matched only one person: Omar Ballard, the fifth man convicted in the case. Ballard, who pleaded guilty in 2000, acknowledged he was solely responsible and is serving a life sentence. The Norfolk Four have said they cracked after they were threatened with the death penalty and repeatedly called liars. One of the men recalled a detective shoving him into a corner and showing him a picture of Moore-Bosko's bloody body. The confessions conflicted with one another. Ballard's account was the only one containing information matching the crime scene. The detective who questioned them, Robert Glenn Ford, was convicted in 2011 of extortion and lying to the FBI in unrelated cases. In vacating some of the Norfolk Four's convictions, a federal judge once declared that \\"no sane human being\\" could find them guilty. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam approved legislation earlier this year that gives the men 3.5 million in state funds contingent on them resolving claims against the city. Sen. Scott Surovell, a sponsor the legislation, said he was pleased that the city agreed to settle rather than fight the men. \\"Justice was long overdue for these four, what happened to them was outrageous and undermines faith in our criminal justice system,\\" he said. \\"Hopefully this settlement will help ensure this never happens again.\\" The settlement with the city was finalized a month ago but had not been previously made public. A city spokeswoman referred questions to the City Attorney Bernard Pishko, who did not immediately return requests for comment. The false convictions took a heavy toll on the four men, including lengthy prison terms and years as registered sex offenders. Wilson, who was wrongly convicted of rape, said it took an attorney and 10,000 to persuade a board to grant him an electrician's license and that he was blocked from working on certain properties, such as schools, and barred from city parks. He also said his son was run out of his Cub Scout troop because other parents didn't want Wilson around.

For everyone who expects a traditional superhero-movie it might be an unpleasant surprise. It is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie. It focuses mainly on emotions and it's a bit like a Greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow. That's because Sasha, like each superhero, takes the law into his own hands and the society doesn't appreciate it. Sasha becomes an outlaw. While on the run, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him. As you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics. It reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by Ram Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. However, when there's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what's going on, it's all over. But the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action. What is more important here is the outcome of Sasha's actions, which are mostly very drastic. The score is very scarce, which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film. So basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it. Is the film worth it? That is a question really difficult to answer. I don't think that this experience enriched me so very much, but somehow I keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again. Mostly due to the atmosphere, which is really dense, but not suffocating because all the time Sasha and Katya have hope. After all they're young people, who have all their lives to live. So no matter how hard it gets there's always a slight joyous tune when they are together. Choose your answer. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?

Question: Process: - Blood carried into kidney by the renal artery - Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood - The waste that is filtered out mixes with water - Become urine - Ureters carry urine out of the kidneys. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose low water levels in the body happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of low water levels in the body can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of waste removal through the kidneys. Direct effect: The primary function of the kidneys is to filter out waste products from the blood and maintain proper electrolyte balance by regulating the reabsorption of water. The filtration process relies on a delicate balance of pressure and water content in the blood. When the body experiences low water levels, or dehydration, blood volume decreases, leading to a decrease in blood pressure. This reduction in blood volume and pressure can decrease the rate and efficiency of filtration in the nephrons, potentially resulting in less waste being removed from the body. Additionally, the concentration of waste in the kidneys may increase because of the reduced availability of water for urine formation. This may lead to more waste being reabsorbed into the bloodstream and generate a negative feedback loop, further exacerbating the situation. Indirect effect: Low water levels in the body can also have secondary effects on the kidneys and waste removal. For instance, dehydration can lead to hormonal changes that cause vasoconstriction in the renal arteries, reducing blood flow to the kidneys and affecting filtration efficiency. The body may also increase the production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and aldosterone, promoting water reabsorption back into the bloodstream and decreasing the overall amount of urine produced. As a result, less waste is removed from the body in smaller volumes of highly concentrated urine. In summary, low water levels in the body can impact waste removal from the body both directly through the decreased efficiency of the filtration process as well as indirectly through hormonal changes that promote water reabsorption and reduced urine production. Maintaining proper hydration is essential for kidney function and overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

There were intricate designs around the base of the sweatshirt, depicting a magical forest scene. Earl hoped this would remind Emma of the adventures they shared together exploring their nearby woods. Earl could hardly contain his excitement as he headed home. He imagined Emma's face lighting up when she saw the sweatshirt and how eagerly she would put it on. As he neared their modest house, he spotted Emma playing outside.

What is it?\\" She inquired, practically bouncing with curiosity. Earl grinned, holding the sweatshirt behind his back. \\"Close your eyes and hold out your hands,\\" he instructed, already anticipating Emma's reaction. Emma complied with her father's request eagerly, her small hands trembling with anticipation as she shut her eyes tight. With a flourish, Earl presented the royal blue sweatshirt to his daughter. Emma's eyes flew open, and the moment she saw the shirt, her face broke into a beaming smile. She marveled at the magical forest design, her fingers dancing along the intricately embroidered branches and animals woven into the fabric. \\"Oh, Dad! It's beautiful!\\" Emma gushed, wrapping her arms around Earl's waist in a warm hug. \\"Thank you so much!\\" Overwhelmed with happiness, Emma couldn't help but snuggle into her father, feeling both loved and protected. \\"You're welcome, sweetheart,\\" Earl murmured, his heart swelling with joy at the sight of his daughter's happiness. \\"I knew you'd love it. Now, why don't you try it on and show me how it looks?\\" Eager to wear her new sweatshirt, Emma quickly pulled it over her head. The vibrant royal blue color brought out the brightness in her eyes, instantly making her appear even more radiant. The fit was perfect, and the intricate forest design seemed to come alive as it shimmered under the sunlight, thanks to Emma's cheerful energy. Seeing his daughter's beaming face and the way the sweatshirt fit her so well, Earl felt a sense of fatherly pride. He knew he had succeeded in finding the perfect surprise for Emma.

The embroidered forest design seemed to come to life, reflecting the wonder and magic of the woodland scenery. Together, Earl and Emma filled the woods with laughter and contentment as they explored the terrain, the bond between a father and his daughter growing even stronger. Earl felt grateful for the simple yet meaningful gift of the sweatshirt, which would now serve as a symbol of their love, and the cherished memories they shared within the enchanting forest around them.

Examples of such games include tug-of-war, jump rope, or even as a makeshift limbo stick. 2. Learning a skill: The children could be learning various skills involving the use of a rope, such as knot-tying or rope climbing during physical education classes or scouting activities. 3. Safety and guidance: The rope could be serving as a safety line or guiding device for the children to hold onto while walking or navigating through a location, such as a field trip or nature hike. 4. Team-building activity: Holding a rope may be part of a team-building exercise where the children are encouraged to work together to achieve a common goal, such as navigating an obstacle course or crossing a bridge. 5. Artistic or creative purposes: The rope might be used as a prop in a theatrical performance, dance, or artistic display, or even as part of a decoration or stage set-up.

In 1905, the Qing sent Zhao Erfeng to Tibet to retaliate against rebellions. By 1908, Zhao was appointed imperial resident in Lhasa. Zhao was beheaded in December 1911 by pro-Republican forces. The bulk of the area that was historically known as Kham was now claimed to be the Xikang Administrative District, created by the Republican revolutionaries. By the end of 1912, the last Manchu troops were forced out of Tibet through India. Thubten Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama, returned to Tibet in January 1913 from Sikkim, where he had been residing. When the new ROC government apologised for the actions of the Qing and offered to restore the Dalai Lama to his former position, he replied that he was not interested in Chinese ranks, that Tibet had never been subordinated to China, that Tibet was an independent country, and that he was assuming the spiritual and political leadership of Tibet. Because of this, many have read this reply as a formal declaration of independence. The Chinese side ignored the response, and Tibet had thirty years free of interference from China.

Write a text based on this summary: german employment hits record high since reunification Text:","completion":"Step 1: Research key facts and figures about German employment and its record high Justification: To write about the topic accurately, it's important to be aware of the relevant data, such as the role of unemployment rates, industry growth and government policies contributing to the record high employment. Germany has recently made headlines for achieving its highest employment level since the country's reunification in 1990. A significant milestone for the German economy, this record high is a testament to the country's impressive growth and resilience amidst global economic challenges. Step 2: Mention the specific figures related to employment Justification: By providing exact figures, the text presents a clearer picture of the economy and the impact of its success. According to the Federal Statistical Office, the number of employed individuals in Germany reached 45.5 million at the end of 2021, with the employment rate at an all-time high of 76.8%. This impressive growth over the years has helped to significantly reduce unemployment rates, with the current figure at a record low of 3.5%. Step 3: Discuss the factors contributing to the record high employment Justification: By addressing the key driving forces, the text offers insights into the reasons behind Germany's economic success and the contributing factors. There are several factors that have contributed to this positive trend in German employment. First, the federal government’s commitment to promoting pro-business policies and investment in infrastructure projects has played a significant role in supporting job creation. This has spurred growth across key industries such as manufacturing, automotive, and renewable energy. Second, Germany's robust and well-regulated vocational education system has contributed significantly to the country's highly-qualified workforce. Leveraging the strengths of this successful education model, young Germans are afforded ample opportunities to enter the workforce with the necessary skills and training. Step 4: Discuss challenges and opportunities for the future of German employment Justification: This provides a well-rounded perspective on the topic and encourages readers to consider the potential impacts of ongoing economic developments. Despite these positive trends in the German labor market, the country still faces challenges that could hinder the continuation of record high employment. Factors such as the impact of renewed COVID-19 outbreaks, demographic changes, and increasing automation could potentially affect Germany's employment landscape in the coming years. However, Germany's strong economic foundation and proven capacity for adaptation present opportunities for continued success in employment. By focusing on innovation, investment in new technologies, and supporting industries with high growth potential, Germany has the potential to maintain its position as a global economic powerhouse. In conclusion, Germany's record high employment since reunification is an impressive reflection of the country's economic growth and resilience. Its success can be attributed to a combination of proactive government policies, a robust education system, and strong growth across key industries. As the nation tackles ongoing challenges and explores opportunities for further growth, its efforts will continue to create a brighter future for the German workforce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Greta: Senate Majority Leader Reid spends too much time at the podium with 'Woe is me' stuff, does not lead\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Greta: Senate Majority Leader Reid spends too much time at the podium with 'Woe is me' stuff, does not lead Introduction: As the political dynamics in the United States continue to evolve, lawmakers have a plethora of responsibilities; they must legislate, prioritize constituents' needs, and stay on course with party platforms. However, critics argue that some prominent political figures, such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, appear to be falling short in the leadership department. Fox News host Greta Van Susteren recently weighed in, accusing Reid of spending too much time at the podium expressing self-pity and failing to guide his fellow senators effectively. Step 1: Identify Reid's supposed shortcomings; Van Susteren, an experienced legal analyst and journalist, has claimed that Reid tends to focus on sympathy-seeking statements, often characterized by a \\"woe is me\\" attitude. This, she argues, detracts from Reid's ability to provide strong leadership and facilitate progress. Some examples of his shortcomings include: - The inability to galvanize Democratic senators and create unity on crucial issues. - The failure to effectively communicate with Republicans, resulting in the stagnation of bipartisan cooperation. - Prolonged time spent on the Senate floor, lamenting and venting frustrations rather than driving constructive change. Step 2: Analyze why this is problematic for the Senate; Reid's perceived lack of leadership may have significant consequences in the Senate, mainly because: - The Senate relies on strong guiding forces to ensure that legislative processes run smoothly. - A majority leader who spends too much time airing grievances can create an environment of negativity, potentially demotivating fellow senators in pursuit of change. - Less effective communication between parties can result in a stalemate, slowing down the passage of much-needed legislation. Step 3: Offer potential solutions to improve Reid's leadership approach; For Harry Reid to strengthen the perception of his leadership, he should consider doing the following: - Focus on positivity and proactive problem-solving, turning his attention toward solutions rather than dwelling on difficulties. - Seek common ground with Republicans to foster a more collaborative atmosphere that prioritizes bipartisan cooperation. - Delegate tasks effectively and refrain from dominating the Senate floor, enabling other senators to contribute and showcase their abilities. Conclusion: While Greta Van Susteren's perspective offers a stern critique of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's leadership abilities, it provides an opportunity for reflection and improvement. By embracing suggestions like focusing on solutions, embracing bipartisan discussions, and empowering fellow senators, Reid can transform his public image and step up as a strong guiding force in the Senate. Ultimately, adept leadership will not only better serve Reid's political party but will also be a testament to the United States' unwavering pursuit of progress and unity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sinhalese cuisine is one of the most complex cuisines of South Asia. Due to its proximity to South India, Sinhalese cuisine shows some influence, yet is in many ways quite distinct. As a major trade hub, it draws influence from colonial powers that were involved in Sri Lanka and by foreign traders. Rice, which is consumed daily, can be found at any occasion, while spicy curries are favourite dishes for lunch and dinner. Some of the Sri Lankan dishes have striking resemblance to Kerala cuisine, which could be due to the similar geographic and agricultural features with Kerala. A well-known rice dish with Sinhalese is Kiribath, meaning \\"Milk Rice.\\" In addition to sambols, Sinhalese eat \\"Mallung\\"- chopped leaves mixed with grated coconut and red onions. Coconut milk is found in most Sri Lankan dishes to give the cuisine its unique flavour. Sri Lanka has long been renowned for its spices. The best known is cinnamon which is native to Sri Lanka. In the 15th and 16th centuries, spice and ivory traders from all over the world who came to Sri Lanka brought their native cuisines to the island, resulting in a rich diversity of cooking styles and techniques. Lamprais rice boiled in stock with a special curry, accompanied by frikkadels (meatballs), all of which is then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked as a Dutch-influenced Sri Lankan dish. Dutch and Portuguese sweets also continue to be popular. British influences include roast beef and roast chicken. Also, the influence of the Indian cooking methods and food have played a major role in what Sri Lankans eat. The island nation's cuisine mainly consists of boiled or steamed rice served with curry. This usually consists of a \\"main curry\\" of fish or chicken, as well as several other curries made with vegetables, lentils and even fruit curries. Side-dishes include pickles, chutneys and \\"sambols\\". The most famous of these is the coconut sambol, made of ground coconut mixed with chili peppers, dried Maldive fish and lime juice.

Given the fact that: The more rope segments on a pully that are helping to do the lifting work, the less force that is needed for the job. Answer the question: Would it require more strength for a construction worker to move a heavy load of bricks with a pulley that used 1 rope segment? or 10 rope segments?","completion":"It would require more strength for a construction worker to move a heavy load of bricks with a pulley that used 1 rope segment as compared to a pulley with 10 rope segments. Allow me to elaborate on the reasons behind this statement. A pulley system allows for mechanical advantage which reduces the amount of force required to lift or move an object. The mechanical advantage can be determined by the number of rope segments supporting the load. In general, more rope segments equate to a higher mechanical advantage and therefore less required force. In the case of a single (1) rope segment, the construction worker would need to exert a force equal to the weight of the load that they are lifting. This is because there is no mechanical advantage in the system. The worker is essentially applying force directly to the load, making it much harder to lift or move without assistance. On the other hand, a pulley system with 10 rope segments would offer a significant mechanical advantage. This means that the force required to lift or move the load would be divided by the number of rope segments, in this case, 10. In other words, the construction worker would only need to exert one-tenth of the total force required as compared to the system with only 1 rope segment. The following example further illustrates this point: Assume that the total weight of the bricks to be moved is 1000 pounds. With a single rope segment, the construction worker must apply the full 1000 pounds of force to lift the load. However, when using a pulley system with 10 rope segments, the force required to lift the same load would be only 100 pounds (1000/10). This significant reduction in force requirement makes using more rope segments an attractive option for those looking to move heavy loads with reduced effort. Using a pulley system with more rope segments not only minimizes the amount of strength needed but also decreases the risk of injury and fatigue for the construction worker. In conclusion, it would require more strength for a construction worker to move a heavy load of bricks with a pulley that used 1 rope segment compared to a pulley system with 10 rope segments. The use of more rope segments in the pulley system greatly reduces the force needed to lift or move the load, providing a higher mechanical advantage and improving overall efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She is in love with the woodcutter Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), but her parents Cesaire (Billy Burke) and Suzette (Virginia Madsen) have promised wealthy blacksmith Adrian Lazar (Michael Shanks) that Valerie will marry his son Henry (Max Irons) hoping Valerie will marry into wealth so she and they can live off Lazar's money.Valerie plans to run away with Peter, but their plans are put on hold when the town sirens erupt, telling the couple that the werewolf who terrorizes their village has struck again. On closer inspection of the victim (found among a field of haystacks), it is found to be Lucy, Valerie's older sister. The townspeople offer a monthly sacrifice to the beast and stay away from the woods but Lucy ventured there after discovering that Valerie had been promised in engagement to Henry, whom Lucy loved.Adrian, Henry, Peter, Cesaire, and the other men venture out into the woods to a mountain cave hunt the Wolf. Against Henry's protest, the group splits into two groups and Henry and his father are attacked. The others manage to behead the wolf, but it kills Adrian in the process. The men bring back the head of a common gray wolf, thinking it is the one that has been terrorizing the village.Valerie sees Suzette crying over Adrian's body and confronts her. Suzette admits that she and Adrian once had an affair and that Lucy is actually his daughter as well as Henry's half-sister. This is the reason why she could not be offered to him. Valerie also learns that Cesaire is seemingly unaware of this.The townspeople decide to celebrate the death of the wolf, but their preparations are interrupted by the arrival of famous witch hunter Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), who reveals that the townspeople did not slaughter the real Wolf because it would have changed back into its human form if they did.

Answer the following question: A higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. A sound wave that has more frequency will have more or less energy? Answer:","completion":"A sound wave with a higher frequency will have more energy than a sound wave with a lower frequency, if they both have the same amplitude. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. The energy of a wave is directly proportional to both its frequency and amplitude. This is supported by the physics principle which states that the energy of a wave is determined by its frequency and amplitude. 2. Based on this principle, if a wave has a higher frequency but the same amplitude as another wave, it will naturally have more energy because of the direct proportionality between energy and frequency. 3. In the context of sound waves, they follow the same physics principles as other types of waves. Therefore, the energy of a sound wave will also depend on its frequency and amplitude. 4. If we compare two sound waves with the same amplitude but different frequencies, it is evident that the sound wave with the higher frequency will have more energy due to the direct relationship between energy and frequency. So, the answer is: A sound wave that has more frequency will have more energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The term 'communion' comes from the idea of sharing or partaking in something significant and profound.\\" She paused, looking thoughtful as she continued, \\"We believe that in this world, there are forces greater than ourselves that influence our lives. These forces are present in our surroundings, the air, the sun, the moon, and especially in the creatures that inhabit our land. The flying creatures that you see outside our window, we call them the 'little holy ones' because we see them as messengers of the divine. They carry the spirit of the sacred in their wings and in their songs.\\" Noticing my fascination, the woman continued, \\"The full moon of spring is a unique time of the year for us. When the moon is full, it stands as a symbol of wholeness, unity, and abundance. Spring, on the other hand, represents new beginnings, renewal, and growth. So when the full moon occurs during spring, it marks a highly auspicious occasion. That's why we hold our communion on these three nights; we wish to partake in the combined essence of unity and new beginnings.\\" \\"We prepare for this communion weeks in advance,\\" the woman explained. \\"The community comes together to clean and adorn our sacred spaces, gather offerings, and practice the rituals we've inherited from our ancestors. On each night of the communion, we gather under the moonlit sky, and the ceremony begins with singing, dancing, and storytelling. There is an air of joy and harmony during this time, as we connect with each other and honor the divine forces in our lives.\\" \\"At the peak of the ceremony, the little holy ones descend from the cliffs, attracted by the vibrations of our voices and the energy of the communion. Their presence signifies the approval and blessings of the divine. As they fly among us, we reach out and touch their feathers, allowing their sacred energy to flow through us, rejuvenating our spirits, and reminding us of our interconnectedness with the world and one another.\\" \\"The communion fosters a deep sense of community, gratitude, and love. When the ceremony ends, we carry that feeling with us in everything we do. Once a year may seem infrequent, but the impact of the communion is so profound that it sustains us throughout the year. It reminds us of our place in the world, our purpose, and the significance of our connection with one another and with the divine.\\" The woman smiled gently, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and awe at her words. The communion seemed like a beautiful and meaningful tradition that brought people together and reinforced their bonds. It's a celebration of life, nature, and the extraordinary forces that shape our existence – something that undoubtedly transcends time and space, binding us all in an eternal dance of unity and love."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He disappointed cattleman Walt Garnet by not going into that business. Walt's beautiful daughter Linda returns to town after a long absence and Ben still carries a torch for her, but she's now involved with another man, Harry Odell. The cattle business is in trouble. Beef prices have dropped so low, cattle companies are being urged to sell their stock to a rendering plant. Ben tries to intervene, and eventually learns that banker Parker is colluding with Odell and the plant's owner, Sledge, to gain control of the ranchers' valuable land. Melba Sykes and her father Tim are squatting on Walt's ranch. It turns out that Odell is not only hiding his business schemes from Linda but also the fact that he's been romancing Melba behind her back. Tim Sykes is killed, and when Sledge produces a bill of sale from the man, Ben knows it's been forged because Tim did not know how to write. Melba boasts to Linda that her lover Odell will look out for her interest now. Linda realizes she's been betrayed and turns to Ben for solace and advice. Melba becomes furious when Odell breaks off their relationship and snaps a bullwhip at him.

The signals are loud and clear: seed and late stage valuations are getting frothy and wacky, and hiring talent in Silicon Valley is the toughest it has been since the dot.com bubble. The rules for making money are different in a bubble than in normal times. What are they, how do they differ and what can a startup do to take advantage of them? First, to understand where we're going, it's important to know where we've been. Below is a quick history of the four waves of startup investing (Click here for slides). The Golden Age (1970 - 1995) VC's worked with entrepreneurs to build profitable and scalable businesses, with increasing revenue and consistent profitability -- quarter after quarter for at least five quarters. They taught you about customers, markets and profits. The reward for doing so was a liquidity event via an Initial Public Offering. Startups needed millions of dollars of funding just to get their first product out the door to customers. Software companies had to buy specialized computers and license expensive software. A hardware startup had to equip a factory to manufacture the product. Startups built every possible feature the founding team envisioned (using \\"Waterfall development,\\") into a monolithic \\"release\\" of the product taking months or years to build a first product release. The Business Plan (Concept-Alpha-Beta-FCS) became the playbook for startups. There was no repeatable methodology, startups and their VC's still operated like startups were simply a smaller version of a large company. The world of building profitable startups ended in 1995. The Dot.Com Bubble (August, 1995 - March, 2000) With Netscape's IPO, there was suddenly a public market for companies with limited revenue and no profit. Underwriters realized that as long as the public was happy snapping up shares, they could make huge profits from the inflated valuations. Thus began the 5-year dot-com bubble. For VC's and entrepreneurs the gold rush to liquidity was on. The old rules of sustainable revenue and consistent profitability went out the window. VC's engineered financial transactions, working with entrepreneurs to brand, hype and take public unprofitable companies with grand promises for the future. The goals were \\"first-mover advantage,\\" \\"grab market share\\" and \\"get big fast.\\" Like all bubbles, this was a game of musical chairs, where the last one standing looked dumb and everyone else got absurdly rich. Startups still required millions of dollars of funding. But the bubble mantra of get \\"big fast\\" and \\"first-mover advantage\\" demanded tens of millions more to create a \\"brand.\\" The goal was to get your firm public as soon as possible using whatever it took because the sooner you got your billion-dollar market cap, the sooner the VC firm could sell their shares and distribute their profits. Just like the previous 25 years, startups still built every possible feature the founding team envisioned into a monolithic \\"release\\" of the product using \\"Waterfall development.\\" But in the bubble, startups got creative and shortened the time needed to get a product to the customer by releasing \\"beta's\\" (buggy products still needing testing) and having the customers act as their Quality Assurance group. The IPO offering document became the playbook for startups. With the bubble mantra of \\"get big fast,\\" the repeatable methodology became \\"brand, hype, flip or IPO.\\" Back to Basics: The Lean Startup (2000-2010) After the dot.com bubble collapsed, venture investors spent the next three years doing triage, sorting through the rubble to find companies that weren't bleeding cash and could actually be turned into businesses. Tech IPOs were a receding memory, and mergers and acquisitions became the only path to liquidity for startups. VC's went back to basics, to focus on building companies while their founders worked on building customers. Over time, open source software fueled the rise of the next wave of web startups and the embrace of Agile Engineering meant that startups no longer needed millions of dollars to buy specialized computers and license expensive software -- they could start a company on their credit cards. Customer Development, Agile Engineering and the Lean Methodology enforced a process of incremental and iterative development. Startups could now get a first version of a product out to customers in weeks/months rather than months/years. Startups began to recognize that they weren't merely a smaller version of a large company. Rather, they understood that a startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model. This meant that startups needed their own tools, techniques and methodologies distinct from those used in large companies. The concepts of Minimum Viable Product and the Pivot entered the lexicon along with Customer Discovery and Validation. The New Bubble: 2011-2014 Signs of a new bubble have been appearing over the last year -- seed and late stage valuations are rapidly inflating, hiring talent in Silicon Valley is the toughest since the last bubble and investors are starting to openly wonder how this one will end. Breathtaking Scale The bubble is being driven by market forces on a scale never seen in the history of commerce. For the first time, startups can today think about a Total Available Market in the billions of users (smart phones, tablets, PC's, etc.) and aim for hundreds of millions of customers. And those customers may be using their devices/apps continuously. The revenue, profits and speed of scale of the winning companies can be breathtaking. The New Exits Rules for building a company in 2011 are different than they were in 2008 or 1998. Startup exits in the next three years will include IPO's as well as acquisitions. And unlike the last bubble, this bubble's first wave of IPO's will be companies showing \\"real\\" revenue, profits and customers in massive numbers. (Think Facebook, Zynga, Twitter, LinkedIn, Groupon, etc.) But like all bubbles, these initial IPO's will attract companies with less stellar financials, the quality IPO pipeline will diminish rapidly, and the bubble will pop. At the same time, acquisition opportunities will expand as large existing companies, unable to keep up with the pace of innovation in these emerging Internet markets, \\"innovate\\" by buying startups. Finally, new forms of liquidity are emerging such as private-market stock exchanges for buying and selling illiquid assets (i.e. SecondMarket, SharesPost, etc.) 3 Rules in the New Bubble Today's startups have all the tools needed for a short development cycle and rapid customer adoption: Agile and Customer Development plus Business Model Design. The Four Steps to the Epiphany, Business Model Generation and the Lean Startup movement have become the playbook for startups. The payoff: in this bubble, a startup can actively \\"engineer for an acquisition.\\" Here's how: 1. Order of Battle Each market has a finite number of acquirers, and a finite number of deal makers, each looking to fill specific product/market holes. So determining who specifically to target and talk to is not an incalculable problem. For a specific startup, this list is probably a few hundred names. 2. Wide Adoption First, Revenue Later Startups that win in the bubble will be those that get wide adoption (using freemium, viral growth, low costs, etc.) and massive distribution (i.e. Facebook, Android/Apple App store.) They will focus on getting massive user bases first, and let the revenue follow later. 3. Visibility During the the Lean Startup era, the advice was clear: focus on building the company and avoid hype. Now that advice has changed. Like every bubble, this is a game of musical chairs. While you still need to focus on customers for your product, you and your company now need to be everywhere and look larger than life. Show and talk at conferences, be on lots of blogs, use social networks and build a brand. In the new bubble, PR may be your new best friend, so invest in it. Lessons Learned We're in a new wave of startup investing - it's the beginning of another bubble Rules for liquidity for startups and investors are different in bubbles Pay attention to what those rules are and how to play by them Unlike the last bubble, this one is not about selling \\"vision\\" or concepts You have to deliver. That requires building a company using Agile Engineering and Customer Development Startups that master speed, tempo and pivot cycle time will win Follow Steve Blank on Twitter: www.twitter.com/sgblank ||||| By · · · It’s apparently that time again — the Valley has gone on tilt.

Investors got it badly wrong when they pushed Internet stocks to nose-bleed levels in 2000, only to lose billions when the companies mostly went bust. It's 2011, and here we go again. There may not be sock puppets and Super Bowl commercials, as in the last Internet boom, but signs throughout Silicon Valley are starting to show eerie similarities to the dot-com bust. Now, some are wondering if a bubble is forming around a new breed of Internet companies even before they reach the stock market. Though not at the 2000 fever pitch, things are moving in that direction as small sets of investors are seemingly willing to pay any price for promising Web start-ups. Consider the: Huge price tags placed on companies.Facebook is being valued at 75 billion, based on private transactions from the SharesPost market, which would make the social-media upstart more valuable than Disney. Rush to go public. Several tech initial public offerings are expected in the next 12 months, including online gaming site Zynga, business contact site LinkedIn, Internet radio station Pandora and online phone-call company Skype. And it's not just Web media properties with IPO fever. Some tech hardware companies also plan to go public. Freescale Semiconductor, a former unit of Motorola and maker of semiconductors, filed for an IPO in mid-February. Massive takeover bids by Internet giants. Even big companies are said to be drinking the Internet Kool-Aid. There is speculation that Google and Facebook have considered bidding as much as 10 billion for online microblogging service Twitter. Online coupon site Groupon spurned a 6 billion buyout offer from Google, according to published reports. The public's current infatuation with tech has been a long time coming. Tech and Internet stocks turned into bad words after the dot-com bust in 2000. But the get-rich-quick feelings toward tech are back. Those 48 tech IPOs represented 28% of the total number of deals. It's hard to blame tech CEOs for rushing the IPO window. Investors can't seem to get enough. The stock prices of those tech IPOs, on average, jumped 19% on their first day of trading — the strongest reception for any industry, Renaissance Capital says. But, first, a cautionary word... Given the near-hysteria about promising but largely unproven companies, investment professionals warn that things could start getting out of hand. Much of the excitement and the astounding price tags on companies are products of a relatively new corner of the markets in which most investors can't participate . Private marketplaces, including SecondMarket and SharesPost, allow owners of shares of private companies such as Digg, Facebook, Zynga and Twitter to sell to high-net-worth individuals and institutions. Typically, the sellers are employees at these firms looking to cash in on shares they've received. And the buyers are sophisticated investors who understand they could lose their entire investment. These online services provide a way for employees to sell their shares now rather than waiting for an IPO that may never occur. However, with the great power that such marketplaces offer comes confusion. Many of the valuations put on companies are overinflated based on limited sales of shares occurring on the relatively small markets. For instance, if one employee sells a few shares of a company at a seemingly high price, some observers might infer that all the company's shares would sell at that same price. Multiplying the price fetched in one sale by the company's total number of shares can produce a high market value for the company. However, the fact is these private marketplaces conduct such a small sliver of the trading volume on the exchanges that prices for transactions can be extremely volatile. A good one-day sale of stock could greatly inflate the market value of a company temporarily. \\"It's like the baseball player who goes 2-for-3 in a game, and an announcer jokingly says the player is on pace to hit .667 for the season,\\" says Phil Sanderson, managing partner at IDG Ventures. Before long, estimates for the value of popular Internet companies can soar. Consider Twitter. In December, The New York Times reported the company was valued at 3.7 billion after a funding round. Now, it's pegged at about 7.2 billion, according to SharesPost. Further fueling the speculation are largely unsubstantiated rumors that big Internet companies are on the prowl for acquisitions. Last month, Twitter CEO Dick Costolo scoffed at Twitter acquisition rumors, the driver behind the 10 billion value estimate, during a speech at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Twitter co-founder Biz Stone is more blunt. In an interview last month, he said the 10 billion figure was \\"made up\\" in a published report by The Wall Street Journal. \\"Twitter is not for sale,\\" Stone says. \\"I have no idea where it came from. We have never specifically mentioned numbers.\\" Private marketplaces, in part, have influenced the sky-high valuations, Stone says. \\"Someone buys 100 shares, and then someone comes up with head-spinning, outrageous figures,\\" Stone says. \\"We're very, very interested in building an independent company.\\" What's the real value? Until companies finally go public and the stocks actively trade on major exchanges, the small and relatively thin trading on private markets sets the price. The problem for these companies and their investors, especially in the trendy Internet industry, is that valuations can quickly go up in smoke if anything doesn't go just right. Some Internet companies appear to be stranded as private companies, dashing some investors' hopes of cashing in on a splashy IPO. Just because a company files plans for an IPO doesn't mean it will actually happen. Widely watched video game rental service GameFly, a sort of Netflix for video games, filed for a 50 million IPO on Feb. 10, 2010. However, more than a year later, the deal is still stuck in the pipeline. Given such huge risks, the level of the public's infatuation with shares of privately held Internet companies is again taking on a feel of a mania, says Gary Freedman, securities lawyer with Ervin Cohen & Jessup. Several ingredients that inflate bubbles are all present, including a broad acceptance of the companies' products. Also intensifying the distortion is the fact that there's very little financial information on these private companies, he says. \\"It's the same mania,\\" Freedman says. \\"Markets are cyclical. It's really no different than looking at the Internet bust and the housing market.\\" The marketplaces are designed to prevent running afoul of securities laws by only attracting investors who are deemed to be \\"accredited,\\" Freedman says. To be accredited, investors must meet a number of criteria presented in securities law, including a net worth of 1 million or more or an annual income of 200,000 in each of the past two years. Even so, industry observers expect regulators to take a closer look at the marketplaces, to determine if old rules are still appropriate, as they play a greater role in capital markets. But proponents of the next breed of Internet companies say the valuations aren't absurd this time because the companies have fundamentals behind them. \\"We're talking about real companies with real revenue and real profit,\\" says Jeremy Smith of SecondMarket. \\"It's a boom, not a bubble, when you hear the sound of dynamite profits,\\" says Bing Gordon, a partner at venture-capital giant Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. and board member of social-gaming company Zynga, valued at 9 billion. \\"There is effervescence, but no bubble,\\" says Geoff Yang, a founding partner of Redpoint Ventures. History not repeating itself? A major shift in technology is bound to create companies with massive market values, the proponents say. The emergence of social media (more than 500 million accounts on Facebook alone), combined with mobile phone use (4.5 billion), is disrupting all of technology, so giant winners are to be expected, say venture-capitalists such as Cohler and Yang. \\"Back (in the late 1990s), we built the best company we could with 75 million users and limited technology,\\" says Marc Andreessen, a Facebook board member and early investor in Zynga whose company, Netscape Communications, saw its stock price soar to 75 a share in its first day of trading in August 1995. \\"Now, the social-mobile Internet is so much bigger.\\" \\"I think this boom is going to last awhile,\\" says Ted Schlein, a managing partner at KPCB. \\"The trend lines are unlike anything we've seen in history.\\" He says the enormous size of the social and mobile Internet market — tens of billions of people — dwarfs the markets for the fledgling Internet (billions) and personal computers (hundreds of millions), putting companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Zynga in prime position to strike it rich in IPOs. Facebook has about 2 billion in annual revenue. Groupon topped 760 million in sales last year. Pandora's revenue of 90 million for first nine months of 2010 has helped make it profitable. \\"This is just the beginning of a big market run,\\" says Tim Draper, founder of venture-capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson.

Kitchen Creek flows through the park's three glens, which the descriptions of the waterfalls are organized by: Ricketts Glen, Glen Leigh, and Ganoga Glen. The falls are listed in order going upstream along Kitchen Creek, starting with the southernmost and ending at the northernmost in each glen. This is also the order in which a hiker would encounter the falls while traveling north along the creek on the Falls Trail.The Falls Trail is a 7.1-mile (11.4 km) loop hike. Starting at PA 118, it is 1.8 miles (2.9 km) north along the creek through Ricketts Glen to Waters Meet, where the trail divides. Following the Glen Leigh branch, it is 1.2 miles (1.9 km) north through the glen to the Highland Trail, then 1.0 mile (1.6 km) west along the Highland Trail to Ganoga Glen. Turning southeast, it is 1.3 miles (2.1 km) through Ganoga Glen back to Waters Meet, then the 1.8 miles (2.9 km) through Ricketts Glen is retraced, but heading south back to PA 118.The description of each waterfall starts with the name. While the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) Bureau of State Parks names 22 waterfalls in Ricketts Glen State Park (all but Kitchen Creek and Shingle Cabin), the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) names 23 (all but Shingle Cabin), and Scott E.

The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\"). Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the third greatest in the show's history.

I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items.

Article: Passenger pigeons once flew over much of the United States in unbelievable numbers. Written accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries described flocks so large that they darkened the sky for hours. It was calculated that when its population reached its highest point, there were more than 3 billion passenger pigeons--a number equal to 24 to 40 percent of the total bird population in the United States, making it perhaps the most abundant bird in the world. Even as late as 1870 when their numbers had already become smaller, a flock believed to be 1 mile wide and 320 miles (about 515 kilometers) long was seen near Cincinnati. Sadly, the abundance of passenger pigeons may have been their _ . Where the birds were most abundant, people believed there was an ever-lasting supply and killed them by the thousands. Commercial hunters attracted them to small clearings with grain, waited until pigeons had settled to feed, then threw large nets over them, taking hundreds at a time. The birds were shipped to large cities and sold in restaurants. By the closing decades of the 19th century, the hardwood forests where passenger pigeons nested had been damaged by Americans' need for wood, which scattered the flocks and forced the birds to go farther north, where cold temperatures and spring storms contributed to their decline. Soon the great flocks were gone, never to be seen again. In 1897, the state of Michigan passed a law prohibiting the killing of passenger pigeons, but by then, no sizable flocks had been seen in the state for 10 years. The last confirmed wild pigeon in the United States was shot by a boy in Pike County, Ohio, in 1900. For a time, a few birds survived under human care. The last of them, known affectionately as Martha, died at the Cincinnati Zoological Garden on September 1, 1914. Question: What can we infer about the law passed in Michigan? Answer: The answer is:","completion":"We can infer that the law passed in Michigan was an effort to protect and preserve the remaining passenger pigeons in the state by prohibiting their hunting and killing. However, this legislative effort came too late, as no sizable flocks had been seen in the state for a decade prior to the legislation. This highlights the lack of awareness or action taken to conserve the species before it was on the brink of extinction. The rapid decline of the passenger pigeon population due to overhunting, habitat destruction, and other factors led to the species' ultimate extinction in the early 20th century. The law serves as a reminder of the importance of timely conservation measures and the consequences of unsustainable human practices on animal populations and ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pacino delivers his usual tour de force as Eli Wurman, a past-his-prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption. But unlike Michael Corleone, it's impossible to have an emotional investment in this character, his dilemma, or his fate. The film traces Eli's preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause, while distracted by a client's (Ryan O'Neal, good in an underwritten part) latest \\"dirty laundry\\" -- in this case, a TV actress companion who's gotten involved with the wrong people. Tea Leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role, although again, the script doesn't give her much to work with. As Eli's sister-in-law, Kim Basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics. This movie is strictly for those who like watching Pacino strut his stuff, and enjoy the other principals. Unfortunately, between the script and direction, \\"People I Know\\" is strictly amateurish. Hence its limited theatrical release, and speedy journey to DVD. Consider yourself warned.","completion":"The sentiment expressed in this passage is predominantly negative. The reviewer describes \\"People I Know\\" as a \\"clunker\\" with no characters to root for or care about, despite the efforts of a talented cast. They particularly criticize the lack of emotional investment in the main character, played by Al Pacino, and the underwritten parts for other actors, such as Ryan O'Neal and Tea Leoni. They also mention that Kim Basinger's performance manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics, which indicates that even the positive aspects of the movie are undermined by the script and direction. Furthermore, the reviewer states that the movie is amateurish and consequently had a limited theatrical release, with a speedy journey to DVD. This adds to the negative sentiment, as it shows the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the film's overall quality. The only positive aspect mentioned is that people who like watching Pacino and the other principal actors might enjoy the movie, but even this is presented in a rather negative light, indicating that it's not enough to save the film from disappointment. In summary, the sentiment of this passage is primarily negative, with the reviewer criticizing various aspects of the film, such as the script, direction, character development, and emotional investment. The few positive aspects mentioned, such as the performances of the principal actors, are not enough to change the overall sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Taj Palace was no exception. Things had started off well with a nice interior and friendly service.

It was just boiled potatoes, cauliflower, and tomatoes sitting in some liquid. Not edible. I will give credit where credit is due and say that the Paneer Tiki Masala was very good. It was flavorful and had a generous portion of paneer. The kicker was at the end when we went to pay for our meal and we were told they wouldn't accept our coupon. It would have been one thing if there was a sign posted on the door stating this or if we hadn't shown the servers the coupon until the end of our meal. However, there is no sign saying they don't accept coupons AND we had the coupon out at the edge of the table from the minute we sat down. FOUR servers never once said anything about it before we ordered, despite the fact that I saw all of them look at it. I'm tired of restaurants offering coupons and then deciding they don't feel like it anymore and won't make good on the ones that are still out there. But to wait until after we are done eating to tell us, when you know that we have a coupon waiting, is shady to me.

Here is an article: Donald Trump said in a new conversation published Saturday that his controversial retweet of a side-by-side image of his wife and Heidi Cruz was a “mistake.” The comment—a shift in tone from his previous defense of the tweet—was part of an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd published Saturday. “Yeah, it was a mistake,” Trump said. “If I had to do it again, I wouldn’t have sent it.” Trump’s campaign defended the tweet, which came as part of a bizarre feud between the real estate mogul and opponent Ted Cruz involving their respective wives, during CNN’s presidential town hall on Tuesday. The image included an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz alongside a glamorous photo of Melania Trump. In the new interview, Trump still said he didn’t “necessarily” view the image of Heidi Cruz as negative, and he repeated his argument that it was a response to Ted Cruz’s actions. The feud began when a Super PAC supporting Cruz—but legally barred from coordinating with him—released an ad featuring a nearly nude photo of Melania Trump. During the interview, Dowd also references allegations that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski forcibly yanked the arm of reporter Michelle Fields, another incident might have exacerbated the candidate’s growing problem with female voters. Trump has defended Lewandowski, who was charged with misdemeanor battery in the incident. Dowd asked Trump if it would have been better for Lewandoski to have apologized to Fields. “You’re right, but from what I understand it wouldn’t have mattered,” Trump said.

Question: Background: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.

Fossil fuels, when burned, release a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to the imbalance in the carbon cycle and the increase of greenhouse gases. In contrast, Nepal's decision to use renewable hydro power for electricity production does not involve the release of carbon dioxide, making its impact on the carbon cycle much less than that of India."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

People died or were born. But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs. It absolutely reeked of hush and hidden feeling. It was worse than a church. It was worse than a highschool hallway. It was more universal, more basic, something even the children could comprehend. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is the state of the \\"guests\\" leaving the green room? Answer:","completion":"The state of the \\"guests\\" leaving the green room is not explicitly defined in the given context. However, based on the descriptions provided, we can infer that the guests leaving the green room might experience a mixed range of deep, profound, and intense emotions, often suppressed or masked as they perform their respective roles imposed by their circumstances. The narrative strongly suggests that guests are often either anxious or grief-stricken, as they're waiting for news of their loved ones who are either battling illness or perhaps on the brink of death. These emotions are compounded by the sterile, slightly artificial hospitality of the green room, with its gourmet coffee, muted colors, and comfortable sofas. The room is intended to offer a quasi-luxurious waiting experience, yet this comfort heightens the guests' emotional turmoil by juxtaposing everyday indulgence with high-stakes, life or death outcomes. Depending on the news they receive when they're eventually called into the hospital proper, some guests might leave with relief and joy if their loved ones are recovering, while others might depart with heavy hearts, burdened with the weight of loss or impending grief. The green room's atmosphere amplifies these emotions - the initial apprehension, the agonizing wait, and then the final relief or despair, creating a heightened emotional experience that's far more nuanced than they would encounter in more commonly shared public spaces like a church or a highschool hallway. Furthermore, those leaving the 'green room' have their emotions intensified due to the suppressed nature of the setting where aesthetic sophistication quarrels with raw human emotion, resulting in an unfathomable emotional impact on the guests. As such, the artificial calm may give way to extreme emotionality once they exit this space, causing them to display a broader spectrum of reactions to their news – both positive and negative. Therefore, every individual's state would differ when they leave the green room, ranging from profound grief to immense relief, intense anxiety to comforting hope; each resonating with the reality that has just unfolded in front of them. A final emotional state would also depend on the individual’s capacity to handle their own specific situation, influenced by several factors, including their personality, resilience, belief systems, and support networks."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rhode Island officials said they are \\"leaving no stone unturned\\" as they try to unravel the mystery behind a beach explosion that injured a woman over the weekend. However, there was no new information that would cause officials to deem the beach unsafe, according to Janet Coit, director of the Rhode Island department of environmental management, ABC's Rhode Island affiliate WLNE reported after a Tuesday press conference. Officials are investigating cables below that sand that were disabled, or \\"de-energized,\\" in 2007, Coit said today. Larry Mouradjian, associate director for natural resources, said officials were taking the matter \\"very seriously,\\" and they are concerned that they still don't know the cause. The explosion on Saturday at the Salty Brine State Beach in Narragansett, Rhode Island, injured Kathleen Danise, 60, when she was launched onto nearby rocks. She suffered a concussion and broken ribs and was briefly hospitalized. On Tuesday, an abandoned cable that is the property of the U.S. Coast Guard was identified a few feet below the sand while some of the beach was closed to the public, WLNE-TV reported. Jack Chartier, Rhode Island fire marshal, said there was no evidence of explosives, but investigators are \\"leaving no stone unturned,\\" WLNE reported, adding that the cable removal was nearly complete. Lieutenant Colonel Todd Catlow of the Rhode Island State Police said investigators were not ruling out the possibility of an energized cable, WLNE reported. “She was like a human cannon,” Danise’s sister, Laura Demartino, told ABC affiliate WTNH in New Haven, Connecticut. While several beach-goers said they smelled gas after the explosion, a spokesman for National Grid, which manages gas and electric service in the area, said there are no gas lines along the beach. The closest gas service to the point where Danise was injured is about 200 yards away, the spokesman told ABC News, adding that a power cable had been found under the beach but the company is certain it isn't theirs. ||||| By News Staff Reporting by Ana Bottary abottary@abc6.com UPDATE: Two abandoned Coast Guard cables were pulled from the sand as crews continued to dig up the area Tuesday. More details are expected at an afternoon news conference. A new discovery was made Monday as crews investigated the Narragansett beach where an explosion occurred Saturday, injuring a woman from Connecticut. Investigators, coordinating with National Grid, spent the day inspecting an underground cable located near the site of the blast, just a few feet under the surface of the sand at Salty Brine State Beach. Crews are trying to determine whether or not it had anything to do with the explosion that sent 60-year-old Kathleen Danise to the hospital with an injured shoulder. The bomb squad and multiple other authorities combed the area Saturday and ruled out that it was not an explosive device that caused the blast, and there is no evidence of a malicious attack. Many who are familiar with the beach are shocked at Monday’s the findings. \\"It's very surprising.” Courtney McCourt was working Saturday, the day of the explosion, saying she’s worked right across from the beach for more than 20 years and has no knowledge of the underground cable. \\"I didn't know it was there… That's kind of disturbing, I guess,\\" she said. The State Fire Marshal’s Office continues to lead the investigation, though National Grid was on scene to inspect the cable determining that it is not their property. Monday evening, they marked off how far the wire extends underground and found that the cable extends off the beach and into the parking lot. The beach has remained open during the investigation, which not all agreed with. \\"I think the beach should be closed if they have no idea what's going on. Why are they even letting people on the beach? They shouldn't be,” said beach-goer, Pauline Dagesse, of Narragansett. National Grid and the State Fire Marshal’s Office will continue to look into the source of the cable, and if it has anything to do with Saturday’s explosion. © WLNE-TV 2015 ||||| PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- A loud boom that knocked a Rhode Island beachgoer out of her chair is still a mystery days later, and with no evidence of an explosive device and few clues in the sand, investigators and scientists are wondering whether this was a bizarre case of nature acting up. Among the theories that have been floated: some kind of seismic event, or a methane explosion caused by decayed seaweed or other organic matter under the sand. \\"I must confess to not understanding this particular unexplained event,\\" said Stephen Porder, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Brown University. \\"Everything at this point is entirely speculation.\\" The blast Saturday at Salty Brine beach in Narragansett was so strong that Kathleen Danise was hurled from her beach chair near the water line and thrown against a rock jetty 10 feet away. Danise, 60, of Waterbury, Connecticut, suffered two fractured ribs and bruises, her family said. CBS affiliate WPRI Danise's family says she has vacationed at Salty Brine Beach in Narragansett, Rhode Island, for 30 years, and had experienced no problems there until Saturday. According to Danise's sister, Laura Demartino, another sister who was present at the time of the blast was also injured. \\"There was a massive bang and I seen the actual rocks shift and move,\\" Demartino told CBS Affiliate WPRI Sunday. \\"And I started screaming, 'Get up, get up!' The same time I'm screaming, the sand erupted, threw my sister from there, like a live canon, face-down, unconscious 10 feet away.\\" Witnesses that morning said they heard a rumbling and loud bang that sounded like a large firecracker, a grenade or a gas explosion, and noticed a sulfur or butane smell. The blast left behind a rift in the sand and little else. Crews dug up a thick electrical cable Tuesday at the site of the unexplained explosion, CBS affiliate WPRI reports. Some of the beach was closed down Tuesday, but most of it remained open with plenty of people taking advantage. WPRI reports that several agencies were working together to dig up the cable. It was buried a couple feet deep and required an excavator to dig. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management told WPRI that both the Coast Guard and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers were inspecting that cable and the jetty itself. On Monday, National Grid had said the cable wasn't theirs. Crews ended up cutting the cable into pieces Tuesday and carrying it away. State Police Col. Steven G. O'Donnell said there was no physical evidence of an explosion, such as charring or debris. Dogs and chemical swipes detected no explosive residue. Officials also determined there was no natural gas line running underneath. O'Donnell said investigators were looking into the possibility of a shift in the rocks or a seismic event, but environmental officials said late Monday that a seismologist with the University of Connecticut told them there were no seismic events that registered in Rhode Island on Saturday. Porder, the ecology professor, and University of Rhode Island oceanography professor John King said the blast could have been caused by a buildup of methane underground. King said it's possible decaying seaweed generated the gas. \\"If you were to put a cigarette out in the sand, that might actually set it off,\\" King said. Rob Thieler, a marine and coastal geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, had another theory about a possible source of methane: estuary sediments, which sometimes cause explosions when they decay. He said scientists have seen evidence of this phenomenon off the coast of Maine. \\"The sea-floor surface looks like a golf ball, and these are presumably places where underlying methane produced by estuary sediment has violently escaped,\\" Thieler said. This type of explosion could happen spontaneously, he said, though having it happen on a sandy beach is rare. Porder said methane might have built up from organic matter trapped underground when the jetty was constructed. \\"You can definitely get an explosion. How you would have that sequence of events on that particular beach on that particular day, I don't know,\\" Porder said. @BrianL423 All the scientists said they had heard of methane explosions happening in nature. But Porder pointed out that it is typically places like swamps or areas in the arctic that produce high levels of methane. \\"I've never heard of a methane explosion on the beach,\\" he said. O'Donnell said investigators are looking at all possible causes, including the rotted-seaweed theory. \\"Everything's on the table,\\" he said. Janet Coit, director of the state body that owns the beach, told WPRO-AM on Monday that the agency is talking to U.S. Geological Survey and the engineers who constructed the jetty in the search for an explanation. The jetty is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which planned to visit the site Tuesday, Maguire said. Coit said she had heard theories about methane or a pocket of air trapped underground. \\"At this point, that's just speculation,\\" she said. ||||| WATERBURY, Conn.

Write some highlights for the following article: This incredible map shows how Americans have quit smoking over the past 40 years because of higher taxes on tobacco and an increased awareness about the dangers of lighting up. The map, created by Metric Maps used data from an annual report on the tax burden of tobacco prepared by the Federation of Tax Administrators, to show the decline on a state-by-state basis. It shows how Americans consumed an average of 125 packs of cigarettes a year between the late 1950s and the late 1980s. But today that figure has fallen to just 46 packs of cigarettes per capita every year. The sharp decline in the numbers of smokers appears to reflect a change in our attitudes to the habit, according to a researcher. 'It's a shift in social norms,' Brian King, report author for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said. 'People no longer see smoking around non-smokers as socially acceptable behaviour.' In 1970, residents in all but two states smoked more than 90 packs of cigarettes a year, according to The Washington Post. By 2012, residents of just three states — Kentucky, West Virginia and New Hampshire — smoked that much. Out of fashion: A researcher suggested that there has been a shift in 'social norms' over smoking. The decline in smoking is, in part, due to the taxes that all 50 states and the District of Columbia levy on packs of cigarettes and other tobacco products. But this wasn't always the case. In 1921, Iowa instituted the first tobacco tax. That year, the state collected 324,000 in taxes. North Carolina was the last state to hold off from implementing a tax and levied its first tax on cigarettes of just 2 cents a pack, in 1969. Today, taxes continue to rise steadily. Revenue: The revenue generated from cigarette sales was 126 million for New York City alone, more than a quarter of the total city and county tax generated across the country. In the Big Apple the levies are 4.35 tax on cigarettes. In four other states — Connecticut, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Washington —it is 3 extra per pack. North Carolina has bolstered its taxes, to 45 cents a pack – despite being a tobacco producing state. And whilst cigarette smoking has declined, taxes have increased at such a dramatic rate that tax income continues to rise. The revenue generated from cigarette sales was 126 million for New York City alone, more than a quarter of the total city and county tax generated across the country. Taxes make up more than half the price of an average pack of cigarettes in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Washington and the District, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators' report. On average, taxes make up just over 44 percent of the price of a pack nationwide. In 2012, states collected more than 18.2 billion in tobacco tax revenue. Utah has always been one of the cleaner-living states where residents strayed away from smoking. Even near peak cigarette use in the 1970s, Utah residents were smoking 66 packs per capita, the lowest rate in the country. Today they consume just 23 packs per capita, lower than any state other than Washington and New York. However, health experts still want more to be done to prevent deaths from second hand smoke which kills an estimated 41,000 non-smokers annually in homes where smokers live.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four. \\"I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired,\\" Blumenthal told CNN's Don Lemon. \\"And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.\\" She said she learned of the recording late last week from a mutual friend. \\"I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,\\" Blumenthal said.

It's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports. Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots. \\"It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,\\" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell. Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer. But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer. \\"To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,\\" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's \\"Crossfire.\\" \\"Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' \\" Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown's death. Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shooting. Dorian Johnson, who was walking with Brown at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away. According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting. But a woman who identified herself as a friend of Wilson called in to a St. Louis radio show last week with what she said was the officer's version of events. The caller, who identified herself only as \\"Josie,\\" said Brown taunted the officer and charged at him. Her account matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN. An autopsy showed Brown had six gunshot wounds, all in the front of his body. Will autopsy shed any light on what happened? Key witness speaks out. Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting. And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that includes lying to police has put Johnson's credibility in question. In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address. Johnson said Monday night he doesn't understand why some are questioning his credibility. \\"I see they bring up my past, my history, but it's not like it's a long rap sheet,\\" Johnson told Lemon. \\"This one incident shouldn't make me a bad person.\\" Michael Brown's funeral: Hope, tears and a call for social change.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population.

Article: In earliest times, men considered lightning to be one of the great mysteries of nature. Some ancient people believed that lightning and thunder were the weapons of the gods. In reality, lightning is a flow of electricity formed high above the earth. A single flash of lightning 1.6 kilometers long has enough electricity to light one million light bulbs . The American scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, was the first to show the connection between electricity and lightning in 1752. In the same year he also built the first lightning rod . This device protects buildings from being damaged by lightning. Modern science has discovered that one stroke of lightning has a voltage of more than 15 million volts . A flash of lightning between a cloud and the earth may be as long as 13 kilometers, and travel at a speed of 30 million meters per second. Scientists judge that there are about 2,000 million flashes of lightning per year. Lightning hits the Empire State Building in New York City 30 to 48 times a year. In the United States alone it kills an average of one person every day. The safest place to be in case of an electrical storm is in a closed car.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Obstretricians debate whether Caesarean section is always best for breech babies About 32 weeks into her first pregnancy, Christie Craigie-Carter's obstetrician told her that the baby she was carrying was stuck in a bottom-down position -- a breech baby -- and that she'd have to give up her dream of a natural delivery and have a Caesarean section instead. Desperate to avoid surgery, Craigie-Carter said she wanted to deliver the baby naturally anyway, but her doctor told her that such a procedure was simply too dangerous. \\"She said I wouldn't find a obstetrician on the East Coast who would deliver a breech baby vaginally,\\" recalled Craigie-Carter. When she asked her obstetrician to try to turn the baby into a head-down position by manually manipulating her abdomen, Craigie-Carter was told that such a maneuver might endanger the baby's life by causing the placenta to separate from the uterine wall. Craigie-Carter went into labor just before her due date and her son Joshua was delivered -- via C-section -- giving her an adored and healthy baby but also lingering regrets that she hadn't been able to even try to deliver him naturally. Her experience highlights a debate over whether breech babies should always be delivered by C-section or whether there are cases where a natural delivery is a safe option. In the United States, such babies are routinely delivered by C-section, in large part because of an international study, published in 2000, that found breech babies faced greater risks when delivered naturally. But the issue has received fresh attention following the decision last June by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada to reverse past opposition to natural deliveries and suggest that \\"planned vaginal delivery is reasonable in selected women.\\" The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists remains firmly opposed to vaginal deliveries of breech babies, warning of the dangers of the head's becoming trapped inside the mother; of neck injuries and paralysis if the baby is extracted incorrectly; and of pressure on the umbilical cord that could shut off blood supply to the baby. Breech babies account for between 3 and 4 percent of full-term pregnancies worldwide, according to the 2000 study. There are three typical ways in which a baby presents as breech: frank (with the bottom down and feet up near the ears); complete (with knees bent and feet near the bottom); and footling (with one or both feet pointing down toward the birth canal). \\"You may get into a situation where the baby is stuck, and I've been there, and it is a true obstetric emergency,\\" said Helain J. Landy, head of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Georgetown University Hospital. Landy said she attempts to turn breech babies into a head-down position using external manual manipulation, but if that fails she \\"would probably recommend a C-section.\\" She said that she is \\"a proponent of what the patient wants as long as it makes sense in terms of her safety and the baby's safety.\\" But because the majority of her patients are first-time mothers, often having had fertility treatments to get pregnant, Landy does not get much call for delivering a breech baby vaginally. She hasn't delivered a singleton breech baby naturally for 14 years, although she has delivered breech babies who were the second of twins where the first had come out in a normal head-down position, opening up the birth canal in the process. \\"With experience comes a little bit of hindsight, and maybe I'm just not as much of a cowboy as I might have been when I was younger, but I really want to get a healthy baby and a healthy mom,\\" Landy said. And given that breech births are trickier, concern about medical malpractice suits is a big factor behind the doctors' widespread reluctance to perform natural breech births, she said. Yet some obstetricians believe that breech delivery is reasonable in certain cases and bemoan the loss of this skill among obstetricians trained today.","completion":"The debate over whether breech babies should always be delivered by Caesarean section or if natural delivery can be a safe option in some cases has been reignited.

The intelligence leaker has applied to the Kremlin for temporary political asylum after the US blocked his travel routes out of Russia. Snowden, 30, who has been inundated with offers from Russian women of a home and marriage, may have already left Sheremetyevo Airport, where he has been living for a month since fleeing Hong Kong after the US called for him to be arrested, several unconfirmed Russian reports said on Tuesday. He is expected to be allowed a temporary Russian visa while his asylum application is formally considered. In Russia, Vladimir Putin has refused to hand him over to America but has also made clear he does not want Snowden to become an issue destabilising relations with Washington. The American wants to make a permanent home in exile in South America but the US has called on countries he would overfly or transit to arrest him and hand him to the US authorities.

If you want to avoid making some mistakes when traveling abroad, you should pay attention to the following. Touch Britain, along with much of Northern Europe and the Far East, has a \\"non-contact\\" culture. In those countries, there is very little physical contact in people's daily talks. Even brushing someone's arm by accident is the reason for an apology. However, in the high-contact cultures of the Middle East, Latin America, and southern Europe, physical touch is a big part of daily life. What's more, there are different standards for who touches whom and where. In much of the Arab world, men hold hands and kiss each other in greeting, but would never do the same with a woman. In Thailand and Laos, it is taboo to touch anyone's head, even children's. In South Korea, elders can touch younger people with force when trying to get through a crowd, but younger people can't do the same. Eye contact In most Western countries, frequent eye contact is a sign of confidence and attentiveness . We may think that a conversation partner who looks away is either not listening to us or lying. Of course, this is not the standard around the world. In many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, the unbroken eye contact would be considered impolite and rude.

Question 1: Why does Apple give 5 GB of iCloud storage, even if I own multiple iOS devices? Question 2: Why does Apple force iOS users to have the Apple Watch app on their device? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answering Question 1 step-by-step: 1. I will begin by gathering information about the iCloud service. 2. I will then consider the rationale of providing 5 GB of storage to users who own multiple iOS devices. Justification: Understanding the purpose of iCloud storage and its utility for users who own multiple iOS devices will help me provide a well-rounded answer to the question. Answering Question 2 step-by-step: 1. I will begin by getting information about the Apple Watch app. 2. I will then examine Apple's reasons for requiring iOS users to have the app on their device, even if they don't own an Apple Watch. Justification: Understanding the purpose of the Apple Watch app and its presence on iOS devices will help me provide a well-rounded answer to the question. Upon completing these steps, I can answer both questions and analyze if their answers share a common reason. Question 1 Answer: Apple provides 5 GB of iCloud storage to each user account, regardless of the number of iOS devices owned, to offer a basic level of cloud storage for backing up important data, like photos, contacts, and documents. Although this storage limit is the same for users with multiple devices, Apple expects that users with higher storage needs will subscribe to paid iCloud storage plans to get more space. Question 2 Answer: Apple preinstalls the Apple Watch app on iOS devices to streamline the user experience and allow for quick setup and management should a user decide to purchase an Apple Watch in the future. By having the app preinstalled, users don’t need to download it separately, and updates can be handled easily through the App Store.

Elsewhere, Julius Jones, Silas's nephew, has a run-in with some Italian mobsters. Just as the two goons are about to kill Julius, Maximillian, a suave, mysterious vampire (who arrived on the ship in his intricately carved coffin), intervenes and kills them. Soon after, Maximillian infects Julius with his vampiric blood, before Julius turning into a decaying ghoul and claiming that it has benefits; he then explains that he has come to Brooklyn in search of the Dhampir daughter of a vampire from his native Caribbean island in order to live beyond the night of the next full moon. This Dhampir turns out to be NYPD Detective Rita Veder, who is still dealing with the death of her mentally ill mother (a paranormal researcher) some months before. As she and her partner, Detective Justice, are in the middle of investigating the murders on the ship, Rita begins having strange visions about a woman who looks like her, and begins asking questions about her mother's past. When she tells Justice about having \\"a strange feeling\\" about the investigation, he is skeptical, which frustrates Rita. The visions are presumably influenced in part by her vampire heritage; this is hinted at a few times throughout the first two-thirds of the story. Rita is completely unaware of this heritage, and believes she is losing her mind, similar to what happened to her mother. Meanwhile, Maximillian initiates a series of sinister methods to find out more about Rita and to further pull her into his thrall, including seducing and murdering her roommate Nikki, as well as disguising himself as her preacher and a lowlife crook.

A: Choose your answer from: 1). cone 2). root 3). flower 4). seed The answer is:","completion":"4). seed In seed plants, the ovule plays a crucial role in the process of reproduction. It is a female reproductive structure that contains a tiny female gametophyte. This gametophyte is responsible for producing an egg cell, which is then ready for the process of fertilization. Fertilization occurs when a sperm cell, originating from a male reproductive structure called the pollen grain, makes its way to the female ovule. Once the sperm cell reaches the egg cell contained within the ovule, the process of fertilization is complete. This union between sperm and egg generates a zygote, which is a single cell with the potential to develop into a new, genetically distinct organism. Following successful fertilization, the ovule undergoes a series of transformations. The zygote first divides and develops into an embryo, which is fully enveloped within the protective layers of the ovule. As the embryo grows and matures, the ovule gradually transforms into a seed, the structure that will enable the plant to reproduce and continue its life cycle. Seeds are generally encased in a seed coat and, depending on the species, can contain stored nutrients and other resources that will help the developing plant establish itself in the environment through the process of germination. In conclusion, after fertilization, the ovule in seed plants will eventually develop into a seed (answer 4). Seeds play a crucial role in the reproductive cycle of seed plants, as they contribute to the propagation of new individuals and the continuation of a species' existence."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Sir Cameron Mackintosh has paid out 2.9million after a FedEx delivery man slipped on a floor his cleaner had mopped. He had his cleaner Esme David tidy up the Broadway office twice a week and his apartment three times, reported the New York Daily News. The FedEx delivery man slipped on the floor at 9.30am on November 13 2008. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital where he was told he tore his rotator cuff muscles in his shoulder, ruptured tendons in his thighs and torn cartilage in his knee. The delivery man, who also had neck and back injuries, was disabled and told he could not work again. The FedEx delivery man was left disabled and forced to retire after 19 years on the job (Stock image) His lawyer, Scott Rynecki said: ‘For someone who produced elaborate Broadway shows, he didn’t do such a good job managing his personnel. ‘There are obvious dangers with mopping the floor at the same time people are arriving for work.’ Mackintosh, 54, was not there at the time of the accident, and was not questioned under oath.

The floor had been mopped by Mackintosh's personal cleaner, Esme David, who was employed by the producer to clean his Broadway office twice a week and his apartment three times. The decision to hire Ms. David was due to Mackintosh's dissatisfaction with the building's existing cleaning service, which he felt was subpar. The incident occurred on November 13, 2008, at 9:30 am. The FedEx delivery man slipped on the wet floor, causing significant damage to his body. He was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where doctors informed him that he had torn his rotator cuff muscles in his shoulder, ruptured tendons in his thighs, and suffered torn cartilage in his knee. In addition to these injuries, the man also suffered from neck and back damage, disabling him and rendering him unable to work ever again. The delivery man's attorney, Scott Rynecki, criticized Mackintosh's management skills, stating, \\"For someone who produced elaborate Broadway shows, he didn't do such a good job managing his personnel.\\" He also highlighted the inherent dangers of mopping floors during peak office hours when people are arriving for work. Mackintosh, 54, was not present during the accident and was not questioned under oath for the case.

His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city. Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared. Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year.

This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. The two objects should be used ONCE in your question. Here is a list of attributes and associated contrastive words that may help write contrastive trigger words. Note that contrastive trigger words help in flipping the label. | Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword | | age | old | new | | altitude | low | high | | area | small | vast | | brightness | dark | light | | clarity | obscure | clear | | cleanness | dirty | clean | | complexity | simple | complex | | cost | cheap | expensive | | density | sparse | dense | | depth | shallow | deep | | distance | near | far | | electric conductivity | low | high | | flexibility | rigid | flexible | | granularity | fine | coarse | | hardness | soft | hard | | length | short | long | | magnitude | small | large | | mass | small | large | | odor | weak | strong | | pressure | low | high | | resistance | low | high | | shape | round | sharp | | shape | flat | spiky | | size | small | large | | sound | quiet | loud | | sound pitch | low | high | | speed | slow | fast | | stability | unstable | stable | | strength | weak | strong | | temperature | low | high | | texture | smooth | rough | | thermal conductivity | low | high | | thickness | thin | thick | | volume | small | large | | weight | light | heavy | | width | narrow | wide | | location | in | out | | location | up | down | | location | above | below | | location | on | off | | location | to | from | Q: Context Word: blade.

After the control of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba attained full-fledged rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province carved out of the Northwest Territories. The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives). The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Progressive Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.Like all Canadian provinces, Manitoba is governed by a unicameral legislative assembly. The executive branch is formed by the governing party; the party leader is the premier of Manitoba, the head of the executive branch. The head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, who is appointed by the Governor General of Canada on advice of the Prime Minister. The head of state is primarily a ceremonial role, although the Lieutenant Governor has the official responsibility of ensuring that Manitoba has a duly constituted government.The Legislative Assembly consists of the 57 Members elected to represent the people of Manitoba. The premier of Manitoba is Brian Pallister of the PC Party. The PCs were elected with a majority government of 40 seats. The NDP holds 14 seats, and the Liberal Party have three seats but does not have official party status in the Manitoba Legislature. The last provincial general election was held on 19 April 2016.

For example, stopping and starting the car a lot uses much more gas than driving at a constant pace. This is why highway consumption is always less than city consumption. Cruise control can help you get better fuel consumption. Fuel consumption gets worse the faster you drive. Since AC uses gasoline, using it will diminish your fuel consumption. To get a more accurate picture of your car's fuel consumption, you need to have more data. By driving for longer and averaging your fuel consumption you eliminate \\"glitches\\" in your data. Say, for example, that you calculated your fuel consumption one day as you drove up into the mountains. Because climbing uphill takes more fuel, your fuel consumption would look much lower than it normally is. Set your odometer to zero and don't reset it after you get a tank of gas. If you don't have an odometer, record how many miles are on your car with a full tank of gas. To get a more accurate measure of fuel consumption, you need to know how much gas you are using. Each time you fill up, write down the number of gallons you purchase and save it. Do not reset your trip odometer as you drive. Make sure your fill up your car 3-4 times for an accurate reading. Try to do this during a month of average driving, as big trips or unexpected traffic will change your fuel consumption. You do not need to fill your car all the way up each time. As long as you record the number of gallons you put in you can calculate fuel consumption. When you are ready to calculate your fuel consumption, top your car off and record the number of gallons you put in. This represents the total gas used over this period of time. If I bought three tanks of gas, 12 gallons, 3 gallons, and 10 gallons, then my total gas usage would be 25 gallons. Use your trip odometer to see how many miles you traveled total, then divide this by gallons to get your average fuel consumption. While this is the exact number of miles per gallon during your test period, it is a good estimate for your car's average fuel consumption. For example, if you used 25 gallons of gas, and drove 500 miles during that time, then your average fuel consumption would be 20 miles per gallon (500 miles / 25 gallons = 20 mpg). By law, car makers must post the average fuel consumption for cars. However, these are only estimates, and they are frequently on the high end. You can look up your car's fuel consumption online through this US Department of Energy website, but to find your car's actual miles per gallon you'll have to calculate it yourself. If your calculation is drastically different from the suggest average, you may need to bring your car to a mechanic. Summary:","completion":"To accurately measure a car's fuel consumption, track the gallons used and miles driven over multiple fill-ups, then divide the total miles by total gallons, keeping in mind that factors like terrain, speed, and AC usage can impact fuel efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Australian actress Maggie Kirkpatrick has avoided jail after being found guilty of sexually abusing a teenage girl in 1984.\\"","completion":"Title: Maggie Kirkpatrick: A Shattered Image and the Dark Side of Fame Introduction Maggie Kirkpatrick, a renowned Australian actress, is best known for her iconic role as Joan \\"The Freak\\" Ferguson in the long-running television series, Prisoner: Cell Block H. Having enjoyed a successful career, her public image was severely tainted when she was found guilty of sexually abusing a teenage girl in 1984. This shocking revelation and the aftermath of the trial have unearthed issues related to the dark side of fame, as well as the complex landscape of sexual abuse cases. The Trial: Accusations and Verdict In August 2015, Maggie Kirkpatrick was charged and found guilty of sexually abusing a teenage girl who was 13 years old at the time of the alleged incident in 1984. The victim claims that the assault took place at Kirkpatrick's home in Prahran, where she was invited after writing her a fan letter. According to the victim, the assault included undressing her, performing a sex act, and engaging in non-consensual sexual activities. After a two-day trial, Magistrate Peter Mealy found that the victim's account was credible despite Kirkpatrick's denial of any wrongdoing, and as a result, the actress was convicted of two counts of indecent assault and one count of gross indecency with a person under 16. The Almost-Jail Time Maggie Kirkpatrick narrowly avoided jail time following her conviction for these reprehensible acts. The actress was initially sentenced to an 18-month community corrections order that required her to complete 100 hours of community service and undergo a sex offender treatment program. However, she later appealed the decision, and in November 2015, the convictions were overturned by Melbourne County Court Judge Geoffrey Chettle, who stated that the victim's testimony was not strong enough to sustain the guilty verdict. This ruling led to widespread controversy and criticism, considering the harrowing nature of the allegations. The Impact on Kirkpatrick's Career and Reputation The sexual abuse case has had a profound impact on Maggie Kirkpatrick's career and public image. Although she has professed her innocence throughout the trial, the damage to her reputation has been immense. Many fans and members of the public have condemned her actions and expressed disillusionment with the celebrated actress. Moreover, having her convictions overturned has led some to questions about the effectiveness of the justice system, as well as how it handles cases involving celebrities. The Dark Side of Fame This case has exposed the dark side of fame, as many celebrities have faced similar accusations and trials. The power dynamics and the pedestal that society places entertainers on can lead to a sense of entitlement and a belief that one is above the law. Often, victims of celebrity-perpetuated sexual abuse are intimidated and reluctant to come forward, fearing that they will not be taken seriously. This social dynamic makes it even harder for victims to seek justice and protection from their abusers. Lessons Learned and Moving Forward This case has prompted much-needed discussions on sexual abuse, the role of celebrities in society, and the complexities of the justice system. It underscores the importance of victim support and the need to address the systemic hurdles that may prevent them from seeking justice. Additionally, it highlights the significance of public awareness and education on sexual assault, emphasizing the responsibilities and accountabilities we all share in order to create a safer and more understanding society. In conclusion, the Maggie Kirkpatrick case serves as a cautionary tale about the dark side of fame and the way society sometimes idolizes celebrities. It is crucial for the public to be aware of these issues and to demand a fair and impartial justice system, regardless of the high-profile nature of the defendant. As we learn from this case, it is imperative for the legal system, the media, and the public discourse to continue to evolve in order to better address sexual assault and protect vulnerable individuals from abuse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a minstrel show with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show features black actors in blackface, extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped CGI-animated cartoons that caricature the leading stars of the new show. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers â Manray, named after American artist Man Ray, and Womack â to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills. To Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as the show premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as being satirical. Delacroix quickly embraces the show, his newfound fame and awards while Hopkins becomes horrified at the racist nightmare she has helped to unleash. Meanwhile, an underground, militant rap group called the Mau Maus, led by Hopkins' older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the content of the show. Though they had earlier unsuccessfully auditioned for the program's live band position, the group plans to bring the show down...

And about 50 years ago, I was the only child I knew who didn't have a father at home on Father's Day. Divorce was very uncommon back then. So when my friends were in town shopping for presents for their fathers, I decided since my mother was both Mother and Father, no one else was like her, who better deserved(be worth) a present on Father's Day than her? I bought her a little set of tools, just a few things, hammer, pliers and screwdriver and a box to put all these things in. I got some ideas from my grandfather and named it Mother's Tool Box. She was excited, more at the thought of being cared for on Father's Day than of the present. She always said she liked her Father's Day memories better than the Mother's Day ones. It made her feel special -- and she was. I have noticed in the past few years, greeting cards are even made for \\"Mother on Father's Day\\". Ever since then, my mother has got cards on Father's Day. By the way, she knew just how to use those tools and others she had ever used over the years. Options: A Go shopping with his friends. B Buy a present for his mother. C Help his mother.

Thanks to the thirty Heads who responded to my question about maternity leave. Clearly, the amount of maternity leave offered to teachers at international schools varies greatly from school to school. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Different educational institutions have different maternity leave for teachers.\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can conclude that \\"Different educational institutions have different maternity leave policies for teachers.\\" The fact that 30 Heads from various international schools responded to the question posed about maternity leave and the author's statement about the clear variation in the amount of leave offered supports this conclusion. It is important to recognize that maternity leave policies can be influenced by multiple factors such as the educational institution's location, the host country's labor laws, cultural norms, and the institution's philosophy or financial capacity. As a result, international schools, which often comprise diverse populations and operate in various legal and cultural contexts, may differ significantly concerning the provision of maternity leave, even for teachers engaged in similar roles or with comparable responsibilities. One might find that some international schools offer generous paid maternity leave, outstripping the benefits provided by domestic schools, while others may provide leave in line with national regulations or industry norms. Factors such as the availability of temporary replacement personnel, individual schools' budgetary constraints, and the level of competitiveness between international schools in certain locations can all potentially contribute to the observed differences in maternity leave policy. Furthermore, it is essential to consider the context of parental leave, which can encompass both maternity and paternity leave and may differ in structure from one institution to another. Some schools may offer combined parental leave, allocating a specific number of weeks to be taken by either parent, while others may provide distinct policies catering to the specific needs of mothers and fathers. Additionally, variations in the duration, level of pay, and any accompanying accommodation for flexible work arrangements may also be observed. In conclusion, based on the input gathered from 30 Heads of international schools, it is evident that different educational institutions have different maternity leave policies for teachers. Such differences may arise due to various factors, including the legal or cultural context in which the institution operates, financial resources, or competitive pressures within the international schooling sector. Additionally, it is essential to acknowledge that the broader context of parental leave may also contribute to observed disparities in leave provisions across institutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Operator of high-stakes poker games featuring celebs, Wall Street bankers, and Russian billionaires, dodges jail William Barbalat — who operated high-stakes illegal poker games in New York — dodged jail Wednesday. Manhattan Federal Judge Jesse Furman sentenced Barbalat, 42, to two years of probation and 200 hours of community service.

He and Sullivan had arrived in New York to produce the new opera, but the composer discovered that he had left his sketches behind in England.

The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar. Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure. Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea, the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is said to be saturated. Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized. Stearic acid is an example of a saturated fatty acid (Figure 3.14). Q: Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their what?

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"These two questions, while related, are not inquiring about the same information. The first question asks specifically about the most profitable franchise in California, while the second question seeks information on the most profitable franchise generally, without any geographical limitation. In order to answer both questions appropriately, I will address them individually. 1. Most profitable franchise in California: California has a diverse and thriving economy with various industries and business sectors flourishing. Thus, it's difficult to pinpoint a single franchise as the most profitable. However, some franchises have shown a pattern of success in the region. Fast food franchises like McDonald's, Subway, and Starbucks have a strong presence and profitability in California, thanks to their brand recognition and popularity. Additionally, fitness-related franchises, such as 24 Hour Fitness and Orangetheory Fitness, also perform well due to the state's health-conscious culture. Other franchises, like 7-Eleven, have a substantial footprint in the state, providing convenience and accessibility to consumers. It is important to note that the most profitable franchise in California can also vary depending on various factors, including location, economic conditions, industry trends, and even the specific year or period taken into account. Therefore, it is challenging to determine an absolute, most profitable franchise in California. 2. Most profitable franchise globally: Similar to the first question, identifying the most profitable franchise globally depends on multiple factors. However, some franchises have demonstrated consistently high profitability over time, making them well-established contenders in this area. McDonald's, for example, remains one of the most profitable franchises in the world, with more than 38,000 locations spanning 119 countries. The company's continued success is attributable to its brand recognition, constant innovation, and ability to adapt to changing market preferences. Another example is KFC, which operates in over 145 countries and is known for its fried chicken, contributing to its worldwide profitability. Other franchises that have proven successful and profitable on a global scale include Marriott International, 7-Eleven, and Subway, to name a few. In conclusion, while the two questions are related, they differ in terms of the geographical scope. The first question focuses on the most profitable franchise specifically in California, while the second question pertains to franchises with high profitability on a global level. Although it may be challenging to identify a single, most profitable franchise due to the various factors at play, some franchises, like McDonald's, Subway, and 7-Eleven, are among those known to experience consistent success both in California and worldwide."},{"prompt":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Toby Tenma is a teenager who lives in the futuristic city-state Metro City, which floats above the polluted \\"Surface\\".

Article: We all remember seeing hitchhikers , standing by the side of the road, thumb sticking out, waiting for a lift. But it is getting rare nowadays. What killed hitchhiking? Safety is often mentioned as a reason. Movies about murderous hitchhikers and real-life crime have put many drivers off picking up hitchhikers. That no single women picked me up on my journey to Manchester no doubt reflects the safety fear: a large, strangely dressed man is seen as dangerous. But the reason may be more complex: hitchhiking happens where people don't have cars and transport services are poor. Plenty of people still hitchhike in Poland and Romania. Perhaps the rising level of car ownership in the UK means the few people lift hitchhiking are usually considered strange. Why can't they afford cars? Why can't they take the coach or the train? Three-quarters of the UK population have access to a car; many of the remainder will be quite old. The potential hitchhiking population is therefore small. Yet my trip proves it's still possible to hitchhike. The people who picked me up were very interesting-lawyer, retired surgeon, tank commander, carpenter, man who live in an isolated farmhouse and a couple living up in the mountains. My conclusion is that only really interesting people are mad enough to pick up fat blokes in red, spotted scarves. Most just wanted to do someone a good turn; a few said they were so surprised to see a hitchhiker that they couldn't help stopping. The future of hitchhiking most likely lies with car-sharing organized over the Internet, via sites such as hitchhikers. org. But for now, you can still stick your thumb out(actually, I didn't do much of that, preferring just to hold up my destination sign) and people-wonderful, caring, sharing, unafraid people-will stop. In the UK, with its cheap coaches and reasonable rail service, I don't think I'll make a habit of it. But having enjoyed it so much, I'm ready now to do a big trip across Europe and beyond.

W. T. McWhorter was determined to find out if it was true, so he planned to dynamite the amphitheater on the day he was to transfer the deed to the CoE. Spectators attended the planned explosion, but it was stopped just in time by CoE attorney David Waid.The dam was completed, and Beaver Lake was at full height by June 1966. For all intents and purposes, Harvey's Monte Ne was gone. However, in times of drought, some of the structures become visible again. The lake dropped to its lowest level on January 22, 1977, more than 27 feet (8 m) below its average depth, and the amphitheater and bridges were visible for the first time in more than 10 years. Before the water flooded downtown Monte Ne again, the rest of the buildings were either bulldozed or moved to avoid problems for swimmers, boaters, and fishermen. The few bridges that spanned the lagoon and the amphitheater were not demolished.In 2006, the waters of Beaver Lake once again receded to their lowest level since 1984, just above 1,100 feet (335 m). This generated a new brief interest in Monte Ne and people were once again attracted to the edge of the lake to explore the remains. The upper part of the amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the never constructed pyramid were exposed for a time before being once again swallowed by the lake.The flooded Monte Ne has become a site of interest for scuba divers who dive by the amphitheater to get a look at the submerged structure.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You just got done with a long run. You are gasping for air. Why does your body react this way? What is the purpose of breathing? All the cells of your body need oxygen to work properly. Your bodys circulatory system works with the respiratory system to deliver the oxygen. Your blood carries red blood cells. The main job of red blood cells is to carry oxygen throughout your body. The red blood cells get oxygen in the lungs. The lungs are the main organs of the respiratory system. The respiratory system is the body system that takes in oxygen. It then releases carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide is the waste material from the cells. After reading the above, is \\"The respiratory system carries red blood cells\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Do your blood carry red blood cells\\"?","completion":"No, the statement \\"The respiratory system carries red blood cells\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"Do your blood carry red blood cells?\\". The accurate response should be \\"Yes, your blood carries red blood cells\\". To clarify, it's the circulatory system, composed of your heart and blood vessels, that carries red blood cells – not the respiratory system. The respiratory system and the circulatory system do work together, but their functions are distinct. The respiratory system is responsible for the intake of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide. When we breathe in, oxygen enters the lungs, diffusing through the lung walls and into the bloodstream. Here, oxygen binds to the hemoglobin in red blood cells. On the other hand, the circulatory system is responsible for transporting these oxygenated red blood cells throughout the body. This system carries nutrients, hormones, gases, and waste products, including carbon dioxide, to and from the cells. The purpose of breathing is to facilitate this oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange. During strenuous exercise such as a long run, your muscles work harder and need more oxygen to produce the energy necessary for contraction. When this happens, your breathing rate increases in an effort to deliver more oxygen to your cells and to remove the increased amount of carbon dioxide produced. That's why after a long run, you may find yourself gasping for air. This is your body's response to the increased demand for oxygen and the need to expel more carbon dioxide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What position in the market does the brand Grolsch occupy?\\" Context: \\"The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. More than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons) are sold per year—producing total global revenues of 294.5 billion (£147.7 billion) in 2006. The history of breweries has been one of absorbing smaller breweries in order to ensure economy of scale. In 2002 South African Breweries bought the North American Miller Brewing Company to found SABMiller, becoming the second largest brewery, after North American Anheuser-Bush. In 2004 the Belgian Interbrew was the third largest brewery by volume and the Brazilian AmBev was the fifth largest. They merged into InBev, becoming the largest brewery. In 2007, SABMiller surpassed InBev and Anheuser-Bush when it acquired Royal Grolsch, brewer of Dutch premium beer brand Grolsch in 2007. In 2008, InBev (the second-largest) bought Anheuser-Busch (the third largest), the new Anheuser-Busch InBev company became again the largest brewer in the world. As of 2015[update] AB InBev is the largest brewery, with SABMiller second, and Heineken International third.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the context of the brewing industry, the brand Grolsch occupies a position as a premium Dutch beer brand. Grolsch became a part of SABMiller, the second-largest brewery in the world, when it was acquired by the company in 2007. Grolsch is known for its distinctive taste and unique swing-top bottles. The acquisition of Royal Grolsch by SABMiller helped the company surpass InBev and Anheuser-Busch in the market share. Since Grolsch is a premium brand, it holds a niche position in the market, catering to consumers who prefer high-quality and distinctively flavored beer. Although Grolsch was a part of SABMiller when it became the second largest brewery in the world, its position in the market may have changed following the merger of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller in 2016, which resulted in the creation of the largest brewing company globally. However, Grolsch still maintains its identity as a premium Dutch beer brand within the ever-evolving and competitive brewing industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I asked him where he was going. He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime. You already know that. You can email me. It’s my job to help you understand, but you have to come to me. You are an adult.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choices: 1. no 2. yes","completion":"2. yes Both questions are indeed inquiring about the same information. They are asking for the reason behind athletes, specifically Olympic winners, biting their medals during victory celebrations and photo opportunities. This tradition has become quite popular among athletes across various sports, and it fascinates many people who watch these events. There are a few reasons athletes bite their medals: 1. Historical tradition and checking authenticity: Biting metals dates back to ancient times when gold coins were used as currency. People would bite the coins to test their authenticity, as gold is a relatively soft metal and would show indentations when bitten. While this method was not foolproof, it was an easy way for anyone to conduct a preliminary test before going to a professional to check the coin's legitimacy. In the context of the Olympic Games, athletes don't need to verify if their medals are genuine, but biting them serves as a symbolic connection to history. 2. Emulating iconic photos and media influence: The media plays a significant role in spreading the tradition of athletes biting their medals. When photographers ask athletes to pose with their medals during a photo session, many request the athletes to bite them to get that iconic shot. Over the years, this has become a customary pose for champions, and replicating that moment has become a part of the medal-winning experience. 3. Celebrating their victory: Winning a medal at the Olympic Games or any other international sporting event is the pinnacle of an athlete's career. Biting the medal can be viewed as a way of savoring the sweet taste of victory, which requires years of hard work, dedication, and sacrifice. Biting the medal can be an athlete's way of symbolizing how real and tangible their win is, providing a unique memory that they can cherish for the rest of their lives. 4. Expression of emotions and excitement: Athletes are often overwhelmed with emotions after a victory, and biting the medal can be a spontaneous, instinctive response to the excitement of the moment. The act serves as an unusual yet fun way for athletes to express their joy and embrace their accomplishments. In summary, athletes biting their medals is a tradition with historical roots and modern significance, fueled by the media and iconic images. It is a unique expression that symbolizes accomplishment, celebration, and emotion for those who have reached the pinnacle of their sporting career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was the illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI (r. 14921503) and his long-term mistress Vannozza dei Cattanei. He was the brother of Lucrezia Borgia; Giovanni Borgia (Juan), Duke of Gandia; and Gioffre Borgia (Jofré in Catalan), Prince of Squillace.

The picture was Welles's first feature film. Nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories, it won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles.

It topped the American Film Institute's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list in 1998, as well as its 2007 update. \\"Citizen Kane\\" is particularly praised for its cinematography, music, and narrative structure, which have been considered innovative and precedent-setting. - Gandia is a city and municipality in the Valencian Community, Eastern Spain on the Mediterranean. Gandia is located on the Costa del Azahar, south of Valencia and north of Alicante. - Tyrone Edmund Power III (May 5, 1914 November 15, 1958) was an American film, stage and radio actor. From the 1930s to the 1950s Power appeared in dozens of films, often in swashbuckler roles or romantic leads.

The movie starred Tyrone Power as Orsini and Orson Welles as Cesare Borgia . - Romagna (Romagnol: \\"Rumâgna\\") is an Italian historical region that approximately corresponds to the south-eastern portion of present-day Emilia-Romagna. Traditionally, it is limited by the Apennines to the south-west, the Adriatic to the east, and the rivers Reno and Sillaro to the north and west. The region's major cities include Cesena, Faenza, Forlì, Imola, Ravenna, Rimini and City of San Marino (San Marino is a landlocked state inside the Romagna historical region). The region has been recently formally expanded with the transfer of seven comuni (Casteldelci, Maiolo, Novafeltria, Pennabilli, San Leo, Sant'Agata Feltria, Talamello) from the Marche region, which are a small number of comuni where Romagnolo dialect is spoken. Etymology. The name \\"Romagna\\" comes from the Latin name \\"Romània\\", which originally was the generic name for \\"land inhabited by Romans\\", and first appeared on Latin documents in the 5th century. It later took on the more detailed meaning of \\"territory subjected to Eastern Roman rule\\", whose citizens called themselves Romans (\\"Romani\\" in Latin; \\"Romàioi\\" in Greek). Thus the term \\"Romània\\" came to be used to refer to the territory administered by the Exarchate of Ravenna in contrast to other parts of Northern Italy under Lombard rule, named \\"Langobardia\\" or \\"Lombardy\\". \\"Romània\\" later became \\"Romandìola\\" in Vulgar Latin, meaning \\"little Romània\\", which became \\"Romagna\\" in modern times.

From correspondence a version appears to have been distributed in 1513, using a Latin title, \\"De Principatibus\\" (\\"About Principalities\\"). However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. This was done with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, but \\"long before then, in fact since the first appearance of \\"The Prince\\" in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings\\". - The Black Rose is a 1950 20th Century Fox Technicolor film starring Tyrone Power and Orson Welles, loosely based on Thomas B. Costain's book. It was filmed partly on location in England and Morocco which substitutes for the Gobi Desert of China. The film was partly conceived as a follow-up to the movie \\"Prince of Foxes\\", and reunited the earlier film's two stars. Talbot Jennings' screenplay was based on a popular novel of the same name by Canadian author Thomas B. Costain, published in 1945, introducing an anachronistic Saxon rebellion against the Norman aristocracy as a vehicle for launching the protagonists on their journey to the Orient. - Duke of Valentinois, formerly Count of Valentinois, is a title of nobility, originally in the French peerage. Though the duchy was once associated with administrative authority as well as possession of manors in Valence in France's \\"\\", those noble prerogatives were whittled away and by the 20th century it was a nominal dukedom consisting of a hereditary title descending in the male line. - Prince of Foxes is a 1947 historical novel by Samuel Shellabarger, following the adventures of the fictional Andrea Orsini, a captain in the service of Cesare Borgia during his conquest of the Romagna. - Samuel Shellabarger (18881954) was an American educator and author of both scholarly works and best-selling historical novels.

Article: The Rwanda Football Federation (FERWAFA) is taking steps to put an end to what some believe is witchcraft working its way into soccer matches. New rules have been put in place to punish clubs, managers and/or players adjudged to engage in the practice, per reports. The decision comes on the heels of an incident earlier this month in a match between Mukura Victory Sports and Rayon Sport. Rayon striker Moussa Camara, whose team was losing 1-0, apparently hit the Mukura Victory Sports woodwork on a shot attempt. Footage showed Camara running over to the post and appear to place an object down, much to the opposing goalkeeper’s chagrin. Article continues below ... The whole scene was crazy, as Camara bolted away as his opponents lashed out at him. He earned a yellow for the act, but the wildest part is Camara scored an equalizer a few minutes later. Whether witchcraft was behind that or just regular old skill is up to the individual to decide. What has happened, though, is that FERWAFA won’t stand for it anymore. Coaches and players and can face steep fines and bans if found guilty of using witchcraft, per the Rwanda New Times. If a team is found guilty, they face a three-point deduction and a fine of 500,000 Rwandan Francs, or about 600. Here’s FERWAFA vice president Vedaste Kayiranga via the New Times: Since there is no scientific way to prove the use of witchcraft, these measures will base upon reports from match officials and anything that is deemed to incite witchcraft will be put under consideration. So, it looks like players will have to rely on pregame superstition to give them the edge now. UPDATE (12/29): Upon further review, it appears Camara was actually trying to reverse apparent witchcraft performed by the goalkeeper. This extended video shows Camara actually removed, not placed, an object near the goalpost. Furthermore, the goalkeeper also received a yellow for his participation in the shenanigans. The video shows just how chaotic the whole scene was, with substitutes and apparently fans getting involved. If it didn’t make sense before why FERWAFA felt the need to address the whole witchcraft situation, it certainly makes sense now.

This is one of the tough measures passed by Rwanda Football Federation (FERWAFA) during an extra-ordinary meeting on addressing the problem of witchcraft in local football.

Rain was born as Jung Ji-hoon on June 25, 1982, in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province in South Korea. His mother died in December 2000 as she struggled with diabetes. In the same year, Rain was recruited as a trainee for JYP Entertainment, led by recording artist and producer Park Jin-young. In a CNN interview and also in a Discovery Channel documentary called Discovering Hip Korea, he recalled being repeatedly rejected because of his looks: \\"In fact, I was told after one audition that my singing and dancing was great On his World 2007 tour, his scheduled concerts in Shanghai, Toronto, San Francisco, and Hawaii were canceled, followed by the last concert in Los Angeles. The last event at the Staples Center was canceled only two hours prior to opening: Rain's producer blamed the situation on financial problems of the local promoter, while the local promoter blamed Wellmade STAR M calling them too \\"incompetent to handle the situation\\". On March 19, 2009, a federal jury in Honolulu found that Rain, his former management agency JYP Entertainment, and two other promotion companies were guilty of breaching a contract and defrauding Honolulu promoter Click Entertainment for 2 million (originally just over 1 million) after the Hawaii concert was canceled and the promoters were not refunded the 500,000 licensing fee. Rain and JYP were ordered to pay 2.4 million each in punitive damages, 1 million for damages related to the fraud, and 2.3 million for breach of contract. A separate lawsuit filed by promoters Wellmade STAR M was dismissed by a South Korean court on January 28, 2010. Judge Bae Kwang-Kuk ruled in favor of Rain and blamed the plaintiff for poor preparations surrounding the canceled U.S. tour. In April 2010, Rain and other J. Tune Creative shareholders were accused of embezzling money from the company by a fabric manufacturing company. The company claimed they suffered financial losses. Rain and the shareholders were acquitted of the charges in December of that year. He was re investigated in September 2011 after a discrepancy was found, but was later acquitted again in June 2013.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the place that was transformed into the Town Hall Cinema? Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers. It closed in 1970 and was demolished in 1972. Notable old boys included Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and...

Article: Twenty years ago, Oliver's back injury ruined her childhood dream of becoming a ballet dancer.

She was struck by the beautiful movements and the\\"nice, patient instructor--Nelson\\", who later became her husband. The couple opened a t'ai chi school in the UK. But they soon found themselves in a bottleneck. So the couple decided to move to China. They taught English in universities and learned t'ai chi under various masters. After years of practice, Oliver found her occasional backaches had disappeared. But three years after moving to China to pursue their dream, Nelson died, bringing her much pain. She thought of quitting, but considering the career in which her husband took pride, she stuck to it. She says her t'ai chi\\"family\\"-- the masters and students -- also provided great support, including her then tutor Dong Bing. She speaks of their first meeting:\\"I had been told that his skill was of a very high level and for some reason I had a mental image of a powerful, big man.

In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: \\"To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition.\\"\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The conflicts and fears depicted in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" were primarily induced by racial tensions and social changes occurring in the South during the time the novel was written and published. Two significant events that influenced the novel were Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person in 1955, leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted as the school's first black students. The novel, set in the mid-1930s but written in the perspective of the 1950s, reflects the conflicts, tensions, and fears surrounding racial issues and the treatment of African Americans during that time. These events and the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro, as described by reviewer Harding LeMay, fueled the racial conflicts and fears portrayed in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Where does the painting that not get distribution of reproductions reside today? ? Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, occasionally formerly known as The Imprudence of Candaules, is a 45.1 by 55.9 cm (17.8 by 22.0 in) oil painting on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830. It shows a scene from the Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying and challenges him to either accept his own execution or to kill Candaules as a punishment. Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, still unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes. Etty hoped that his audience would take from the painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights should justly be punished, but he made little effort to explain this to audiences. The painting was immediately controversial and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, and in 1847 was one of a number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The work retained its controversial reputation in later years, and when The Art Journal bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's former collection in 1849 they did not distribute reproductions of Candaules. In 1929 it was among several paintings transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where as of 2018 it remains.","completion":"The painting \\"Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed\\" by William Etty, which did not get distribution of reproductions, resides today in the Tate Gallery.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Select from: a). soak in a brine overnight. b). take the chicken, and rub with salt and pepper, let stand for 3 hours....I think the answer is","completion":"a). soak in a brine overnight. The correct method to make the chicken juicier before roasting is by soaking it in a brine overnight. A brine is a solution made of water, salt, and sometimes other flavorful ingredients like herbs or sugar. When you soak chicken in a brine, it helps to infuse the chicken with moisture and flavor, making it juicier and more flavorful when roasted. The other method mentioned, b). taking the chicken, and rubbing it with salt and pepper, then letting it stand for 3 hours, will primarily help in seasoning the chicken, not necessarily making it juicier. While this surface level seasoning can contribute to some flavor development, it won't have the same impact on the overall juiciness and moisture retention as brining would."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . Options: (I) negative. (II) positive.","completion":"The sentiment of the following sentence is negative (Option I): \\"Is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors.\\" To understand the sentiment behind the sentence, it is important to break down the adjectives and phrases used: 1. \\"Insultingly\\": This adverb is used to describe something that is offensive or disrespectful. When used to qualify the examination of grief and its effects on the relationships of the survivors, it implies that the examination is not only flawed but also potentially offensive. 2. \\"Inept\\": This adjective refers to a lack of skill, competence, or ability in a certain area. By describing the examination as inept, it further reinforces the negative sentiment, suggesting that the examination is poorly executed and does not offer any valuable or meaningful insights. 3. \\"Artificial\\": This adjective is often used to describe something that is lacking in authenticity, sincerity, or natural quality. When applied to an examination of grief, it suggests that the analysis may be superficial or contrived, rather than genuine or insightful. The combination of these words and the overall tone of the sentence clearly indicates a negative sentiment. The focus on the shortcomings and flaws of the examination of grief and its impacts indicates that the author is dissatisfied with the content and execution of the analysis, leading to the conclusion that the sentiment is negative."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? the thornier aspects","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"the thornier aspects\\" can be perceived as negative, depending on the context in which it is used. The term \\"thorny\\" typically denotes a situation or subject that is particularly difficult, complex, or problematic. Here, it is worth mentioning that sentiment analysis can be subjective, and without additional context, it might be challenging to determine the sentiment accurately. The adjective \\"thorny\\" is often used to describe prickly or spiky plants like thorn bushes; however, when it is symbolically applied to various subjects or situations, it is usually suggestive of a challenging or uncomfortable nature. The word \\"aspects\\" refers to various features, elements, or perspectives of a particular situation or topic. Combining these two words, \\"thornier aspects\\" implies that the situation or matter being discussed involves some complicated, hard-to-solve, or even contentious elements. In most cases, the phrase denotes a sense of negativity or discomfort related to the aspects being referred to precisely because they're tangled or riddled with potential issues that are difficult to navigate. However, given that the provided sentence fragment doesn't offer specific context, one cannot definitively state the sentiment as positive or negative without knowing its relationship with the overall statement. For example, if this sentence is used in a context like, \\"After hours of discussion, the group finally addressed the thornier aspects of the proposed legislation,\\" then the sentiment can be considered negative as it implies challenges or difficulty in the aspects discussed. On the other hand, if the context is along the lines of, \\"The team developed creative solutions for the thornier aspects of the project,\\" the sentiment could be seen as positive, where the thornier aspects were being successfully handled. To conclude, the sentiment of the phrase \\"the thornier aspects\\" is generally negative, primarily due to its association with complexity and difficulty. However, without a clear context and understanding of the subject matter, it is not possible to ascertain the sentiment definitively since it can be influenced by the surrounding phrases or overall nature of the discussion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Context_1 : 20 Years Of Dysfunction is a DVD/CD released in 2005 by crossover thrash band Stormtroopers Of Death. Mainly created by singer Billy Milano, the material for the 2-disc DVD/CD is mostly culled from fan-shot amateur footage. The relative scarceness of available material has resulted in some hilarious decisions by the production team; for instance, \\"Milk\\" is sung by Danny Lilker but the video footage inappropriately shows vocalist Milano singing. Also notable is that the DVD does not include any material from the second Stormtroopers Of Death studio album \\"Bigger Than The Devil\\". Context_2 : Thrash of the Titans was a benefit concert held on August 11, 2001 at the Maritime Hall in San Francisco, CA. The concert was a co-benefit for Testament vocalist Chuck Billy, who was diagnosed with germ cell seminoma (a rare form of cancer); and Chuck Schuldiner, leader of the death metal band Death, who was also battling cancer. The Master of Ceremonies for the evening was S.O.D. vocalist Billy Milano. The concert was organized by Walter Morgan. The show was announced in May 2001, and all 2300 tickets quickly sold out. Context_3 : Biohazard is an American heavy metal band formed in Brooklyn, New York in 1987. They are acknowledged as one of the earliest bands to fuse hardcore punk and heavy metal with elements of hip hop. The earliest lineup consisted of bassist/vocalist Evan Seinfeld, guitarist Bobby Hambel, and drummer Anthony Meo. Guitarist/vocalist Billy Graziadei would join the band soon after, changing the band to a four-piece. Since February 2016, the lineup has consisted of Billy Graziadei, Bobby Hambel and Danny Schuler. Context_4 : Billy Milano is a Bronx-born heavy metal musician now based in Austin, Texas. He is the singer and - occasionally - guitarist and bassist of crossover thrash band M.O.D., and he was also the singer of its predecessor, Stormtroopers of Death. He was also the singer of United Forces, which also featured his Stormtroopers of Death bandmate Dan Lilker. Context_5 : Buffalo was an Australian rock band formed in August 1971 by founding mainstay Dave Tice on lead vocals (ex-Head). Fellow founders, also from Head, were Paul Balbi on drums, John Baxter on guitar, and Peter Wells on bass guitar; together with Alan Milano on lead vocals (ex-Mandala). Milano left after their debut album, \\"Dead Forever...\\" (June 1972), and Balbi was replaced on drums by Jimmy Economou. Their next two albums, \\"Volcanic Rock\\" (July 1973) and \\"Only Want You For Your Body\\" (June 1974), were also issued by Vertigo Records. After 1975 line-up changes resulted in a more commercial sound and the group disbanded in March 1977. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane noted that there was \\"nothing subtle about Buffalo's primal, heavyweight sound, but it was delivered with a great deal of conviction ... combining the dense, occult riffing ... with the progressive blues chops ... the band certainly captured the arrogant disposition of the times in a bold and thunderous fashion\\". Alongside Billy Thorpe & The Aztecs and Blackfeather, Buffalo pioneered Australia's heavy metal, pub rock and alternative rock movements. Peter Wells died on 27 March 2006, aged 58. Context_6 : Daniel A. \\"Dan\\" Lilker (born October 18, 1964 in Bayside, New York) is a musician from the United States, most known as a bass player, but also guitarist, pianist, drummer and vocalist. He is the bassist for the thrash metal band Nuclear Assault and was a founding member of Anthrax with Scott Ian, (Lilker was then playing rhythm guitar) and recorded bass guitar and co-wrote on their first album, \\"Fistful of Metal\\". He also founded crossover band Stormtroopers of Death with Scott Ian and Charlie Benante (from Anthrax), and Billy Milano (Anthrax roadie, M.O.D. singer). He also plays bass with Brutal Truth, Exit-13, Malformed Earthborn, The Ravenous, Overlord Exterminator, Venomous Concept, Crucifist, Nokturnal Hellstorm and Extra Hot Sauce. Context_7 : Something's Gotta Give is the fifth full-length studio album by New York hardcore band, Agnostic Front. It was released in June 1998 on Epitaph Records and follows 1995's \\"Raw Unleashed\\" compilation album. It is actually the first studio album since 1992's \\"One Voice\\". The album was co-produced by Billy Milano, the frontman of crossover thrash bands S.O.D. and M.O.D.. It marks a return to a more hardcore punk style of sound than the thrash metal inspired music of \\"One Voice\\". Backing vocals, amongst others, were provided by Tim Armstrong and Lars Frederiksen of Rancid, and Jimmy Gestapo of Murphy's Law. Context_8 : M.O.D. (abbreviation for Method of Destruction) is a crossover thrash band from New York City, fronted by Stormtroopers of Death vocalist Billy Milano. The band has been around for 31 years (minus one hiatus from 1997 to 2001), and released eight studio albums. With M.O.D., Milano sought to continue on the musical path of the bands Anthrax, Stormtroopers of Death and Nuclear Assault, mixing shades of hardcore punk with thrash metal and often humorous and politically incorrect lyrics. Context_9 : Zoetrope was an American heavy metal band from Chicago, Illinois. Although their sound was akin to thrash metal, the group described themselves as \\"Street Metal\\". The group was formed in 1976 by teenage friends Barry Stern (drums/vocals), Kevin Michael Rasofsky, aka Kevin Michael, (guitar), and Calvin \\"Willis\\" Humphrey (bass), soon to be joined by second guitarist Ken Black. Initially playing covers, the band soon ventured into writing their own material and released a single in 1980. Although undeniably a metal band, Zoetrope was also active in Chicago's hardcore punk scene, sharing bills with locals hardcore bands and hanging out at O'Banions, a Chicago punk bar (Ken Black and Barry Stern also produced the self-titled LP by Chicago-based hardcore band Life Sentence in 1986). Following the release of a couple of demo tapes, the group was signed to Combat Records and issued their first LP, \\"Amnesty\\", in 1985. In 1987, the band traveled to Los Angeles to record their follow up, \\"A Life of Crime\\", with producer Randy Burns (Megadeth, Nuclear Assault). During the recording sessions, Ken Black left the band and returned to Chicago to sort out substance abuse issues. He was replaced by Louis Svitek. Although Svitek appears on the album's cover, Kevin Michael later confirmed that Ken Black had finished his guitar parts before leaving Los Angeles. During the tour supporting \\"A Life of Crime\\", Svitek was recruited for M.O.D. by Billy Milano. After the tour, Barry Stern jumped ship to fellow Chicagoans Trouble. Kevin Michael eventually returned with a new line up for 1993's \\"Mind Over Splatter\\" but the band folded for good soon after. Context_10 : Stormtroopers of Death (also known as S.O.D.) were an American crossover thrash band formed in New York City in 1985. They are credited as being among the first bands to fuse hardcore punk with thrash metal into a style sometimes referred to as crossover thrash. The band is also known for reuniting Anthrax members Scott Ian (guitars) and Charlie Benante (drums) with their former bassist Dan Lilker. The song \\"Milano Mosh\\" from their 1985 debut album, \\"Speak English or Die\\", was the \\"Headbanger's Ball\\" intro anthem for many years. fact_1 : M.O.D.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What non-native plant species are considered noxious? from the following article ? Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from 4,600 to 13,804 ft (1,402 to 4,207 m), which is more than 9,000 ft (2,700 m), the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to 9,000 ft (2,700 m). At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25 percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13 percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.Exotic species of flora that are not native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These non-native plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas...

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose album changed perceived notions about the number of successful singles that could be taken from one album? ? Blender described Jackson as the \\"late 20th century's preeminent pop icon\\", while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a \\"musical phenomenon\\" and that \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\\". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\". Time magazine speculated that \\"the fallout from Thriller has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of 4.1 billion\\".

Conversely, Stylus Magazine's Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album \\"embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today\\". According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, Smiley Smile is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album \\"can be thought of as a kind of protomiminal rock music\\". He continues: Smiley Smile can almost be considered a work of art music in the Western classical tradition, and its innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces. Yet there is also a spirit of tentativeness in Smiley Smile. We must remember that it was essentially a Plan B—that is, the album issued instead of Smile. The Beach Boys recorded using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked many of the technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such as a replacement for what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how \\"Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and that was part of the vocals on one of those songs.\\" Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in \\"With Me Tonight\\", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice... answer the following question: What is the full name of the man who was the engineer on the album that had the spirit of experimentation?

Answer the above question based on the context below: Barbie stars as Genevieve, one of twelve princesses who live in a castle with their widowed father, King Randolph. The princesses have adventurous and free-spirited natures that are viewed as \\"unladylike\\" and \\"non-proper\\" by other members of the royal society. This leads King Randolph to summon his cousin, Duchess Rowena, to the castle to help raise the princesses. Unbeknownst to King Randolph, Rowena plans to poison him and get rid of his daughters so that she can become queen. Attempting to break the princesses' spirits, Rowena makes their lives miserable by stripping the castle of everything they love, making them wear grey dresses and banishing singing and dancing. The princesses find comfort in their late mother's favorite story, which tells of a magical kingdom where golden flowers grant wishes and princesses can dance at an enchanted pavilion for three nights. The princesses realize that the story contains clues on how to enter the magical kingdom from their own bedroom, by dancing on specific stones on the floor from oldest to youngest. Now inside the magical kingdom, the princesses discover that the water there possesses healing properties. The next day, the princesses appear tired and the duchess finds their new dancing shoes worn through, arousing her suspicion. The royal cobbler and Genevieve's love interest, Derek, comes to fix their shoes and sees that they are covered in gold dust. When King Randolph mysteriously falls ill, Genevieve is prompted to ask Derek to investigate Rowena's true intentions. That night, the princesses return to the magical kingdom to dance. During this time, Derek discovers that Rowena is stealing heirlooms from the castle and dealing with an apothecary, and he rushes back to the castle. Answer:","completion":"In the given context, King Randolph is planned to be poisoned by his cousin, Duchess Rowena. Unaware of her malicious intent, King Randolph invites Rowena to the castle to help raise his twelve princess daughters, who possess adventurous and free-spirited natures that are disapproved of by the royal society. Rowena has a hidden agenda—to poison King Randolph and eliminate his daughters, ultimately allowing her to seize the throne and become queen. In an effort to break the princesses' spirits, Rowena takes away the things they cherish and imposes strict and joyless rules upon them. Despite these challenges, the princesses find solace in their late mother's favorite story, which leads them to a magical kingdom where they can temporarily escape their dismal reality. While Rowena's scheme is unfolding, the royal cobbler Derek (who is also Genevieve's love interest) becomes involved in the story when he notices that the princesses' dancing shoes are covered in gold dust, a clue to their adventures in the magical kingdom. As King Randolph suddenly falls ill, Genevieve suspects foul play and asks Derek to further investigate Rowena's true intentions. During the princesses' visit to the magical kingdom, Derek uncovers evidence that Rowena is not only stealing precious heirlooms from the castle but is also in league with an apothecary. It becomes clear that Rowena is responsible for King Randolph's mysterious illness, and that her ultimate goal is to poison the king and dispose of his daughters to seize power. Thus, Derek's timely intervention and the strong bond among the princesses become crucial in thwarting Rowena's nefarious plans and saving their family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The ultimate goal is living within your financial means, both short- and long-term. Pay attention to the ways you’re spending money. Perhaps the most important aspect of preparing yourself to become financially independent is ensuring that you are not spending more than you’re making. Fortunately, there are several methods to track your spending: Use a ledger or a spreadsheet. The manual approach is great way to start, as it makes you keenly aware of every expense. Whatever you use, the act of entering every expense into a database of your expenses will keep you better informed of your own spending patterns. Use free accounting software. Once you have multiple bank accounts, and different types of income and expenditures, your ability to organize the corresponding information may demand more than your spreadsheet skills can handle. Online platforms such as Personal Capital and Mint are free and immensely helpful. For more specific advice, see How to Manage Your Money Wisely. With an eye towards making immediate improvements in your financial behavior, evaluate how you spend most of your money. There are everyday expenses many people often overlook that can hamper your ability to live within your financial means. Because a handful of expenses consume most of your budget, pursue these first and minimize common types of spending. Minimize rent or mortgage payments. Choose your home based on the cost of living in the area. Go for as little home as you’re comfortable in — both when buying or renting. Consider purchasing a duplex and renting out one side or renting out rooms in your home. Reduce your reliance on vehicles. Vehicles not only diminish the quality of our environment, they are also associated with substantial financial costs. Walking, biking, and taking the bus will reduce your spending immediately. Clothing, food, and leisure are areas in which many people spend far more than is appropriate, given their income. Remember that even everyday decisions regarding your method of transportation or eating habits can be the difference between overspending and being able to begin saving for financial independence. Buy what you can used. Thrift stores and craigslist offer high quality items for only a fraction of what they would cost new. Do it yourself. From home repair to vegetable gardening, you can save money (and increase your worldly wisdom) by taking matters into your own hands. There’s also an undeniable sense of satisfaction fixing something yourself or growing the ingredients to make yourself a salad from your own yard. Understand that debt does not necessarily prevent you from becoming financially independent. Also recognize that you don’t need to pay it off as quickly as possible. Pay off debt steadily, but within your ability to do so while achieving financial stability. Most importantly, do not take on unnecessary debts. When paying off debt, start with high-interest debt, like credit cards and auto loans, before paying off student loans. Don’t take on new debt. Your education is a reasonable expense to take out loans for, as it is an investment in yourself. Even a car loan can be justifiable if it is the only way you can afford to buy a vehicle. Continually increasingly credit card debt, however, is blatantly irresponsible. Not only is taking on new debt a clear sign that you are not living within your means, continually acquiring debt will ensure that you are unable to achieve financial independence. Never finance a vacation, new clothes, or even unnecessary food purchases with a credit card. A good rule to follow: only take on debt for investments, not for lifestyle.

He was the de facto leader of post-war Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomulka was initially very popular for his reforms; his seeking a \\"Polish way to socialism\\"; and giving rise to the period known as \\"Gomulka's thaw\\". Context: Wladyslaw Gomulka was born on 6 February 1905 in Bialobrzegi Franciszkanskie village on the outskirts of Krosno, into a worker's family living in the Austrian Partition (the Galicia region). His parents had met and married in the United States, where each had emigrated in search of work in the late 19th century, but returned to occupied Poland in the early 20th century because Wladyslaw's father Jan was unable to find gainful employment in America. Jan Gomulka then worked as a laborer in the Subcarpathian oil industry. Wladyslaw's older sister Jozefa, born in the US, returned there upon turning eighteen to join her extended family, most of whom had emigrated, and to preserve her US citizenship. Wladyslaw and his two other siblings experienced a childhood of the proverbial Galician poverty: they lived in a dilapidated hut and ate mostly potatoes. Wladyslaw received only rudimentary education before being employed in the oil industry of the region. Gomulka attended schools in Krosno for six or seven years, until the age of thirteen, when he had to start an apprenticeship in a metalworks shop. Throughout his life Gomulka was an avid reader and accomplished a great deal of self-education, but remained a subject of jokes because of his lack of formal education and demeanor. In 1922, Gomulka passed his apprenticeship exams and began working at a local refinery. The re-established Polish state of Gomulka's teen years was a scene of growing political polarization and radicalization. The young worker developed connections with the radical Left, joining the Sila (Power) youth organization in 1922 and the Independent Peasant Party in 1925. Gomulka was known for his activism in the metal workers and, from 1922, chemical industry unions. He was involved in union-organized strikes and in 1924, during a protest gathering in Krosno, participated in a polemical debate with Herman Lieberman. He published radical texts in leftist newspapers. In May 1926 the young Gomulka was for the first time arrested, but soon released because of worker demands. The incident was the subject of a parliamentary intervention by the Peasant Party. In October 1926, Gomulka became a secretary of the managing council in the Chemical Industry Workers Union for the Drohobych District and remained involved with that communist-dominated union until 1930. He around this time learned on his own basic Ukrainian. Question: Where was he born?.

Wilhelm Richard Wagner (; German: ['RicaRt 'va:gna] In 1833, Wagner's brother Albert managed to obtain for him a position as choir master at the theatre in Wurzburg. In the same year, at the age of 20, Wagner composed his first complete opera, Die Feen (The Fairies). This work, which imitated the style of Weber, went unproduced until half a century later, when it was premiered in Munich shortly after the composer's death in 1883. Having returned to Leipzig in 1834, Wagner held a brief appointment as musical director at the opera house in Magdeburg during which he wrote Das Liebesverbot (The Ban on Love), based on Shakespeare's Measure for Measure. This was staged at Magdeburg in 1836 but closed before the second performance; this, together with the financial collapse of the theatre company employing him, left the composer in bankruptcy. Wagner had fallen for one of the leading ladies at Magdeburg, the actress Christine Wilhelmine \\"Minna\\" Planer and after the disaster of Das Liebesverbot he followed her to Konigsberg, where she helped him to get an engagement at the theatre. The two married in Tragheim Church on 24 November 1836. In May 1837, Minna left Wagner for another man, and this was but only the first debacle of a tempestuous marriage. In June 1837, Wagner moved to Riga (then in the Russian Empire), where he became music director of the local opera; having in this capacity engaged Minna's sister Amalie (also a singer) for the theatre, he presently resumed relations with Minna during 1838. By 1839, the couple had amassed such large debts that they fled Riga on the run from creditors. Debts would plague Wagner for most of his life. Initially they took a stormy sea passage to London, from which Wagner drew the inspiration for his opera Der fliegende Hollander (The Flying Dutchman), with a plot based on a sketch by Heinrich Heine. The Wagners settled in Paris in September 1839 and stayed there until 1842. Wagner made a scant living by writing articles and short novelettes such as A pilgrimage to Beethoven, which sketched his growing concept of \\"music drama\\", and An end in Paris, where he depicts his own miseries as a German musician in the French metropolis. He also provided arrangements of operas by other composers, largely on behalf of the Schlesinger publishing house. During this stay he completed his third and fourth operas Rienzi and Der fliegende Hollander.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What kind of pieces did Wagner start out writing?","completion":"In the provided text, it states that Wagner \\"composed his first complete opera, Die Feen (The Fairies)\\" at the age of 20.

Born Millicent Lilian Entwistle in Wales on February 5, 1908, she was a British stage actress with aspirations of stardom. She dreamed of making a name for herself in the film industry in Hollywood during the 1920s and 1930s. Peg Entwistle began her acting career in New York, performing in various Broadway plays; her most significant role was in the running play titled \\"Tommy\\" in 1925. Despite her accolades, she moved to Los Angeles in 1932 in hopes of launching a successful film career. Her decision to move west came after a series of personal struggles, including her husband, fellow actor Robert Keith, divorcing her, which left her heartbroken and desperate for a fresh start. Living in Los Angeles with her uncle, she finally landed a role in RKO Studio's film \\"Thirteen Women.\\" Sadly, the critics' harsh reviews for the film and her role in it were devastating to her confidence and stirred feelings of failure. Moreover, it was during the Great Depression, which made it challenging for aspiring actors to find work in the already competitive Hollywood scene. On the night of September 16, 1932, the 24-year-old actress climbed the steep terrain of Mount Lee to the Hollywoodland sign (as it read then) and scaled a workman's ladder to the top of the letter \\"H.\\" She then took off her coat, folded it, placed her purse that also contained her suicide note, and leaped to her death. Peg's body was found by a passerby two days later, and her cause of death was officially declared a suicide. The media extensively covered her tragic story, turning her into somewhat of a symbol of the shattered dreams of aspiring actors. Though Peg Entwistle's life was short and marred by darkness, it's essential to recall that she was a talented actress who had shown promise in her work in both theater and film. Peg's story serves as a reminder of the hardships and heartbreak many actors face in their quest for success in the film industry, as well as the importance of mental health awareness and the need to support those struggling with depression and feelings of failure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This method involves creating a 2D array to store lengths of LCS and filling the array by comparing elements of the two lists. The steps to find the LCS are as follows: 1. Initialize the 2D array \\"lengths\\" with dimensions (len(A) + 1) x (len(B) + 1), and fill it with 0s. 2. Iterate through the elements of list A. 3. Inside this loop, iterate through the elements of list B. 4. Compare each element of list A with each element of list B. 5. If the elements match, update the corresponding entry in \\"lengths\\" by adding 1 to the length of the LCS found so far (lengths[i - 1][j - 1] + 1). 6. If the elements don't match, update the corresponding entry in \\"lengths\\" with the maximum of the LCS lengths found so far (max(lengths[i - 1][j], lengths[i][j - 1])). 7. Once the \\"lengths\\" array is filled, backtrack to find the LCS. Here is the Python code to solve the problem: \`\`\`python def lcs(A, B): lengths = [[0] * (len(B) + 1) for _ in range(len(A) + 1)] for i, x in enumerate(A): for j, y in enumerate(B): if x == y: lengths[i + 1][j + 1] = lengths[i][j] + 1 else: lengths[i + 1][j + 1] = max(lengths[i + 1][j], lengths[i][j + 1]) result = [] i, j = len(A), len(B) while i != 0 and j != 0: if lengths[i][j] == lengths[i - 1][j]: i -= 1 elif lengths[i][j] == lengths[i][j - 1]: j -= 1 else: assert A[i - 1] == B[j - 1] result.append(A[i - 1]) i -= 1 j -= 1 return result[::-1] A = [6927, 'J', 4321, 5361, '7623', '2389', '549', '4727', 'j', 'v', 'I', 'i', '1995', '6401', '2735', 'G', 'm', '9651', 'S', '6803', 'Y', 1825, 'T', 3683, 'e', 'D', 8473, 5407, 4845, 'p', 'L', 6003, 4377] B = ['O', 'V', 1139, 'n', '7623', '2389', '549', '4727', 'j', 'v', 'I', 'i', '1995', '6401', '2735', 'G', 'm', '9651', 'S', '6803', 'V', 'd', 4141, 877, 'Q', 6405, 'F', 'u'] output = lcs(A, B) print(output) \`\`\` Output: \`\`\`python ['7623', '2389', '549', '4727', 'j', 'v', 'I', 'i', '1995', '6401', '2735', 'G', 'm', '9651', 'S', '6803'] \`\`\` So, the longest common subsequence in the given lists A and B is ['7623', '2389', '549', '4727', 'j', 'v', 'I', 'i', '1995', '6401', '2735', 'G', 'm', '9651', 'S', '6803']."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tyler was born Liv Rundgren at Mount Sinai Hospital in East Harlem, New York. She is the only daughter of Bebe Buell, a model, singer, and former Playboy Playmate (Miss November 1974), and Steven Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith. Her mother named her after Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann, after seeing Ullmann on the cover of the March 5, 1977 issue of TV Guide. She is of Italian, German, Polish, English and African American ancestry on her father's side and German ancestry on her mother's side. In 2001, Tyler played the object of infatuation for three men (Matt Dillon, John Goodman, and Paul Reiser) in the comedy One Night at McCool's. In discussion of the role, she said it was \\"definitely the first part where I had to be so physically aware and have people so aware of me physically. Maybe it's not hard for anybody else, but it is a bit for me. I mean I love my body and I feel very comfortable in my skin but this was tough.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"Tyler, a true beauty, gives the role a valiant try, but her range is too limited to play this amalgam of female perfection.\\" In 2001, she starred in the feature film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, directed by Peter Jackson. She played the Elf maiden Arwen Undomiel. The film is based on the first volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in Plunkett & Macleane. She learned to speak the fictitious Elvish language that was created by Tolkien. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle noted that Tyler's performance was \\"lovely and earnest\\". A year later, Tyler again starred as Arwen in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the second installment of the series. The film received favorable reviews. She spent months learning sword fighting to be used during the concluding battle scenes in The Two Towers, but her scenes were removed after the script was changed. The film was an enormous box office success, earning over 926 million worldwide, out-grossing its predecessor, which earned over 871 million. In 2003, Tyler featured in the third and last installment of the series, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Following the success of The Lord of the Rings, she appeared opposite her Armageddon co-star Ben Affleck in writer-director Kevin Smith's romantic comedy Jersey Girl (2004), playing a woman who meets a widowed father played by Affleck, re-opening his heart to love. In an interview with MTV News, Tyler confessed that she felt \\"scared and vulnerable\\" while filming Jersey Girl, adding \\"I was so used to those other elements of the character [Arwen]. On The Lord of the Rings, a lot of things were done in post-production, whereas this was really just about me and Ben sitting there, just shooting off dialogue.\\" However, she reiterated that doing Jersey Girl was what she wanted to do. In 2005, she appeared in Steve Buscemi's independent drama Lonesome Jim, where she was cast alongside Casey Affleck, as a single mother and nurse who reconnects with an old fling who has returned to their small town in Indiana after a failed run as a novelist in New York. The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize. Her next appearance in film was in a supporting role as an insightful therapist who tries to help a once-successful dentist (Adam Sandler) cope with the loss of his family in the September 11th attacks in Reign Over Me (2007).

Given the following context: The historic center of San Francisco is the northeast quadrant of the city anchored by Market Street and the waterfront. It is here that the Financial District is centered, with Union Square, the principal shopping and hotel district, and the Tenderloin nearby. Cable cars carry riders up steep inclines to the summit of Nob Hill, once the home of the city's business tycoons, and down to the waterfront tourist attractions of Fisherman's Wharf, and Pier 39, where many restaurants feature Dungeness crab from a still-active fishing industry. Also in this quadrant are Russian Hill, a residential neighborhood with the famously crooked Lombard Street; North Beach, the city's Little Italy and the former center of the Beat Generation; and Telegraph Hill, which features Coit Tower. Abutting Russian Hill and North Beach is San Francisco's Chinatown, the oldest Chinatown in North America. The South of Market, which was once San Francisco's industrial core, has seen significant redevelopment following the construction of AT&T Park and an infusion of startup companies. New skyscrapers, live-work lofts, and condominiums dot the area. Further development is taking place just to the south in Mission Bay area, a former railroad yard, which now has a second campus of the University of California, San Francisco, and where the new Warriors arena will be built.West of downtown, across Van Ness Avenue, lies the large Western Addition neighborhood, which became established with a large African American population after World War II. The Western Addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including Hayes Valley, the Fillmore, and Japantown, which was once the largest Japantown in North America but suffered when its Japanese American residents were forcibly removed and interned during World War II. The Western Addition survived the 1906 earthquake with its Victorians largely intact, including the famous \\"Painted Ladies\\", standing alongside Alamo Square.

Feel around the root with your hands and look for noticeable spots of rot. Peeled ginger will darken around the edges when it starts to go bad. Cut off the ends of the root with a sharp chef’s knife. Cutting a little off of each side will make it easier to hold the ginger rather than working with an irregular shape. Try to only cut off a small portion from the edges so you do not waste any of the usable ginger. Stand the ginger on one of its ends, and use a sharp knife or vegetable peeler to remove the rest of the skin. Slice in a downward motion towards the cutting board. Remember to try and remove as little of the skin as possible. Alternatively, you can use the edge of a spoon to scrape the peel off of fresh ginger. This works especially well on the rounded knobs that may be difficult to reach with a knife. Peeled ginger should be stored in a freezer-safe resealable bag and keeps for 1 week. Frozen ginger is easier to grate since it hardens up. Unpeeled ginger keeps in the freezer for up to 3 months. Allow it time to thaw before peeling it. Peeled ginger can be grated as soon as it’s pulled out from the freezer.","completion":"Ensure ginger is solid and free of soft spots or rot. Cut off the ends to make it easier to hold.

The gun was pointed at Felicia but not at Laura , so","completion":"Felicia's heart raced uncontrollably as Laura stood frozen in terror, unable to move or scream. They had been enjoying a typical girls' night out, wandering through the vibrant downtown streets, laughing and gossiping about the events of the week. But that all changed when the man, who had been eerily stalking them since they left the pub, finally approached them. His once harmless expression had morphed into a menacing scowl as he brandished his firearm. The metallic glint of the pistol glared menacingly at Felicia, forcing her to swallow her fear and take control of the situation. She glanced at Laura, noticing the panic invading her friend's eyes, and sent her a reassuring nod, trying to channel some of the courage she didn't know she possessed. \\"Alright, just stay calm,\\" Felicia said evenly, maintaining eye contact with the stranger. \\"What do you want?\\" The gun-wielding man looked at her with a sinister grin, clearly enjoying the power he held over the two young women. \\"You will give me your wallets, phones, and any jewelry you have on,\\" he spat, his voice tinged with malice. As the girls began to nervously comply with his demands, Felicia's mind raced to find a way out of this dreadful situation. She noticed a small crowd forming nearby, as curious onlookers slowly discovered the unfolding drama. Felicia looked back to the man and said, \\"Okay, we'll give you what you want, just please don't hurt us.\\" As they handed over their belongings, Laura discreetly caught the eye of a man standing not too far from the scene, signaling for help. The observer nodded subtly and slipped away, presumably to call the police. The thief seemed satisfied with their compliance, but feeling emboldened by his dominance, he barked out an additional command. \\"Now, start walking down that alley!\\" He gestured at the narrow space between two buildings just down the street. Felicia and Laura's hearts sank. They knew they had to buy time for help to arrive, but how? Felicia realized they needed to maintain control of the situation even if it meant prolonging their torment. She glanced at the dimly lit alley, noting its relative seclusion, and formulated a plan. \\"Alright, but you better not try anything in there,\\" Felicia warned the man, her voice brimming with an indignant courage she did not truly feel. They began walking towards the alley, their minds working in tandem to prolong the journey. Laura pretended to trip, falling to the ground dramatically. The gunman grew impatient and yanked her to her feet, but Felicia noticed his grip on the weapon had weakened ever so slightly. Still edging towards the alley, Felicia accidentally bumped into a stack of empty cans, sending them crashing to the ground and causing a racket that attracted the attention of even more bystanders. The gunman was getting increasingly agitated, sensing that his time was running out. He raised the gun once more, his hand shaking slightly. \\"One more slip-up and I swear I'll –\\" His threat was interrupted by the sound of sirens approaching in the distance. Panic flashed across his face, quickly replaced by a snarl of anger. \\"You think you're so smart, don't you?\\" Suddenly, Felicia saw her opportunity. She mustered all the strength she could and threw her leg up, connecting with the man's hand in a swift, solid kick. The gun flew from his grip, skittering across the pavement and out of reach. Without wasting a moment, Felicia and Laura sprinted towards the crowd that had just begun to disperse at the sound of the gun. The frenzied thief was hot on their heels, his rage fueling his impulsive pursuit. As they reached the crowd, the approaching police intercepted the pursuing man, tackling him to the ground with a cacophony of shouts and struggling limbs. Felicia and Laura collapsed against a nearby wall, their hearts pounding even louder than the sirens that now filled the air. They embraced each other tightly, their fingers digging into each other's skin in a desperate bid for grounding. Together they had faced their nightmare and had come out the other side stronger, more united than ever before. And as they looked at each other, tears of relief streaming down their cheeks, they knew that they would never again take their bond for granted, grateful for one another's presence in their darkest hour."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Palmyra (; Palmyrene: Tadmor; Arabic: تَدْمُر‎ Tadmur) is an ancient Semitic city in present-day Homs Governorate, Syria. Archaeological finds date back to the Neolithic period, and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BC. Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the Roman Empire in the first century AD. The city grew wealthy from trade caravans; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the Silk Road and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the Great Colonnade, the Temple of Bel, and the distinctive tower tombs. Ethnically, the Palmyrenes combined elements of Amorites, Arameans, and Arabs. The city's social structure was tribal, and its inhabitants spoke Palmyrene (a dialect of Aramaic), while using Greek for commercial and diplomatic purposes. Greco-Roman culture influenced the culture of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped local Semitic deities, Mesopotamian and Arab gods. By the third century AD Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center. It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated Persian Emperor Shapur I. The king was succeeded by regent Queen Zenobia, who rebelled against Rome and established the Palmyrene Empire. In 273, Roman emperor Aurelian destroyed the city, which was later restored by Diocletian at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to Christianity during the fourth century and to Islam in the centuries following the conquest by the 7th-century Rashidun Caliphate, after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by Arabic. Before AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to the Roman province of Syria, having its political organization influenced by the Greek city-state model during the first two centuries AD. The city became a... A:","completion":"The name of the ruler who succeeded the leader that defeated the Persian Emperor Shapur I is Queen Zenobia.

Street art has become a global culture and even art museums are collecting the works of street artists. People have different opinions about street art. Some think it is bad, but others think it is a very beautiful new culture. Street art began in New York in the 1960s. This style of drawing and writing became know as graffiti. Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. One well-known New York street artist is Swoon. She cuts paper pictures of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start as street artist. She studied art but, later, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. Nowadays the Internet has a big influence on street art. Artists can show their pictures to people around the world.

Question: what is vitamin a for I found the following answer on Google: It is also commercially produced and administered as esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"While the answer you found on Google refers to the commercial production and administration of vitamin A in the form of retinyl esters (such as retinyl acetate or palmitate), it does not directly answer what Vitamin A is for. Let me provide you with a detailed answer. Vitamin A is a group of fat-soluble organic compounds that are essential for various bodily functions. The two main forms of vitamin A are preformed vitamin A (retinol and its esterified forms, like retinyl acetate or palmitate) and provitamin A carotenoids (largely beta carotene), which can be converted to active retinol in the body. Vitamin A has several crucial functions, including: 1. Vision - Vitamin A (particularly its derivative, retinal) is a vital component of the light-sensitive proteins called rhodopsin and iodopsin in the retina, enabling proper light perception and color vision. 2. Immune system - Vitamin A maintains the integrity of epithelial cells, which serve as the body's first line of defense against infections. It also supports the production and functioning of various immune cells. 3. Growth and reproduction - Vitamin A is essential for normal growth and development, including embryonic development. It is involved in the formation and maintenance of the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other vital organs. 4. Cell differentiation and gene expression - As a component of retinoic acid, vitamin A modulates the expression of genes and regulates the differentiation of various cell types. In summary, Vitamin A plays a vital role in maintaining healthy vision, supporting the immune system, enabling proper growth and reproduction, and regulating cell differentiation and gene expression.

Hull made a bright start to the game, with David Meyler capitalizing on some lapse goalkeeping to slot in a goal, giving the visitors an early lead. The excitement continued when Andy Robertson made his debut mark on the team, firing a clever finish from a tight angle and effectively doubling Hull's lead in the 12th minute. His goal solidified Hull's dominance in the match, and they looked to be in control as they weathered Stuttgart's attacks. However, Stuttgart was not willing to go down without a fight. Vedad Ibisevic, a Bosnia-Herzegovina international, managed to put his team on the scoreboard just before the break with a powerful shot from 20 yards out. This goal came after Hull's goalkeeper, Steve Harper, made an impressive save to keep out a penalty attempt from Ibisevic towards the end of the half. Despite Ibisevic's efforts, Hull maintained their composure and continued to dominate the match, showing that they were not to be intimidated by their Bundesliga opponents. They could have potentially extended their lead further, but in the end, Hull emerged victorious. The result allowed Steve Bruce's side to finish their pre-season games on a high note, with an unbeaten streak that undoubtedly boosted the team's morale going into the new season.

Paraphrasing is a technique used to present information in a different way while retaining its original meaning, and these examples are a clear demonstration of this concept at work. The first sentence reads, \\"He was born in 1951 in Mauritius (Quatre Bornes) and died in 2002.\\" The chronological order of the events (birth and death) are presented in this sentence, with the specific location of the birth (Quatre Bornes, Mauritius) indicated in brackets.

Both sentences successfully convey the birth and death details of the person in question, albeit with slightly different emphases and textual flow.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: John is a chemical engineer with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to develop a drug that can be absorbed by the system in different rates. To that end, he conducted two experiments. In one case, he used lower concentrations of reactants, he called it case A. Then he used the same reactants in a higher concentration. He called it case B. But I can use this background: Collision theory tells us that molecules need to collide in order for a reaction to take place. All else being equal, anything that increases the frequency of collisions would also increase the rate of reaction. One way to do this is to increase the concentrations of one or more of the reactants. Using a real world example, a busy freeway will experience much more frequent car collisions than a fairly empty neighborhood street. Similarly, forcing more randomly moving molecules into the same amount of space will cause an increased number of collisions over a given length of time, providing the reactants with more opportunities to transform into products. What is an answer for this question: Would case A have higher or lower rate of reactions than case B? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided and considering the principles of collision theory, case B, where higher concentrations of reactants are used, would have a higher rate of reaction compared to case A with lower reactant concentrations. Collision theory states that for a reaction to occur, the reactant molecules must collide with a specific orientation and with sufficient energy. The probability and frequency of these effective collisions depend on the concentrations of the reactants involved. In case B, the higher concentration of reactants provides more molecules per unit volume, thus increasing the likelihood of these molecules colliding with one another. As a result, there would be a higher number of effective collisions over a given period of time, which translates to a higher rate of reaction. On the other hand, case A has a lower concentration of reactants. Consequently, there are fewer reactant molecules per unit volume, and the frequency of effective collisions is reduced compared to case B. This leads to a lower rate of reaction due to the decreased number of opportunities for reactant molecules to collide and transform into products. To summarize, case B, with its higher concentration of reactants, experiences a higher rate of reaction than case A due to the increased frequency of effective collisions as guided by the collision theory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I repeatedly see people asking advice on forums as to which is the best detox to do. Whenever I see this question I want to scream at the person 'no, don't do it. It is a waste of your time and money'...but I don't. I don't want to cause a scene, or start a barrage of backlash from people claiming that it worked for them. Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing. Before I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary. Why detoxes don't work Firstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies. I read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \\"shining glory\\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How did Veet convince Chinese women that any body hair was unsightly?

Here is a premise: I wanted to lighten the mood of the conversation. What is the effect? Options: a). I remained quiet.. b). I told a joke..","completion":"Based on the premise given that you wanted to lighten the mood of the conversation, it would be most effective to choose option b) \\"I told a joke.\\" Going with option a) \\"I remained quiet\\" would not create the desired effect of lightening the mood of the conversation since staying quiet does not contribute anything to the situation. Silence might even be misinterpreted as being detached or uninterested in the conversation, which could exacerbate any existing tension or awkwardness. On the other hand, option b) \\"I told a joke\\" is more likely to achieve the intended goal of lightening the mood. Sharing a joke or funny story introduces humor into the conversation, which can help in several ways: 1. Encouraging laughter: Laughter is a psychologically and physically beneficial response that can reduce stress, promote relaxation, and create a positive atmosphere. 2. Building rapport: Jokes can create common ground between people, helping them relate to one another and foster a sense of camaraderie. 3. Breaking tension: A well-placed joke can diffuse tension or awkwardness in a conversation, making everyone feel more at ease. 4. Changing focus: If the conversation had gotten heavy or drifted into an uncomfortable topic, a joke can help steer the discussion back to a lighter and more enjoyable subject. It is essential, however, to tell an appropriate joke that will not offend or alienate anyone in the conversation. A well-chosen, uncontroversial joke can effectively lighten the mood, while an offensive or inappropriate one could have the opposite effect. In conclusion, if your goal is to lighten the mood of the conversation, it is best to opt for telling a joke (option b). By doing so, you can potentially create laughter, build rapport, break tension, and change focus, contributing to a happier and more relaxed atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

People who hate the anonymity of hotels but want more luxury than a hostel often choose to stay at bed and breakfasts. \\"B&B's\\", usually someone's private home, are often found in the countryside. Hostels For those traveling on a tight budget, hostels are the best accommodation option. Informal places usually with a friendly youthful vibe , they offer dormitory beds for rent. Bathrooms are usually down the hall. Remember to check reviews by previous guests online before you book your hostel. Couch Surfing An unusual but interesting option, couch surfing is a growing trend among young internationals. The idea is that you become a member of the online couch-surfing community (www. couchsurfing. com) and then when you travel, look up other members in that country and ask to stay on their couch . Most hosts will suggest sightseeing trips and take you out in the evening, making it a great way to see things that aren't in your guidebook.

To break it down, let's first look at the premise and its details: 1. Wood Quay is the location of the original Viking settlement and The Viking Adventure. 2. The Viking Adventure's operating days and hours are Tuesday to Saturday from 10am to 4:30pm, and it is closed on both Sunday and Monday. Now let's look at the hypothesis which states that The Viking Adventure is open to visitors every day of the week. Logically, if we compare the hypothesis to the details in the premise, we can see that there is a contradiction regarding the opening days and hours of The Viking Adventure. According to the premise, The Viking Adventure is closed on Sundays and Mondays, which means it is not open every day of the week. So, the hypothesis does not align with the information provided in the premise. Therefore, if the premise is true, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true since it contradicts the information given in the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Profits were boosted by the use of new fuel efficient aircraft and what it called a \\"remarkable\\" turnaround at Spanish airline Iberia. IAG's operating profits nearly doubled to just more than €1bn. It also raised its 2015 forecast by 20%. Since the formation of IAG through the merger of BA and Iberia in 2011, Iberia has been undergoing a massive restructuring programme, with jobs and salaries being cut. Last year, Iberia made a further 1,427 redundancies following negotiations with trade unions in Spain, taking the total number of job cuts in recent years to 4,500. But the airline reported an operating profit of €50m, compared with an operating loss of €166m last year. Mr Walsh called Iberia's turnaround \\"remarkable, both financially and operationally\\" adding he was \\"very proud of its achievement especially its strong cost discipline\\". \\"In 2013 we said our intention was for Iberia to break even in 2014 and it has fulfilled that promise,\\" he added. He added he expected Iberia to continue to improve its profitability given the trajectory that it is on. \\"The performance to date for Iberia has been tremendous and we expect that to continue in 2015,\\" he said. Shares in IAG rose almost 5% to 586.50p on the London Stock Exchange. In addition to BA and Iberia, IAG also owns Spanish low-cost airline Vueling. IAG said all three of its airlines faced very competitive markets domestically and across Europe from \\"the growing presence of low-cost carriers\\". BA reported an operating profit of €1.2bn, up from €762m a year earlier, which IAG said showed \\"significant progress towards its long-term targets\\". Vueling reported a slight rise in annual operating profits to €141m. It increased capacity by 24% and added new bases in Brussels and Rome. Last month, IAG launched a €1.36bn takeover bid for Irish airline Aer Lingus, but it gave no further details on the progress of the takeover in its results statement. The Irish government, which holds a 25% stake in Aer Lingus, is believed to have concerns over the deal and trades unions have warned over jobs cuts. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh, told the BBC: \\"We'll have discussions in due course with the Irish government. \\"I'm very much focused on the fantastic results that we've announced today and looking forward to developing IAG with the existing airlines and with opportunities to expand with other airlines.\\" Summary:","completion":"IAG, the company that owns British Airways and Iberia, made a lot of money last year because they used more fuel-efficient airplanes and improved their business, especially at Iberia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

He was proficient in playing both the upright bass and the guitar and was a capable singer, but he is perhaps best known as one of the most prolific songwriters of his time. Next to Muddy Waters, Dixon is recognized as the most influential person in shaping the post-World War II sound of the Chicago blues. Dixon's songs have been recorded by countless musicians in many genres as well as by various ensembles in which he participated. Dixon signed with Chess Records as a recording artist, but he began performing less, being more involved with administrative tasks for the label. By 1951, he was a full-time employee at Chess, where he acted as producer, talent scout, session musician and staff songwriter. He was also a producer for the Chess subsidiary Checker Records. His relationship with Chess was sometimes strained, but he stayed with the label from 1948 to the early 1960s. During this time Dixon's output and influence were prodigious. From late 1956 to early 1959, he worked in a similar capacity for Cobra Records, for which he produced early singles for Otis Rush, Magic Sam, and Buddy Guy. He later recorded for Bluesville Records. From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, Dixon ran his own record label, Yambo Records, and two subsidiary labels, Supreme and Spoonful. He released his 1971 album, Peace?, on Yambo and also singles by McKinley Mitchell, Lucky Peterson and others. Dixon is considered one of the key figures in the creation of Chicago blues. He worked with Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Otis Rush, Bo Diddley, Joe Louis Walker, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, Koko Taylor, Little Milton, Eddie Boyd, Jimmy Witherspoon, Lowell Fulson, Willie Mabon, Memphis Slim, Washboard Sam, Jimmy Rogers, Sam Lay and others. In December 1964, the Rolling Stones reached number one on the UK Singles Chart with their cover of Dixon's \\"Little Red Rooster\\". In the same year, the group also covered \\"I Just Want To Make Love To You\\" on their debut album, The Rolling Stones.

Please answer a question about the following article about Napoleon: Alexander faced pressure from his brother, Duke Constantine, to make peace with Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms–demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia, and hand over the Ionian Islands to France. By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of 1,100 square miles called Westphalia. He then appointed his young brother Jérôme as the new monarch of this kingdom. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the Napoleonic era progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, the Treaties of Tilsit at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days. What was the name of the new kingdom Napoleon created from Prussian territories?","completion":"The name of the new kingdom that Napoleon created from Prussian territories was Westphalia.

You should leave your partner plenty of space to be mad at you. They deserve that. You should not be a punching bag - physically or emotionally. Your cheating is not leverage for your partner to control you or abuse you. Set boundaries as to what is okay and not okay when it comes to how you treat each other. You have to move on with your life and, if your partner agrees, your relationship. If you genuinely cannot help but cheat, then your needs are not being met in some way or you do not need a monogamous relationship. That might mean you need to discuss them with your partner, or maybe you need to see a counselor to help you through personal problems. Either way, you have to be able to trust yourself. Summary:","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of accepting one's actions, being honest about needs and desires, and setting boundaries in order to move on and rebuild trust after cheating in a relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The preferred titles are under forty words and mention the purpose of the bill. Patent Application Publication Act of 1995 - Requires each patent application, except applications for design patents and provisional applications, to be published as soon as possible after 18 months from the earliest filing date for which a benefit is sought, except for an application that is no longer pending or one subject to a secrecy order. Permits earlier publication at the applicant's request. Prohibits disclosure of information concerning published applications except as determined by the Commissioner of Patents. Prohibits, upon request by certain independent inventors, the publication of rejected applications, with specified exceptions, until three months after the Commissioner notifies the applicant. Requires the applicant to certify that no application was or will be filed for the invention in a foreign country. Entitles a patent application to claim the benefit of an earlier filing date in a foreign country if a claim therefor and a certified copy of the original foreign application, specification, and drawings upon which it is based are filed in the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) at any such time during the pendency of the application as is required by the Commissioner. Allows the Commissioner to consider the failure of the applicant to file a timely claim for priority as a waiver of any such claim. Authorizes the Commissioner to determine the time period within which an amendment containing the specific reference to an earlier filed application shall be submitted. Specifies that a patent shall include the right to obtain a reasonable royalty from any person who, during the period from publication of the application until issue of the patent: (1) makes, uses, or sells in the United States the invention as claimed in the published application or imports such an invention into the United States, or if the invention as claimed in the published application is a process, uses or sells in or imports into the United States products made by that process as claimed in such application; and (2) had actual notice or knowledge of the published patent application. Makes the right to obtain a reasonable royalty unavailable unless the invention claimed in the patent is identical to that claimed in the published application. Specifies the commencement date of the period for obtaining a royalty based upon the international publication of an international application designating the United States. Revises Federal patent law to provide that a person shall not be entitled to a patent if the invention was described in a published patent application by another filed in the United States, or in a published international application, before the invention thereof by the applicant. Directs the Commissioner to recover the cost of early publication by adjusting the filing, issue, and maintenance fees by charging a separate publication fee, or by any combination of such fees. Provides for the extension of the term of a patent the issue which is delayed due to an unusual administrative delay by the PTO. Limits the total duration of all extensions to ten years. Reduces the extension period equal to the time during the processing or examination of the application leading to the patent in which the applicant failed to engage in reasonable efforts (current law provides a reduction for lack of due diligence) to conclude processing or examination of the application. Prohibits the extension of a patent the term of which has been disclaimed beyond the expiration date of the disclaimer.

With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \\"Father Christmas\\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist Ian Gibbons was recruited for the subsequent tour, and became a permanent member of the group.

In etymology, the \\"cognate\\" category excludes doublets and loanwords. The word \\"cognate\\" derives from the Latin noun \\"cognatus\\", which means \\"blood relative\\". - Mount Passaconaway is a mountain in the Sandwich Range Wilderness of the White Mountain National Forest near the eastern boundary of Waterville Valley . It is named after Passaconaway , a 16th - century sachem of the Pennacook tribe , whose name was also attached to a small village in Albany , where the northern trailhead is now located . It is ranked 42d in elevation on the list of 48 White Mountains four - thousand footers . On the original 1931 list of 4000 - footers , it was ranked 26th , with an elevation of 4,116 feet , although the 1931 topographic map shows it as 4,060 feet . The 1987 USGS topographic map indicates it is 4,043 , while the elevation recorded in the USGS Geographic Names Information System is 4,019 ft. The thickly wooded , unmarked summit may be approached from trailheads to the north ( on the Kancamagus Highway ) or from Wonalancet to the south . Old maps show a \`\` Passaconaway Lodge '' or \`\` shelter '' on the southeast aspect of the mountain , and the 4,000 - footer guidebook mentions that it was built in 1891 . It was rebuilt several times , evolving into the Wonalancet Out Door Club 's Camp Rich . After its collapse in 2000 it was removed , consistent with Wilderness regulations . - A sachem or sagamore is a paramount chief among the Algonquians or other Native American tribes of the northeast. The two words are anglicizations of cognate terms (c.1622) from different Eastern Algonquian languages. Some sources contend the sagamore was a lesser chief than the sachem. - The Weeks Act is a federal law (36 Stat. 961) enacted by the United States Congress on March 1, 1911. Introduced by Massachusetts Congressman John W. Weeks and signed into law by President William Howard Taft, the law authorized the US Secretary of Agriculture to \\"Examine, locate and recommend for purchase ... such lands within the watersheds of navigable streams as ... may be necessary to the regulation of flow of navigable streams...\\" This meant that the federal government would be able to purchase private land if the purchase was deemed necessary to protect rivers' and watersheds' headwaters in the eastern United States. Furthermore, the law allowed for land acquired through this act to be preserved and maintained as national forest territory. Six years earlier, the Transfer Act of 1905 transferred control over the federal forest reserves from the General Land Office of the Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture and its Forest Service. Responsibility for land purchased through the Weeks Act was not given to former Chief Forester Gifford Pinchot because he resigned in 1907, with the stipulation that he would only resign if he could appoint his successor. This stipulation led to the Forest Service's tradition of picking a head with forestry knowledge. With the land acquired through the Weeks Act, Pinchot's successor obtained the power to issue permits for water power development on National Forests. The Weeks Act appropriated 9 million to purchase 6 million acres (24,000 km) of land in the eastern United States. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - The Merrimack River (or Merrimac River, an occasional earlier spelling) is a river in the northeastern United States. It rises at the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipesaukee rivers in Franklin, New Hampshire, flows southward into Massachusetts, and then flows northeast until it empties into the Atlantic Ocean at Newburyport. From Pawtucket Falls in Lowell, Massachusetts, onward, the MassachusettsNew Hampshire border is roughly calculated as the line three miles north of the river. - A paramount chief is the English language designation for the highest-level political leader in a regional or local polity or country administered politically with a chief-based system. This term is used occasionally in anthropological and archaeological theory to refer to the rulers of multiple chiefdoms or the rulers of exceptionally powerful chiefdoms that have subordinated others. Paramount chiefs were identified by English-speakers as existing in Native American confederacies and regional chiefdoms, such as the Powhatan Confederacy and Piscataway Native Americans encountered by English colonists in the Chesapeake Bay area of North America. - The Massachusett are a Native American people who historically lived in areas surrounding Massachusetts Bay, as well as northeast and southern Massachusetts in what is now the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including present-day Greater Boston. Tribal members spoke the Massachusett language, which is part of the Algonquian language family. The present-day U.S state of Massachusetts is named after the tribe. - The White Mountain National Forest (WMNF) is a federally managed forest contained within the White Mountains in the northeastern United States. It was established in 1918 as a result of the Weeks Act of 1911; federal acquisition of land had already begun in 1914. It has a total area of (1,225 sq mi). Most of the WMNF is in New Hampshire; a small part (about 5.65% of the forest) is in the neighboring state of Maine. While often casually referred to as a park, this is a National Forest, used not only for hiking, camping, and skiing, but for logging and other limited commercial purposes. The WMNF is the only National Forest located in either New Hampshire or Maine. Most of the major peaks over 4,000 feet high for peak-bagging in New Hampshire are located in the National Forest. Over of the Appalachian Trail traverses the White Mountain National Forest. In descending order of land area the forest lies in parts of Grafton, Coos, and Carroll counties in New Hampshire, and Oxford County in Maine. - The Pennacook, also known by the names Penacook, and Pennacock, were a North American people of the Wabanaki Confederacy who primarily inhabited the Merrimack River valley of present-day New Hampshire and Massachusetts, as well as portions of southern Maine. They are also sometimes called the Merrimack people. - The Eastern Algonquian languages constitute a subgroup of the Algonquian languages. Prior to European contact, Eastern Algonquian consisted of at least 17 languages, collectively occupying the Atlantic coast of North America and adjacent inland areas from what are now known as the Canadian Maritime provinces to North Carolina. The available information about individual languages varies widely. Some are known only from one or two documents containing words and phrases collected by missionaries, explorers or settlers, and some documents contain fragmentary evidence about more than one language or dialect. Nearly all of the Eastern Algonquian languages are extinct. Mi'kmaq and Malecite-Passamaquoddy have appreciable numbers of speakers, but Western Abnaki and Delaware are each reported to have fewer than 10 speakers after 2000. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - The Wabanaki Confederacy (\\"Wabenaki, Wobanaki\\", translated roughly as \\"People of the First Light\\" or \\"People of the Dawnland\\") are a First Nations and Native American confederation of five principal nations: the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, Abenaki, and Penobscot. - New Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the west, Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. New Hampshire is the 5th smallest by land area and the 9th least populous of the 50 United States. - Maine is the northernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Maine is the 39th most extensive and the 41st most populous of the U.S. states and territories. It is bordered by New Hampshire to the west, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the north. Maine is the easternmost state in the contiguous United States, and the northernmost east of the Great Lakes. It is known for its jagged, rocky coastline; low, rolling mountains; heavily forested interior, and picturesque waterways; and also its seafood cuisine, especially clams and lobster. There is a continental climate throughout the state, even in coastal areas such as its most populous city of Portland. The capital is Augusta. - Passaconaway, which translates to \\"Child of the Bear\\", was sachem of the Pennacook people in what is now northern New England in the United States. - New England is a geographical region comprising six states of the northeast United States: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. It is bordered by the state of New York to the west and south, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the northeast and north, respectively. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast, and Long Island Sound is to the south. Boston is its largest city. Its largest metropolitan area is Greater Boston, which also includes Worcester (the second-largest city in New England), Manchester (the largest city in New Hampshire), and Providence (the capital and largest city of Rhode Island), with nearly a third of the entire region's population. - The Sandwich Range is located in the White Mountains of New Hampshire in the United States, north of the Lakes Region and south of the Kancamagus Highway. Although the range is not outstanding for its elevation, it is very rugged and has excellent views of the surrounding lakes, mountains, and forests. - The Appalachian National Scenic Trail, generally known as the Appalachian Trail or simply the A.T., is a marked hiking trail in the eastern United States extending between Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mount Katahdin in Maine. The trail is about 2,200 miles (3,500 km) long, though the exact length changes over time as parts are modified or rerouted. The trail passes through 14 states: Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.

Those aboard an American Airlines airplane from London got to see a little more of America than they expected Friday, after their flight was diverted to Tulsa, Oklahoma, due to engine trouble. Flight 79 took off from Heathrow Airport at 3 p.m. (10 a.m. ET), destined for Dallas, Texas, according to American Airlines' website. The Boeing 777-200 airliner made it over the United States, but not to its final destination. It was diverted to Tulsa due to an issue with the plane's left engine, American Airlines spokeswoman Laura Masvidal told CNN. She did not specify what the issue was. Its flight crew declared an emergency before landing at Tulsa's airport shortly after 6:30 p.m. CT (7:30 p.m. ET). One problem -- besides whatever happened to the left engine -- is that Tulsa's airport doesn't have U.S. Customs and Border Protection workers on hand to handle incoming international travelers. That means the aircraft's 230 passengers and 14 crew members have to wait on the airport's tarmac, according to Masvidal. The aircraft that will take them to Dallas was set to leave that Texas city around 9:15 p.m. for Tulsa. According to American's website, it should have Flight 79's passengers and presumably crew on board when it departs Oklahoma at 10 p.m. If all goes according to plan -- this time around -- this aircraft should arrive at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport a few minutes after 11 p.m. local time. For those keeping score at home, that amounts to 14 hours after Flight 79's passengers first took off from London. CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.

Jason Kidd burns bridge with Nets, but may be left in limbo as Bucks balk at pick demands Now it’s just a leverage contest and a haggle over Jason Kidd’s worth – a fitting conclusion considering this all started because of Kidd’s overinflated sense of self. A decision on the Kidd fiasco is expected Monday, and it hinges on the Nets and Bucks getting over their compensation chasm, according to sources. Brooklyn has been determined to get a first-rounder in any swap – and has asked for the next year’s draft choice — but the Bucks are reportedly threatening to pull away from negotiations if the Nets don’t accept their offer of a 2015 second-round pick. Either way, it appears that bridges are burned and Kidd won’t return to the Nets, at least not in any relevant capacity. They still owe him 5 million in guaranteed salary. The only precedent of an NBA coach trade is Doc Rivers going to the Clippers last year, netting the Celtics a first-round pick. Of course, Rivers won an NBA title and advanced to two Finals prior to that deal. Kidd’s resume includes 44 victories with the highest payroll in league history. A source close to the situation confirmed that Kidd had met Friday with the Bucks in New York after the Nets granted permission. This after he went to a press conference the day before at which he thanked Nets ownership and said he was “honored” to coach a team with the “best facilities in the world.” Irina Pavlova, the president of Mikhail Prokhorov’s Onexim Sports, said she was excited about the job Kidd did last season and was happy to provide him a “worthy” practice facility in Brooklyn, one that will cost about 50 million. The next day, Kidd was interviewing for a job with the worst team in the NBA last season. The Bucks, despite their lowly status, have greater selling points now than in recent years. They have new owners – including one partner, Mark Lasry, who is reportedly Kidd’s good pal — and they drafted Jabari Parker with the second pick last week. If Kidd is out, the Nets are expected to look outside of the organization for a new coach – preferably an established one who can clean up a mess – with out-of-work veterans Lionel Hollins and George Karl as leading candidates. The next coach would represent Brooklyn’s fourth in less than two years, joining Kidd, Avery Johnson and P.J. Carlesimo. But Kidd was the golden child. The Nets rolled out the carpet for the future Hall of Famer. They hired him despite a pending DWI charge and suspension, giving him a marketing slogan and a press conference. They sold him an ownership stake in the team. They handed him a roster full of All-Stars and proven veterans, with a rope so long he was allowed to start 10-21 with his job intact. They retired his jersey with the first such ceremony under the Russians, all with the understanding that this was the same player who forced his way out of the organization with a faked migraine. He was ownership’s hire — not GM Billy King’s — and the subject of its praises and faith up until now. “He made a mistake if he thinks he’s going to a better situation in Milwaukee,” an NBA executive said. “Not to mention, he’s taking somebody else’s job when he already had a better one.” There are plenty of reasons Kidd decided to demand more power in the Nets organization, none more simply explained than it’s indicative of his personality and behavior patterns. Broken down, though, it’s about money and ego. Kidd, who signed a four-year, 10.5 million deal with the Nets, was peeved that first-time coaches Steve Kerr and Derek Fisher netted contracts nearly double his own. It apparently didn’t matter that the Nets were the only team offering Kidd a coaching job just weeks removed from his retirement. He also had a “strained” relationship with King, according to ESPN, which would explain why Kidd plotted to hijack the hierarchy and demand a position similar to Rivers’ in L.A. and Gregg Popovich’s in San Antonio. Instead, Kidd lost the faith of the ownership. The 41-year-old went from being a coach-killer as a player to committing coach-suicide. What this means for the Nets in free agency is still unclear, although instability is not a good selling point. The timing of the turmoil is troubling for the Nets, who are attempting to re-sign two players with close ties to Kidd – Paul Pierce and Shaun Livingston. So they begin summer league this week with three new draft picks and a head coach pushing his way to the worst team in the NBA last season. On a mobile device? Click here to watch video.

The Boeing 747-8 comes in two main variants: the 747-8 Intercontinental (747-8I) for passengers and the 747-8 Freighter (747-8F) for cargo. The 747-8 Intercontinental is designed to carry passengers and is currently the longest passenger aircraft in the world. It offers several improvements over the previous 747 versions, such as enhanced fuel efficiency, reduced noise, and greater range capabilities. Able to carry up to 467 passengers in a typical three-class configuration, it provides airlines with lower operating costs and better environmental performance. The 747-8I was launched with Lufthansa as the first customer, and other major airlines, such as Korean Air and Air China, have also added this aircraft to their fleets. The 747-8 Freighter, on the other hand, is a dedicated cargo aircraft designed to carry a wide range of cargo, from large machinery and equipment to perishable goods, in its large cargo hold. The 747-8F maintains the iconic nose-loading feature of the 747 aircraft family, allowing for efficient loading and unloading of cargo. The freighter version offers a higher payload capacity and improved fuel efficiency compared to its predecessors, making it an attractive choice for cargo operators. Companies like Cargolux, UPS, and Cathay Pacific Cargo have adopted the 747-8F in their cargo fleets. In summary, the Boeing 747-8 is not exclusively a cargo aircraft, as it has both passenger and cargo variants.

This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\".

Public safety, an issue that the outgoing administration of Martin Torrijos struggled to maintain, will be a priority, Martinelli said. \\"Our prisons will be rehabilitation centers, not schools for criminals,\\" he said. Panama will also work with Mexico and Colombia to combat drug trafficking in the region, Martinelli said.

Which entity is this text about? Samuel Dale Brownback (born September 12, 1956) is an American lawyer, politician, diplomat and the current United States Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom since 2018. Brownback previously served as the 46th Governor of Kansas, as a U.S. Senator from Kansas, as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and as the Secretary of Agriculture of Kansas. A member of the Republican Party, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives during the Republican Revolution of 1994, representing Kansas's 2nd congressional district for a single term, before running in a 1996 special election for the U.S. Senate seat previously held by Bob Dole. He won the special election and the following two regular elections, serving until 2011. Brownback signed three anti-abortion bills in 2011. In April 2011, he signed a bill banning abortion after 21 weeks, and a bill requiring that a doctor get a parent's notarized signature before providing an abortion to a minor. In May 2011, Brownback approved a bill prohibiting insurance companies from offering abortion coverage as part of general health plans unless the procedure is necessary to save a woman's life. The law also prohibits any health-insurance exchange in Kansas established under the federal Affordable Care Act from offering coverage for abortions other than to save a woman's life. A Kansas budget passed with Brownback's approval in 2011 blocked Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri from receiving family planning funds from the state. The funding amounted to about 330,000 a year. A judge has blocked the budget provision, ordered Kansas to begin funding the organization again, and agreed with Planned Parenthood that it was being unfairly targeted. In response, the state filed an appeal seeking to overturn the judge's decision. Brownback has defended anti-abortion laws in Kansas, including the Planned Parenthood defunding. \\"You can't know for sure what all comes out of that afterwards, but it was the will of the Legislature and the people of the state of Kansas\\", Brownback said. In May 2012, Brownback signed the Health Care Rights of Conscience Act, which \\"will allow pharmacists to refuse to provide drugs they believe might cause an abortion\\". In April 2013, Brownback signed a bill that blocked tax breaks for abortion providers, banned sex-selection abortions and declared that life begins at fertilization. The law notes that any rights suggested by the language are limited by U.S. Supreme Court decisions. On April 7, 2015, Brownback signed The Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, which bans the most common technique used for second-trimester abortions. This made Kansas the first state to do so.","completion":"This text is about Samuel Dale Brownback.

The president had his share of victories and setbacks amid a backdrop of Twitter storms and, at times, raging rhetoric. Trump's political base seems pleased with his first year in office, touting his efforts to cut Obama-era regulations, install Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and roll back Islamic State forces in the Middle East. \\"We were kind of thinking we were going to relax and put Trump behind us and just watch all the great promises that he gave us, and watch him make America great again,\\" said Michigan Trump supporter Meshawn Maddock. \\"But what happened immediately is that we felt he was under attack from day one.\\" The president's biggest legislative victory came just last month, a sweeping tax cut bill that had been a Republican priority for years. \\"We are very proud of it,\\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed it. \\"It is going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It is going to be fantastic for the economy.\\" In fact, there are plenty of signs of a surging economy, and public opinion polls show growing support for Trump's handling of it and even a bump up in support for the tax bill, which many voters saw initially as too favorable to the wealthy. The tax victory also seems to be helping Trump galvanize the Republican Party behind him, even those who in the past have been cool to his leadership. \\"This president hasn't even been in office for a year, and look at all the things he has been able to get done, by sheer will in many ways,\\" said Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who also announced recently he would not run for re-election this year.

Anderson received widespread acclaim for her performance as the aloof and enigmatic Lady Dedlock, who harbors a dark secret from her past.

Please answer the following question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: where was alice paul born? A:","completion":"Alice Paul was born on January 11, 1885, in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, United States. She was the eldest of four children born to William Mickle Paul I, a prominent businessman, and his wife Tacie Parry. Born into a Quaker family, Alice Paul was raised with strong beliefs in gender equality and social justice. Alice Paul's early life in New Jersey greatly influenced her later work as a suffragist and women's rights activist. She attended Swarthmore College, a Quaker institution co-founded by her grandfather, where she studied biology and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1905. She then continued her education in England, where she earned a master's degree in sociology from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a doctorate in economics from the University of Pennsylvania. While in England, Alice Paul became actively involved in the British suffrage movement, led by prominent activists like Emmeline Pankhurst. She participated in multiple protests and demonstrations, which ultimately led to her arrest and imprisonment on several occasions. These experiences further cemented her determination to fight for women's right to vote. In 1910, Alice Paul returned to the United States and became a key player in the American suffrage movement. She joined the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and played a vital role in organizing events and advocating for women's voting rights. Later on, she co-founded the National Woman's Party (NWP) with fellow suffragist Lucy Burns. Together, they led a number of significant campaigns, including the Silent Sentinels – a non-violent protest in front of the White House that continued for over two years. Thanks to the tireless work of Alice Paul and many other suffragists, the 19th Amendment was ratified on August 18, 1920, granting women the right to vote in the United States. After achieving this historic milestone, Alice Paul continued to advocate for women's rights throughout her life. She played an essential role in drafting the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) in 1923, which aimed to provide legal equality to men and women nationwide. In summary, Alice Paul was born in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, on January 11, 1885. Her upbringing and education, alongside her experiences in the British suffrage movement, paved the way for her lifelong commitment to the fight for women's rights and suffrage in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Morty, however, immediately becomes suspicious of the girl's intentions and starts to tease Rick by suggesting that the girl might have an ulterior motive, such as stealing his organs for illegal purposes. Morty's suspicion is heightened by the fact that he believes someone like Rick might look like an easy target for such criminal activities. Morty continues to play on Rick's fears by asking if the girl was pretty or had any unusual accents, implying that she might be part of an international criminal organization like the Korean-Chinese mafia. Rick becomes increasingly nervous and scared as Morty's suggestions take root in his mind. Due to the fear that Morty has instilled in him, Rick decides that it's best not to contact the girl.

Store Necklaces: For each necklace, put it carefully in a small ziplock bag, making sure it's not tangled. Close the ziplock bag halfway, leaving a small gap. Take one end of the necklace and gently pull it through the gap so it hangs outside the bag. This will help prevent tangling. 4. Store Bracelets: Carefully roll up each bracelet and place it in a separate small ziplock bag or plastic cup. This will help prevent them from getting tangled together. 5. Store Earrings: You can use an egg carton to store your earrings. Place each pair of earrings in a separate egg hole. Close the carton and secure it with a rubber band. 6. Store Rings: Place each ring in a separate small ziplock bag or a small compartment in the jewelry box. 7. Pack Jewelry: Now, place all the ziplock bags, plastic cups, or egg cartons with jewelry into a bigger container or a small box.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in New York in the 1960s (the origins of Off Off Broadway). Though it's not for everyone, it is a genuinely brilliant, darkly funny, even more often deeply disturbing tale about love, sex, personal liberty, and revenge, a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when Congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our Constitution. The story is not about being gay, though -- it's about love and sex that don't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate. On the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any great fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in America. The stage version won international acclaim in its original production, it toured the U.S. and Europe, and with others of its kind, influenced almost all theatre that came after it. Luckily, we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway). This is not a mainstream, easy-to-take, studio film -- this is an aggressive, unsettling, glorious, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget.

This package includes happiness and sorrow, failure and success, hope and despair. Life is a learning process. Experiences in life teach us new lessons and make us a better person. With each passing day we learn to handle various situations. Love Love plays a pivotal role on out life. Love makes you feel wanted. Without love a person could go hayward and also become cruel and ferocious. In the early stage of our life, our parents are the ones who shower us with unconditional love and care, they teach us about what is right and wrong, good and bad. But we always tend to take this for granted. It is only after marriage and having kids that a person understands and becomes sensitive to others feelings. Kids make a person responsible and mature and help us to understand life better. Happiness and sorrow Materialistic happiness is short-lived, but happiness achieved by bringing a smile on others face gives a certain level of fulfillment. Peace of mind is the main link to happiness. No mind is happy without peace. We realize the true worth of happiness when we are in sorrow. Sorrow is basically due to death of a loved one, failure and despair. But these things are temporary and pass away. Failure and success Failure is the path to success. It helps us to touch the sky, teaches us to survive and shows us a specific way. Success brings in money, fame, pride and self-respect.

Question: I have a new situation: Two coastal Canadian towns, Hammond and Soundville decided to start sand mining to bring more money to their budgets. A few months later however, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations and find other sources of income. they wanted to protect the environment. But I can use this background: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] What is an answer for this question: Which village made less money from sand mining? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be deduced that Hammond made less money from sand mining compared to Soundville. There are several factors that contribute to this conclusion. First, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations after only a few months, which means they had a limited time to generate revenue from this activity. In contrast, Soundville did not stop their sand mining operations, and therefore, it is likely that they continued generating income for a longer period. Another aspect worth considering is that while both towns started sand mining to boost their budgets, Hammond made a conscious decision to shift their focus to other sources of income to protect the environment. This further indicates that financially, the town of Hammond may have been less dependent on sand mining than Soundville. Lastly, it is important to note that the negative environmental impacts and potential legal issues related to sand mining might have discouraged Hammond from continuing their operations, thus resulting in less revenue generation from this specific venture. In summary, given the limited timeline of sand mining in Hammond and their decision to prioritize environmental protection and explore alternative income sources, it can be concluded that Hammond made less money from sand mining compared to Soundville."},{"prompt":"- Food is put into mouth - Food is chewed and mixed with saliva (spit) - Food travels down the esophagus (throat) - Food travels into the stomach - Acid in the stomach breaks the food down further - Food travels into the small intestine - Nutrients from food are absorbed into the blood stream - Food travels into the large intestine - Most of the remaining material is now waste What might be the last step of the process?

Those infected have no history of recent international travel, the Florida Department of Health said Tuesday, \\"so exposure was likely from local mosquitoes.\\" The cases were reported in two southeastern Florida counties: Martin and Miami-Dade. Dengue acquired from local mosquitoes is rare in the United States, Florida health officials said, urging residents to take steps such as wearing repellent to protect against mosquito-borne illnesses. Dengue fever is passed from person to person by mosquitoes. Unlike malaria, there are no drugs to prevent it. It also is difficult to treat and thus far, attempts to develop a vaccine have been unsuccessful. The World Health Organization estimates that there are between 50 million and 100 million infections each year. Dengue is most common in Asia and India, but more cases have been popping up in the Caribbean and Latin America in recent years. In mild cases, dengue fever causes a high fever, rash and joint and muscle pain. In extreme cases, it can cause death. According to the World Health Organization, about 12,000 people die of dengue fever each year. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say dengue rarely occurs in the United States. But this isn't the first time Florida has dealt with dengue. In 2009 and 2010, officials documented 28 locally acquired cases in Key West. As dengue cases increase, Honduras declares state of emergency.

Seeing them standing there together, an incognito air of familiarity surrounding them, she felt, for the first time in days, a wave of inexplicable panic wash over her. Suddenly, as if a silent signal had passed between them, Nate's eyes lifted to meet hers, locking her into an impenetrable gaze that held a strange mix of surprise and guilt. His usually bright eyes were clouded now, holding a previously undiscovered layer of depth that made her heart throb painfully. Her eyes now wide with a blend of shock and confusion, she examined Nate's face. His features were as flawless as ever: the rugged jawline, the soft locks of hair brushing against his forehead, that half-smile that never seemed to leave his face. Typically, she would have been entranced, but today, she uncomfortably observed the drips of sweat weaving down the sides of his face and the uneasy twitches of his lips. She saw the unmistaken signs of fear dancing in the usually calm corners of his eyes, revealing a vulnerability she had never seen in him before. Simultaneously, as if choreographed, Lily stepped further into her line of sight, smiling weakly with her lips closed and her eyes holding hints of regret. Her normally radiant face now seemed almost pallid in comparison, sinking deep lines of worry around her eyes. The pangs of remorse, hidden away in the corner of Lily's eyes, were suddenly too loud for her to ignore, her lovely, playful face now a stoic mask of secrecy. Transfixed by her sighting, she delved within herself to summon the hitherto unfelt courage. Her heart pounded erratically as her eyes lingered on the two. The air felt heavier, denser, making it hard for her to breathe. Each moment stacked upon the other, lengthening the seconds into small eternities. Silence loomed over them, making the soft hum of the buzzing streetlights in the backdrop almost deafening. Her ordinarily vivacious spirit now felt muted, but there was a storm raging in her heart. The sudden visual she stumbled upon had thrown her into a whirl of questions she, unfortunately, had no answers to. But she was resolute. She would confront them, face her fears head on, no matter how bleak the truth might be. Bracing herself internally, she took a deep breath and mustered all her strength to break the silence. \\"Nate,\\" she began, her voice barely above a whisper.

Matthew was failing at dribbling.; Answer:","completion":"Answer: (I). Kyle was failing at dribbling. As Kyle just started playing soccer, it is quite common for him to struggle with some basic skills such as dribbling. When someone is new to a particular sport, it requires some time and practice to get familiar with the game dynamics and improve their techniques. Dribbling is an essential component of soccer, which involves moving the ball on the ground by using different parts of the foot. For a beginner like Kyle, falling short in his dribbling attempts is a normal part of his learning process, providing him valuable opportunities to learn from his mistakes and eventually become better at the game. On the other hand, Matthew had been playing for years and presumably has a considerable amount of experience under his belt. He has spent a significant amount of time practicing, improving his skills, and mastering various techniques, including dribbling. It would be rather odd if Matthew was failing at dribbling, given his long-term involvement in soccer. He is more likely to be proficient in this skill, and might even be a potential mentor for Kyle in helping him learn and enhance his dribbling abilities. As soccer is a team sport, collaboration and support between players are crucial aspects of achieving success. With Matthew as an experienced teammate, Kyle is bound to develop his skills over time with practice, perseverance, and perhaps mentorship from those around him who can show him the ropes and guide him on his soccer journey. In due course, this might lead to an improved performance from Kyle, contributing to a more effective and harmonious team dynamic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Acidic reaction: Rainwater is mildly acidic in nature, primarily due to the dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide, forming a weak carbonic acid solution (H2O + CO2 → H2CO3). This weak acid is responsible for the dissolution of limestone rock (calcium carbonate), leading to the formation of soluble calcium bicarbonate. This reaction is as follows: CaCO3 + H2CO3 → Ca(HCO3)2. In the given perturbation hypothesis, with less rainfall occurring, the acidic reaction between rainwater and limestone will decrease due to a lack of available acid to dissolve the limestone. 4. Limestone disintegration: Reduced acidic reactions would slow down the limestone dissolution process, resulting in a decreased rate of disintegration. Consequently, caves would either take longer to form or fail to form at all in areas experiencing prolonged periods of minimal rainfall. 5. Gap formation: As limestone disintegration is directly related to the formation of caves, a slower disintegration rate would lead to a much slower pace of gap formation within the limestone bedrock. 6. Cave formation: Ultimately, the perturbation hypothesis of hotter and drier weather preventing rainfall directly affects the process of cave formation by decreasing the rate of limestone dissolution in affected regions. This would result in caves taking longer to form or even no cave formation at all due to a lack of suitable environmental conditions for the limestone to dissolve and form gaps. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process of cave formation via acidic reactions in limestone. Hotter and drier weather conditions preventing rain result in a reduced frequency of acidic reactions, leading to slower limestone disintegration and gap formation. As a consequence, this directly impacts the cave formation process, potentially hindering the development of caves in affected regions or causing existing caves to evolve at a much slower pace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During Prohibition, Laurel and Hardy are sent to prison for concocting and selling their own home brew. They are put in a cell with \\"Tiger\\" Long, the roughest, toughest and meanest of all inmates. Stan has a loose tooth that causes him to emit a razzberry at the end of every sentence; the inmate interprets this as a coolly defiant attitude and is impressed—nobody else ever stood up to him like that. He and Stan become fast friends. Laurel & Hardy are assigned to attend prison school with James Finlayson being the teacher. The vaudeville routine that follows ends with a spitball meant for somebody else hitting the teacher in the face and the boys wind up in solitary. There is a sustained scene of the bleak cells with the unseen boys conversing through the walls. After a prison break, the boys escape to a cotton plantation, where they hide out undetected, in blackface. The boys sing \\"Lazy Moon\\". When they attempt to repair the warden's car, they are discovered and are sent back to prison. The prison authorities decide to send Laurel to the prison dentist to have the offending tooth pulled, but the dentist is incompetent and the procedure goes awry.

What is the most widely spoken African language?","completion":"The most widely spoken African language is Swahili, also known as Kiswahili. It is a Bantu language and has its roots in the African Great Lakes region. Swahili boasts millions of speakers and is particularly prevalent in Eastern and Southeastern Africa, serving as either the first, second, or third language for many individuals. Swahili has approximately 100 million speakers across various countries, with Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Mozambique, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo being the primary areas where the language is spoken. It functions as a lingua franca— a common language bridging people of diverse ethnic and linguistic backgrounds— which facilitates communication and commerce throughout the region. In Tanzania and Kenya, Swahili is an official language alongside English, and the language is widely used in education, administration, and local media. It is also taught as a subject in schools across East and Central Africa. Swahili has a standardized written form in the Latin script due to the influence of European missionaries and colonizers, as well as the efforts of local Swahili scholars. Swahili's vocabulary incorporates a significant number of loanwords from other languages. Its primary influence is from Bantu languages, but it has also drawn from Arabic, as a result of extended historical interaction between Arabs and Swahili coastal communities through trade and religion. Other loanwords come from languages like Persian, English, Portuguese, and even German, reflecting various global influences on Swahili-speaking regions throughout history. Moreover, Swahili culture is amazingly rich, comprising various elements of music, literature, and traditional crafts. Swahili literature, for example, has deep historical roots and is famous for its poetry and epics, including the classic work \\"Utendi wa Tambuka\\" and the famous Swahili epic, \\"Utendi wa Shufaka.\\" The language's extensive reach and its vivid, expressive character have rendered Swahili an influential force in African literature, music, art, and culture. Due to its widespread use and prominence in diplomacy, business, and education, Swahili has garnered increasing international attention. As a result, it is taught in many universities around the world, which has contributed to the expansion and recognition of Swahili as the most widely spoken African language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Retail therapy has long been considered as a good way to let off stress. Now, US scientists have discovered not only does retail therapy exist,but that it could be caused by an individual's fear of sudden death. Researchers found materialistic people thought terrorism and war more stressful than others. Psychologists believe the rise of materialism around the world and its treatment effect on extreme stress might be a response to fear of death caused by acts of terrorism, disease and natural disasters. The scientists from Michigan State University said people with possession obsessions often have lower self-esteem than others so are more likely to shop as the result of severe psychological suffering. Ayalla Ruvio,a business professor studying people's shopping habits while rockets fell in Israel, said, \\"When the going gets tough, the materialistic people go shopping. This stress spending is likely to produce even greater stress and lower well-being. Essentially, materialism appears to make bad events even worse. Dr Ruvio led a two-part study of Israeli citizens living in a town that came under extreme rocket attacks for about six months in 2007. She compared 139 residents of the southern town with 170 from another town that was not under attack to see how their symptoms of post-traumatic stress and shopping habits varied. Dr Ruvio found that, when faced with a deadly threat, those who are highly materialistic suffered much higher levels of stress,while their tendency to shop was increased. Dr Ruvio said, \\"The relationship between materialism and stress may be more harmful than commonly thought.\\" The second stage of their research surveyed 855 Americans about their materialistic nature and fear of death. They found shopping was used to relieve feelings of stress and anxiety about death but this was in response to fear of a variety of life-threatening events like car accidents, criminal attacks and natural disasters.

Rickey Nelson Henley Henderson (born December 25, 1958) is an American retired professional baseball left fielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine teams from 1979 to 2003, including four stints with his original team, the Oakland Athletics. Nicknamed \\"The Man of Steal\\", he is widely regarded as baseball's greatest leadoff hitter and baserunner. He holds the major league records for career stolen bases, runs, unintentional walks and leadoff home runs. At the time of his last major league game in 2003, the ten-time American League (AL) Following a mid-season trade to Oakland in 1989, Henderson reasserted himself as one of the game's greatest players, with a memorable half-season in which his 52 steals and 72 runs scored led the A's into the postseason; his 126 walks for the year were the most for any AL hitter since 1970. With a record eight steals in five games, he was named MVP of the American League Championship Series; he hit .400 while scoring eight runs and delivering two home runs, five runs batted in (RBI), seven walks and a 1.000 slugging percentage. Leading the A's to a four-game sweep over the San Francisco Giants and the franchise's first World Series title since 1974, Henderson hit .474 with an .895 slugging average (including two triples and a homer), while stealing three more bases. On August 22, 1989, he became Nolan Ryan's 5,000th strikeout victim, but Henderson took an odd delight in the occurrence, saying, \\"If you haven't been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you're nobody.\\" A year later, Henderson finished second in the league in batting average with a mark of .325, losing out to the Kansas City Royals' George Brett on the final day of the season. Henderson had a remarkably consistent season, with his batting average falling below .320 for only one game, the third of the year. Reaching safely by a hit or a walk in 125 of his 136 games, he led the league in runs (119), stolen bases (65), on-base percentage (.439) and OPS (1.016) was 2nd in slugging % (.577), 4th in walks (97) and extra base hits (66), 6th in home runs (28) and total bases (282) and had 61 RBI and Henderson won the AL's MVP award and helped Oakland to another pennant. He again performed well in the World Series (.333 batting, .667 slugging, a home run and three steals in four games), but the A's were swept by the underdog Cincinnati Reds. On May 1, 1991, Henderson broke one of baseball's most noted records when he stole the 939th base of his career, one more than Lou Brock's total compiled from 1962 to 1979, mainly with the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1993, Henderson was having another outstanding season when he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays at the trade deadline. In 90 games with Oakland, he was batting .327 (2nd in AL) with 17 home runs and 47 RBIs.

Arabic (, ' or ' or ) is a Central Semitic language complex that first emerged in Iron Age northwestern Arabia and is now the \\"lingua franca\\" of the Arab world. It is named after the Arabs, a term initially used to describe peoples living from Mesopotamia in the east to the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west, in northwestern Arabia, and in the Sinai peninsula. The modern written language (Modern Standard Arabic) is derived from Classical Arabic. It is widely taught in schools and universities, and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, government, and the media. The two formal varieties are grouped together as Literary Arabic (\\"fuṣḥā\\"), which is the official language of 26 states and the liturgical language of Islam. Modern Standard Arabic largely follows the grammatical standards of Classical Arabic and uses much of the same vocabulary. However, it has discarded some grammatical constructions and vocabulary that no longer have any counterpart in the spoken varieties, and has adopted certain new constructions and vocabulary from the spoken varieties. Much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the post-classical era, especially in modern times. During the Middle Ages, Literary Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe, especially in science, mathematics and philosophy. As a result, many European languages have also borrowed many words from it. Arabic influence, mainly in vocabulary, is seen in European languages, mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese, Valencian and Catalan, owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and 800 years of Arabic culture and language in the Iberian Peninsula, referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus.

What was the name of the album released in 2002 by the band that played at Lollapalooza in 1994? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1993, the Breeders released their second album, Last Splash. At this time, the group's lineup consisted of sisters Kim and Kelley Deal on guitar and vocals, Josephine Wiggs on bass and vocals, and Jim Macpherson on drums. Last Splash was successful in various countries worldwide, and the group toured extensively and played at Lollapalooza 1994. In November 1994, Kelley Deal was arrested on drug-related charges, and in 1995, Wiggs left to pursue other musical projects. Macpherson continued playing with Kim Deal in her side-project group, the Amps, and then in the 1996 incarnation of the Breeders, but quit the band in 1997. The Breeders' lineups for their albums Title TK (2002) and Mountain Battles (2008) included the Deal sisters, Mando Lopez, and Jose Medeles. In 2013, Wiggs and Macpherson rejoined the Deals to tour the 20th anniversary of Last Splash—the LSXX Tour.On December 31, 2013, the Breeders performed their final concert on the 60-date tour in Austin, Texas. The group enjoyed the LSXX concerts, and decided they would like to record new music together.

Context: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected?

And there is always a way of coping with yourself , in ways appropriate for your particular situation , you just need to find one that works for you . Answer the following question: What may happen if one does n't pursue safe self - care avenues ?","completion":"If one doesn't pursue safe self-care avenues, several negative consequences may arise, affecting not only their physical and emotional well-being but also their relationships and overall quality of life. Some of the potential implications are: 1. Deterioration of physical health: Neglecting self-care can lead to poor physical health, as the individual might not prioritize essential activities such as exercise, sleep, and proper nutrition. Over time, the lack of self-care can contribute to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and an overall weakened immune system. 2. Decline in mental health: Mental health issues may arise if an individual fails to seek out safe self-care strategies. Ongoing stress, anxiety, and negative emotions can exacerbate existing mental health conditions or even lead to new ones, such as depression or chronic anxiety disorders. 3. Decreased productivity: When an individual is not practicing self-care, they may experience a decline in productivity due to reduced energy and focus. Fatigue, burnout, and difficulty concentrating can all result from neglecting well-being, making it challenging to complete tasks and perform at optimal levels in personal and professional life. 4. Strained relationships: Insufficient self-care can create strain on personal and professional relationships. When an individual is not taking care of themselves, they may become irritable or exhibit mood swings, causing tension and conflict with others. Over time, this can lead to damaged relationships, social isolation, and a lack of support from friends and loved ones. 5. Poor decision-making: Neglecting self-care can cloud one's judgment and hinder their ability to make rational decisions. Emotional distress and lack of focus can often result in impulsive choices or an inability to concentrate on complex issues, which can negatively impact various aspects of life. 6. Increased risk of substance abuse: Individuals who fail to seek out safe self-care measures might resort to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as alcohol, drugs, or other addictive substances. Over time, substance abuse can lead to addiction and exacerbate existing physical and mental health issues. 7. Low self-esteem: Self-care is an essential component of fostering a positive self-image and cultivating self-confidence. By neglecting self-care, individuals risk developing a negative self-perception, which can hinder their ability to advocate for themselves, form meaningful connections, and achieve personal goals. 8. Compromised resilience: Effective self-care bolsters one's resilience in the face of adversity. By not taking care of themselves, individuals may lack the necessary emotional resources to effectively cope with challenging situations and bounce back from setbacks. In summary, neglecting safe self-care avenues can have long-lasting, detrimental effects on an individual's physical, emotional, and psychological well-being. Pursuing healthy self-care practices is essential for maintaining overall health, nurturing personal and professional relationships, staying productive, and enhancing one's quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Belinda Jo Carlisle was born in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California on August 17, 1958 to Harold Carlisle, a gas station employee, and his wife, Joanne (nee Thompson), a homemaker. Her mother met her father, who was twenty years her senior, at age eighteen, and Carlisle was born nine months later. She was named after her mother's favorite film, Johnny Belinda (1948). Carlisle was the first of seven siblings, with three brothers and three sisters. Carlisle's first venture into music was in 1977 as drummer for the punk rock band the Germs, under the name Dottie Danger. She was recruited into the band by Lorna Doom, whom she had met in an art class while a student at Thousand Oaks High School. However, her time in the band was short due to her contracting mononucleosis, and she never recorded or performed live with the Germs. According to Pat Smear, upon quitting, she introduced her friend, Donna Rhia, who became her replacement. Carlisle does appear on one recording introducing the band at a 1977 performance at the Whisky a Go Go, heard on the live album Germicide (1977). Around this time Carlisle did some back-up singing for Black Randy and the Metrosquad. Soon after leaving the Germs, she co-founded The Go-Go's (originally named the Misfits), with friends and fellow musicians Margot Olavarria, Elissa Bello, and Jane Wiedlin. Olavarria and Bello were soon out of the group and the new line-up included bassist-turned-guitarist Charlotte Caffey, guitarist-turned-bassist Kathy Valentine, and drummer Gina Schock. All five women were largely untrained musicians, and Carlisle recalls having to use tape as fret markers during their initial songwriting: \\"[Charlotte] had to show us how to plug in our amps,\\" she said. The Go-Go's would go on to become one of the most successful American bands of the 1980s, helping usher new wave music into popular American radio, and becoming the first all-female band who wrote their own music and played their own instruments to ever achieve a No. 1 album, Beauty and the Beat, which featured the hits \\"We Got the Beat\\" and \\"Our Lips Are Sealed\\". The Go-Go's recorded two more studio albums on I.R.S. Records, including 1982's Vacation, which went gold. \\"Head over Heels\\", from their 1984 album Talk Show, made it to No. 11. In 1984, Carlisle made a foray into acting in the movie Swing Shift, starring alongside Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.

Article: For teenagers, it's great fun to explore new places and it feels like an adventure, even when you know you're not the first to have been there. But to make sure not to get lost or waste time going round in circles, the following tips may be helpful. *Do the map reading if you're being driven somewhere. It'll be easier if you keep the map following the direction you are traveling in. Keep looking ahead so that you can give the driver lots of warning before having to make a turn, or you'll have to move to the back seat. *Get a group of friends together and go exploring. You'll need a good map, a compass, a raincoat, a cell phone to call for help in case you get lost, and a bit of spare cash for emergencies. Tell someone where you're going before you set out and let them know what time you expect to be back. The purpose of the activity is in not getting lost, not in seeing how fast you can go, so always stick together, waiting for slower friends to catch up. *See if your school or a club organizes orienteering activities, in which you need a map and a compass to find your way.

No The sentence \\"The second decline was not as complete as the first\\" does not directly answer the question \\"Why was the second decline in popularity not as strong as the first?\\" While it does confirm that the second decline was not as strong or complete as the first, it does not provide any reasons or explanations for the differences between the two declines. To properly answer the question, it is important to identify and discuss the factors or circumstances that contributed to the disparity between the first and second declines in popularity. This could include a variety of factors such as changes in public opinion, differences in marketing or promotional efforts, alterations in the quality or nature of the product or service being discussed, shifts in the competitive environment, or other external influences that might have affected the outcomes. For example, a more comprehensive and detailed answer could be: The second decline in popularity was not as strong as the first because several factors contributed to the diminished impact. Firstly, during the second decline, the product benefited from increased marketing efforts, which helped maintain a higher level of public interest and engagement compared to the first period of decline. Secondly, the product had undergone improvements in its quality and features, making it more appealing to consumers and helping to offset some of the negative factors leading to the decline. Additionally, during the second decline, competitors in the market faced their own challenges, which made it difficult for them to capitalize on the declining popularity and attract customers away from the product in question. Finally, external factors such as economic conditions and technological advancements might have played a role in creating a more favorable environment for the product during its second decline, allowing it to better weather the storm and maintain a stronger presence in its market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Since American students have been introduced into the era of the Massive Open Online Course, the opportunity for cheating appears greater than ever. The all-knowing Google search engine is within easy reach. So how can a teacher handle such a large number of examinees so far away, let alone searching out cheaters taking tests across the Internet? Using technology, of course. While special services via webcam and cheating detecting software have been developed now, Mettl, an online company, has developed advanced techniques for netting cheaters, which the company claims are even more reliable and easier to use. Whatever small attempt to cheat, he or she will be found out. Mettl has adopted a mass of technologies on its test-taking platform, creating a mini monitoring state in an exam. Here's how it works: A test-taker signs on to Mettl and selects his/her exam from the site's library of pre-loaded tests. Facial and keystroke recognition technology confirm the person that has signed in is the very person, and the system records both the test-taker (through the webcam) and the test-taker's screen throughout the test. Mettl's technology uses the test-taker's webcam to detect how many people are using the computer. Soon, it will track eye movement well enough to sense whether the test-taker is looking away from the screen, perhaps to consult a smart phone or a friend in secret. Mettl also monitors the test-taker's screen and can detect when the test-taker has changed a computer or moved from the test. The system will soon be able to record sound, detecting whether the test-taker is talking or being talked to. If any wrongdoings are detected, the system flags the incident and reports it back to the test's administrator. This can bring any number of things, depending on the test-giver's wishes: a complete shutdown of the exam, a warning message that appears on the test-taker's screen, even human instructions from the control center.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the village the Sharpe family lived in after moving from Geneva? On 27 July 1843 Sharpe married Elizabeth Fletcher, second sister of John Fletcher, at Bolton Parish Church. The couple had five children: Francis in 1845, Edmund junior (known as Ted) in 1847, Emily in 1849, Catherine (known as Kate) in 1850, and Alfred in 1853.When Sharpe moved his family from Lancaster to live in North Wales in early 1856 he was aged 47. The seven years he spent there were later described, in a Memoir published in 1882 by the Architectural Association, as \\"perhaps the happiest years of his life\\". The family initially lived in a semi-detached house called Bron Haul near Betws-y-Coed, on what is now the A5 road. Two years later he bought a larger property called Coed-y-Celyn on the east bank of the River Lledr, about a mile south of Betws-y-Coed. After moving to Geneva, the family lived for about three years in a rented property called Richemont on the road from Geneva to Chêne-Bougeries. Finally in 1866 the family moved back to Lancaster to live in Scotforth, then a small village to the south of the town.Elizabeth Sharpe died on 15 March 1876, a month after the consecration of St Paul, Scotforth where a plaque to her memory can be found in the chancel of the church. A year later, Sharpe travelled to northern Italy with his two daughters, his youngest son Alfred, and three research assistants, to make drawings of 12th-century churches in the region. During the trip he became seriously ill with a chest infection and died on 8 May, in or near Milan. His body was taken to Lancaster, where he was buried on 19 May, alongside his wife, in the municipal cemetery. \\"Glowing obituaries\\" were carried by the local newspapers and the architectural press, including The Builder, The Building News, and The Architect. His estate was valued at \\"under £14,000\\" (equivalent to £1,290,000 as of 2018). A plaque to his memory was placed in the chancel of St Paul's, next to that of his wife.

Thread your needle with matching, lightweight thread, and sew straight across your hem roughly 1/4 inch (6 mm) away from the raw edge. After sewing this line, trim the edge so that there is only 1/8 inch (3 mm) between the thread line and the raw edge. This stitch will end up being on the bottom of your hem. It should help you maintain an even, consistent roll. Fold the raw edge toward the wrong side of the fabric and press in place using an iron. While not entirely necessary, pressing the fold in place will make the hem less likely to unroll as you stitch. Fold the fabric so that the bend falls just past your initial row of stitching. You should see your initial stitching along the underside of the fabric but not from the front. Pick up one thread from the fabric and a small stitch from the edge of your fold. Pull the needle through, but do not pull it taut just yet. Use a small, sharp needle for best results. Doing so will make it easier to pick up single threads along your hem. The stitch made into your fold should be as close to the actual fold as possible. Position it in between your initial line of stitching and the fold itself. The threads you pick up from the front of the actual fabric should be directly above the stitch made into your fold. These threads should also be right above the raw edge. Make sure that you only pick up one or two threads from the fabric. Picking up more will cause the hem to be more visible from the front of the fabric. Each stitch should only pick up one or two threads from the fabric, and the stitches should be spaced roughly 1/4 inch (6 mm) apart. Repeat this until you have 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of hem stitching. Lightly pull on the thread in the direction of your stitching. The raw edge should roll itself down into your hem, disappearing from sight. Use firm pressure, but do not pull tightly. Pulling too tightly can cause the fabric to bunch up. Smooth out any bubbles or bumps with your fingers. Continue stitching along the rest of the hem in the same manner until you reach the end. Knot off the end and cut off any excess thread. As you get better at the process, you can pull the thread after 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) of stitching rather than every 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm). If completed correctly, the raw edge should be hidden along the wrong side of the fabric and the hem stitching should be barely visible from the front. The hem may already be smooth enough, but if desired, use an iron to press it further. This step completes the process. Summary:","completion":"To create a rolled hem, start by sewing a straight line 1/4 inch from the raw edge of the fabric and trim the edge so there's only 1/8 inch between the stitching and the edge. Fold the raw edge towards the wrong side of the fabric and press it in place with an iron. Fold the fabric so the initial stitching is hidden and use a small, sharp needle to create closely spaced stitches along the length of the hem, picking up only one or two threads from the fabric for each stitch.

Austin and University of Texas police were searching his home on Western Drive in South Austin on Tuesday afternoon. Tooley, who killed himself at the Perry-Casteneda Library around 8:40 a.m. after firing shots outside on campus, was a student in UT's College of Natural Sciences. Neighbors near the house on Western Drive said that around 11:45 a.m., family members were gathered at the home - several of them appearing distraught, with one woman sobbing. Officials said the gunman began firing shots with his semi-automatic weapon randomly at 21st Street and University Drive. Witnesses heard at least 10 shots before they pointed police toward Tooley. Officers were able to then chase him off the streets, away from students, and into the PCL building - where he committed suicide. No other injuries were reported, and police never fired their weapons. On Tuesday afternoon, UT President Bill Powers - who had been giving media briefings all morning - released the following statement: \\"I extend my sympathy to the family, friends, and classmates of the young student who took his life. In the days ahead we will attempt to understand his actions and to learn from this tragedy. We invite those who would like counseling services to contact the Counseling and Mental Health Center (for students) or the Employee Assistance Program (for staff and faculty).\\" Gov. Perry made the following comments at a press conference in San Antonio on an unrelated subject: “Before we get started, I want to make a brief statement regarding the incident at the University of Texas this morning. We understand there was a shooter on the University of Texas campus this morning who is now deceased. Additional reports of what transpired continue to flow in, but this is an ongoing investigation by law enforcement at this time. I want to thank campus officials and law enforcement, including the Austin Police Department, DPS and others, for their swift action, that protected the students and faculty on campus this morning. As always, they were highly-professional and swift in their response, and we are blessed to have such brave peace officers protecting our citizens.” Just weeks before Tuesday, Austin and university police conducted a joint training exercise that prepared them for critical situations much like this. In addition, Austin Police Department Chief Art Acevedo emphasized three things: The importance of preparedness. \\"It became readily apparent that the University of Texas was prepared for this situation,\\" said Acevedo. Rapid response. Authorities were almost immediately on campus and chased the gunman inside the library building. Acevedo commended the students who led the way to the suspect as they kept pointing law enforcement in the right direction. Agency collaboration University of Texas Police Department Chief Robert Dahlstrom said at 12:30 p.m. that a search for a potential second gunman or suspect turned up nothing - and that initial witness speculation that there may have been two threatening individuals appear to be false. He also said that multiple descriptions of the same person led to the belief of that second person. \\"There is no doubt training paid off in this situation,\\" said Dahlstrom. Authorities said the gunman fired a minimum of four shots from a 7.62-mm firearm into the building. Though no one was injured, EMS did treat two people for minor injuries, which police said were unrelated to the gunman but rather due to the commotion and movement in response to the incident. The all-clear was issued for University of Texas faculty and students around noon, meaning they can leave campus but cannot go in the investigation area where the shooting took place. The PCL is the only area that is currently contained. Authorities - in a multiagency effort - had spent several hours searching fervently for a possible second suspect after a gunman entered the University of Texas Perry Castenada library with an AK-47, fired off shots and then shot himself. \\"This is a very critical incident,\\" said UT President Bill Powers. \\"The University of Texas Police Department and Austin Police Department responded extremely professionally this morning.\\" For more information, people are directed to call 1-866-657-9400 or (512) 471-2255. Armored vehicles and helicopters surrounded the scene on campus as a number of agencies conducted secondary searches to eliminate explosives that could \\"have been left behind by one or more suspects.\\" K-9 officers swept areas around campus, conducting sniff searches mainly around the University Drive area. \\"We are very fortunate in the fact that no one else was injured, other than the lone gunman,\\" said UT Police Department Chief Robert Dahlstrom. \\"No shots were fired by members of law enforcement,\\" said Acevedo.

Q: The single circular dna chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in what, but instead occupies a specific location called the nucleoid within the cell? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Binary Fission Due to the relative simplicity of the prokaryotes, the cell division process, called binary fission, is a less complicated and much more rapid process than cell division in eukaryotes. The single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell (Figure 10.2). Although the DNA of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size, there are no histone proteins and thus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes. The packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes. The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell. The starting point of replication, the origin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (Figure 10.15). Replication of the DNA is bidirectional, moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously. As the new double strands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell. As the cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called FtsZ directs the partition between the nucleoids. Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site. A septum is formed between the nucleoids, extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When the new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate.

Because of the unit conventions then in use, the gravitational constant does not appear explicitly in Cavendish's work. Instead, the result was originally expressed as the specific gravity of the Earth, or equivalently the mass of the Earth. His experiment gave the first accurate values for these geophysical constants. The experiment was devised sometime before 1783 by geologist John Michell, who constructed a torsion balance apparatus for it. However, Michell died in 1793 without completing the work. After his death the apparatus passed to Francis John Hyde Wollaston and then to Henry Cavendish, who rebuilt the apparatus but kept close to Michell's original plan.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Terence Joseph \\"Terry\\" Nation (8 August 1930 - 9 March 1997) was a Welsh television writer and novelist. Nation first made his name as a comedy writer before becoming a prolific writer for drama, working on many of the most popular British series of the 1960s and 1970s. He made a significant contribution to the long-running BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who from its outset, creating the villainous Daleks which established its early popularity and later devising the recurring character of Davros. Prior to this, Nation had declined an offer from scriptwriter David Whitaker to write for a new science-fiction programme that was entering production at the BBC; Whitaker had been impressed by a script that Nation had written for the ABC anthology series Out of this World. Now unemployed, and with a young family to support, Nation contacted Whitaker and accepted the offer, writing the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks (also known as The Mutants and The Dead Planet). The serial introduced the eponymous extraterrestrial villains that would quickly become the series' most popular and enduring monsters, and resulted in a major merchandising success for the BBC. Having risen in the public consciousness, Nation went on to contribute further scripts to Doctor Who. In 1965, Nation and Dennis Spooner co-wrote the 12-part serial The Daleks' Master Plan, after which Nation, who still held the copyright to the Daleks, attempted to launch a Dalek spin-off TV series in the United States. Various other Dalek tie-in material appeared, including comic strips in the children's weekly TV Century 21 and annuals; such material was frequently credited to Nation, even when written by others. Between 1966 and 1972, appearances by the Daleks in Doctor Who became less frequent and were written for the series by other authors. In 1973, following an eight-year absence from scriptwriting for the series, Nation returned to writing for the Daleks on Doctor Who with the Third Doctor serial Planet of the Daleks. In 1998, readers of Doctor Who Magazine voted Nation's 1975 serial Genesis of the Daleks the greatest Doctor Who story of all time. In the story, Nation introduced the character of Davros, the creator of the Daleks, who went on to appear in further storylines. Nation also wrote two non-Dalek scripts for Doctor Who, The Keys of Marinus in 1964, which introduced the Voord and The Android Invasion in 1975, which introduced the Kraal. During this time, Nation also worked in commercial TV, contributing scripts to series such as The Avengers, The Baron, The Champions, Department S, The Persuaders! and The Saint.

Here is a news article: Kiyoshi, left, and Mitsuko Serizawa sit in their living room with a portrait of their son, Kiyotaka, who killed himself a year ago after working 90-hour weeks as a supervisor at a building maintenance company (Anna Fifield/The Washington Post) In the United States, there’s no end to stories and listicles and books telling you how to work more productively so you can spend more time with your family or doing the things you love. In Japan, there’s not even a term for “work-life balance.” What there is, though, is a word for “death by overwork.” It’s “karoshi,” and it’s considered such an inevitable result of Japan’s notoriously grueling work culture that it’s hardly even discussed. But every year here, hundreds, maybe thousands, of Japanese people literally work themselves to death. Kiyotaka Serizawa was one of them. A year ago in July, the 34-year-old killed himself after working crazy hours — 90 hours a week during the last weeks of his life — at a company that does maintenance at apartment buildings. “His colleagues told me that they were amazed how much he worked,” his father, Kiyoshi Serizawa, said in an interview in their family home. “They said they’d never seen anyone who didn’t even own the company work so hard.” Japan has a working culture where spending long hours at the grindstone, or in compulsory socializing with superiors after work, is the norm. It began in the 1970s, when wages were relatively low and employees wanted to maximize their earnings. It continued through the boom years of the 1980s, when Japan became the world’s second-largest economy and everyone was on the juggernaut. And it remained after the bubble burst in the late 1990s, when companies began restructuring and employees stayed at work to try to ensure they weren’t laid off. Still, irregular workers — who worked without benefits or job security — were brought in, making the regular workers toil even harder. Now, no one blinks an eyelid at 12-hour-plus days. [ It’s official: Japan’s population is dramatically shrinking ] “In a Japanese workplace, overtime work is always there. It’s almost as if it is part of scheduled working hours,” said Koji Morioka, an emeritus professor at Kansai University who is on a committee of experts advising the government on ways to combat karoshi. “It’s not forced by anyone, but workers feel it like it’s compulsory.” While the basic workweek is 40 hours, many workers don’t put in for extra hours for fear of being given a bad performance evaluation. This has led to the concept of “service overtime” — “service” being Japanese for “free.” This relentless schedule has led to karoshi — either from a fatal heart attack or stroke, or a suicide triggered by overwork — becoming a recognized cause of death. Labor ministry figures show that 189 deaths were classified this way last year, although experts think the actual number is in the thousands. Karoshi has long been considered a male problem, but advocates say they’re seeing an increasing number of women dying, almost always by killing themselves. The striking thing about them is that they’re very young, often in their 20s, said Hiroshi Kawahito, a lawyer and secretary-general of the National Defense Counsel for Victims of Karoshi, which fights for victims’ families. Kawahito represented the family of a journalist in her early 30s who died of a heart attack. When a reporter gasped, he added: “It’s actually not rare in Japan for people in their early 30s to have heart attacks.” Once a death is classified as karoshi, a victim’s family is automatically entitled to compensation through a kind of workers’ comp system. The number of claims for karoshi-related cases rose to a record high of 2,310 in the year ending in March, government figures show. But less than a third of applications are successful , Kawahito said. Kiyotaka Serizawa’s death was officially certified last month. He was a supervisor responsible for overseeing building janitors in three separate locations in this town northeast of Tokyo. Struggling to keep up, Kiyotaka had tried to resign a year before his death, but his boss refused to accept his notice. Apparently concerned about inconveniencing his subordinates, he carried on working. He would sometimes stop at his parents’ house to sleep as he drove between offices. “He would lie here on this couch and go into such a deep sleep that I would come and check on him to make sure his heart was still beating,” said his mother, Mitsuko Serizawa. [ Why Japan will pay a big price for Britain’s vote to leave the E.U. ] The last time his mother saw him was July last year, when he came to collect the laundry he’d been too busy to do. He stopped off for 10 minutes and watched some cute cat videos on his phone with his cat-mad mother. But then, on July 26, he went missing. Three weeks later, his body was found in his car in Nagano Prefecture, not far from a place where he’d gone on family camping holidays as a child. He’d burned briquettes in his car and died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Although karoshi has been a problem for several decades, it was only 18 months ago that the government passed legislation to try to tackle the problem. The act sets specific targets, such as reducing the percentage of employees working for more than 60 hours a week to 5 percent by 2020, from the 8 to 9 percent range recorded in the past few years. The government is also trying to get employees to actually take their paid vacation leave. Most Japanese workers get 20 days leave a year, but few take even half of that because of a working culture in which taking days off is seen as a sign of slacking or lack of commitment to the job. The government hopes to entice workers to take at least 70 percent of their leave owed. “If you’re conscious of this right, then you can show that there’s nothing wrong with taking time off,” said Yasukazu Kurio of the ministry of health and labor’s office for the prevention of karoshi. Kurio is trying to set a good example: Last year he took 17 of his 20 days. Kawahito, the lawyer, said that the government’s efforts could have some impact at the margins but that they don’t deal with the fundamental problem. “There’s nothing that’s stated under this act to penalize companies that break the rules,” said Kawahito, who’s not exactly a role model for work-life balance. As a younger lawyer, he used to work long hours, but now that he’s reached the age of 66, he’s cut back to about 60 hours a week. Still, he wants to see a law like the European Working Time Directive that stipulates 11 hours off between shifts. [ Japan is trying to save its economy with a Jedi mind trick ] The karoshi problem is exacerbated by the relative weakness of labor unions, which have been primarily concerned with raising wages rather than shortening working hours, and the Japanese practice of having a job for life. Most university students go into a company or a ministry after graduation with the expectation they’ll be there until they retire. “In a country like the U.S., people have more freedom to move to a company that treats you better,” said Kenichi Kuroda, a professor at Meiji University in Tokyo who specializes in labor culture. “But in Japan, people tend to stay at one company for life, so it’s difficult for people to move on.” Some companies, especially in the financial sector, are taking the initiative by allowing employees to come in earlier and leave earlier. So instead of working from nine to nine, they’re now working from seven to seven and can be home in time to see their children. “These companies are finding ways to bring about social change, and it could influence other companies by showing how they’re creating a ‘dream lifestyle,’” Kuroda said, laughing to show he knew 12-hour days would not be considered revolutionary elsewhere. Still, the problem is going to be difficult to alleviate. Japan’s population is aging rapidly, with the workforce expected to shrink by at least a quarter by 2050. That means even fewer people available to work, increasing the workloads of those who remain. Morioka, the professor, said that eliminating death by overwork will mean changing the entire working culture of Japan. “It’s impossible to get rid of karoshi alone,” he said. “We need to change the overtime culture and create the time for family and hobbies. Long working hours are the root of all evil in Japan. People are so busy they don’t even have the time to complain.” Yuki Oda contributed to this report.

Labor demand, with 1.28 jobs per applicant, is the highest since 1991, which should help Prime Minister Shinzo Abe draw more people into the workforce to counter the effect of a shrinking population, but lax enforcement of labor laws means some businesses are simply squeezing more out of employees, sometimes with tragic consequences. Claims for compensation for karoshi rose to a record high of 1,456 in the year to end-March 2015, according to labor ministry data, with cases concentrated in healthcare, social services, shipping and construction, which are all facing chronic worker shortages. Hiroshi Kawahito, secretary general of the National Defense Counsel for Victims of karoshi, said the real number was probably 10 times higher, as the government is reluctant to recognize such incidents. “The government hosts a lot of symposiums and makes posters about the problem, but this is propaganda,” he said. “The real problem is reducing working hours, and the government is not doing enough.” The labor ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Kawahito, a lawyer who has been dealing with karoshi since the 1980s, said 95 percent of his cases used to be middle-aged men in white-collar jobs, but now about 20 percent are women. Japan has no legal limits on working hours, but the labor ministry recognizes two types of karoshi: death from cardiovascular illness linked to overwork, and suicide following work-related mental stress. A cardiovascular death is likely to be considered karoshi if an employee worked 100 hours of overtime in the month beforehand, or 80 hours of overtime in two or more consecutive months in the previous six. A suicide could qualify if it follows an individual’s working 160 hours or more of overtime in one month or more than 100 hours of overtime for three consecutive months. Work-related suicides are up 45 percent in the past four years among those 29 and younger, and up 39 percent among women, labor ministry data show.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter The problem has become more acute as Japan’s workforce has divided into two distinct categories - regular employees, and those on temporary or non-standard contracts, frequently women and younger people. In 2015 non-regular employees made up 38 percent of the workforce, up from 20 percent in 1990, and 68 percent of them were women. Lawyers and academic say unscrupulous employers operate a “bait-and-switch” policy, advertising a full-time position with reasonable working hours, but later offering the successful applicant a non-regular contract with longer hours, sometimes overnight or weekends, with no overtime pay. Refusing overtime pay and break time are illegal, and the applicant could refuse the job, but activists say companies tell them they will be given regular contracts after six months or so. They say young applicants often accept due to lack of experience, while women trying to re-enter the workforce after childbirth often feel it would be difficult to get a foothold elsewhere. Emiko Teranishi, head of the Families Dealing with Karoshi support group, said she hears lots of complaints about hiring tactics, with some companies telling new hires that their salary includes 80 hours of overtime, and they must reimburse the company if they work less. “Some people don’t even make minimum wage under this system,” said Teranishi, whose own husband committed suicide after working long hours. Such abuses have become so common in the past 10 years that such companies have been dubbed “black” companies in the media. Hirokazu Ouchi, a professor at Chukyo University, wrote a book last year about such companies when he realized some of his students were being treated illegally at their part-time jobs. Ouchi said their hiring practices typically follow a similar pattern. “Companies will hire someone for two to three years, but they have no intention of investing the time or the money to nurture that employee,” said Ouchi. He added that the labor ministry lacked the manpower to follow up on complaints. A ministry official working in corporate surveillance acknowledged that his department was somewhat short-staffed but the government was taking steps to recruit more every year. He declined to give his name as he is not authorized to speak to the media. Slideshow (4 Images) Japan’s working-age population has been falling since the mid-1990s, which would normally lead companies to improve working conditions to attract workers, but Ouchi said it was not happening because they can get away with bending the rules. “This is a way for companies to keep labor costs down, but it is also a path that leads to death by overwork,” he said.

The country is now seeing a record number of compensation claims relating to death from overwork or karoshi. According to Labour Ministry data, claims for compensation for karoshi rose to a record high of 1,456 in the year ending March 2015. Most of the cases pertained to the health care, social services, shipping and construction industries. All these industries are facing severe worker shortages. According to the Japan Times, labour demand, at 1.28 jobs per applicant, is at its highest since 1991. However lax enforcement of labour laws effectively means that some businesses try to get as much as they can from their employees, often with tragic consequences. Hiroshi Kawahito, the secretary-general of the National Defense Counsel for Victims of Karoshi however believes that the true figures could be 10 times higher than official records as he believes the government was reluctant to recognise such cases. \\"The government hosts a lot of symposiums and makes posters about the problem but this is proganda,\\" he alleges. He said the government is not doing enough. \\"The real problem is reducing working hours, and the government is not doing enough.\\" Kawahito who has been dealing with karoshi cases since the 1980s, said 95% of his cases used to be middle-aged men in white-collar jobs. Now, about 20% are women. Japan has no legal limits on working hours. The Labour Ministry recognises two types of karoshi: death from cardiovascular illness linked to overwork and suicide following work-related mental stress. A suicide ruling is possible if it comes after an individual has been working for 160 hours or more of overtime in one month or more than 100 hours of overtime for three consecutive months, Japan Times says. Work-related suicides are up 45% in the past four years among those 29 years old and younger. It is up 39% among women, the Labour Ministry data reveal. Japan's workforce is split into two categories - regular employees and those on temporary or non-standard contracts, which usually affect women and younger people, the newspaper noted. Last year, non-regular employees comprised 38% of the total workforce, up from 20% in 1990. The newspaper said that 68% of them were women. Emiko Teranishi, the head of Families Dealing with Karoshi support group said she has heard a lot of complaints about companies' hiring tactics. She said that some companies tell new hires that their salary includes 80 hours of overtime and they must reimburse the company if they should work less hours. \\"Some people don't even make minimum wage under this system,\\" said Teranishi. Her husband committed suicide after working long hours. ||||| It's true: Your job is killing you. (iStockphoto) For decades now, the modern worker has been urged to slow down, chill out, de-stress. Doctors link long shifts and on-the-job anxiety to high blood pressure, heart disease, depression and stroke. Many think the consequences can be fatal. In Japan, the government compensates families who lose loved ones to employment-related exhaustion or suicide. The Japanese call this phenomenon karoshi, or death by overwork. Yet, so far, the connection between job strain and bad health has mostly been correlational — we haven't known whether stressful jobs directly cause our health to deteriorate. Surveys show that people who work more are more likely to suffer from hypertension and more likely to experience a stroke. The plausible biological explanation: Both of these health problems are symptoms of stress and sleep deprivation. But what if it wasn’t the job’s fault? What if naturally obsessive or anxious people gravitate to occupations where they are forced to work too much? What if the people who volunteer for overtime only do it because they need the money to solve some other crisis in their life? The connection between bad health and overwork, as common sense as it seems, is cloudy. [How work-life balance became work all the time] Recently, economists at Purdue and the University of Copenhagen made a clever attempt to clear up the question. They looked at Danish manufacturing companies where overseas sales increased unexpectedly because of changes in foreign demand or transportation costs between 1996 and 2006. These constituted a set of natural experiments. At firms where exports spiked, there was suddenly a lot more work to do, a lot more things to sell. This put the squeeze on employees, who became measurably more productive — but also started to have more health problems. “The medical literature typically finds that people who work longer hours have worse health outcomes — but we try to distinguish between causality and correlation,” said Chong Xiang, an economics professor at Purdue and co-author on the paper, along with David Hummels and Jakob Munch. A draft was released this week by the National Bureau for Economic Research. This kind of study could only be done in a place such as Denmark, where the single-payer health care system keeps track of everyone’s doctor’s visits and drug purchases. Researchers found that women at companies where there was an export boom were subsequently more likely to be treated for severe depression, and more likely to take prescription medication for heart attack or stroke. For both men and women, there was also an increase in severe on-the-job injuries. The health effect was related to how much pressure the company faced. If external forces caused a company’s exports to rise by, say, 10 percent, female employees were about 2.5 percent more likely to be treated for severe depression, and 7.7 percent more likely to take heart attack or stroke drugs. For context, about 4 percent of women overall were being treated for severe depression and 1 percent of women were on heart attack or stroke medication. These conditions are not very common, but job strain caused a measurable, statistically significant bump in prevalence. The researchers aren’t sure why men weren’t measurably affected, but it could have something to do with how women are at higher risk in general for stroke or depression in their lifetimes. And the men could have been sicker in other ways that the researchers couldn’t observe. [The definitive guide to whether or not a robot will take your job] At companies that experienced the biggest increases in exports, the rate of serious injury also went up. These were on-the-job accidents severe enough to merit an insurance payout from the Danish government. (Such cases are rare, about 4 in 1,000 workers.) If you sorted companies by how big of an export boost they experienced, and focused on the top 25 percent, these exceptionally busy firms saw a 28-percent increase in severe injuries — which translates to about 1 extra-serious injury per 1,000 workers. Most of these injuries seemed to be concentrated in positions involving physical labor, not white-collar work. The researchers also found interesting patterns involving sick days. At most firms, employees started taking fewer sick days after business picked up, which indicates that they felt pressured to come in even if they weren’t feeling well. But at companies that became exceptionally busy — those that enjoyed an export boost ranking in the top 25 percent — the number of sick days per person actually increased, by 14 percent for men and 24 percent for women. At these places, it seems the pressure was too much and the overwork made people too sick to come in. (The researchers focused on sick days that occurred in conjunction with a doctor’s visit or a drug prescription.) We should always be careful of studies that so neatly confirm our assumptions, but here the conclusion aligns with decades of medical research hinting at similar things. We’ve known for a while that overwork and job stress is associated with poor health; it was just unethical to run an experiment to prove that one causes the other. In this case, we can blame (or thank) the invisible hand for doing the dirty work. The more or less random fluctuations in foreign economies provided an opportunity to observe what happens when people suddenly get a lot busier at work. Though this study focused on the Danish manufacturing sector, it covered both blue and white collar workers, so the results seem generalizable enough: Working too hard has health consequences. Our jobs really are killing us.

This persistent issue is rooted in the nation's working culture, beginning in the '70s when Japanese employees sought to maximize earnings in a period of low wages and continuing through economic booms and busts. Japan's basic workweek is 40 hours; however, due to fear of getting bad performance evaluations, many workers do not claim extra hours. This working culture resulted in \\"karoshi,\\" which, shockingly, is a recognized cause of death in Japan due to either stroke, a fatal heart attack, or suicide triggered by overwork. The labor ministry revealed that 189 deaths were categorized this way last year, though experts speculate actual numbers could be in the thousands. Even though the Japanese government passed legislation 18 months ago to address the problem, experts argue it doesn't tackle the core issue, and that the country's working culture itself needs to change."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The disease is caused by protozoan trypanosomes, specifically \\"Trypanosoma evansi\\", of several species which infect the blood of the vertebrate host, causing fever, weakness, and lethargy which lead to weight loss and anemia. In some animals the disease is fatal unless treated. - Trypanosomiasis or trypanosomosis is the name of several diseases in vertebrates caused by parasitic protozoan trypanosomes of the genus \\"Trypanosoma\\". - Trypanosoma cruzi is a species of parasitic euglenoids. Amongst the protozoa, the trypanosomes characteristically bore tissue in another organism and feed on blood (primarily) and also lymph. This behaviour causes disease or the likelihood of disease that varies with the organism: for example, trypanosomiasis in humans (Chagas disease in South America ), dourine and surra in horses, and a brucellosis-like disease in cattle. Parasites need a host body and the haematophagous insect triatomine (descriptions \\"assassin bug\\", \\"cone-nose bug\\", and \\"kissing bug\\") is the major vector in accord with a mechanism of infection. The triatomine likes the nests of vertebrate animals for shelter, where it bites and sucks blood for food. Individual triatomines infected with protozoa from other contact with animals transmit trypanosomes when the triatomine deposits its faeces on the host's skin surface and then bites. Penetration of the infected faeces is further facilitated by the scratching of the bite area by the human or animal host. - A protease (also called a peptidase or proteinase) is any enzyme that performs proteolysis; protein catabolism by hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Proteases have evolved multiple times, and different classes of protease can perform the same reaction by completely different catalytic mechanisms. Proteases can be found in Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Bacteria, Archaea and viruses. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Cysteine (abbreviated as Cys or C) is a semi-essential proteinogenic amino acid with the formula HOCCH(NH)CHSH. It is encoded by the codons UGU and UGC. The thiol side chain in cysteine often participates in enzymatic reactions, as a nucleophile. The thiol is susceptible to oxidization to give the disulfide derivative cystine, which serves an important structural role in many proteins. When used as a food additive, it has the E number E920. - Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protozoan \\"Trypanosoma cruzi\\". It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs. The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 812 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 6070% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people. \\"T. cruzi\\" is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the blood-sucking \\"kissing bugs\\" of the subfamily Triatominae. These insects are known by a number of local names, including: \\"vinchuca\\" in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, \\"barbeiro\\" (the barber) in Brazil, \\"pito\\" in Colombia, \\"chinche\\" in Central America, and \\"chipo\\" in Venezuela. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, eating food contaminated with the parasites, and by vertical transmission (from a mother to her fetus). Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope. Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for \\"T. cruzi\\" in the blood. Prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine has not been developed as of 2013. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of endstage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox... - A catalytic triad refers to the three amino acid residues that function together at the centre of the active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and -lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold. - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. - Cysteine proteases, also known as thiol proteases, are enzymes that degrade proteins. These proteases share a common catalytic mechanism that involves a nucleophilic cysteine thiol in a catalytic triad or dyad. - Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate, or catalyze, chemical reactions. The molecules at the beginning of the process upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. The set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell. The study of enzymes is called \\"enzymology\\". - Cruzipain is a cysteine protease expressed by Trypanosoma cruzi .

Answer:","completion":"Grand Forks International Airport (GFK) and McCarran International Airport (LAS) are not both located in the Midwest United States. The two airports are situated in different regions of the country and serve different catchment areas. Grand Forks International Airport (GFK) is located near the city of Grand Forks, in the state of North Dakota. This places it within the region commonly referred to as the Midwest. The Midwest is a collection of states in the north-central part of the United States, including North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. This region is characterized by its agricultural and industrial activities, as well as a strong sense of cultural heritage dating back to the pioneer days of America's westward expansion. GFK plays a vital role in connecting the cities and communities in and around North Dakota to the larger national and international transportation network. On the other hand, McCarran International Airport (LAS) is located in the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. This places it not in the Midwest but rather in the western United States, specifically in a region known as the Southwest. The Southwest region generally encompasses the states of Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and parts of California, Colorado, and Texas. This region is characterized by its arid and desert-like climate, vast expanses of open space, and unique geological features such as the Grand Canyon and the Great Basin. LAS is a major commercial airport, serving millions of passengers from around the world each year. Las Vegas is a renowned travel destination in its own right, attracting visitors for its casino resorts, nightlife, entertainment events, conventions, and natural beauty in the surrounding area. In summary, while Grand Forks International Airport is located in the Midwest US, McCarran International Airport is not. The latter is situated in the Southwest region of the United States. These two airports serve different geographic areas and cater to distinct socio-economic and cultural needs of their respective regions."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

He had loved Sheila for a long time, fought for her heart, believed in their love until finally she had come around. They were about to kiss for the first time and then this: yellow gumballs. Stan went to a group to try to accept that Sheila was gone. It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in California. After several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs. He did this because he believed in capitalism, he loved capitalism. He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon's stock price, he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America like blood staining through a handkerchief, he loved how everything could be tracked and mirrored in numbers. When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio; and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila.
