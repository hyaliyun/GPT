Article: Don't be bamboozled by the brand name. Many times people don’t make the right decision in choosing a pair of snow boots because of the brand name or the style of the boot. Unfortunately, this can have an effect on your feet when walking in the snow. For example, shearling boots are very popular and trendy boots currently. They're made with the finest sheepskin for comfort and warmth but they're not made for the snow. These boots may be very thick and warm, but they're not water resistant and are easily stained by the salt and snow. However, there are some brand name boots that are known for their quality. Boot makers that have high quality goods may be the best known for a reason. You need to do your research and figure out if a brand name is all hype or if they are the best of the best. It is a good idea to shop around for the best deal when buying snow boots. Check the price at local stores as well as online. The perk of getting the boots locally is that you can probably get them right away and you won't have to pay for shipping. The perk of buying snow boots online is that you may have more options to choose from and they may be cheaper. Make sure that you are comparing the exact same boots when shopping around. Slightly different styles may have different costs and different qualities. Even if you want to try the boots on in a store, it doesn't mean that you have to buy them there. Try them on in the store to figure out what size works for you, or to figure out if they fit you well at all, and then buy them where you can get them cheapest. This may very well be online. If you are buying a quality pair of boots they should be guaranteed for life from manufacturing defects. This means that if the stitching fails or the fabric splits, they will repair your boots or send you a new pair. Some damage to boots will probably not be covered by a guarantee. If the damage is caused by something that the boots are meant to withstand, then you may have to pay for replacements. For example, it you accidentally run over them with your car, the manufacturer will probably not repair them for free. Boots that have good guarantees are usually more expensive. However, think of the cost as an investment and remember that instead of buying a new pair every year, you may be able to use these boots for years into the future. Snow boots are usually more expensive when everyone goes to buy them at the beginning of winter. If you plan ahead, however, you can get a much better deal. Try buying your snow boots in early spring, when stores are trying to get rid of all their winter gear. Prices could be much, much lower than they were a few months earlier. Look for discontinued styles as well. These could be even cheaper! What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article highlights the importance of making informed decisions when purchasing snow boots, rather than being swayed by brand names or trends. It advises shoppers to research boot quality and compare prices both in-store and online. The article also suggests trying on boots before purchasing, considering guarantees, and timing the purchase for optimal savings. The focus is on finding affordable, high-quality snow boots that provide comfort, warmth, and durability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","completion":"Charles Ingram Courtenay Wood, the Second Earl of Halifax, was a British national born on the 3rd of October, 1912, at Garrowby, Yorkshire, England. He was also popularly known as 'The Earl of Halifax' — an identifiable moniker that became deeply associated with his name and status. During his lifetime, he had the opportunity to live under the reign of HM King George VI and experience the stalwart leadership of the prime minister, Winston Churchill. Charles Wood obtained his formative education at Christ Church, Oxford, marking the initiation of his intellectual journey and his association with one of the world's most renowned academic institutions. This furnished him not only with high-quality education and exposure but also considerably shaped his future career prospects and beliefs. Wood was an active member of the UK's Conservative Party, establishing his political leanings toward conservatism. He dedicated much of his life to serving the principles and policies of his chosen party. His political affiliations also reveal his key societal values, reflecting his belief in gradual rather than drastic societal changes, the sanctity of traditional institutions, and the necessity of stability and continuity in government. Over the years, he held a prominent status in British society, however, his personal life was equally notable. The Earl of Halifax was married to Ruth Alice Hannah Mary Wood (née Primrose), known as the Countess of Halifax. Together, they shared love and companionship until he passed away. Wood's demise occurred on March 19, 1980, at his residence, Garrowby Hall, in Yorkshire, England. It was a significant loss for the country and left an irreplaceable gap in the Conservative Party. His memory continues to be esteemed by many, especially those in his close circle and the wider political community. A memorial dedicated to Charles Wood is present in York Minster, serving as a testament to his life and legacy. Though he is no more, Wood's contributions, ideals, and service to his country continue to leave an indelible mark in British history. The legacy of Charles Ingram Courtenay Wood, 2nd Earl of Halifax carries on, recollected in the pages of history and hearts of those who had the honor of knowing him. His persona is one that was intricately fused with his political dedication, academic ventures, and personal relationships, offering a comprehensive view of a man truly dedicated to his work and country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to Czech Czech:","completion":"\\"Aye, kapitáne,\\" zazněl ihned Scottův hlas z interkomu, \\"dilitiové krystaly. Czech language is a West Slavic language spoken mostly in the Czech Republic. It is closely related to Slovak and somewhat similar to Polish, and it uses the Latin alphabet along with various diacritical marks or \\"háčky and čárky\\" to distinguish its specific sounds. Here is your given phrase translated into Czech: \\"Ano, kapitáne,\\" ozval se okamžitě hlas Scotta z interkomu, \\"krystaly dilitia. When translating from one language to another, it is essential to consider each language's unique grammar rules, syntax, and vocabulary. In this case, \\"Aye, Captain\\" has been translated to \\"Ano, kapitáne,\\" which is a common way to address the captain or agree with a superior officer in Czech. It's worth noting that while \\"Aye\\" is a rather informal way of saying \\"yes\\" in English, \\"Ano\\" is quite a general term and can be used in both formal and informal settings. Scott's voice is vocalized as \\"hlas Scotta,\\" which literally translates to \\"the voice of Scott.\\" And \\"from the intercom\\" can be translated into \\"z interkomu\\" in Czech. Notice that the preposition \\"from\\" is translated to \\"z\\" in Czech, and \\"interkomu\\" is the equivalent term for \\"intercom.\\" Finally, the core of the phrase relates to the \\"dilithium crystals.\\" The term \\"dilithium crystals\\" is often associated with the fictional material used to provide energy for the warp drive in the Star Trek universe. This concept can be translated into Czech as \\"krystaly dilitia,\\" which shares a similar meaning and maintains the original idea. Translations between English and Czech can be quite complex due to the differences in grammar, syntax, and vocabulary, as well as the cultural and historical factors that may influence certain phrases' meanings. Thus, it's essential to ensure that translations capture the original text's essence while being accurate and conveying the intended message for the target audience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Process: - Oil is gathered through mining operations - The oil is transported to stores - Oil is purchased by homeowners - Oil is placed into a stove in the house - The oil is lit on fire, and burns for a long time - The warm air off of the oil travels through the house - Question: suppose new rigs are built happens, how will it affect more oil is gathered. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The construction of new oil rigs can have a significant impact on the process of oil gathering, transportation, and its eventual use in home heating systems. The proposed perturbation, which is the building of new oil rigs, would directly influence the first step of the process, in which oil is gathered through mining operations. As more oil rigs are built, there will be an increased capacity for oil extraction, resulting in more oil being gathered from various sources, provided that the demand for oil remains stable or increases. This increase in oil extraction could have a ripple effect on the subsequent steps in the process. One of the primary effects would be on the transportation of oil to stores, which is the second step. As more oil is extracted, there is likely to be a higher volume of oil that needs to be transported to various distribution points. This might require expanding the existing infrastructure for transporting oil, such as pipelines, trucks, or ships, to accommodate the increased supply. In the short term, this could create potential bottlenecks in the transportation process, leading to temporary disruptions in the supply chain. However, in the long term, investments in transportation infrastructure would likely be made to handle the increased throughput, stabilizing the supply chain and ensuring a steady flow of oil to stores. An increase in oil production might also impact the price of oil, as more supply could create downward pressure on prices, leading to cheaper oil for homeowners. This could result in increased demand for oil and a potential uptick in its consumption within households. If this happens, more oil would be purchased by homeowners and used in their stoves, leading to an increased burning of oil for heating. Ultimately, this increased usage of oil in homes could lead to more warm air being produced and circulating within the house, providing greater overall warmth to the occupants. In conclusion, building new oil rigs would likely lead to more oil being gathered and transported, which could, in turn, affect the price and usage of oil in home heating systems. The subsequent effect would experience an increase, as more warm air would be generated and distributed throughout the house due to the increased availability and consumption of oil. This, however, is contingent upon stable or increased demand and effective management of the transportation infrastructure necessary to distribute the increased production adequately."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There has been some talk that the Dodgers may go after a Varitek or a pitcher - oriented catcher , which would free Martin from behind the plate and take his athleticism to third base , where the coaches feel he could also be an All - Star , a move Torre , Todd Zeile and Craig Biggio all made successfully . Let 's put this out here plain and clear : Jason Varitek is cooked . Toast . Question: What may be the reason Varitek is cooked toast ?","completion":"Jason Varitek, a former Major League Baseball (MLB) catcher, was considered a valuable asset to his team during his playing career, with his strong skills behind the plate, ability to work with pitchers, and leadership qualities. However, using the term \\"cooked toast\\" implies that his best days are behind him and that he is no longer the asset that he used to be. There could be several reasons for this view on Varitek's abilities and contributions to the team: 1. Aging: The most apparent reason for any professional athlete's decline is the inevitable process of aging. As players grow older, their physical abilities tend to decline, making it harder for them to maintain the same level of performance. Jason Varitek played in the MLB from 1997 to 2011, making him an older player towards the end of his career. As a result, it's not unreasonable to expect some deterioration in his skills and abilities. 2. Wear and tear: Playing a highly demanding position like catcher can take a significant toll on a player's body over time. Catchers are involved in practically every play and are required to squat behind the plate for the majority of the game. This can result in cumulative injuries or issues, such as knee, back, or shoulder problems that can limit a player's effectiveness. It is possible that Varitek experienced this kind of wear and tear, impacting his performance on the field. 3. Declining offensive production: A player's performance at the plate can have a significant impact on their value to the team. If Varitek's offensive production was in decline, this could contribute to the perception that he is \\"cooked toast.\\" Towards the end of his career, his batting average and other offensive statistics might have dropped, making him a less valuable asset as a hitter in the lineup. 4. Changes in the game: Over time, baseball has evolved, with teams placing increasing importance on data-driven analysis and advanced statistics. This may have affected the way players like Varitek were evaluated by teams, with diminished emphasis on traditional, hard-to-quantify skills like game-calling, leadership, and camaraderie. As a result, teams may have viewed Varitek as less valuable in the more data-driven environment. 5. Emergence of younger catchers: As new talent emerges in baseball, older players may find it more challenging to maintain their spots on the roster or keep a starting role. With younger players often displaying potential for growth and development, coupled with lower salary demands, they can be a more attractive option for teams looking to build competitive rosters. If younger catchers were emerging when Varitek's performance started to decline, this could also contribute to the perception that he was \\"cooked toast.\\" In conclusion, the term \\"cooked toast\\" is usually used to imply that a player's best days are behind them and they may no longer prove valuable to a team. In the case of Jason Varitek, this could be due to a combination of aging, wear and tear on his body, declining offensive production, changes in the game, and the emergence of younger talent. These factors might have played a role in diminishing Varitek's value on the field, resulting in the perception that he was \\"cooked toast\\" towards the end of his career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person to whom Bartok dedicated the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928? from the following article ? Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Philip Henry Sheridan (March 6, 1831 - August 5, 1888) was a career United States Army officer and a Union general in the American Civil War. His career was noted for his rapid rise to major general and his close association with General-in-chief Ulysses S. Grant, who transferred Sheridan from command of an infantry division in the Western Theater to lead the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the East. In 1864, he defeated Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley and his destruction of the economic infrastructure of the Valley, called \\"The Burning\\" by residents, was one of the first uses of scorched earth tactics in the war. In 1865, his cavalry pursued Gen. Robert E. Lee and was instrumental in forcing his surrender at Appomattox. The protection of the Great Plains fell under the Department of the Missouri, an administrative area of over 1,000,000 mi.2, encompassing all land between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock was assigned to the department in 1866 but had mishandled his campaign, resulting in Sioux and Cheyenne raids that attacked mail coaches, burned the stations, and killed the employees. They also killed and kidnapped a considerable number of settlers on the frontier. Under pressure from the governors, General Grant turned to Sheridan. In September 1866, Sheridan arrived at the former Fort Martin Scott near Fredericksburg, Texas, where he spent three months subduing Indians in the Texas Hill Country. In August 1867, Grant appointed Sheridan to head the Department of the Missouri and pacify the Plains. His troops, even supplemented with state militia, were spread too thin to have any real effect. He conceived a strategy similar to the one he used in the Shenandoah Valley. In the Winter Campaign of 1868-69 (of which the Battle of Washita River was part) he attacked the Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Comanche tribes in their winter quarters, taking their supplies and livestock and killing those who resisted, driving the rest back into their reservations. When Sherman was promoted to General of the Army following Grant's election as President of the United States, Sheridan was appointed to command the Military Division of the Missouri, with all the Great Plains under his command. Professional hunters, trespassing on Indian land, killed over 4 million bison by 1874, and Sheridan applauded: \\"Let them kill, skin and sell until the buffalo is exterminated\\". When the Texas legislature considered outlawing bison poaching on tribal lands, Sheridan personally testified against it, suggesting that the legislature should give each of the hunters a medal, engraved with a dead buffalo on one side and a discouraged-looking Indian on the other. Eventually the Indians returned to their designated reservations. Sheridan's department conducted the Red River War, the Ute War, and the Great Sioux War of 1876-77, which resulted in the death of a trusted subordinate, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. The Indian raids subsided during the 1870s and were almost over by the early 1880s, as Sheridan became the commanding general of the U.S. Army. Comanche Chief Tosawi reputedly told Sheridan in 1869, \\"Tosawi, good Indian,\\" to which Sheridan supposedly replied, \\"The only good Indians I ever saw were dead.\\" In Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, Dee Brown attributed the quote to Sheridan, stating that \\"Lieutenant Charles Nordstrom, who was present, remembered the words and passed them on, until in time they were honed into an American aphorism: The only good Indian is a dead Indian. Sheridan denied he had ever made the statement. Biographer Roy Morris Jr. states that, nevertheless, popular history credits Sheridan with saying \\"The only good Indian is a dead Indian.\\" This variation \\"has been used by friends and enemies ever since to characterize and castigate his Indian-fighting career.\\" Did he have any particular strategies?","completion":"Yes, Sheridan had particular strategies. One of them was similar to the one he used in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War. In the Winter Campaign of 1868-69, he attacked the Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Comanche tribes in their winter quarters. He took their supplies and livestock and killed those who resisted, driving the rest back into their reservations. This strategy helped to pacify the Plains and protect people living on the frontier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What had \\"killed and severely injured lake bathers recently?\\" Another letter to The New York Times blamed the shark infestation on the maneuvers of German U-boats near America's East Coast. The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings. Richard G. Fernicola published two studies of the event, and notes that \\"there are many theories behind the New Jersey attacks,\\" and all are inconclusive. Researchers such as Thomas Helm, Harold W. McCormick, Thomas B. Allen, William Young, Jean Campbell Butler, and Michael Capuzzo generally agree with Murphy and Lucas. However, the National Geographic Society reported in 2002 that \\"some experts are suggesting that the great white may not in fact be responsible for many of the attacks pinned on the species. These people say the real culprit behind many of the reported incidents—including the famous 1916 shark attacks in New Jersey that may have served as inspiration for Jaws—may be the lesser known bull shark.\\"Biologists George A. Llano and Richard Ellis suggest that a bull shark could have been responsible for the fatal Jersey Shore attacks. Bull sharks swim from the ocean into freshwater rivers and streams and have attacked people around the world. In his book Sharks: Attacks on Man (1975), Llano writes, One of the most surprising aspects of the Matawan Creek attacks was the distance from the open sea. Elsewhere in the book are accounts of well-documented shark-human interactions at Ahwaz, Iran, which is 90 miles (140 km) upriver from the sea.

The statement \\"Alleles under selection are likely to occur only in those geographic regions where they confer an advantage\\" is related to the concept of genetic differences but is specifically discussing the concept of natural selection. In this context, alleles that provide an advantage in a specific environment are more likely to be passed on to the next generation, increasing their frequency in the population of that geographic region. This process contributes to the genetic differences observed in populations from different geographic regions, as certain alleles will be more prevalent in one region compared to another due to the advantages they provide in those specific environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sudden burst of spring produce in the market after a long, monotonous winter of cavolo nero and bright oranges is one of the things that constantly reminds me why I love living and eating in Italy.

There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake.

It’s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course).

The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \\"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \\"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate.

The social network refused to confirm or deny the software's existence, but said in a statement it was \\"spending time understanding and learning more\\" about China. No decisions about the company's approach in the country had yet been made, a spokeswoman said. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group which campaigns for better privacy online, told the BBC the project sounded \\"extremely disturbing\\". \\"Kudos to the Facebook employees who brought this to the attention of the New York Times,\\" said the EFF's global policy analyst Eva Galperin. \\"It's very nice to know there are some principled people still working there.\\" The sources quoted by the New York Times - both current and former employees - stressed that like many pieces of software worked on internally, it may never be implemented. Censorship concessions Since 2009, the only way to access Facebook in China has been via a virtual private network - software designed to “spoof” your real location and avoid local internet restrictions. Facebook, which has 1.8 billion active users, is aggressively looking to expand in parts of the world beyond its existing markets. In the developing world, that means experimenting with new technology to connect rural areas. And in China, it appears the site is at the very least considering making concessions to China’s notoriously tightly-monitored internet. According to employees quoted anonymously by the New York Times’ reporter Mike Isaac, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was questioned about the plans in an all-staff meeting earlier this summer. \\"It’s better for Facebook to be a part of enabling conversation, even if it’s not yet the full conversation,” he is reported to have said while stressing it was early days. Facebook’s spokeswoman would not confirm or deny the quote was accurate. Mr Zuckerberg recently spent time with China's leader, Xi Jinping, as well as taking time to learn Mandarin. Third-party company Facebook regularly removes content from the network at the request of governments. It makes this process relatively public with a yearly report detailing the quantity and nature of take-down requests. Where this software would differ is in that it would enable a third-party, likely a Chinese company working with Facebook, to prevent messages from appearing in the first place. The range of topics censored in mainland China is vast. Most famously, searches related to the Tiananmen Square yield no results relating to the 1989 massacre. Facebook isn’t the first first Silicon Valley giant to grapple with the moral maze of doing business in China. Google famously pulled out of mainland China after a backlash surrounding the censorship of search results. It now routes all traffic to Google Hong Kong. LinkedIn, the network for professionals, does censor some content - although as the firm isn't typically seen as a host of public debate, the move is not seen as being nearly as contentious. If Facebook follows LinkedIn’s lead, the EFF’s Ms Galperin said \\"Facebook would be trading in their principles in exchange for access to the market. It would have tremendous implications for human rights.\\" Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook Summary:","completion":"Facebook is reportedly developing software to censor users' posts in China, which could help the social media giant regain favour with the country's authorities, who blocked it in 2009."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Transforming your canvas shoes into closed toe sandals can be a fun little project, but it needs supervision of an adult because we'll be using some sharp tools. Here's how we do it: 1. **Mark out the Area**: If you want closed-toe sandals, you'll need to decide which part of the shoe to cut. You have to leave the toe area and the heel. It’s like drawing a fun path on your shoes that you'll follow. Draw on either side of your lace area and decide how wide you want the top of the sandals to be. 2. **Cutting Time**: Once you finish drawing, ask an adult to carefully cut along these lines with a sharp knife or scissor. It is important to cut slowly, because we don't want to accidentally cut too much. 3. **Clean the Edges**: After you're done cutting, there might be some extra threads or rough edges. You can ask an adult to carefully trim them and clean it up. It’s like when you're colouring and you go outside the lines, you just clean it up. 4. **Secure the Edges**: In order to prevent fraying or the threads to come out you can use a glue. Ask an adult to apply the shoe glue to the edges where you made the cuts - it acts like a barrier that keeps everything in place. 5. **Make them Comfortable**: Once you're done, walk around a bit in your new sandals. If you notice any sharp edges poking or hurting your foot, put some soft fabric or a cushion there. It’s like putting a soft pillow on your chair, it becomes more comfortable. Remember, it's always important to ask for an adult's help when you're using sharp tools or glue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Not having friends may be from a variety of different causes. Take some time to consider your reasons. Also, keep in mind that you can choose to change your situation and seek out friends if you want. Some questions you might ask yourself to determine the reason why you don’t have friends at the moment include: Have you undergone a significant change recently? Going away to college or moving to a new city can be part of the reason why you may not yet have friends. Likewise, having a falling out with friends can lead to isolation. Did you recently lose a friend or group of friends for some reason? Are you naturally introverted? If you tend to prefer your alone time to spending time with other people, then you might be an introvert. If this is the case, then not having friends may be due to a preference for solitude. However, you can still have friends and maintain your solitude. Have you been struggling with emotional turmoil lately? If you have been feeling down for a while and unable to motivate yourself to go out and seek friendship, then this could also be part of the reason why you don’t have friends. If so, it is important to seek help. Talk to your school counselor, someone in the counseling center at your college, or a trusted adult, such as a parent, teacher, or religious leader. It is important to accept yourself for who you are right now. Realize that there’s nothing wrong with you for being shy, different, or just not very social. Your worth as a person isn’t determined by how many friends you have, so don’t let anyone make you feel bad about yourself. If your peers try to make fun of you, stand up for yourself. Don’t get into a physical fight, but do let people know you aren’t a pushover. If you want to make more friends in the future, accepting yourself as you are now is an important first step. Despite what society and other people might tell you, it’s perfectly okay to prefer spending time by yourself. There is nothing wrong with being quiet, introverted, and reserved. If you decide you don’t mind not having close friends, don’t let anyone tell you your preference is wrong. However, keep in mind that being alone all of the time is not healthy either. You may not want to be as social as other people, but having some degree of socialization is healthy. If being around people makes you nervous, ask yourself whether social anxiety could be holding you back from making friends. Other conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, ADHD, and autism can also make it difficult to befriend others. If you think you have a mental health disorder, ask your parents to take you to a doctor or therapist. If you feel persistently sad or hopeless, talk to your school counselor or a therapist. They can help you get to the bottom of your feelings and develop some strategies for coping socially.","completion":"The article discusses various factors that may contribute to not having friends, emphasizes the importance of self-acceptance, and suggests seeking help and developing coping strategies if emotional or mental health issues may be causing social difficulties."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body.

Since the Klondike bar is considered something desirable and valuable in popular culture, comparing Adam to it suggests that the person who wrote the tweet believes that Adam is also highly desirable, valuable and potentially even better than the product. This tweet thus embodie a positive sentiment towards Adam Lambert, expressing the idea that he is better or more valuable than something already considered desirable like a Klondike bar. The tweet is a compliment and a sign of appreciation for Adam, and it's likely meant to make the user, as well other fans of Adam Lambert, feel connected and share their admiration for the singer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001? ? Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding.

On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused.

Chemical weed killers containing glyphosate are an easy way to kill unwanted wild rose, but you do need to be very careful not to let it impact the plants that you don't want to remove. Some chemical weed killers will linger in the soil so chose your weed killer carefully if you want to replant in the area soon after. OPT: I. Consider placing mulch around the area. You can also dig around the area to help kill the roses, with a shovel, or garden fork.. II. If you are concerned about rotting of mature stems, consider trying a homeopathic weed killer. Dig a hole that is 12 inches (30 cm) deep.. III. Be sure to read the instructions before adding your weed killer to the lawn clippings. Your florist can also provide supplemental weed killer.. IV. Also make sure you choose a weed killer effective for use on woody plants. Get rid of wild rose bushes in late summer, if possible.. Answer:","completion":"In order to get rid of a wild rose bush, you need to combine both chemical and physical methods. You will first have to choose an appropriate weed killer, specifically chemical weed killers that contain glyphosate. Glyphosate is an active ingredient in many herbicides, and it works by inhibiting an enzyme involved in the production of amino acids crucial to plant growth. However, glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide, meaning it will kill most plants it comes into contact with — not just the wild rose bush. Therefore, when using such a weed killer, it is important to be precise and careful to avoid damaging other surrounding plants you wish to keep. To properly use the weed killer, make sure you read the instructions and follow them accurately. Safety should be your priority; therefore, wear protective clothing to avoid skin contact with the glyphosate. Generally, this will involve mixing a specific amount of the weed killer with water in a spray bottle or larger sprayer. This mixture is then applied directly to the leaves and stems of the wild rose bush. The best time to apply the weed killer is when the rose bush is actively growing, usually in late spring or early summer. This is when the plant will absorb the most glyphosate and effectively transport it to the roots, which will ensure a thorough extermination of the plant. However, you should be aware that some chemical weed killers can linger in the soil, posing potential risks to any future plants that you may wish to cultivate in the formerly infested area. Therefore, choose your weed killer carefully if you plan to replant in this area soon, or consider using a glyphosate-free alternative. Physical methods can also be applied to help kill the wild rose bush. For instance, you can place mulch around the area to prevent the plant from obtaining the sunlight it needs for photosynthesis. Moreover, you can manually dig around the area using a shovel or garden fork to remove the plant's root system, which will help stop it from spreading. To effectively do this, dig a hole that's approximately 12 inches (30 cm) deep around the bush. Further, if you're concerned about the possibility of mature stems rotting, you can try using a homeopathic weed killer as an alternative. These are usually made with natural ingredients like vinegar or citrus oil, which help to kill the wild rose bush without causing harm to the environment. And lastly, remember to do this process preferably in late summer when the wild rose bush's growth slows down. This will help ensure a more effective extermination process. Furthermore, the selection of a weed killer effective for use on woody plants like the wild rose bush is essential. Not all herbicides are designed to kill such types of plants effectively; therefore, you need to check whether the one you choose is suitable for the task. To sum up, getting rid of a wild rose bush requires careful selection and use of a weed killer combined with physical removal methods. It's a task that needs precision, patience, and the right resources, but with careful management and the right approach, your garden can be free of the wild rose bush."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we're going to learn about a fun, natural way to add some color to your hair. Doesn't that sound cool? It's called \\"Henna Hair Dye\\". Now, let's start our adventure to find out how to use this awesome thing called henna! Step 1: Purchase Henna Hair Dye First, you or your mommy or daddy need to buy henna hair dye. Henna is a special powder that magically adds color to your hair. You can find it in stores or online. Step 2: Gather Your Other Materials Besides henna, there are some other tools you'll need to complete this magical hair-coloring journey: - A mixing bowl to mix the henna powder with water - A spoon to mix the henna - Gloves to keep your hands clean - An old T-shirt to protect your clothes - Hair clips to divide your hair into sections - A shower cap or plastic wrap to cover your head Step 3: Protect Your Clothes, Skin, and Work Area Wearing an old T-shirt and gloves will protect your clothes and skin from the henna dye. Cover your work area with an old sheet, newspapers or plastic wrap to prevent any spills or stains from the henna paste. Safety first! Step 4: Make a Paste with the Henna Powder Now it's time for magic! Mix the henna powder with water in the mixing bowl using a spoon until it becomes a thick paste. It should look like greenish-brown toothpaste. Fun, right? Step 5: Divide Your Hair into Sections Ask mommy or daddy to divide your hair into four or more sections using hair clips. This helps make applying the henna paste to your hair much easier! Step 6: Apply the Henna Paste to Your Hair Now, gently rub the henna paste onto your hair. Make sure to cover each section from your roots to the tips of your hair. Remember to wear gloves to keep your hands clean. Step 7: Wrap Your Head Once your hair is all covered in the henna paste, ask your mommy or daddy to help wrap your head with a shower cap or plastic wrap. This keeps the henna paste in place and lets it work its magic! Step 8: Wait Now, it's time to be patient! You need to wait for the henna paste to color your hair. This could take about 2 to 4 hours, depending on how dark you want your new hair color to be. While you're waiting, you can watch your favorite show, read a book, or take a nap! Step 9: Wash It Out When the waiting is over, it's time to rinse the henna paste out of your hair. You can do this in the shower or sink. Make sure to wash your hair until the water runs clear. This means all the henna paste has been washed away! Step 10: Be Careful of Staining Henna hair dye may still stain your towels, pillowcases, or clothes after washing it out. So use old towels and pillowcases for a few days until there is no residue left. Don't forget to ask your mommy or daddy for help! Bonus Tip: Avoid Overuse of Henna Henna is safe and natural, but using it too much might make your hair feel dry. To keep your hair looking and feeling great, try not to use it more than once every 4-6 weeks. And that's it! Now you know how to color your hair with henna hair dye. Pretty cool, huh? Just remember to always ask for help from your mommy, daddy, or an adult since they know best.

Terry asks his boss's wife Sylvia to his apartment after an office party and the two go to bed. Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window. At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

Article: In the atmosphere, carbon dioxide acts rather like a one-way mirror or the glass in the roof of a greenhouse which allows the sun's rays to enter but prevents the heat from escaping According to a weather expert's prediction , the atmosphere will be 3degC warmer in the year 2050 than it is today, if man continues to burn fuels at the present rate.If this warming up took place.the ice caps in the poles would begin to inch,thus raising sea level several meters and severely flooding coastal cities.Also.the increase in atmospheric temperature would lead to great changes in the climate of the northern hemisphere ,possibly resulting in an alteration of the earth's chief food growing zones. In the past,concern about a man-made warming of the earth has concentrated on the Arctic because the Antarctic is much colder and has a much thicker ice sheet.But the weather experts are now paying more attention to West Antarctic.which may be affected by only a few degrees of warming,in other words,by a warming on the scale that will possibly take place in the next fifty years from the burning of fuels. Satellite pictures show that large areas of Antarctic ice are already disappearing.The evidence available suggests that a warming has taken place.This fits the theory that carbon dioxide warms the earth. However, most of the fuel is burnt in the northern hemisphere,where temperatures seem to be falling.Scientists conclude,therefore ,that up to now natural influences on the weather have gone beyond those caused by man.The question is:Which natural cause has most effect on the weather? One possibility is the variable behavior of the sun.Astronomers at one research station have studied the hot spots and 'cold' spots (that is, the ly less hot spots)on the sun.As the sun rotates ,every 27.5 days,it presents hotter or colder faces to the earth,and different aspects to different parts of the earth.This seems to have a considerable effect on the distribution of the earth atmospheric pressure,and consequently on wind... Question: Although the fuel consumption is greater in the northern hemisphere, temperatures there seem to be falling.This is_. Answer: Answer:","completion":"Although the fuel consumption is greater in the northern hemisphere, temperatures there seem to be falling. This is likely due to natural influences on the weather, such as the variable behavior of the sun, which may temporarily counteract or outweigh the warming effects of increased carbon dioxide levels from human activities. Astronomers have studied the hot spots and 'cold' spots on the sun and noted that as the sun rotates every 27.5 days, it presents varying temperatures to different parts of Earth. This variation in solar temperature has a considerable effect on global atmospheric pressure and wind patterns, thus impacting the weather. While human-induced climate change is still a significant concern, these natural phenomena can lead to short-term cooling effects that may temporarily mask the underlying warming trends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to find the answer, I will need to conduct research on Palermo's waterways. Step 5: Provide the answer based on research. After conducting research, I found that the only remaining waterway in Palermo is the Kemonia River (also known as Fiume Kemonia). It currently runs underground through the city after being covered during urban expansion in Palermo. Step 6: Ensure the answer is satisfactory. The answer is now satisfactory because it provides the specific name of the only remaining waterway in Palermo.

What is the final step of the following process: - Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process described above is the formation of iron oxide, commonly known as rust. This occurs as a result of the chemical reaction between the dissolved iron and the free oxygen in the presence of water. When water comes into contact with an iron surface, it interacts with the carbon dioxide present in the air to form a weak carbonic acid (H2CO3). The formation of this acid leads to a reduction in the pH level of the aqueous environment in contact with the iron surface. As the acidity increases, the iron (Fe) atoms on the surface begin to dissolve into the water, forming iron ions (Fe2+). Simultaneously, some of the water molecules break down into their constituent elements, hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The free oxygen molecules in the water then react with the dissolved iron ions to form iron oxide (Fe2O3), which is commonly referred to as rust. This substance appears as a reddish-brown material on the surface of the iron and is a sign of the corrosion that has occurred. Rust is porous and flaky in nature, which exposes more iron to water and oxygen, causing the corrosion process to continue and eventually weaken the iron structure. To summarize, the final step in this corrosion process is the formation of iron oxide, or rust, which is the result of a chemical reaction between dissolved iron ions and free oxygen molecules in the presence of water. This reaction leads to the weakening and eventual degradation of the iron structure, making it crucial to prevent or minimize rust formation in iron-based materials to maintain their strength and integrity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When other people are part of the mix, it can distract you and the girl you like from paying full attention to each other. By spending time alone and doing fun activities, you can show her that you're good dating material. Some alone together activities you might consider include: Going out to get coffee together. The relaxed, cozy atmosphere of most coffee shops can be a great way of calming nerves while spending time together. Watching a movie together. You might go to a theatre or watch one at home, but in either case, you'll both be able to enjoy sharing this experience together. Doing light hiking together. This way you'll be able to enjoy the beauty of nature while getting to know the girl you like. You don't have to take daily runs, although exercising together can help you and the girl you like grow closer. Something as simple as throwing a frisbee around a park can help you and the girl you like make this physical connection. Other options you might try include: Playing her favorite sport, like volleyball, soccer, or baseball. You might do this with just the two of you, or invite friends to join. Team up together to play a two-person game, like the bean bag toss game which is sometimes also called the cornhole game. Some events are generally looked at as being things that couples do together, like watching fireworks or going out to eat. To make this seem less like a date while still indicating you like her, you might invite her by saying: \\"I heard this new great restaurant opened up downtown. It looks delicious and I was planning on going there but I didn't want to go alone. Would you like to come with me?\\" \\"It's been forever since I watched the Independence Day fireworks. I have a really great spot to see the view. Would you like to come with me?\\" Learning a new skill with the girl you like will give you a shared experience through which your relationship can grow. Beyond that, after you learn, you'll both have a sense of accomplishment together which will only improve your bond. Some skills you might consider: Taking a painting class together after school, at a community center, or at a community college. Even if you're no Picasso by the end of your class, you'll both have enjoyed time together learning something new. Learning the basics of baking or cooking. Many cooking classes are available after school, or you could learn recipes alone with her at your home. Taking a dance class together. Physical contact releases a hormone that encourages trust and closeness, so learning to dance with her could spark romance.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who is the worker the boy beagle knocks using the spinning bars? Oswald is walking merrily on the road, heading towards the county fair. On his way, the boy beagle is expelled out of the house by a disgruntled father. The father dog roughs up the boy beagle some more before returning indoors. Feeling sorry for his little friend, Oswald decides to take the little dog along. At the fair, Oswald and the boy beagle disguise themselves as a single customer in an attempt to just pay for one ticket. But their cover is blown when they stumble, prompting the ticket seller to shoo them. Annoyed by that employee, the boy beagle assaults the ticket seller, eventually knocking the latter out of the ticket booth. Going further into fair, the boy beagle wishes to board the roller coaster. But when a guard demands for a ticket which he has none, the little dog decides to just harass the guard, momentarily knocking that worker using the spinning bars. Oswald, who tries to take him, would also be knocked down by those bars. Oswald chases the boy beagle into the trousers of a hefty tourist. While the little dog is able to get out of the pants, the rabbit gets stuck. The boy beagle begins pelting Oswald in the head with some baseballs. Oswald then pursues the boy beagle into a high striker which the little dog climbs up. Oswald strikes the lever with a mallet but the boy beagle is able to dodge the bell-hitting mechanism. Oswald strikes the lever once more but harder. The impact of the second hit was so powerful that the high striker collapses. The rabbit then captures the boy beagle in a way that the tiny canine cannot escape.

Keith was born in Clinton, Oklahoma, to Carolyn Joan (nee Ross) and Hubert K. Covel, Jr. and is of English ancestry. He has a sister and a brother. The family lived in Fort Smith, Arkansas, for a few years when Keith was in grade school, but moved to Moore, Oklahoma (a suburb of Oklahoma City) when he was still young. Before the family moved to Moore, he visited his grandmother in Fort Smith during the summers. Keith had a public feud with the Dixie Chicks over the song \\"Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue\\", in 2003 as well as over comments they made about President George W. Bush on stage during a concert in London. The lead singer of the Dixie Chicks, Natalie Maines, publicly stated that Keith's song was \\"ignorant, and it makes country music sound ignorant\\". Keith responded by pointing out that Maines did not write her music and he does, and by displaying a backdrop at his concerts showing a doctored photo of Maines with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. On May 21, 2003, Maines wore a T-shirt with the letters \\"FUTK\\" on the front at the Academy of Country Music Awards. While a spokesperson for the Dixie Chicks said that the acronym stood for \\"Friends United in Truth and Kindness,\\" many, including host Vince Gill, took it to be a shot at Keith (\\"Fuck You Toby Keith\\"). In an October 2004 appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher, Maines finally confessed that it was indeed a shot at Keith, and that she \\"thought that nobody would get it\\". In August 2003, Keith's representation publicly declared he was done feuding with Maines \\"because he's realized there are far more important things to concentrate on\\". Keith was referring specifically to the terminal illness of a former bandmate's daughter, Allison Faith Webb. However, he continues to refuse to say Maines' name, and claims that the doctored photo was intended to express his opinion that Maines' criticism was an attempt to squelch Keith's free speech. In April 2008, a commercial spot to promote Al Gore's \\"We Campaign\\", involving both Keith and the Dixie Chicks, was proposed. However, the idea was eventually abandoned due to scheduling conflicts.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success.

Maria Lea Carmen Imutan Salonga, KLD (born February 22, 1971), known as Lea Salonga (), is a Filipina singer and actress best known for her roles in musical theatre, for supplying the singing voices of two Disney Princesses, and as a recording artist and television performer. At age 18, she originated the lead role of Kim in the musical Miss Saigon, first in the West End and then on Broadway, winning the Olivier and Theatre World Awards, and becoming the first Asian woman to win a Tony Award. Salonga is the first Filipino artist to sign with an international record label (Atlantic Records in 1993). She is also the first Philippine-based artist to have received a major album release and distribution deal in the United States, and one of the best-selling Filipino artists of all time, having sold over 19 million copies of her albums worldwide. Maria Lea Carmen Imutan Salonga was born at Medical Center Manila in Ermita, Manila, to Feliciano Genuino Salonga, a naval Rear admiral and shipping company owner (1929-2016), and his wife, Maria Ligaya Alcantara, nee Imutan. She spent the first six years of her childhood in Angeles City before moving to Manila. Her brother, Gerard Salonga, is a conductor. She made her professional debut in 1978 at the age of seven in the musical The King and I with Repertory Philippines. She played the title role in Annie in 1980 and appeared in other productions such as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Fiddler on the Roof, The Sound of Music, The Rose T, The Goodbye Girl (1982), Paper Moon (1983) and The Fantasticks (1988). In 1981, she recorded her first album, Small Voice, which was certified gold in the Philippines. In 1985, she and her brother took part in the eighth Metro Manila Popular Music Festival as the interpreters for the song entry titled \\"Musika, Lata, Sipol at La La La\\" which was composed by Tess Concepcion. During the 1980s, Salonga also had several television projects through GMA Radio Television Arts where she worked as a child actor and teen idol. After the success of her first album, from 1983 to 1985, she hosted her own musical television show, Love, Lea, and was a member of the cast of German Moreno's teen variety show That's Entertainment. She acted in films, which included the family-oriented Tropang Bulilit, Like Father, Like Son, Ninja Kids, Captain Barbell and Pik Pak Boom. As a young performer, Salonga received a Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS) award nomination for Best Child Actress, and three Aliw Awards for best child performer in 1980, 1981 and 1982. She released her second album, Lea, in 1988. She also opened for, and performed with, international acts such as Menudo and Stevie Wonder in their concerts in Manila in 1985 and in 1988, respectively. She finished her secondary education in 1988 at the O. B. Montessori Center in Greenhills, San Juan, Metro Manila, where she was a Bergamo 1 Student and an active participant in school productions. She also attended the University of the Philippines College of Music's extension program aimed at training musically talented children in music and stage movement.

It figures this is a French film, LOL, with the emphasis on young girls with much older men...why is it the French are so fixated on this kind of thing? When the age difference is this great, it really comes off as pervy! Valentina Cervi is beautiful (she bears a strong resemblance to Olivia Hussey, of Zeffirelli's '68 Romeo and Juliet, set in a similar period), but she looks about 15 and the actor playing Tassi, her painting instructor, looks...well, 50 is KIND. Other posters have done the work of explaining the historical record (unusually detailed in this case) of the real Artemisia, a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period (17th century). Her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the age-old accusation that \\"all great artists were men\\" -- she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits -- and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant. Not only was she clearly assaulted, and forced into a degrading sexual relationship (because in those days marriage to your assaulter was the only way to avoid social shame), but Tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and child. The movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story -- very dramatic and not in need of any \\"spicing up\\" -- because in some weird Frencified way, it's \\"hotter\\" to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather. That's \\"sexy\\" -- the truth is boring and seems too feminist/politically correct. It also disturbs me that this is ONLY part of Artemisia life considered interesting enough to film. The fact that she painted for decades (her famous painting of Judith beheading Holfernes was painted AFTER, not before the rape), that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious Florentine Academy, that she went on to have children...oh that's boring stuff. After all, that's about a middle aged woman and they aren't \\"hot\\" like teenagers. I understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film (or a book) about a real historical character. You need to create dialog, have subplots, create dramatic structure. Certainly some details can be sacrificed -- it's no big deal if the dates are moved a few years, or if Artemisia is played by a blonde actress (when we know from her self portraits that she was a brunette...and a big boned one, not a skinny minny), or something like that. But to turn her story around on her, and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing. It's even worse because the director is female. She should be horribly ashamed of herself! If you LIKE this (and I know some people could care less about the real woman artist and just like period costumes and hot sex), you will probably like \\"Dangerous Beauty\\" with Rufus Sewell and Catherine McCormack.

Question: what is 2nd or 3rd cousin once removed The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the given statement does not directly answer the question about what 2nd or 3rd cousins once removed are. To clarify the concept of 2nd and 3rd cousins once removed, we can define them as follows: A 2nd cousin is a relative with whom you share common great-grandparents but not common grandparents. In other words, you both have the same great-grandparents, but you have different grandparents and parents. A 3rd cousin is a relative with whom you share common great-great-grandparents, but you have different great-grandparents, grandparents, and parents. The term \\"once removed\\" refers to a one-generation difference between two relatives. When we say \\"2nd cousin once removed,\\" it means that one person is a 2nd cousin of the other person's parent (or child). For example, your father's 2nd cousin would be your 2nd cousin once removed because there is a one-generation gap between you and your father's 2nd cousin. Similarly, a \\"3rd cousin once removed\\" refers to a situation where one person is a 3rd cousin of the other person's parent (or child). For instance, your mother's 3rd cousin would be your 3rd cousin once removed due to the one-generation difference between you and your mother's 3rd cousin. So, in conclusion, the concept of 2nd or 3rd cousins once removed refers to a relationship in which one person is a 2nd or 3rd cousin to the other person's parent or child, making it a one-generation difference between those individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I do not recommend this place at all and it's a shame as I have enjoyed watching Rick Moonen on Master Chef and thought we'd give this place a whirl. We ordered their \\"featured\\" appetizer, the foie gras which was hyped up by our server. The way he described, it sounded like the foie gras was going to be the star of the plate \\"drizzled\\" with a balsamic reduction. Well, when it arrived, the foie gras was swimming in a pool, literally, of balsamic and it was inedible. We informed the waiter, and he said he would correct the error. He returned with the same piece of foie gras, now just removed from the pool and sitting on a bare plate. Really? We said, \\"no thank you\\" as it was not presentable at this point and it had absorbed all the balsamic from the time in the pool. We then ordered a bottle of wine, needed it at this point, clam chowder, whole lobster; one steamed and one broiled and their macaroni and cheese for a side and the broccoli raab vegetable. The clam chowder came out cold with a heaping handful of fresh thyme on the top which made it entirely inedible. I asked for bread with the soup and the waiter said, \\"crackers?\\" and I repeated, \\"bread please.\\" He brought out two, quarter-sized rolls. Could they spare it? The lobsters were brought out but I ordered steamed and the server was going to give me the broiled one by mistake so I informed him that I wanted the steamed one. Instead of just putting it in the right place, he went back to the kitchen only to return a few seconds later to put the steamed one in front of me. Huh? When I touched it, it was ice cold; chilled lobster? I informed the waiter and I said that this was now ridiculous and please tell me where the hidden camera is. I mean iced cold! He took it back to the kitchen. I stared at the Mac and cheese and when I picked some up on my fork to take a bite, it was dripping no more like running cream/butter/milk -- disgusting. Kraft would be more appetizing than that! I asked the waiter if he would eat that mac and cheese that was swimming in milk or cream and he said \\"no.\\" so I sent that back and p.s. the veggies were cold too. When the Lobsters arrived back at the table, I ate my share, as I was very hungry at this point and just wanted to get out of there. They appropriately took off everything from our bill except the Lobster and the chowder (which was terrible) and we paid and left.

Write an article based on this \\"A PE teacher took advantage of a drunken woman and raped her, a jury has heard.\\"","completion":"Title: Understanding the Consequences: The Horrendous Actions of a PE Teacher Introduction: In a harrowing tale of abuse and betrayal, a physical education (PE) teacher found himself in the center of a devastating scandal and a heinous act. The incident, involving the sexual assault of a vulnerable and inebriated woman, has sent shockwaves through the community and ignited conversations about consent, the responsibility of educators, and the need for society to reevaluate how we perceive and respond to such actions. The Crime: According to court depositions, the accused, a respected PE teacher, met the woman at a local social gathering. It was here that the woman consumed alcohol to the point of inebriation, a state in which she was not able to make responsible decisions, least of all, provide consent for any sexual contact. In a reprehensible act, the PE teacher took advantage of her vulnerable state and proceeded to sexually assault her. The Trial: As the case unfolded in court, the jury heard the gut-wrenching and painful testimony of the survivor. Her accounts detailed the horrors she endured, reinforcing the notion that consent is an unequivocal, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in any sexual activity. It's a fundamental right, independent of a person's state of inebriation or other circumstances. The accused's decision to ignore this consent is not only a grave violation but a criminal act. Addressing the Issue of Consent: This case raises significant concerns about our understanding of consent and sexual assault prevention. Educators, in particular, are expected to adhere to a higher moral code and serve as role models for their students. Their actions should emphasize the importance of respect, communication, and empathy when dealing with others. This incident highlights the need for further education and open discussions on the topic of consent and recognizing the signs of vulnerability. Support for Survivors: The bravery of the survivor in this case should not go unnoticed. Coming forward and seeking justice in the face of such a traumatic experience is a painful process. Support for survivors is of utmost importance, and organizations that provide aid, counseling, and resources to those who have experienced sexual assault play a crucial role in the healing process. Additionally, educating society on how to effectively support survivors and empathize with their experiences is essential in destigmatizing sexual assault cases and creating an environment where survivors feel heard and understood. Preventing Future Incidents: To mitigate the possibility of similar incidents in the future, several steps can be taken at both the community and institutional level. Establishing clear guidelines and comprehensive training for educators on issues of sexual misconduct, responsibility, and how to recognize vulnerability is a critical starting point. Schools should regularly reinforce these guidelines and ensure that all staff members are held accountable for their actions. Moreover, fostering open discussions about consent and sexual assault among students creates an environment centered around mutual respect, understanding, and empathy. Society, too, must recognize the importance of conversations about consent and the consequences of violating it in order to create holistic change. Conclusion: The PE teacher's abhorrent actions are a stark reminder of the urgent need for society to address issues relating to consent and sexual assault in all spheres of life. Educators have a particularly significant role in promoting respect and modeling appropriate behavior for young people, serving as an essential part of this change process. Only through comprehensive education, supportive environments, and cultivating a better understanding of consent can we move forward in the fight against sexual violence and protect the most vulnerable members of our society."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He meets up with his best friend since childhood, Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise), who is a US Navy Commander working with the Department of Defense to escort Defense Secretary Charles Kirkland (Joel Fabiani) and Powell at the fight after a trip to Norfolk, Virginia. As the first round begins, Dunne is distracted by an attractive redhead named Serena (Jayne Heitmeyer) who wears a ruby ring, and leaves his seat, which is then taken by Julia Costello (Carla Gugino), a mysterious woman with platinum blonde hair and a white satin suit. When Tyler is unexpectedly knocked out by Ruiz, gunshots ring out, mortally wounding Kirkland and grazing Costello, who loses her glasses and blonde wig, revealing her naturally dark hair. Dunne kills the sniper and Santoro orders the arena to be locked down. Despite the lockdown, Costello escapes into the casino, covers her wounds in pieces of cloth from her blouse and after stealing a black satin jacket, disguises herself as a hooker. Santoro becomes suspicious when he notices that the 'knocked out' Tyler woke up instantly when the shots rang out, and after studying the fight tape, realizes the knockout punch didn't connect.

Joy Division were an English post-punk band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester. Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer-songwriter Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bass player Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The band was formed by Sumner and Hook after attending a 4 June 1976 Sex Pistols concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. While Joy Division's early recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they evolved a unique sound, aided by producer Martin Hannett, which earned their reputation as pioneers of the post-punk movement. Joy Division toured Continental Europe in January 1980. Although the schedule was difficult and demanding, Curtis experienced only two grand mal seizures, both in the final two months of the tour. That March, the band recorded their second album, Closer with Hannett again producing at London's Britannia Row Studios. That month they released the \\"Licht und Blindheit\\" single, with \\"Atmosphere\\" as the A side and \\"Dead Souls\\" as the B side, on the French independent label Sordide Sentimental. A lack of sleep and long hours committed to the bands' activities destabilised Curtis's epilepsy, and resultingly, his seizures became almost uncontrollable. Curtis would often experience seizures during live performances, which would leave him feeling both ashamed and depressed. As the band worried about their singer, some audience members thought his seizures and behaviour were simply part of the show. On 7 April, Curtis attempted suicide by overdosing on his anti-seizure medication; phenobarbitone. The following evening, Joy Division were scheduled to play a gig at the Derby Hall in Bury. Curtis was too ill to perform, so at Rob Gretton's insistence, the band played a combined set with Alan Hempsall of Crispy Ambulance and Simon Topping of A Certain Ratio singing on the first few songs, with Curtis singing for part of the set. When Topping came back towards the end of the srt, some audience members threw bottles at the stage. Curtis's ill health lead to the cancellation of several other gigs that April. Joy Division's final live performance was held at the University of Birmingham's High Hall on 2 May, and included their only performance of \\"Ceremony\\", one of the last songs written by Curtis and later recorded by New Order as their first single. Hannett's production has been widely praised. However, as with Unknown Pleasures, both Hook and Sumner were unhappy with the production. Hook said that when he heard the final mix of \\"Atrocity Exhibition\\" he was disappointed that the abrasiveness had been toned down. He wrote; \\"I was like, head in hands, 'Oh fucking hell, it's happening again. Unknown Pleasures number two...Martin [Hannett] had fucking melted the guitar with his Marshall Time Waster. Made it sound like someone strangling a cat and, to my mind, absolutely killed the song. I was so annoyed with him and went in and gave him a piece of my mind but he just turned round and told me to fuck off\\".

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Mike was reading about an instrument that could measure gravity, gravimeter. He then found how gravimeter was used to measure the gravitational field of the Moon. He read about two distinct cases where the Moon's gravitational field was measured on earth, side A and side B. In side A the Moon's gravity was measured from the side where the Earth was facing the Moon. And in side B the Moon's gravitational field was measured from the opposite side of the Earth. He found these two locations showed very different consequences of Moon's gravitational field. But I can use this background: Because the gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally. As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to \\"catch up\\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height. What is an answer for this question: Would side B see less or more deformed Earth than side A? A:","completion":"Side B would see less deformed Earth than side A. Here's an explanation: The Moon's gravity has a stronger effect on the side of the Earth facing the Moon (side A) because it is closer to the Moon. This stronger gravitational pull results in a higher tidal force, making the Earth deform more on side A compared to side B. On side B, where the Earth is facing away from the Moon, the gravitational force from the Moon is weaker due to the increased distance. This results in a lower tidal force, so the Earth's deformation is less pronounced on side B than on side A. In summary, the Earth would be more deformed on the side facing the Moon (side A) due to the stronger gravitational force exerted by the Moon, whereas the opposite side (side B) would be less deformed due to the weaker gravitational force."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the most logical next event? How to build wealth in your 20s Pay more than the minimum on monthly loan payments. Paying off college loans should be your top financial priority. While many people in their 20s plan to let their college loans linger while accumulating money in savings or checking accounts, this is not the wisest approach.","completion":"The most logical next event after building wealth in your 20s by paying more than the minimum on monthly loan payments and prioritizing paying off college loans would be to create a solid financial plan and start investing in diverse assets. 1. Create a budget and track your expenses: The next step to building wealth is to create a budget to understand where your money is going and to identify areas where you can better allocate your funds. A budget will also help you visualize your financial goals more realistically. You can use personal finance tools or applications to keep track of your income and expenses easily. 2. Build an emergency fund: It's essential to accumulate an emergency fund of about six months' worth of living expenses before you start investing. This fund serves as a safety net in case you face any unexpected events like job loss, medical emergencies, or car repairs. Keeping an emergency fund will also reduce your reliance on high-interest debt, such as credit cards, during difficult times. 3. Eliminate high-interest debt: While focusing on paying off your college loans, do not neglect any other high-interest debt you might have, such as credit card debt. By aggressively paying off high-interest debts, you'll save money in the long run and improve your overall financial position. 4. Start saving for retirement: Once your debts are under control, consider contributing to your retirement savings. In your 20s, you can take advantage of compound interest and build a substantial retirement fund by starting early. Invest in retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) or an IRA (Individual Retirement Account), which offer tax benefits and help your money grow over time. 5. Invest in diverse assets: To build wealth, you must begin investing in different types of assets to diversify your risk. Consider investing in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). You can build a more aggressive portfolio in your 20s by allocating a significant portion of your investments to equities since you have a longer time horizon to withstand market fluctuations. 6. Automate your savings and investments: One of the most effective ways to ensure regular savings and investments is by automating the process. Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings, retirement, or investment accounts. This approach guarantees regular contributions and helps you stay disciplined in your financial journey. 7. Increase your income streams: Focus on improving your career prospects through continuous learning, networking, and acquiring new skills. Also, consider exploring additional streams of income such as freelancing, side hustles, or investment income. 8. Live below your means: Minimizing your expenses and sticking to your budget will help you save and invest even more. Find ways to live frugally without compromising too much on the quality of life. Adopting a minimalist lifestyle allows you to allocate your resources better, focus on what's truly important, and build wealth faster. 9. Review your financial plan periodically: Your financial goals and priorities may change over time. Therefore, it's essential to review and adjust your financial plan every few years or as your circumstances change. Regular assessment helps you stay on track and make necessary modifications to your budget, savings, and investment plans. In conclusion, building wealth in your 20s involves a combination of aggressive debt repayment, strategic financial planning, disciplined savings, and smart investing. By adopting these strategies and staying committed to your financial goals, you can set yourself up for financial success in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The face of Jessica had a lot more wrinkles than Jennifer because","completion":"The face of Jessica had a lot more wrinkles than Jennifer because the various factors that contributed to the aging process had affected her more profoundly. These factors encompass both internal and external elements that have influenced the rate and extent of aging, some of which are an inevitable part of life, while others are more dependent on lifestyle, genetics, and environmental exposures. One of the primary reasons Jessica's face may have had more wrinkles is due to genetic predispositions. Our genetic makeup and heredity play a significant role in determining skin structure, strength, and natural resilience. Certain individuals may inherit genes that promote stronger collagen and elastin fibers, which are responsible for the overall elasticity and firmness of the skin. In Jessica's case, her genetic disposition could have made her more susceptible to the loss of collagen and elastin, resulting in more apparent wrinkles and sagging. Another possible reason for the increased wrinkles on Jessica's face could be her history of sun exposure. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun can cause significant damage to the skin, breaking down collagen and contributing to wrinkle formation. Prolonged exposure to the sun without proper protection, such as wearing sunscreen or sun-protective clothing, can hasten this process. It is possible that Jessica spent more time outdoors without adequate sun protection, leading to more accelerated photoaging in comparison to Jennifer. Environmental factors such as pollution, smoking, and exposure to irritants can also contribute to premature aging. Jessica might have had more wrinkles due to unfavorable environmental conditions she faced throughout her life. This could include living in a heavily polluted area, working in an environment with harmful toxins, or possibly being a smoker. These factors can generate free radicals in the skin, causing oxidative damage and accelerating the aging process. Stress and inadequate sleep could be other contributing factors for Jessica's wrinkled appearance. When we experience stress or lack of sleep, our body produces higher levels of cortisol, a hormone that can break down collagen and make the skin look more aged. Jessica could have had a more stressful lifestyle or poor sleep patterns that led to a higher rate of skin damage, manifesting in the form of wrinkles. Lastly, nutrition and skincare habits play a role in skin aging. Eating a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, such as fruits and vegetables, can help protect the skin from free-radical damage. Additionally, maintaining a consistent skincare routine, involving gentle cleansing, moisturizing, and using products containing skin-healthy ingredients like retinoids and vitamin C, can help protect and repair the skin. If Jessica had poor nutrition or neglected her skincare routine, it could have contributed to her more wrinkled appearance compared to Jennifer. In summary, Jessica's face had more wrinkles than Jennifer's because of a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that impacted the health and appearance of her skin. These factors led to a more accelerated aging process in Jessica, resulting in a greater prevalence of wrinkles and a more aged appearance than Jennifer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The incantations seemingly fail to produce results, but Chucky suddenly springs to life and kills Tiffany's Goth admirer Damien while Tiffany looks on with excitement.

Q:Information: - William Holman Hunt (2 April 1827 7 September 1910) was an English painter and one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid color, and elaborate symbolism. These features were influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs. For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact. Of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career. He was always keen to maximize the popular appeal and public visibility of his works. - Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic.

Whether you're using a state-of-the-art SLR camera or toting along your trusty smartphone, a holiday simply isn't a holiday if you're not snapping loads of photos along the way. However, each tool requires different techniques to truly get the most out of your photographs - especially if you're looking to rack up those Instagram likes online. Experts recommend incorporating a human element into landscapes - such as a person or their property - in order to truly illustrate the grandeur of the landmark or wilderness around you. When shooting portraits, keep your subjects at eye level, or elevate them, to ensure the most flattering angle. Time of day will also impact the quality of your snap. Dave Bouskill, founder and photographer of adventure travel blog, The Planet D, recommends shooting early in the morning or late at night.

But Jasmine's birth was a special one because she had a 'twin' brother named Simon who was born eight years later! You may wonder, how can they be twins if they were born so many years apart? Let me explain. Jasmine's mommy and daddy really wanted to have a baby, but they were having a hard time making it happen. So they decided to visit some doctors to get some help. These doctors have a special way to help mommy's and daddy's have babies, called IVF (which is short for \\"In Vitro Fertilization\\"). When they tried IVF in 2004, the doctors took some tiny, tiny cells, called embryos, and put two of them inside Jasmine's mommy (Mrs. Billington). These embryos are like magic seeds that can grow into babies. The doctors also took 22 other embryos and put them into a very cold place, like a freezer, so they could use them later. Jasmine grew from one of the two embryos the doctors placed inside her mommy, and she was born in May 2005. She brought a lot of happiness to her parents, but they also wanted her to have a brother or sister to play with. So, a few years later, Jasmine's parents decided to try IVF again. This time, they took one of the remaining frozen embryos and put it in Jasmine's mommy's tummy. Just like before, the embryo started growing, and soon enough, baby Simon was born in May 2013 at 37 weeks. Even though Jasmine and Simon were born eight years apart, they are still considered 'twins' because they come from the same set of embryos their parents made when using IVF.

Possible answers: A). yes B). it is not possible to tell C). no","completion":"C). no The premise, \\"The French Revolution in 1789 sent ripples of discontent through the Caribbean,\\" indicates that the events and ideas of the French Revolution were felt in the Caribbean region and created or amplified the discontent among people in the area. This suggests that the Caribbean was not a region completely free of discontent before or during the 18th century. The hypothesis \\"Discontent was unheard of in the Caribbean in the 18th century\\" implies that the Caribbean was a region free from unrest, dissatisfaction, and discontent throughout the entire 18th century. If we look at the premise, it argues that the French Revolution in 1789, which took place in the late 18th century, triggered or exacerbated discontent in the Caribbean. Therefore, the premise contradicts the hypothesis and indicates that discontent existed in the Caribbean during the 18th century, even if it became more pronounced or gained momentum due to the influence of the French Revolution in 1789. Further historical context supports this answer. In the 18th century, the Caribbean was a region deeply involved in the triangular trade, which included the brutal transatlantic slave trade. Slavery and the associated human rights abuses were prevalent in the Caribbean throughout this period, and this inherently caused discontent among the enslaved populations and created social tensions. Additionally, economic disparities and competition between European colonial powers in the Caribbean generated political and economic discontent in the region. In conclusion, the premise that \\"The French Revolution in 1789 sent ripples of discontent through the Caribbean\\" does not entail the hypothesis \\"Discontent was unheard of in the Caribbean in the 18th century.\\" Instead, the premise points to a reality that contradicts the hypothesis and highlights that there was indeed discontent in the Caribbean during the 18th century, even before the French Revolution in 1789."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What bank did Molly work for? Movie plot title: Catch That Kid Movie plot: Madeline Rose \\"Maddy\\" Phillips (Kristen Stewart) is 12-year-old girl who loves to climb. Her father Tom (Sam Robards) has climbed Mount Everest so it runs in the family. Several years earlier, Tom fell more than 100 feet during a climb and because her parents Tom and Molly (Jennifer Beals) are afraid she might hurt herself, they have ordered Maddy not to climb. Tom had some internal injuries from that earlier fall which he did not know about and now the injury has paralyzed him from the neck down. There is an experimental operation costing 250,000 which can save him, but insurance will not pay for the operation and the family does not have the money. Harderbach Financial's president Brisbane (Michael Des Barres) refuses to loan the amount and does so by putting loopholes in a contract Molly signed (he is really trying to avoid loaning any money at all). When asked if he has a heart, Brisbane coldly responds \\"This is not an emotional issue, Mrs. Phillips. A bank has no heart. Only paper in a vault\\". That is when Maddy first gets the idea to rob the bank. Maddy steals three go-carts from her father's race course (Tom has a race track where people race in go-carts) and convinces her two friends Gus (Max Thieriot) and Austin (Corbin Bleu) to help her. They remain hesitant, so she tells both of them that she loves him and does not care for the other and gives half of her friendship necklace to each of them, claiming she has the other half. They break into Harderbach Financial (a bank in which Molly had begun to work for, designing a security system). They manage to break in, but with her mother at the hospital visiting their father, she is forced to babysit her younger brother Max. She and Gus progress to a room with thousands of security deposit boxes while Austin keeps the guards away from them. Maddy has to free climb to get to the exit when her hook gets caught in a crack when using the handhelds. She cracks the code (finding it is Madeline) and they flee the room, unintentionally setting off the alarm as...

Instrumentation is provided by strings, horns, a guitar, and a piano, to create what Music Times' Carolyn Menyes described as a \\"crawling beat\\". March Robisch of Thought Catalog described the single as having \\"that ska quality that made No Doubt so successful\\". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson wrote that it is a \\"ska-flecked romp of pumped-up foghorns and plodding brass\\". A writer from Capital XTRA described it as having a \\"mellow beat\\", while Rolling Stone's Daniel Sannwald wrote it has a \\"party-vibe production\\".During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans from the low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a \\"child whisperer\\" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it \\"a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis\\". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including \\"When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home\\". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing \\"Shine!\\" and Williams screaming \\"Hey!\\". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, \\"So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation\\" and \\"that bear with the red hat\\", as obvious references to Paddington.

I can't compare this Costco to the Costcos in my home state (Maryland) because I never had my own membership and only went once or twice with my parents when I was a kid. However, I did bring myself to get the Gold Star Membership, even though I am single (for now?). I spent the first hour walking through every aisle, looking at every product, and typing the prices into my phone. After mentally comparing the prices here with the prices at other grocery stores, I concluded that Costco offers much better bargains for most items. So, I went ahead picked up everything that I needed (and did not need). After another hour of intense shopping, my cart was filled to the brim with Greek yogurt, eggs, chips, coffee beans, cereal, paper towels, toilet paper, Ziploc bags, toothpaste, almonds, and so much more. I even bought a tub of protein powder (yes, Costco sells Optimum Nutrition Chocolate Whey Protein Isolate, MusclePharm Combat Cookies N' Cream Protein Blend, and CytoSport Whey Protein!). I heard that they sell meat for good prices. I can't vouch for that statement, however, because I'm a vegetarian. I also saw that they sell clothes and books in the middle of the warehouse.

Unbeknownst to Dillon, Shannon has a crush on him. As the police turn up, Dillon and Smoothy run off and Dillon accidentally drops a stolen diamond into Cassandra's bag. The four girls then walk out and go their separate ways home. First, the story focuses on Shannon: she walks into her home just as her mother is leaving her father. She loses her temper and runs away, going to Jo's home, who has to rush to work, telling her she does not have time to talk. Jo calls Shannon over to the supermarket where she works, but tells her to leave as soon as she arrives. When she refuses, Dillon kisses Jo, upsetting Shannon, whom he asked out earlier in the day, so she grabs a Pringles tube from the shop and runs away. After getting drunk at a bar, she goes to a tunnel where she sprays graffiti on the wall, is attacked by a gang and then taken in by Kelly, who saved her. Shannon realizes that Kelly seems to be looking for the Pringles. This is later confirmed when she finds out that she is searching for \\"15 diamonds\\".

Article: In promising to fuse media as diverse as television, telephone communication, video games, music and data transmission, the era of digital convergence goes better than yesterday's celebrated \\"information superhighway.\\" Yet achieving this single technology is far from straightforward. There are currently three major television broadcast standards, and they are all incompatible with each other. But this is nothing compared to the many technologies supporting the Internet, each with a different bandwidth and physical media. The problems faced in designing platforms and communication systems that will be accepted across the world can appear insuperable. Even once global standards are assured, however, a further obstacle lies in wait. The Internet is plagued by long, erratic (,) response times because it is a pull-technology, driven by patterns of user demands. Push-technology, on the other hand, reverses the relationship: servers simply send information to passive users, as in television and radio. But if some form of combination between one-way television flow and interactive Internet is to be the basis of our future media, it is hard to see how it could be operated. Moreover, the problem of fusing Internet with television is also one of defining the services offered. Information, entertainment and relaxation appear at first to be quite different needs. Serious doubts remain over whether consumers will be interested in having to make the sort of mental effort associated with computing while also settling down in front of a sitcom . Besides the issue of consumer habits, infrastructurecosts are set to be immense, and will have to be met by national states or the private sector before being passed on to users. Platforms do not necessarily have to be expensive. The mobile phone is a good example of how something that is technologically sophisticated can almost be given away, with its cost recovered through service charges. Users are then coercedthrough clever marketing to upgrade to newer phones with more features to reinforce their dependence. Whatever the outcome, it is obvious that technology will play an increasing part in our everyday lives. Beyond technology, digital convergence embraces the services, industrial practices and social behavior that form modern society. We have in our hands the technology to construct the most sophisticated machines ever built, but if they are unusable, simply because of their operating instructions, then recent lessons have taught us they will not survive. Whatever we design must be simple, reliable and useful. Perhaps this is where artificial intelligence will come in.

She attained popular success as a country female vocalist during the 1960s and early 1970s and was twice nominated for the Best Female Country Vocal Performance Grammy award. Many of her hits were written by her husband at the time, Harlan Howard. Howard's biggest hit and signature song was the 1966 country hit \\"Evil on Your Mind\\", which peaked at number five on the Billboard country charts. Context: In 1959, under the name Jan Howard, she released the single \\"Yankee Go Home\\", which failed to hit the country charts. In 1960, the Howards went to Nashville, Tennessee, where they appeared on The Prince Albert Show, the Grand Ole Opry segment carried nationally by NBC Radio. Howard then released her first single under her new record company, Challenge. Titled \\"The One You Slip Around With\\", the song was Howard's first significant country hit, hitting the top 15, peaking at number 13 on the Billboard country music chart and earning her several Most Promising Female Vocalist awards (over, among others, another newcomer, Loretta Lynn). Occasional appearances on the Grand Ole Opry led to friendships with several country singers, including Patsy Cline. According to Cline's 1980 biography, Honky Tonk Angel, Cline originally yelled at Howard after a performance on the Opry stage. Howard fought back, and Cline was shocked by her reply. Cline then said to Howard, \\"Anybody who stands up to Cline is all right, we're gonna be good friends.\\" The two were good friends until Cline's death in 1963. Meanwhile, painfully shy Jan was suffering from the psychological scars of her youth, as well as the anxiety of beginning a new adventure. When her weight dropped below 97 pounds, Harlan hospitalized Jan and she went into therapy. Howard appeared on ABC-TV's Jubilee USA on February 6, 1960, and later that year she won Billboard magazine's Most Promising Female Country Award. In 1962, she charted successfully on the country charts at number 27 with, \\"I Wish I Was a Single Girl Again\\". However, none of Howard's follow-up singles was successful. Question: How did she handle this? Answer:","completion":"Jan Howard faced a lot of challenges during her early career, like feeling shy and having anxiety from her past experiences. When her weight dropped very low, her husband, Harlan, took her to the hospital, and she started going to therapy. Therapy is like talking to a special helper who listens and gives advice on how to feel better. Jan continued to perform and make friends in the music industry, like Patsy Cline. Even though not all her songs were successful, she kept on trying and eventually had a big hit with the song \\"Evil on Your Mind.\\" So, she handled her difficulties by getting help, making friends, and never giving up on her dreams."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about the strong reaction from Harry Redknapp, the then-manager of English football club Portsmouth FC, and the club's chairman, Milan Mandaric, against accusations or insinuations regarding the transfer policies of their club. They appear to be upset and are taking collaborative efforts to put an end to these negative statements or rumors. To provide a more comprehensive understanding, let's break down the key elements in the text: 1. Harry Redknapp: At the time of the event mentioned in the text, Harry Redknapp was the manager of Portsmouth FC and a well-known figure in English football. Known for achieving considerable success across several clubs as a manager, he would be directly responsible for making decisions concerning the recruiting and transfer of players. 2. Milan Mandaric: He was the chairman of Portsmouth FC during the time in question, meaning he oversaw the operations, strategies, and policies of the club. He would play a significant role in the financial decisions regarding the club's transfer policies. 3. Portsmouth FC: The English football club that Redknapp was managing and Mandaric was chairing. Also known as Pompey, the club had experienced various periods of success and difficulties over the years. 4. Transfer policy: In the context of football, a club's transfer policy refers to its approach and strategies related to the acquisition or sale of football players, both within and from other clubs. It includes assessing player performance, managing budgets, and negotiating contracts or fees. The text highlights that both Redknapp and Mandaric are furious over claims related to their transfer policies, which they likely view as unfounded or detrimental to the club's reputation. They are joining forces to counter such accusations and to clear the air around Portsmouth FC's transfer decisions. The specific nature of the slurs or allegations is not mentioned in the text; however, it emphasizes their determination to confront those who criticize their policies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: This film is one of the more risqué black and white films of this time in the early 1930's before the Hoyts Code was enforced. It's the story of a young beautiful woman moving to New York and making her way to the top of the business by using her body as a tool to get there. Barbara Stanwyck plays the young and beautiful Lily Powers who indeed does a fairly well job with her performance. Lily moves to New York and makes her way up the business place by sleeping with all the men. Stanwyck does an outstanding performance as being a strong woman who uses men as one time deals, hardly any emotion towards them playing them as if they were pawns. Lily Powers is a woman who doesn't have love on her mind just power and money. I thought this movie to be a little bit different then other films I have seen because there is hardly any background music heard. I believe it is only because this is when people were first introduced to live sound and dialogue between the people of the film. The few times the music is heard is during the beginning as we are shown how she makes her way up the chain. The filming and different scenes were something fantastic! The director of this film did all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this film full of realism. This film was all together an alright movie.The ending to this movie wasn't as good as it should have been, but it didn't entirely ruin it. Baby Face had its slow moving scenes throughout the movie, and perhaps a few predictable parts such as who she will sleep with next. But this is a lovable movie that can be watched more then once, and suggested to some people and friends. What is the sentiment of this review? Options are: - negative; - positive;","completion":"The sentiment of this review is positive. While the reviewer does highlight some drawbacks, such as the film's slow-moving scenes, predictable parts, and a less satisfying ending, they overall praise the film. They commend Barbara Stanwyck's performance, the film's unique approach and the director's workmanship. They even state that \\"Baby Face\\" is a \\"lovable movie that can be watched more than once,\\" suggesting that despite its flaws, the movie is enjoyable and worth recommending to others. Therefore, despite some critical points, the overarching sentiment leans toward the positive side."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Excerpts from video posted on a social media website on Tuesday show a leader of al-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula claiming responsibility for the attack on Charlie Hebdo. The original video is 11 minutes long. (Reuters) BEIRUT — Al-Qaeda’s branch in Yemen expanded Wednesday on its claim of responsibility for last week’s massacre at the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo, calling it a “blessed battle of Paris” carried out as revenge for publishing images of the prophet Muhammad. The 11-minute video, posted on the Web, coincided with the publication of the newspaper’s first edition since the attack, which left 12 people dead and began days of violence and intense police manhunts watched by the world. The cover features a cartoon of Muhammad shedding a tear and holding a sign that says “Je Suis Charlie” (I am Charlie) under the headline: “Tout Est Pardonné” (All Is Forgiven). The decision to immediately revisit a Muhammad caricature has brought complaints from some French Muslims and other groups — including an influential Islamic clerical body in Egypt — raising worries about possible backlash or violence. In the video, a leader of al-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula, Nasr al-Ansi, said it “chose the target, laid the plan, financed the operation.” He added that al-Qaeda’s overall chief, Ayman al-Zawahiri, ordered the attack. Ansi, the main ideological guide for the group, went on to praise the brothers who waged the newspaper attack, Chérif and Said Kouachi, as “heroes of Islam.” A total of 17 people died over three days of bloodshed, which ended with twin police raids on Friday that also killed the two brothers and another gunman, Amedy Coulibaly, who took hostages at a kosher supermarket. The attacks, experts said, may reflect shifting tactics by terrorist groups toward commando-style assaults on less-protected targets as security and surveillance blankets other sites such as airlines and hotels. Al-Qaeda’s Yemen branch had earlier put Charlie Hebdo on an enemies’ list. The latest statement follows a previous claim of responsibility by the Yemen-based group last week, but appears to be have been timed with the new Charlie Hebdo edition — a huge press run that was selling fast. The emotive religious language and militaristic bravado in the new release also could highlight growing competition with the Islamic State, whose stature among radical Islamists has risen rapidly with its gains in Iraq and Syria and declaration of a self-ruled “caliphate.” In a video made public after his death, the supermarket hostage-taker Coulibaly claimed allegiance to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, even though police also linked him directly to the Kouachi brothers, who were French citizens of Algerian descent. Coulibaly, who was of Senegalese ancestry, also was born in France. Ansi commends Coulibaly, although there is no direct claim of responsibility for that incident. Intelligence officials say at least one of the Paris gunmen received training from an Al-Qaeda offshoot in Yemen. The Post's Greg Miller explains who they are, how they're connected to the Islamic State, and what happens next in Europe and the U.S. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) “ISIS has taken the spotlight away from al-Qaeda, and so al-Qaeda has performed this act in Paris — and it will perform more such attacks unfortunately — in order to regain the prominence that it has lost,” said Ahmad Moussalli, an expert on Islamist movements who teaches at the American University of Beirut. France’s parliament on Tuesday renewed the country’s participation airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq. French President Francois Hollande, speaking aboard the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle on Wednesday, said the ship could take in the international coalition against the Islamic State after a planned deployment in the Indian Ocean. The al-Qaeda video — entitled “Vengeance for the Prophet: A Message Regarding the Blessed Battle of Paris” — included powerful imagery showing the Eiffel Tower dissolving into wisps of smoke, the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden firing an AK-47 rifle and footage of planes slamming into the World Trade Center towers during the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “As for the blessed Battle of Paris: We in [AQAP] claim responsibility for this operation as vengeance for the messenger of Allah,” said Ansi, wearing a traditional Yemeni headdress. Yemeni officials say that one of the Kouachi brothers visited Yemen and met with al-Qaeda figures who could have included Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born terror suspect who was killed in Yemen during a U.S. drone strike in 2011. Awlaki is shown in the latest video. The video is likely to sharpen the direction of the investigation, which has been exploring suspected funding and training links between the attackers and al-Qaeda’s Yemen-based affiliate, often called AQAP, which is considered one of the most active branches of the terror group. At least 54 people have been detained since the attacks as part of the terrorism investigation, France’s Justice Ministry said. “We tell you once again: Stop your insults on our prophet and sanctities. Stop spilling our blood. Leave our lands. Quit plundering our resources,” said Ansi in the video. “Otherwise,” he warned, the world should “except tragedies and terror.” Al-Qaeda’s Yemen branch, formed in 2009, has gained strength in recent months as it has taken more territory amid unraveling security in the country. Last month, U.S. Special Operations forces raided an AQAP hideout in an attempt to free two hostages, American photojournalist Luke Somers and South African teacher Pierre Korkie. Both were killed in the operation. AQAP has been linked to several attempted attacks in recent years, including the failed bombing of a Detroit-bound Northwest Airlines flight in 2009 by an assailant with explosives sewn into his underwear. In 2010, it attempted to ship bombs hidden in printing cartridges to two Jewish institutions in Chicago. The devices were uncovered in Britain and the United Arab Emirates. But according to terrorism researcher Moussalli, AQAP remains the most extensive al-Qaeda branch in operation. “They have sleeper cells all over the world,” he said, “and I wouldn’t be surprised if they attack in other cities, not just Paris.” Hugh Naylor is a Beirut-based correspondent for The Post. He has reported from over a dozen countries in the Middle East for such publications as The National, an Abu Dhabi-based newspaper, and The New York Times. Brian Murphy joined the Post after more than 20 years as a foreign correspondent and bureau chief for the Associated Press in Europe and the Middle East.

Determine the sentiment: A very slick modern (keeping it sensually hip) revamp on the Dracula story (although staying with the traditional customs) with quite an interesting, if not fully grasped back story of the prince of darkness. The first time I tried watching it I could only make it halfway through, before losing interest. Again it gets off to a good start (especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with Dracula), but then for me it got less involving when it hits New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. A great place to set it, but never took advantage of its settings (despite etching a paradise in damn, where Dracula could flourish). Produced by Wes Carven (and yeah they throw that name out there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals, but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts don't help. The messy script does get considerably silly. Lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy, inserting a lot of blood (the make-up is suitably achieved) and a lot of \\"Virgin\\" advertising. No I don't mean virgins, it's the music company, as it does get in numerous shots and Helsing's daughter works there too. Oh that wasn't obvious planting. The soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes. Now the performances are all over the shop, but there are few familiar faces to spot (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula just didn't come off, as not much of a presence was formed. He was simply out-shined by the succulent ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's brides. The likes of Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are respectably okay. Christopher Plummer gives out a grizzled turn as Van Helsing and Omar Epps has fun with his role.","completion":"The sentiment expressed in this review can be characterized as mixed to negative. The reviewer appreciates the modern and sensual take on the Dracula story and finds some aspects, such as the initial storyline and artistic visuals, interesting. However, they seem to be more critical about several aspects of the film. They lose interest and find it less involving when the story shifts to New Orleans, and they believe that the film does not fully exploit its setting. The reviewer points out that Wes Carven's production adds some quality, but the film's writing and direction by Patrick Lussier are not praised. In fact, the script is described as messy and silly, and the reviewer doesn't seem to appreciate the editing and cheap jolts. They have mixed opinions about the soundtrack, calling it amusing but not necessarily fitting or impressive. Regarding the performances, the reviewer's feelings are mixed and lean towards negative. They note a lack of presence from Gerard Butler as Dracula, but appreciate the performances of the actresses playing Dracula's brides. Some other cast members are described as okay and respectably okay. Christopher Plummer's grizzled turn as Van Helsing is positively mentioned, as is Omar Epps's enjoyment of his role. In conclusion, the overall sentiment of the review tilts towards negative due to criticisms about the script, editing, and some performances. However, the reviewer does express appreciation for certain aspects, such as the modern take on the story, the initial plotline, and some of the acting."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Associated Press) This image provided by the Multnomah County Jail shows Katt Williams who was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a driver. Williams is in jail Sunday, Oct, 7, 2018. He had come to Portland to perform in Nick Cannon’s “Wild ‘N Out” comedy improv show Friday night. (Multnomah County Jail via AP) (Associated Press) SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Comedian Katt Williams has been arrested on suspicion of assaulting a hired driver during an argument about taking him and his dog from the Portland, Oregon, airport to a performance in the city. Williams, who was in jail Sunday, came to Portland to perform in Nick Cannon's \\"Wild 'N Out\\" comedy improv show Friday night. The town car driver had swelling and cuts on his face and was treated at a hospital, according to Port of Portland police. The comedian, 47, whose real name is Micah Williams, left in another vehicle and was arrested Saturday. Williams has been charged with assault in the fourth degree, and an arraignment is scheduled for Monday. He also was arrested for an out-of-state warrant from Georgia. A publicist for Williams, whose comedy specials have appeared on HBO and Netflix, didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. A jail official and a spokesman for the district attorney's office said they didn't know if the comedian had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. The incident happened at Atlantic Aviation, which handles private planes at Portland International Airport, police said. An employee who answered the phone Sunday said her boss had told workers not to discuss the case. Williams won the Emmy Award last month for guest actor in a comedy series for his appearance in \\"Atlanta,\\" a TV show about two cousins in Atlanta's rap scene. His arrest comes more than a year after Williams was sentenced to three years of probation in Los Angeles after pleading no contest to stealing a celebrity photographer's camera. Prosecutors said in April 2017 that he also needed to attend anger management classes. In 2016, Williams got five years of probation after pleading no contest in Georgia to assault and battery tied to allegations he threatened a bodyguard while an acquaintance beat him with a baseball bat. ||||| Tiffany Haddish arrives at the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards on Monday, Sept. 17, 2018, at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.

The character was played by the show's star Donald Glover, but it's unclear whether the actor-singer dressed up as Perkins who became a main attraction in the crowd and social media taking selfies during commercial breaks. Perkins congratulated Bill Hader, who won an Emmy for best actor in a television comedy over Glover — last year's winner. Even Hader had no idea who was dressed up as Perkins. \\"I don't know who it was, but I know it was that guy from 'Atlanta,'\\" Hader said backstage. When Glover was shown in the crowd, Perkins was not around. Perkins became one of the most intriguing figures during the second season of \\"Atlanta\\" for his eerie appearance during the sixth episode of the series.

The comedians sang: \\"There were none, now there's one, so we're done.\\" They were joined by Tituss Burgess, Kristen Bell, Sterling K. Brown and Ricky Martin, who declared the song \\"too white\\" and gave it a Latin turn. Andy Samberg showed up to ask in song if there was a place for a straight white male in the song before being sent off. Martin and Samberg were met with loud cheers inside Microsoft Theater. The group gave way to the night's hosts Michael Che and Colin Jost, who continued to riff on Hollywood diversity and the sexual misconduct scandal that has roiled the industry. ___ 4:45 p.m. John Oliver says Hollywood's biggest award shows are \\"terrible gigs\\" for the hosts, not fun or glamorous.

Ventimiglia also waved over his co-star Justin Hartley and wife Chrishell Stause to say hello. Elsewhere, another \\"This Is Us\\" co-star, Sterling K. Brown, says he loves the regular-guy role he plays on the NBC hit series. Brown, nominated for lead actor in a drama, an award he won last year, says it's nice going to work every day playing a character who \\"didn't kill people, he's not secrets and lies.

Martindale says, \\"I think it's fine to be political, don't get me wrong. But middle America is hard to reach.\\" — Mike Cidoni Lennox (@CidoniLennox on Twitter) with Lindsey Bahr (@ldbahr) ___ 2 p.m. The sprawling golden carpet for the 70th annual Emmy Awards is heating up as security readies for the deluge of television stars headed for the Microsoft Theater Monday afternoon. NBC's Natalie Morales and Hoda Kotb were among the very early arrivals, making their way down the carpet before the inevitable traffic jam of bodies. Extra host Mario Lopez, who has a foot injury, zipped down the carpet on a tiny scooter keeping his left leg off the ground. Although the temperatures in downtown Los Angeles are in the 80s, arriving attendees will not have to bear the brunt of the heat.

Benjamin, visibly uncomfortable as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans, evades those who try to congratulate him. Mrs. Robinson, the neglected wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Benjamin is coerced inside to have a drink and Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. She invites him up to her daughter Elaine's room to see her portrait and then enters the room naked, making it clear that she is available to him. Benjamin initially rebuffs her, but a few days later after his scuba demonstration on his birthday, he clumsily organizes a tryst at the Taft hotel. Benjamin spends the remainder of the summer drifting around in the pool by day, purposefully neglecting to select a graduate school, and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Dr. Larry Roberts (Albert Finney), a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, is puzzled when four beautiful models working in television commercials request cosmetic surgery to make changes so minor as to be imperceptible to the naked eye. When these models later start dying under mysterious circumstances, he discovers they are all linked to the same advertisement research firm. The Digital Matrix research firm rates advertising models using a scoring system to measure the combined visual impact of various physical attributes in television commercials. In an experiment to increase their scores, some models are sent to Dr. Roberts to get cosmetic surgery to maximize their visual impacts. Though the models are physically perfect after the surgeries, they still are not as effective as desired, so the research firm decides to use a different approach. Each model is offered a contract to have her body scanned digitally to create 3D computer-generated models, then the 3D models are animated for use in commercials. The contract deals seem to be incredibly lucrative for the models: once their bodies are represented digitally, they get a paycheck for life, never having to work again, since their digital models are used for all their future work in commercials. However, when these same models start dying under mysterious circumstances, Roberts becomes suspicious and decides to investigate Digital Matrix. He has a strong interest in investigating the deaths: he is considered a prime suspect by the police (from evidence planted at the scene of one of the murders) and his most recent patient (with whom he is involved in a relationship), Cindy (Susan Dey), is the last of the models to be digitally scanned. During his investigation, Roberts discovers some advanced-technology devices the Digital Matrix corporation is using to hypnotize consumers into buying the products they advertise.

Michael, on the other hand, just began adulthood and is still quite young. Both of them want to ask the doctor about their risks for future health problems. Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.

He was the President of a big and important country called the United States. The president is like a boss who helps make important decisions for the people in his country. Obama is married to a very nice lady named Michelle. Together, they have two daughters named Malia and Sasha. While Barack was the president, their family lived in a big, white house called the White House. This special house is where all presidents live while they are in charge. After spending eight years as the president, Barack and Michelle had to move out of the White House. It was time for a new person to be the boss of the country. But guess what? They decided they didn't want to buy a new house just yet. Instead, they wanted to be renters! Renting means living in a place that belongs to someone else, and you pay them money to stay there. It's like when you borrow toys from a friend, but you give them a little gift in return as a \\"thank you.\\" There are many reasons why people might choose to rent instead of buying a house. Sometimes it's because they don't have enough money saved up, or they're not sure where they want to live forever and ever. For Barack and Michelle, they wanted to stay close to their daughter Sasha's school so she could finish before they find their dream home. After leaving the White House, Barack and Michelle found a beautiful house nearby to rent. They were excited to move in and start a new chapter in their lives. Their family would have new neighbors and new rooms to decorate. And while they loved living in the White House, they also looked forward to being \\"regular\\" people again. They wanted to take walks around their new neighborhood, enjoy their freedom, and have fun with their family. So, Barack and Michelle became renters, and they found that it was a good choice for them at that time.

You have to burn more calories than you take in. It's a simple equation. Sometimes people make weight loss too difficult. It takes a deficit of 3,500 calories to lose a pound. So, if you burn 500 extra calories a day, you're on track to lose 1 pound per week. That might not sound like a lot, but over a year, it is. Your basal metabolism will burn some calories (that means what you burn just from living and moving). You can calculate your basal metabolism using online calculators. You can find calorie calculators online that will provide a detailed estimate. Don't lose weight by guessing. Indoor rowing, burpees, and jumping rope are all big calorie burners. Experts say that cardio exercises burn more calories than strength training does. Rowing, running, walking, or riding a bicycle are all cardio activities. Switch up the intensity of the workout. Cardio is a great weight loss technique because it requires the body to use fat as its first fuel burning source. You should aim to do 60 minutes of exercise a day about five or six days out of the week. However, don't think you can exercise without monitoring your diet and lose weight fast. Both play a key role. Take enough steps. Buy a Fitbit to track your steps, and try to get in 10,000 steps a day.Take the stairs when you could take the elevator. Walk to work, instead of driving. Spend some time in the garden. Little things will add up. Strive for consistency. It's key. You can't exercise once in a blue moon and think that will matter. Build exercise into your daily life. Drink coffee before you exercise. A cup of coffee before your workout will give you a boost of energy that will make you work harder, and burn more. But skip the sweeteners and cream. Kettlebells are bowling-ball size weights that are made out of cast iron. They're used for strength training. They're great for your core, and they provide a full body workout. Swinging a kettlebell can burn 400 calories in 20 minutes. Kettlebells range from 2 to 100 pounds. Start with one that works for you. The overarm swing is one good way to use a kettlebell. Battling ropes can burn a lot of calories, and it's a common fitness technique found at gyms. You can burn as many as 10.3 calories per minute with rope battles. You hold a thick rope in each hand and perform different motions with it. Switch up the exercises in quick intervals. You'll lose weight faster that way than standing in the same place on a treadmill. Circuit training sessions often contain exercises like mountain climbers, squats, bicycle crunches, and lunges. Because you are constantly switching exercises, circuit training is less boring for many people. You will burn 30 percent more calories with a circuit training workout than other types of workouts.","completion":"The key to weight loss is burning more calories than you consume, with a deficit of 3,500 calories leading to a loss of 1 pound. To achieve this, aim for 60 minutes of exercise around five to six days a week, focusing on cardio activities like indoor rowing, jumping rope, or running. Use online calculators to determine your basal metabolism and the calories you burn during exercise. Incorporate strength training with kettlebells and circuit training, which involves exercises like mountain climbers and squats. Consistency in physical activity is crucial, so strive to include exercise in your daily life. Monitor both your diet and exercise to achieve weight loss. Consider using a Fitbit to track your steps and aim for 10,000 steps a day.

Given the below context: The paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun in the winter of 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas \\"in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.\\" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that \\"perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer.\\" This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces,...

Louis van Gaal admired Blind after his World Cup displays for Holland. Overmars says United haven't contacted the club about signature.","completion":"Title: Marc Overmars Affirms Daley Blind Won't Leave Ajax Cheaply Amid Manchester United Interest Introduction: Ajax Director of football, Marc Overmars, has recently made it clear that Dutch international utility player, Daley Blind, will not be sold on the cheap, amidst speculation linking him with a move to Premier League giants Manchester United. During the summer transfer period, these rumors have gained traction, fueled significantly by Blind's stand-out performances for the Netherlands national squad under former Dutch manager and current United boss, Louis van Gaal. Body: 1) Daley Blind's Impressive World Cup Performances: The versatile, 30-year-old Ajax star made headlines during the 2014 FIFA World Cup, primarily for his stellar displays in a variety of positions under then-manager, Louis van Gaal. Playing as a left-back, central midfielder, and occasionally as a center back, Blind demonstrated his adaptability, proving indispensable for the Dutch squad. The Netherlands finished third in the tournament, with Blind's resourcefulness playing a significant role in their success. 2) Louis van Gaal's Admiration for the Player: Given the player-coach relationship established during the World Cup, it comes as no surprise that Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is eager to secure Blind's signature, bolstering his squad with the player's wealth of experience and tactical know-how. As the Red Devils continue to search for reinforcements during the summer transfer market, Blind appears to be high on van Gaal's wish list. 3) Marc Overmars' Stance on Blind's Potential Departure: Despite the growing interest from Manchester United, Ajax's Director of football, Marc Overmars, remains firm in his insistence that Blind will not leave the club at a discounted rate. Speaking to the media about the speculation surrounding the player's future, Overmars stated, \\"We believe that Daley is an important player for Ajax, and we're not willing to let him go cheaply. Right now, there has been no official contact from Manchester United regarding his signature.\\" 4) Impact on the Transfer Saga: With Overmars taking a stand against a cut-price sale, it remains to be seen whether Manchester United will pursue Blind by meeting Ajax's asking price, or if they'll turn their attention to alternative targets in the market. Regardless, the Dutch international's future continues to be the subject of intense speculation, and only time will tell if a reunion with Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford awaits. Conclusion: The statement from Ajax's Marc Overmars has added another layer of intrigue to Daley Blind's potential move to Manchester United. Despite the player's existing connection with United manager Louis van Gaal, it seems the club must be willing to invest significantly if they hope to secure the services of the Dutch utility man. As the summer transfer window unfolds, fans eagerly await any developments in this ongoing saga."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Irena and Paul are descended from a line of 'cat people,' people who turn into panthers after mating and who must then kill in order to take human form again.Irena knows nothing about this side of her ancestry. She is still a virgin, so she has no idea what sex will do to her.

Q: It is understood the Pontfadog Oak, which has been growing near Chirk in Wrexham since the year 802, was felled by gusts of around 60mph overnight on Wednesday. The famous sessile oak tree had a girth of 42ft 5in (12.9m). Legend has it that Welsh princes used to rally troops at the tree. The oak - which had a huge hollow trunk said to big enough to seat six people at a table - had become a local attraction for walkers and visitors in recent years. Rob McBride, a so-called \\"tree hunter\\" who measures and logs trees, said it was rare for an oak to live to such an age, with most usually lasting around 900 years. \\"The tree was one of the biggest and oldest oak trees on the planet,\\" said Mr McBride, who lives close to the Pontfadog Oak. \\"It has a very significant history and until about 200 years ago was a tree that was pollarded - with branches and leaves regularly cut to feed animals and build fencing.\\" He added that villagers had gathered after hearing about the tree, adding: \\"It's quite like a wake\\". Mr McBride said he had been campaigning for ancient trees like the Pontfadog Oak to be given a protected status like castles. \\"If it had had a few thousand pounds spent on some supporting work, it may well have stayed upright,\\" he said. 'Almighty crash' The tree is believed to have been a rallying point for Welsh princes, including Owain Gwynedd who is said to have met his troops under the oak in the 12th Century before defeating King Henry II of England in battle. Dianne Coakley-Williams, whose husband Huw's family owned the oak and its land for generations, said she was woken by an \\"almighty crash and a bang\\" as it fell near their house at about 02:20 BST on Thursday. \\"The wind here was absolutely dreadful - I've never known anything like it before ever,\\" she said. \\"I suppose it's lucky that nobody was hurt. But it's just so sad. My mother-in-law is devastated. She said it's like losing an old friend.\\" Angharad Evans of the Woodland Trust said the tree had had a lot to cope with over the past few weeks, with heavy snow, a prolonged cold snap and finally high winds. \\"The Woodland Trust believes that this sad case illustrates how we are failing to provide adequate protection for our ancient trees at present,\\" she added. Local assembly member Ken Skates said Wrexham had lost one of its \\"most important and iconic pieces of local heritage\\". But Mr McBride said some people were also talking about the possibility of re-erecting the tree. \\"It's early days. They would have to take the top off and then re-erecting it, which can be done.

Sylvia Jane Hutton (nee Kirby, born December 9, 1956), known simply by her first name Sylvia during the 1980s, is an American country music and country pop singer and songwriter. Some original source books have her birth name as Sylvia Kirby Allen; however, Allen was her first husband's last name. She consequently used only her first name. There was also a point in time that she used Sylvia Rutledge. In 1982, from her Just Sylvia studio album, the singer released the single \\"Nobody\\", which reached No. 1 on the country music charts, hit No. 15 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, and sold more than a million copies. The song was also an Adult Contemporary hit, making the Top 5. \\"Nobody\\" became Sylvia's signature song and made her a success on both the Country and Pop music charts, which was what many of her contemporaries, such as Barbara Mandrell, Juice Newton, Dolly Parton, Anne Murray, Ronnie Milsap and Kenny Rogers were doing at the time. \\"Nobody\\" and the album Just Sylvia were certified gold in the United States and Canada. \\"Nobody\\" was the 1982 BMI Song of the Year, awarded for receiving more radio airplay than any other single that year. Sylvia's bouncy and sly style made her popular among teenagers, making her a teen idol briefly, which foreshadowed the female pop teen idols of the late 1980s, such as Debbie Gibson and Tiffany. In 1982, Sylvia was the Academy of Country Music's \\"Female Vocalist of the Year\\" and a Grammy nominee for \\"Best Female Vocalist\\". In 1983 Sylvia's album Snapshot was released; its title song climbed to No. 5 on the Country charts and became her second-highest selling single release. She had two other songs in the Top 20 that year, \\"I Never Quite Got Back\\" and \\"The Boy Gets Around\\" (which she described in the notes of her 1998 anthology album as being \\"pretty forgettable\\"). In 1985, the momentum continued with the hits \\"Fallin' in Love\\" and \\"Cry Just a Little Bit.\\"). By 1986 though, Sylvia's chart success was fading as more traditionally styled country singers, such as Randy Travis, dominated the charts. Sylvia continued to record for RCA until the end of 1987, charting 11 Top Ten and No. 1 songs, and sold more than four million records.

News article: The Sound of Music Thomas Lauderdale is an unabashed fan of “The Sound of Music,” so the Pink Martini bandleader didn’t hesitate when he got the opportunity to work with descendants of Capt. Georg and Maria von Trapp. Their collaboration grew into the coming album “Dream a Little Dream,” and Speakeasy premieres the title track today. Lauderdale met Sofia, Melanie, Amanda and August von Trapp—Capt. von Trapp’s great grandchildren—two years ago at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Ore., where Pink Martini is based, Lauderdale told Speakeasy. The quartet was in town to perform with the local symphony. “Their repertoire at the time was very ‘Sound of Music’-heavy and basic, and they’re so talented, I felt they could be doing a broader repertoire,” Lauderdale said. What started as Lauderdale suggesting pieces for the von Trapps to perform grew into helping them produce the project they were working on, then evolved into a full-on collaboration between the siblings and Pink Martini, with contributions from Wayne Newton, Irish band the Chieftains and Charmian Carr, who played Liesl in the 1965 film version of “The Sound of Music.” “The idea for this album was to sort of set them free, to be compatible with who they have been, with their past, but hopefully to create a pathway for them to pursue any option they wanted to pursue after,” Lauderdale said. “Dream a Little Dream” features several original tunes, and also includes two songs from the movie, “The Lonely Goatherd” and “Edelweiss,” along with a cover of Abba’s “Fernando” and the title track, which was written in the 1930s. “It has this timeless feel to it, and I’ve always loved the song,” Lauderdale said. “Amanda responded immediately to that song when we were in the studio, and she sang it so wonderfully and beautifully.” “Dream a Little Dream” is due March 4 on Heinz Records, and the von Trapps will appear in concert with Pink Martini for a month starting Feb. 27. “In a sense, spending any time with them, it’s almost like walking onto the set of ‘The Sound of Music,’ but they’re not actors,” Lauderdale said.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas (CNN) -- Three Americans rescued last week from captivity in the Colombian jungle will return to their homes Saturday, the U.S. Army South said. Left to right, Keith Stansell, Marc Gonsalves and Thomas Howes talk about spending more than 5 years as hostages. Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes and Keith Stansell have been undergoing a reintegration process at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, since their return 10 days ago to the United States. The men were among 15 hostages, including former Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, who were rescued July 2 in a Colombian military operation.","completion":"Most logical completion of the news story: The Colombian military operation, dubbed \\"Operation Jaque,\\" was hailed as a major success, with no shots fired and all hostages rescued unharmed. The three rescued American contractors had been working on counter-narcotics surveillance missions when their plane crashed in the Colombian jungle in 2003, and they were subsequently taken hostage by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). During their captivity, the hostages were subjected to harsh conditions, including forced marches, minimal food, and exposure to the elements. The emotional reunion with their families in San Antonio marked the end of a long and painful ordeal. The U.S. Army South spokesman, Major General John Thompson, praised the Colombian military's efforts in the rescue operation and emphasized the strong ties between the U.S. and Colombia in combating drug trafficking and terrorism. He also expressed gratitude for the public's support and concern for the hostages' well-being throughout their captivity. As part of their reintegration process, Gonsalves, Howes, and Stansell received medical and psychological care, as well as assistance in readjusting to their life outside of captivity. While they will need time to heal and reintegrate with their families and society, their resilience and hope have been an inspiration to many. The Colombian government continues its efforts to secure the release of hundreds of other hostages still held captive by the FARC, in hopes of bringing an end to decades of conflict and promoting peace and security in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Impoverished by the Civil War, the state continued with an economy based on tobacco, cotton and agriculture. Towns and cities remained few in the east. A major industrial base emerged in the late 19th century in the western counties of the Piedmont, based on cotton mills established at the fall line. Railroads were built to connect the new industrializing cities. The state was the site of the first successful controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight, by the Wright brothers, near Kitty Hawk on December 17, 1903. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left the state to go North for better opportunities, in the Great Migration. Their departure changed the demographic characteristics of many areas. What political party Dominated NC after the confederacy? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"After the Confederacy, North Carolina was dominated by the Democratic Party. The state had become a one-party state, as was common across the former Confederate states. This dominance was largely due to political, social, and economic factors that came into play after the Civil War. The Democratic Party's control in North Carolina, as well as other Southern states, resulted from the end of Reconstruction and the ushering in of an era known as the \\"Solid South,\\" where the Democratic Party held near-unbroken control over the region. This control was facilitated by restrictions on voting that disproportionately impacted African Americans, such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and other measures that effectively disenfranchised a large portion of the African American population. Economic factors also contributed to the Democratic Party's power in North Carolina. Impoverished by the Civil War, the state continued operating under an economy heavily based on tobacco, cotton, and agriculture. It wasn't until the late 19th century that a major industrial base began to emerge in the western counties of the Piedmont, centering on cotton mills built at the fall line. This industrialization was largely fueled by railway infrastructure that connected newly industrializing cities. Yet despite these economic shifts, political power remained firmly in the hands of the Democratic Party. Furthermore, the state underwent significant demographic changes during the first half of the 20th century. As a part of the Great Migration, many African Americans left North Carolina for better opportunities in the North. This withdrew a significant portion of potential opposition to the Democratic Party's power, further consolidating its control in North Carolina. However, it's important to note that political dominances are never absolute and political loyalties can shift over time. While the Democratic Party dominated North Carolina's political scene in the aftermath of the Confederacy, the state's political landscape has evolved over time to become more diverse and competitive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

His girlfriend Adrian supports his choice, and so do his doctors, who reveal he will require surgery for a detached retina, which could lead to permanent blindness. In a private moment, Rocky goes to see a recuperating Apollo, and wants a truthful response if Apollo gave his all in the fight, to which Creed agrees. After Rocky is released from the hospital, he enjoys the benefits of his life's changes: Rocky's new fame attracts an agent who sees Rocky as a potential endorsement and sponsorship goldmine, and his sudden wealth encourages him to propose to Adrian. She happily accepts, and they marry in a small ceremony. Soon after, Rocky and Adrian happily learn that Adrian is pregnant. Meanwhile, fueled by hate mail, Apollo becomes obsessed with the idea that a rematch is the only way to prove that Rocky's performance was simply a fluke. Determined to rectify his boxing career's only blemish, Apollo ignores all pleas by his friends and family to forget the fight and move on to other potential opponents, and instead demands his team do whatever necessary to goad Rocky out of his hiatus and have a rematch with him. Rocky at first seems unaffected by Apollo's smear campaign, but his inexperience with money causes him to run into financial problems. After largely unsuccessful attempts to find employment, Rocky visits Mickey Goldmill, his trainer and manager, at his gym to talk about the possibility of returning to boxing. At first, Mickey declines, concerned about Rocky's health, but he soon accepts after Apollo publicly insults Rocky. Adrian confronts Rocky about the danger of returning to boxing and reminds him of the risk to his eyesight. Rocky argues he knows nothing else, so this is the only way he can provide. Adrian, furious at Rocky for breaking his promise, refuses... Answer:","completion":"Rocky Balboa is challenging Apollo Creed in the movie plot of Rocky II."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: What is the brightest star in the constellation Cygnus?","completion":"The brightest star in the constellation Cygnus is Deneb, also known by its formal name, Alpha Cygni. Deneb is an extremely luminous supergiant star, placed at a distance of nearly 3,550 light-years away from Earth. It is one of the most distant stars visible to the naked eye, and its exact distance is challenging for astronomers to determine due to its location in a region dense with gas and dust. Deneb serves as one of the three stars that create the prominent asterism called the Summer Triangle, along with Vega in the constellation Lyra and Altair in the constellation Aquila. In terms of brightness, it is ranked as the 19th brightest star in the entire night sky. The name \\"Deneb\\" originates from the Arabic word \\"dhaneb,\\" meaning \\"tail,\\" as it represents the tail of Cygnus the Swan. The constellation Cygnus represents a celestial swan gliding through the sky and is sometimes also associated with the mythological figure of Orpheus from Greek mythology. Deneb is a blue-white supergiant, with a spectral class of A2 Ia. It's a massive star, with an estimated mass of around 19 solar masses (meaning it is 19 times larger than our Sun). Its radius is extensive, measuring about 203 times the size of our Sun. If it were to replace our Sun, its photosphere would extend beyond the orbit of Earth, engulfing our planet in the process. The true luminosity of Deneb is estimated to be about 200,000 times that of our Sun. Its impressive luminosity and size result from its core burning helium, which indicates that the star is in an advanced phase of its life. After millions of years of nuclear reactions, Deneb will exhaust its fuel supply and go through various phases, finally collapsing upon itself to form either a neutron star or a black hole. In summary, the brightest star in the constellation Cygnus is Deneb, a blue-white supergiant star that is part of the Summer Triangle. It is one of the most luminous and distant stars visible to the naked eye, with a distance of approximately 3,550 light-years from Earth. Its immense size and brightness make Deneb a fascinating celestial object for astronomers and sky gazers alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write a summary based on this article: BEIRUT Two suicide car bombers killed 55 people and wounded 372 in Damascus on Thursday, state media said, the deadliest attacks in the Syrian capital since an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began 14 months ago. The blasts further shredded a ceasefire that was declared by international mediator Kofi Annan on April 12 but that has failed to halt bloodshed pitting Assad's security forces against peaceful demonstrators and an array of armed insurgents. Opposition leaders said Annan's peace plan was dead, while Western powers insisted it remained the best way forward. Annan condemned the \\"abhorrent\\" bombings and urged all parties to halt violence and protect civilians. \\"The Syrian people have already suffered too much,\\" he said in a statement. The White House and the United Nations also condemned the attacks, for which there was no claim of responsibility. Syria's foreign ministry said the attacks were a sign that the major Arab state was facing foreign-backed terrorism and urged the U.N. Security Council to combat countries or groups supporting such violence. \\"Syria stresses the importance of the UNSC taking measures against countries, groups and news agencies that are practicing and encouraging terrorism,\\" the state news agency SANA quoted the ministry as saying in a letter to the U.N. body. The near-simultaneous explosions hit the al-Qazaz district just before 8 a.m. (9.00 a.m. EDT), residents said. One punched a crater three metres (10 feet) deep in the city's southern ring road. Bloodied corpses and body parts could be seen on the road. State television also showed at least one overturned truck. Walls of buildings on each side of the avenue had collapsed. One resident reported limited damage to the facade of the nearby Palestine Branch Military Intelligence centre, one of the most feared of more than 20 Syrian secret police agencies. The huge walled complex was targeted by a 2008 bombing that killed 17 people and which authorities blamed on Islamist militants. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll from the bombings at 59 and said most of them worked for the security forces. No group has claimed responsibility. The Interior Ministry vowed to \\"chase down the criminal killers and those who help or house them in their dens\\". It also appealed to citizens to pass on any information that might help. MOUNTING DEATH TOLL Rami Abdulrahman, head of the British-based Observatory, said 849 people - 628 civilians and 221 soldiers, of whom 31 were defectors - had been killed since the April 12 truce accord. The toll did not include Thursday's deaths. The attacks occurred a day after a bomb exploded near U.N. observers monitoring the ceasefire, which state forces and rebels have both violated, and two weeks after authorities said a suicide bomber killed at least nine people in Damascus. \\"This (Thursday's attacks) is yet another example of the suffering brought upon the people of Syria from acts of violence,\\" said Major-General Robert Mood, leader of the U.N. monitors, who visited the scene. Opposition to Assad, which began with peaceful protests in March 2011 inspired by popular revolts against other Arab autocratic leaders, has grown increasingly militarised. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday there was only a narrow window of opportunity to avert full-scale civil war. Syrian television showed a man pointing to the wreckage. \\"Is this freedom? This is the work of the Saudis,\\" he said. Saudi Arabia has advocated arming rebels seeking to oust Assad. Nadine Haddad, a candidate in Monday's parliamentary election which was boycotted by most opposition figures, blamed Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, who also says Syrian insurgents should get weapons. \\"I am addressing Sheikh Hamad and I tell him shame on you. You are now destroying the Syrian people, not the Syrian regime. You are killing children going to school,\\" she said. Qatar condemned the blasts in Damascus and called on all sides to stop the bloodshed in Syria. The White House said it did not believe the attacks were representative of the opposition to Assad, contrary to what the Syrian authorities and state media have suggested. \\"There are clearly extremist elements in Syria, as we have said all along, who are trying to take advantage of the chaos in that country, chaos brought about by Assad's brutal assault on his own people,\\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. Samir Nashar, a member of the opposition Syrian National Council's executive board, blamed the state for the bombings, saying they were meant to deter protesters and U.N. monitoring, an argument echoed by rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA) leaders. \\"These bombs are not the work of opposition fighters,\\" said its chief, General Mustafa al-Sheikh, adding that the FSA lacked the capability to set off such big explosions. An increasing series of big bombings in Syria has generated various theories, including that some may be self-inflicted wounds by security agents out to discredit the rebels, or that they may show the rise of al Qaeda-linked Syrian Islamists with skills honed by years of activity across the border in Iraq. The U.N. Security Council condemned the \\"terrorist attacks\\" and urged all parties to comply with the U.N.-backed peace plan. The European Union also denounced the bombings as \\"pure terrorism\\", but said Annan's peace plan, backed by the EU, the United Nations and the Arab League, was still viable. \\"It is the best option to try and ensure peace in Syria,\\" Michael Mann, spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, said in Brussels. \\"It is the best way forward.\\" Annan's blueprint calls for a ceasefire, political dialogue between the government and opposition, and unfettered access for humanitarian aid and journalists to Syria. Western powers have shunned any Libya-style military intervention in Syria, while Russia and China have blocked any U.N. Security Council action against Damascus, although both have supported the U.N.-Arab League envoy's peace effort. Russia condemned the bombings, accusing unspecified foreign countries of encouraging such violence and saying Moscow would not yield to pressure to change its stance on Syria. \\"Some of our foreign partners are doing practical things so that the situation in Syria explodes in literal and figurative sense,\\" state-run RIA quoted Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying in Beijing, without naming any countries. Russia has been a strategic ally and major arms supplier to Syria during its four decades under Assad family rule. Moscow opposes Western calls for U.N. sanctions against Damascus and any foreign interference in Syria, saying there should be an end to violence by all sides and then dialogue without preconditions, such as Assad leaving power. France, among Assad's sternest critics, said Annan's plan was the \\"last chance\\" to end the crisis. \\"The regime carries full responsibility for the horrors in Syria,\\" the Foreign Ministry said. \\"By choosing a blind and brutal repression, the regime has entered a spiral of violence with no way out.\\" The U.S. Embassy in Beirut called the double bombing \\"reprehensible and unacceptable\\" but reiterated Washington's demand that the Syrian government implement Annan's plan. REBELS SET TO RESUME ATTACKS The United Nations says Syrian forces have killed 9,000 people during the revolt. Damascus blames foreign-backed \\"terrorists\\", saying they have killed 2,600 soldiers and police. Nashar said the government had stuck to violence and had not implemented any of Annan's six-point plan. \\"We want international intervention to stop this policy of killing,\\" he added, without saying what form it should take. Riad al-Asaad, the FSA's commander of operations, said the rebels were ready to resume attacks on government forces as soon as Annan announced that his initiative had failed. In other violence, 10 rebels were killed overnight when tanks shelled the village of Ain Sheeb in the northwestern province of Idlib, opposition sources said. Tank fire also killed a civilian in the northwestern town of Ain Hamra.

Two large... (Associated Press) Syria's health minister says 50 people have been killed in two strong explosions that ripped through the Syrian capital. That makes Thursday morning's bombings the deadliest attack on the capital since the country's uprising began 14 months ago. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The explosions heavily damaged a military intelligence building and left blood and human remains in the streets. The blasts happened at about 7:50 a.m., when employees are usually arriving at work. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Two strong explosions ripped through the Syrian capital Thursday, killing more than 40 people and leaving scenes of carnage in the streets in an assault against a center of government power, officials said. Syria's state-run TV said 170 people were wounded in what one official said may have been the most powerful of a series of blasts that have hit the capital this year. There was no claim of responsibility for Thursday's attack on a military intelligence headquarters. But an al-Qaida-inspired group has claimed responsibility for several large explosions targeting mostly security facilities since December, raising fears that extremist groups are entering Syria's conflict and exploiting the chaos. The regime has used the bombings to support its claims that terrorists rather than a popular uprising are behind Syria's violence. The relentless violence by both sides of the conflict has brought a U.N.-brokered ceasefire plan to the brink of collapse. Thursday's explosions, which ripped the facade off the intelligence building, went off at about 7:50 a.m. when employees are usually arriving at work. The building is part of a broader military compound for a feared section of the intelligence services known as the Palestine Branch. An Associated Press reporter at the scene said paramedics wearing rubber gloves were collecting human remains from the pavement after the explosions. Heavily damaged cars and pickup trucks stood smoldering in the area. The outer wall of the headquarters collapsed and some walls crumbled, although the basic structure inside appeared intact. The Syrian government blamed \\"terrorists\\" and said dozens were killed or wounded, most of them civilians. Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the Norwegian head of the U.N.'s cease-fire monitors in the country, toured the site and said the Syrian people do not deserve this \\"terrible violence.\\" \\"It is not going to solve any problems,\\" he said, when asked what his message was to those who are carrying out such attacks. \\"It is only going to create more suffering for women and children.\\" Central Damascus is tightly under the control of forces loyal to President Bashar Assad but has been struck by several bomb attacks, often targeting security installations or convoys. The latest major explosion in the capital occurred on April 27 when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives belt near members of the security forces, killing at least nine people and wounding 26. Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi posted a message on his Facebook page urging people to go to hospitals to donate blood, saying that Thursday's blast \\"might be the strongest\\" of a wave of explosions that have hit Damascus since late December. The explosions left two craters at the gate of the military compound, one of them 3 meters (10 feet) deep and 6 meters (20 feet) wide. Residents said the two explosions quickly followed each other: first a smaller blast, then a massive one. \\"The house shook like it was an earthquake,\\" said housewife Maha Hijazi, who appeared shaken as she stood outside her house across the street from the targeted compound. Thursday's bombings were among the deadliest since such spectacular attacks started in December 2011, with a double suicide bombing of a Damascus security building that killed at least 44 people. Fresh attacks have followed in other cities, including Idlib in the north and Aleppo, Syria's largest city and long considered an Assad stronghold. Most of the attacks target state security offices and occur early morning. The government blames the bombings on the terrorists it says are behind the anti-Assad uprising. Opposition leaders and activists routinely blame the regime for orchestrating the attacks, saying they help it demonize the opposition and maintain support among those who fear greater instability. A shadowy group called the Al-Nusra Front has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks in statements posted on military websites. Little is known about the group, though Western intelligence officials say it could be a front for al-Qaida's Iraq branch. International diplomacy has failed to stop the bloodshed, and the U.N. has ruled out military intervention of the type that helped bring down Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, in part out of fear that it could exacerbate the violence. Special envoy Kofi Annan brokered a peace plan last month, but the initiative has been troubled from the start, with government troops shelling opposition areas and rebels attacking military convoys and checkpoints after the cease-fire was supposed to begin on April 12. Many civilians have grown critical of the plan, saying it does not protect them from regime forces. Although the daily death toll has dropped in recent days, Annan said Tuesday that the level of violence is unacceptable and that the plan's failure could lead to civil war. A team of 70 U.N. military observers now in Syria should grow to more than 100 in the coming days. A full team of 300 is expected by the end of the month to oversee a cease-fire intended to allow for talks on a political solution to the conflict. On Wednesday, a roadside bomb hit a Syrian military truck in a southern province just seconds after the U.N.'s Maj. Gen. Mood was driving by in a convoy, demonstrating the fragility of the international plan to end the country's bloodshed. Syria's conflict started in March 2011 with mass protests calling for political reform. The government swiftly cracked down, dispatching tanks, troops, snipers and pro-government thugs to quash dissent, and many members of the opposition took up arms to defend themselves and attack government troops. Many soldiers also switched sides. The U.N said weeks ago that more than 9,000 people had been killed. Hundreds more have died since. ___ AP writer Ben Hubbard contributed to this report from Beirut. |||||","completion":"On May 10, 2012, Damascus experienced its deadliest attack since the beginning of the Syrian civil uprising 14 months prior, when two suicide car bombers killed 55 people and wounded 372.

The Cochin royals agreed to pay the amount and accepted the Mysore's superiority. Finally, Malabar and Cochin came under the Mysore rule, opening Malabar Coast to the kings of Mysore. However the King of Travancore, who was under the protection of the East India Company, refused to pay the tribute. Eventually the Mysore army began to move to Travancore from the north. The Dutch military garrison at Cranganore Fort tried to stall the movement. Hyder Ali asked his commander Sardar Khan to take an army of 10,000 along the Cochin Kingdom. In August 1776, Cochin was invaded from the north and the fort at Trichur was captured. After the surrender of the ruler of Cochin, Hyder advanced to the Travancore Defence Lines .

Generate a 2-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package net.nurik.roman.muzei.","completion":"Title: Disappointing Overall Experience Rating: ⭐⭐ I recently decided to give the 'net.nurik.roman.muzei' app a try after hearing about its unique features and customization options. While the idea behind it seemed promising, my experience using it has been quite frustrating and unsatisfactory, resulting in a 2-star rating from me. Here's a detailed outline of my concerns with the app. First and foremost, the user interface and navigation was far from intuitive. Although the app boasts of its ease-of-use, I found myself constantly searching for ways to activate specific features and customize settings. The overall layout was confusing at times, and I often felt lost while attempting to apply even the simplest changes. This issue was only exacerbated by the slow response time whenever I tried to access certain functions. Speaking of response time, the app's performance wasn't particularly impressive either. Despite using a high-end device, I frequently endured lag, app crashes, and frozen screens while browsing through the app. This was especially problematic considering the whole idea behind the app is to provide a seamless and enjoyable art-viewing experience on my device's home screen. The app's instability coupled with the device's battery-draining tendency left me feeling very disappointed. Moreover, although the app offers a variety of artwork sources, I found the selection to be rather limited. Even with the option to add third-party art sources, there were still very few choices available in terms of themes and styles. It didn't particularly help that issues like artifacting and improper image scaling negatively impacted the quality of the displayed artwork. The fact that customization options for the artwork display were also limited only added to my dissatisfaction. Lastly, I encountered several occasions where the app's settings were reverted back to default without any prior notification or consent. This hindered my ability to consistently enjoy a personalized experience, leading to increased annoyance as I had to redo my customizations frequently. In conclusion, I regret to say that the 'net.nurik.roman.muzei' app fell considerably short of my expectations, with its confusing user interface, slow and unstable performance, limited selection of artworks, and lack of consistent customizability. I had high hopes for this app to provide me with a pleasing and effortless way to enhance my device with beautiful artwork. However, the issues I faced ultimately resulted in an unfavorable 2-star rating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"Many African commentators joined Ayittey in accusing Sudan of practising Arab apartheid.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Who accused the Arab government of practicing acts of racism?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"Many African commentators joined Ayittey in accusing Sudan of practising Arab apartheid.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"Who accused the Arab government of practicing acts of racism?\\" However, it is important to provide a more detailed explanation for better comprehension. In the sentence provided, the key information is the identification of certain individuals and groups accusing the Sudanese Arab government of practicing acts of racism. These individuals and groups can be broken down as follows: 1. Many African commentators: This is a broad category referring to numerous individuals from various African countries who have expressed their opinions on the issue. These commentators could include journalists, academics, public figures, and other professionals who are knowledgeable about the political and social conditions in Sudan. Their opinions are likely to be based on their expertise in African politics, human rights, and minority issues. 2. Ayittey: This refers to a specific individual, possibly George Ayittey, a renowned Ghanaian economist, author, and president of the Free Africa Foundation. He has written extensively on African politics and economics, addressing various issues, including human rights abuses, corruption, and the effects of colonialism on modern African development. Together, these commentators join George Ayittey in accusing the Sudanese Arab government of practicing acts of racism. Their accusation specifically targets the practice of \\"Arab apartheid,\\" referring to a system of racial segregation and discrimination similar to the former South African apartheid policy. In the context of Sudan, this apartheid system potentially involves the exclusion of non-Arab groups from access to resources, opportunities, and political power. In response to the question \\"Who accused the Arab government of practicing acts of racism?,\\" one can therefore say that many African commentators, along with George Ayittey, have accused the Sudanese Arab government of practicing Arab apartheid, a form of racial discrimination and segregation against non-Arab populations in Sudan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Why did the artillery school have to go underground? Context: Educational and technological reforms came about, including the establishment of higher education institutions such as the Istanbul Technical University. In 1734 an artillery school was established to impart Western-style artillery methods, but the Islamic clergy successfully objected under the grounds of theodicy. In 1754 the artillery school was reopened on a semi-secret basis. In 1726, Ibrahim Muteferrika convinced the Grand Vizier Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha, the Grand Mufti, and the clergy on the efficiency of the printing press, and Muteferrika was later granted by Sultan Ahmed III permission to publish non-religious books (despite opposition from some calligraphers and religious leaders). Muteferrika's press published its first book in 1729 and, by 1743, issued 17 works in 23 volumes, each having between 500 and 1,000 copies.

He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

He won five times, including the 1981 British Grand Prix for McLaren, and scored 169 career points. After leaving the sport in 1985, Watson has forged a successful media career, and today he writes for MailOnline. Following the fall-out from the Monaco Grand Prix, Watson assesses the fractious relationship beetween Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, and asks whether Mercedes could have handled the situation in a better fashion. If you go back to qualifying, I can understand why Lewis Hamilton was upset because he did not do anything wrong and he got caught up in Nico Rosberg’s incident which, in my opinion, was not pre-meditated. That said, it did work advantageously for Rosberg. He shouldn’t have done that, and suddenly, all those resentments from OPTIONS: - 1981 British Grand Prix build into big issues. - Formula One build into big issues. - Hamilton build into big issues. - John Watson build into big issues. - Lewis Hamilton build into big issues. - MailOnline build into big issues. - McLaren build into big issues. - Mercedes build into big issues. - Monaco Grand Prix build into big issues. - Nico Rosberg build into big issues. - Niki Lauda build into big issues. - Rosberg build into big issues. - Toto Wolff build into big issues. - Watson build into big issues.","completion":"Correct Answer(s): - Rosberg build into big issues. - Hamilton build into big issues. Explanation: Given the context of the question, it is likely that the story should end either with Hamilton's or Rosberg's resentments building into big issues, as these are the two individuals in the fractious relationship being discussed by Watson. The other options don't make sense in this context. The resentments can't be related to events or organizations mentioned like '1981 British Grand Prix' or 'McLaren'. It doesn’t fit because the issue isn’t about historical events or organizations but about personal resentment between two people. Options that refer to people not mentioned in the story as sources of resentment, such as 'Niki Lauda' or 'Toto Wolff', are not relevant. Watson's name doesn't fit because he is the neutral observer here, not a part of the fractious relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Accies were claiming that the ball had already gone out of play when Greg Kiltie cut across goal and fired his side into an early lead. Kiltie then played a one-two at the edge of the penalty box with Kris Boyd before providing the finish. A Boyd penalty and a Josh Magennis strike added pain for hapless Hamilton. The third-bottom hosts, who could have guaranteed their place in the Premiership next season with their third straight victory, were poor throughout. Media playback is not supported on this device But Kilmarnock, sitting a place behind, were dominant from the off and fully deserved the three points. The result not only narrows the gap between the sides with three games left to play but also means that Dundee United can be relegated on Monday night against city rivals Dundee. Kilmarnock came flying out of the blocks and a cross from Craig Slater went into the box, Hamilton defender Michael Devlin miscued his header and it rebounded off his own bar. The ball fell to Kiltie, but the midfielder's shot was brilliantly saved by Michael McGovern. Kilmarnock would make their early momentum pay, albeit with a slice of controversy. Kiltie cut in from the left wing before arrowing a superb shot into the top corner with the Hamilton players complaining to the referee that the ball had gone out of play in the build up. It would get even better for Kilmarnock - and Kiltie. A perfectly judged through ball from Boyd found the young winger, who showed real composure to finish well past McGovern. A hint of offside, but again the goal stood. Accies saved their best move of the half right until the end. A shot from Ali Crawford from eight yards out forcing a one-handed save from goalkeeper Conor Brennan. Another moment of controversy came in the second-half. Lucas looked to accidentally strike the ball with his arm in a jostle with Magennis, but the assistant referee put the flag up for a penalty. Boyd showed no mercy from the spot and Kilmarnock went close to extending the lead when Rory McKenzie's chip from the edge of the box sailed just over the top corner. Magennis then had the ball in the net, finishing well at the far post, but the flag was up for offside. However, the Northern Ireland forward would get his goal eventually, firing in a low shot that McGovern was unable to stop from squirming over the line.","completion":"In a soccer game, Kilmarnock played really well and won against Hamilton, even though there were some controversial moments in the match."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me.

I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it. I attempted to break the tree in half by throwing it against another tree, as if I were as strong as the hulk or something. Once I chunked the tree at this tree I messed the entire vacation up.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Mays was born in 1931 in Westfield, Alabama. His father, Cat Mays, was a talented baseball player with the Negro team for the local iron plant. His mother, Annie Satterwhite, was a gifted basketball and track star in high school. His parents never married. Mays began his major league career on a sour note, with no hits in his first 12 at bats. On his 13th at-bat, however, he hit a towering home run over the left field roof of the Polo Grounds off of future Hall of Famer Warren Spahn. Spahn later joked, \\"I'll never forgive myself. We might have gotten rid of Willie forever if I'd only struck him out.\\" Mays's batting average improved steadily throughout the rest of the season. Although his .274 average, 68 RBI and 20 homers (in 121 games) were among the lowest of his career, he still won the 1951 Rookie of the Year Award. During the Giants' comeback in August and September 1951 to tie the Dodgers in the pennant race, Mays' fielding and strong throwing arm were instrumental to several important Giants victories. Mays was in the on-deck circle when Bobby Thomson hit the Shot Heard 'Round the World against Ralph Branca and the Brooklyn Dodgers to win the three-game playoff 2-1 after the teams were tied at the end of the regular season. The Giants went on to meet the New York Yankees in the 1951 World Series. In Game 1, Mays, Hank Thompson and Hall of Famer Monte Irvin comprised the first all-African-American outfield in major league history four years after the color line was broken. Mays hit poorly while the Giants lost the series 4-2. The six-game set was the only time that Mays and retiring Yankee ace Joe DiMaggio would compete against each other. Mays was a popular figure in Harlem. Magazine photographers were fond of chronicling his participation in local stickball games with kids. It was said that in the urban game of hitting a rubber ball with an adapted broomstick handle, Mays could hit a shot that measured \\"six sewers\\" (the distance of six consecutive New York City manhole covers, nearly 300 feet). When did he start playing baseball?","completion":"The article does not provide the exact year when Mays started playing baseball. However, it mentions that Mays began his major league career with no hits in his first 12 at-bats, and later on, he won the 1951 Rookie of the Year Award.

To make your ankle bracelet, you will need string. You can use one color, or an assortment. You’ll need three pieces of string for this type of ankle bracelet. You can find the string at craft stores. When picking out the colors, be sure to choose a set that either means something to the person you’re making the ankle bracelet for or simply goes well together. Colorful string Scissors Tape-measure Safety pin or tape Using your tape measure, tape around the spot on your ankle where you want your ankle bracelet to sit. Next, add 6 inches (15.2 cm) to this measurement. This gives you plenty of room to tie the ankle bracelet. Cut your string here. Tie all three of your strings together in one knot at the end. Leave an inch above the knot so that you can tie it again after you complete your ankle bracelet. Use tape or a safety pin to anchor your string. Attaching it to something steady will make it much easier to work with. You can attach it to anything that will hold it still. The leg of your pants A binder The table A pillow With your strings anchored, knot at the side, grab hold of two strings. Hold these straight and wrap your third string around these two and pull it into a knot. You’ll be able to see the knot on the side of the string. Using this same thread, repeat this step 10-15 times. Be sure to hold your two center strings as straight and tight as possible. This will make tying the knots easier because it will keep them out of the way of your staircase. It’s just that easy—pick your next color string after you’ve reached the length you want for the first one. Hold the other two straight and use your new color to tie a knot around them. Repeat this for 10-15 knots. Continue this staircase for the length of your ankle. If you notice that a knot isn’t sitting correctly, you can easily undo it. However, this gets more and more difficult because your staircase gets tighter as you go; so pay attention and catch the mistake early. Once you have approximately 4 extra inches of string, test the length of your ankle bracelet. If it is not yet long enough, continue your staircase and check again after you complete a color. Now that your ankle bracelet is long enough, tie it around your ankle, or the ankle of the person you’re giving it to. Use a strong knot and cut the excess string away.

Here is a question about this article: After the death of Lysimachus, one of his officers, Philetaerus, took control of the city of Pergamum in 282 BC along with Lysimachus' war chest of 9,000 talents and declared himself loyal to Seleucus I while remaining de facto independent. His descendant, Attalus I, defeated the invading Galatians and proclaimed himself an independent king. Attalus I (241–197BC), was a staunch ally of Rome against Philip V of Macedon during the first and second Macedonian Wars. For his support against the Seleucids in 190 BCE, Eumenes II was rewarded with all the former Seleucid domains in Asia Minor. Eumenes II turned Pergamon into a centre of culture and science by establishing the library of Pergamum which was said to be second only to the library of Alexandria with 200,000 volumes according to Plutarch. It included a reading room and a collection of paintings. Eumenes II also constructed the Pergamum Altar with friezes depicting the Gigantomachy on the acropolis of the city. Pergamum was also a center of parchment (charta pergamena) production. The Attalids ruled Pergamon until Attalus III bequeathed the kingdom to the Roman Republic in 133 BC to avoid a likely succession crisis. What is the answer to this question: What depicts the Gigantomachy on the acropolis of the city?","completion":"The Pergamon Altar, constructed by Eumenes II, depicts the Gigantomachy on the acropolis of the city of Pergamum. The Gigantomachy is an epic battle scene from Greek mythology, featuring the struggle between the gods and the giants.

The Winter Olympics is also called the White Olympics. At that time, many color1ful stamps are published to mark the great Games. The first stamp marking the opening of the White Olympics was issued on January 25th, 1932 in the United states to celebrate the 3rd White Olympics. From then on, issuing stamps during the White Olympics became a tradition. To observe the 4th Winter Olympic Games, a group of stamps were published in Germany in November, 1935. The five rings of the Olympics were printed on the front of the sportswear. It was the first time that the symbol appeared on stamps of the Winter Olympics. In the 1950s, the stamps of this kind became more color1ful. When the White Olympics came, the host countries as well as the non-host countries published stamps to mark those Games. China also published four stamps in February, 1980, when the Chinese sportsmen began to march into the area of the Winter Olympics. Japan is the only Asian country that has ever held the White Olympics. Altogether 14,500 million stamps were sold to raise funds for the sports meet. Different kinds of sports were represented on these small stamps. People can enjoy the beauty of the wonderful movements of the athletes. The White Olympics and the Winter Olympics are _ .

The term \\"White Olympics\\" is used to emphasize the association with winter sports and snow-covered landscapes where most of the events take place. Both terms, Winter Olympics and White Olympics, are of the same meaning (A), and they represent the same grand sporting event. The tradition of issuing colorful stamps to mark the Winter Olympics began with the 3rd White Olympics in 1932 in the United States. The practice has continued ever since, with host countries and many non-host countries celebrating the Games through the release of commemorative stamps. This tradition not only enhances the global interest in the Winter Olympics but also helps raise funds for organizing the event, as seen in Japan's case. The symbol of the Olympic rings, which represents the unity of the five participating continents, first appeared on Winter Olympics stamps in Germany during the 4th Winter Olympic Games. Over the decades, the design and colors of these stamps have become more vibrant, reflecting the lively spirit of the Games. China joined the tradition by issuing four commemorative stamps in February 1980, marking their entry into the Winter Olympics. Japan remains the only Asian country to have hosted the Winter Olympics, and they sold a staggering 14.5 billion stamps in support of the event. The stamps showcase various winter sports, providing a glimpse of each event's intensity and beauty. Through these stamps, people can appreciate the athleticism, dedication, and skill of the athletes competing in the Winter Olympics. In summary, the terms White Olympics and Winter Olympics are of the same meaning (A), referring to the globally celebrated sporting event featuring winter sports.

How Washington keeps states from regulating Internet providers The U.S. House is expected to vote Tuesday on a bill that would prevent state and city governments from levying taxes on Internet access. The bill is important for a number of reasons, not least because it could help determine what you ultimately pay for service. But it also highlights an important tension between Washington and the states — one that affects how we regulate what has become the most important connection technology of our time. From telephone service to cable TV, state and local governments have historically had an important role to play in regulating media and communications technology. For instance, public service commissions and utility commissions in each state are tasked with setting up and enforcing rules that firms have to follow if they want to play in the local market. The Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, which has the backing of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and nearly 190 co-sponsors, could take some of that power away, at least on paper. The bill itself is fairly simple: It reaffirms a preexisting ban on Internet taxes. Here's why that's significant: Until now, the ban had to be renewed by Congress every so often. But if the ban becomes permanent, Congress would be heading off any attempt by states to tax Internet providers and reassert themselves over those companies. Think of it this way: If you're a state government, you likely view ISPs as a potential source of tax income. The only thing standing between you and them right now is Congress, which periodically keeps blocking you on the tax issue. This might inspire some slim but valid hope that Congress could someday allow the ban to expire, returning to you a power that you think you should be able to flex. Goodlatte's bill would finally clarify the tax relationship that state and local governments have with Internet providers, which is to say that they will have none. End of discussion. The legislation would officially make regulating Internet providers more of a federal affair, with all of the consequences that implies. And it wouldn't be the first time: In fact, just last week, the Federal Communications Commission voted to \\"strip local governments of the ability to regulate the rates of cable operators,\\" as FierceCable puts it. And earlier this year, the FCC voted to intervene against state laws that make it harder for publicly-funded Internet providers to get off the ground and grow. All of this adds up to Washington having a greater say in the regulatory affairs of Internet providers. This isn't the same as regulating the Internet. But it will likely shape how the Internet ecosystem evolves in certain ways. Brian Fung covers technology for The Washington Post, focusing on telecom, broadband and digital politics.

Here is a question about this article: In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \\"anything but intercourse\\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21. Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, eighty-one percent of parents want schools to discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children. They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers want to address such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 sex education instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so. According to anthropologist Margaret Mead, the turmoil found in adolescence in Western society has a cultural rather than a physical cause; they reported that societies where young women engaged in free sexual activity had no such adolescent turmoil.

The Homegrown Player Rule has been an initiative in England and the Premier League to allow for more domestic, English players to be a brought up from a younger age in hopes of creating more talented English players. Currently, the Premier League does not have a maximum restriction on the number of foreign players allowed on a team, but does require at least eight homegrown players. Greg Dyke, new chairman of the Football Association (FA), wants to implement much stronger regulation of foreign players. His intention is clear as stated in an op-ed piece so that England can win the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Some of Dyke's propositions include: homegrown players in a top-flight 25-man first-team squad be increased from eight to 12 two of which must be brought up in the teams youth system, and also changing the definition of what it is to be a homegrown player. Currently, to be classified as homegrown one must be on an English team for at least three years before the age of twenty-one in which Dyke would like to reduce to eighteen years. This would mean a teenager would have to be with the club at a maximum age of fifteen and players are not allowed to move across national boundaries, even European Union boundaries, before 16. Meaning such that, if a foreign player joined an English youth academy at sixteen, in three years time he would be nineteen.

A West Tennessee nonprofit organization will use a 300,000 federal grant to hire an attorney and a Spanish-speaking paralegal to help provide legal assistance to domestic violence victims. The U.S. Department of Justice two-year grant will begin Oct. 1, which is the start of domestic violence awareness month. U.S. Rep. John Tanner announced Monday that the grant was awarded to West Tennessee Legal Services of Jackson. The organization provides legal assistance and advocacy in 17 counties. \\"This award will offer assistance as we look for whatever ways possible to stop domestic violence and help the women, men and children who are victims of abuse,\\" Tanner said in a news statement. The organization doesn't have a staff member who speaks Spanish and the need is increasing with growing Hispanic populations, said the organization's executive director Steven Xanthopoulos. He estimated the money will help handle at least another 180 cases next year. The group closes about 2,500 cases a year. The money was timed well because the legal group had recently lost about 120,000 in grant money due to a decrease in the poverty population in West Tennessee in Census 2000, Xanthopoulos said. \\"The drop in poverty is a good thing, but there is still a great need out there,\\" he said. \\"So this was a very good thing.\\" Having legal representation at divorce and child custody hearings is important in helping victims leave abusive and sometimes dangerous situations, said Margaret Cole, executive director of Wo/Men's Resource and Rape Assistance Program in Jackson.

Jean-Christophe Lafaille (31 March 1965 - 27 January 2006 [presumed]) was a French mountaineer noted for a number of difficult ascents in the Alps and Himalaya, and for what has been described as \\"perhaps the finest self-rescue ever performed in the Himalaya\\", when he was forced to descend the mile-high south face of Annapurna alone with a broken arm, after his climbing partner had been killed in a fall. He climbed eleven of the fourteen eight-thousand-metre peaks, many of them alone or by previously unclimbed routes, but disappeared during a solo attempt to make the first winter ascent of Makalu, the world's fifth highest mountain. On the strength of his climbs in the Alps, Lafaille was invited on an expedition to Annapurna by Pierre Beghin, one of the leading French climbers of the day. The pair attempted the mountain's vast South Face following the monsoon season in October 1992 in Alpine style, with no Sherpa support, pre-stocked campsites or fixed ropes on the upper mountain. They had reached a height of 7,400 metres when bad weather forced them to descend. The pair made a series of abseils down the face, but due to their lightweight approach they had little protective equipment and were often forced to abseil from a single anchor to conserve equipment. On the fourth or fifth abseil, Beghin fell to his death when the single cam he was using as an anchor became dislodged from the rock. Beghin had been carrying most of the pair's technical equipment, including all the ropes, and Lafaille was left alone on the face, a vertical mile above safety. With great difficulty, Lafaille managed to climb down the 75 degree face to the pair's last bivouac site, where he found 20 metres of thin rope, allowing him to make short abseils down some of the hardest parts. With no technical equipment to use as anchors he was forced to entrust his weight to tent pegs or, on one occasion, a plastic bottle. He finally reached what should have been the relative safety of the top of a fixed rope which he and Beghin had installed on a steep rock band, but almost immediately he was struck by a falling rock, which broke his right arm. Disabled and helpless, he lay on a ledge for two days in the hope that other climbers would rescue him. However, while there was a Slovenian team attempting a route on a different part of the South Face, they judged that a rescue attempt would be too dangerous to undertake, so help never came. The cruellest thing about the ordeal, Lafaille said, was being able to see life in the valley below, and by night, the flashbulbs of trekkers' cameras. In spite of this, he later agreed that the Slovenians had made the right decision in not trying to save him. Eventually, with all hope of rescue gone, Lafaille resolved to continue down alone. He initially tried to continue abseiling, but unable to control the rope with only one hand and his teeth he reverted to downclimbing one-handed, and was utterly exhausted when he reached the Slovenian team's base camp. By that time the climbers at the base of the mountain had given up hope for him, and his first wife, Veronique, had already been told that he had died. Reinhold Messner later said that the survival instinct he showed was of the sort which defines the best mountaineers.

Lord Kerr says EU treaty allows UK to change mind up to moment of leaving, and adding date to bill would not change that The former diplomat who drafted article 50 says the UK could opt to reverse Brexit up to the moment we leave, even if a date for the country’s departure from European Union were added to the withdrawal bill, as Theresa May plans. Lord Kerr, a former UK ambassador to the European Union, said Brexiters in May’s cabinet were suggesting Brexit was irreversible and thereby misleading the public. He was speaking hours after the government confirmed it wanted an amendment to the withdrawal bill to set a fixed departure point of 11pm GMT (midnight in Brussels) on 29 March 2019. “We are leaving the European Union on 29 March 2019,” May wrote in the Telegraph. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme Kerr, now a crossbench peer, said the UK could still opt to stay in the EU. “At any stage we can change our minds if we want to, and if we did we know that our partners would actually be very pleased indeed.” He added: “The Brexiters create the impression that is because of the way article 50 is written that having sent in a letter on 29 March 2017 we must leave automatically on 29 March 2019 at the latest. That is not true. It is misleading to suggest that a decision that we are taking autonomously in this country about the timing of our departure, we are required to take by a provision of EU treaty law.” His complaint came as the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, prepare to meet in Brussels on the second day of the latest round of talks before a crunch summit of European leaders next month. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lord Kerr: ‘It is always possible at a later stage to decide that we want to do something different.’ Photograph: Ian Nicholson/PA Kerr was asked to clarify whether the UK could still halt Brexit even if a date was set on the face of the EU withdrawal bill. “That’s what I’m saying,” he said. Speaking before a speech to an Open Britain event later on Friday, he added: “One should bear in mind that it is always possible at a later stage to decide that we want to do something different.” He added: “It is entirely up to the prime minister to set a date for our departure. My point is quite a different one. These decisions are taken entirely in this country, they have nothing to do with the treaty. As far as the treaty is concerned there are lots of options. There is a provision to seek some extra time for negotiation and, much more important, there’s the ability at any stage to take back the letter that the prime minister sent to President Tusk on 29 March.” Kerr was asked about Davis’s view that the referendum result was a an “irrevocable moment”. He replied: “The David Davis quote I would offer you comes from 2012 when he said: ‘A democracy that has lost the right to change its mind has ceased to be a democracy.’” He added: “I’m not a politician. I’m just the guy who wrote the treaty telling you what the treaty means.” Kerr claimed that circumstances had changed since the referendum. He said: “It is open to us to argue that the terms as they emerge are not quite the ones that we were led to expect: that the costs of coming out are rather different from what it said on the side of the battlebus; that the complexity of coming out was not entirely explained and the effects of coming out on, for example, the NHS or jobs, these things are not what the electorate knew about at the time. If new facts emerge one is entitled to change one’s view, as Keynes said.” He added: “I’m not today arguing for a second referendum, I’m saying if we wanted to have a second referendum there is nothing in the treaty, or in the attitude of EU partners, that would prevent us taking the time to have one.” ||||| LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May should stop misleading voters and admit that Brexit can be avoided if Britain decides unilaterally to scrap divorce talks, the man who drafted Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty said on Friday. Former British ambassador to the EU, John Kerr, poses for a photograph following a news conference, in central London, Britain November 10, 2017. REUTERS/Simon Dawson May, who formally notified the European Union of Britain’s intention to leave the EU by triggering Article 50 of the treaty on March 29, said she would not tolerate any attempt in parliament to block Brexit. By triggering Article 50, May set the clock ticking on a two-year exit process that has so far failed to yield a divorce deal and which was interrupted by her gamble on a snap election in June which cost her party its majority in parliament. “While the divorce talks proceed, the parties are still married. Reconciliation is still possible,” John Kerr, British ambassador to the EU from 1990 to 1995, said in a speech in London. “We can change our minds at any stage during the process,” said Kerr, who added that the legalities of Article 50 had been misrepresented in Britain. “The British people have the right to know this: they shouldn’t be misled.” The day May triggered Article 50, she told the British parliament that there was “no turning back” and on Friday insisted that the United Kingdom would be leaving the EU at 2300 GMT on March 29 2019. In a June 2016 referendum, 51.9 percent of voters backed leaving the EU while 48.1 percent wanted to remain. Brexit supporters argue any attempt to halt the exit process would be anti-democratic, while opponents say the country should have a right to pass final judgment on any exit deal negotiated. May, an initial opponent of Brexit who won the top job in the political turmoil that followed the vote, said last month that Britain would not revoke Article 50.

REUTERS/Simon Dawson “NO TURNING BACK” But ever since the referendum, opponents of Britain’s exit - from French President Emmanuel Macron and former British prime minister Tony Blair to billionaire investor George Soros - have suggested Britain could change its mind and avoid what they say will be disastrous consequences for the British economy. Thus far, there are few signs of a change of heart on Brexit in opinion polls. Both May’s Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party now explicitly support leaving the EU, which Britain joined in 1973. Supporters of Brexit have repeatedly said that any attempt to have another referendum, or to undermine Brexit, would catapult the world’s fifth largest economy into crisis. “A second referendum would lead the United Kingdom into totally uncharted territory with very serious potential consequences for our democracy,” said Richard Tice, who helped found one of the two Leave campaign groups in the referendum. Former British ambassador to the EU, John Kerr, who drafted Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, poses for a photograph following a news conference, in central London, Britain November 10, 2017. REUTERS/Simon Dawson But the Brexit process has been challenged in a number of cases in British courts, many focusing on the as-yet unanswered question: Can Article 50 be reversed? The 256-word clause does not say whether it can be revoked once it is invoked. This means that, if lawyers ask for clarification, the question would have to go to the European Court of Justice, the EU’s highest court. Kerr, who in 2002-2003 acted as secretary-general of the European Constitutional Convention that drafted Article 50, said the debate had been misrepresented inside Britain: it was clear, he said, that May’s Article 50 letter could be revoked. Such is the interest in the legalities of Brexit that one prominent lawyer, Jessica Simor, has formally asked for May’s unpublished legal advice on the matter. “Britain can basically change its mind at any time right up to the 29th of March 2019,” Simor told Reuters last month. “If you can revoke Article 50, then parliament has the power to rescue the country if that becomes necessary – if the government fails to secure a deal, or the deal is terrible, or the people do not want it.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The UK can reverse Brexit up to the moment the country leaves if a date for departure is added to the withdrawal bill, according to Lord Kerr, the former UK diplomat who drafted Article 50.

Drawing from such concepts as the international scientific vocabulary and Standard Average European, linguists[who?] developed a theory that the modern Western languages were actually dialects of a hidden or latent language.[citation needed] Researchers at the International Auxiliary Language Association extracted words and affixes that they considered to be part of Interlingua's vocabulary.

Interlingua has also been found to assist in the learning of other languages. In one study, Swedish high school students learning Interlingua were able to translate passages from Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian that students of those languages found too difficult to understand.

Write some highlights for the following article: Contractors who helped develop the embattled HealthCare.gov website blame each other and the government, but not themselves, in testimony prepared for Thursday's first congressional hearing on the problems engulfing the online enrollment system. House Energy and Commerce Committee members will grill officials from CGI Federal, Optum/QSSI, Equifax Workforce Solutions and Serco at the hearing to examine technological problems faced by people trying to buy health insurance under President Barack Obama's signature reforms. Complaints of inability to log in, lengthy delays, incorrect information relayed to insurance companies and other problems have plagued the website since it opened to much fanfare on October 1. White House video makes HealthCare.gov issues seem simple. In the first detailed account of what happened, the prepared testimony describes a convoluted system of multiple companies designing parts of the website under oversight of the federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services. According to the advance statements, the system had been tested as required but still buckled under an unanticipated flood of visitors when it opened. Cheryl Campbell, senior vice president at CGI Federal, will tell the panel that testing of the site met industry standards and \\"passed eight required technical reviews prior to going live on October 1,\\" according to her prepared testimony. Sebelius on the spot in Obamacare website fiasco. \\"Unfortunately, in systems this complex with so many concurrent users, it is not unusual to discover problems that need to be addressed once the software goes into a live production environment,\\" Campbell's advance testimony says. \\"This is true regardless of the level of formal end-to-end performance testing -- no amount of testing within reasonable time limits can adequately replicate a live environment of this nature,\\" she added. Campbell blames initial problems on the \\"enterprise identity management\\" function known as EIDM that serves as the entry portal to the website. The EIDM tool designed by another contractor, which Campbell's advance testimony doesn't name, \\"created a bottleneck that prevented the vast majority of users from accessing\\" Healthcare.gov when it opened, according to Campbell. Gupta: 5 surprises from Sebelius interview. However, Andrew Slavitt of Optum, which designed the EIDM tool, says in his prepared testimony that an unexpected high volume of people registered at the start and overwhelmed the entry portal and other aspects of the website. He puts the blame on the government, saying: \\"It appears that one of the reasons for the high concurrent volume at the registration system was a late decision requiring consumers to register for an account before they could browse for insurance products.\\" \\"This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that wouldn't have occurred if consumers could 'window shop' anonymously,\\" Slavitt's testimony says, adding that the EIDM tool was able to process the high volumes with low to zero error rates by October 8. A third contractor, Equifax Workplace Solutions, says its role providing \\"real time verification of income and employment\\" information submitted by applicants has worked properly, according to the advance testimony by its corporate counsel, Lynn Spellecy. Equifax conducted \\"multiple load and stress tests\\" that showed it could process up to 120,000 verification requests per hour or more, which it estimated as more than any peak period would demand, Spellecy's testimony says. Insurers pledge to help solve website problems. Campbell also says in her prepared testimony that improvements to the EIDM tool have allowed more users to proceed to the website's main function of providing a range of choices and information on available subsidies for them to choose health insurance required by law. \\"More individuals have enrolled in qualified insurance plans; however, the increased number of transactions ... have caused system performance issues (such as slow response times or data assurance issues) that now need to be addressed through tuning, optimization and application improvements,\\" her testimony says. The White House and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius make the same argument, saying the initial problems in accessing the website have eased. Sebelius: Website problems blindsided President. Sebelius has brought in tech experts from Silicon Valley and elsewhere to work with the contractors on eliminating problems, with acting Office of Management and Budget Director Jeff Zients overseeing the effort. \\"The work of constantly improving the website will continue day by day,\\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday. \\"A week from now, it's going to be better than it is today.\\" The Energy and Commerce Committee isn't the only one probing Obamacare in light of its issues. So, too, is the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The latter sent an eight-page letter Wednesday night to 11 contracting firms involved in putting together HealthCare.gov giving them two days to provide documents, meeting lists and all communications with the Obama administration on the project, committee spokeswoman Caitlin Carroll said. The fact all three committees are in the same chamber -- which is led by Republicans -- is likely no coincidence. The GOP has and continues to be staunchly opposed to Obamacare, even trying unsuccessfully to make defunding or delaying it requirement before it would fund the government. The White House has been pushing back against not just Republicans, but some Democrats who have urged an extension of the open enrollment period beyond March 31 and/or a delay in penalties for those who don't sign up for insurance on time because of the website issues. The Obama administration is moving to clarify confusion on when people need to sign up for health care, and it has plans to issue new guidelines to this point soon. Still, Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters insisted \\"the individual mandate timing\\" -- i.e. the requirement for a person to have insurance by March -- \\"has not changed. ... It was true this morning. It is true tonight.\\" Pelosi pushes back on extending Obamacare deadline.","completion":"There was a big meeting with some people who helped make the HealthCare.gov website.

They said the website was properly tested and the issues are now getting fixed, so it will be easier for people to use.

Q: I heard that Quinn was thirsty and drank a lot of milk with his cookies. And I was wondering How would Quinn feel milk and cookies? Choose from: - like doing jumping jacks; - queasy and sick; - like going swimming; The answer is:","completion":"Quinn would most likely feel queasy and sick if he drank a lot of milk with his cookies. When someone consumes a large quantity of milk along with cookies, their stomach has to work extra hard to digest the mixture, as it contains a high amount of sugars, fats, and carbohydrates. This can lead to feelings of discomfort, bloating, and even nausea. In addition, the combination of milk and cookies can cause a temporary spike in blood sugar levels, which might contribute to the person feeling unwell. Jumping jacks, while supplying a completely different kind of experience, are unlikely to have a significant effect on the gut discomfort caused by overindulging in milk and cookies. If anything, performing high-intensity exercises, such as jumping jacks, could exacerbate the discomfort. As for swimming, it is generally recommended that people avoid swimming immediately after eating, as digestion requires blood flow to the stomach, which can be redirected to the muscles during swimming, leading to cramps or discomfort. Thus, going for a swim wouldn't be the best choice after consuming large amounts of milk and cookies. So, in conclusion, after drinking a lot of milk with his cookies, Quinn would most likely feel queasy and sick."},{"prompt":"Q:What key details about jari lindström can be extracted from the following bio?

Joseph and Mary lived with their son Joseph, Jr. and his family in a small house while theirs was being built. Mary Priestley was primarily responsible for the design of the couple's new home and her family inheritance may have helped finance it, but she died before it was completed. By 1797, Joseph's laboratory was completed—the first part of the home to be finished. It was the first laboratory that \\"he had designed, built, and outfitted entirely himself\\" and was probably the first \\"scientifically-equipped laboratory\\" in the United States. Joseph continued his scientific and scholarly work in his new laboratory, identifying carbon monoxide (which he called \\"heavy inflammable air\\"). In 1798 Joseph Jr., his wife, and their children moved into the new house with Joseph Priestley. The house also held Priestley's library, which contained about 1600 volumes by his death in 1804 and was one of the largest in America at the time. The Priestley family held Unitarian church services in the drawing room and Joseph educated a group of young men until the local Northumberland Academy that he helped found was completed.The house proper was completed in 1798, with a Mr. Jones of Northumberland employed acting as master carpenter. Built in an 18th-century Georgian style, the \\"balance and symmetry\\" of the architecture signaled \\"subdued elegance\\".

Possible answers: see if they were ok, comfort me in my time of sorrow, give me a dollar Answer:","completion":"Kai, upon noticing you sitting on the bench in distress, would most likely want to approach you and see if you were okay. As a perceptive and empathetic individual, Kai understands that seeing someone in tears is an indication that they may need emotional support. In this situation, Kai would feel compelled to walk over to you and inquire about your wellbeing, ensuring their concern is genuine and heartfelt. Once Kai has established communication with you, they would endeavor to comfort you in your time of sorrow. This may involve offering a listening ear for you to express your feelings or providing comforting words of consolation and reassurance. By doing so, Kai wants to create a safe space where you can openly explore your emotions, acknowledging your vulnerability and validating your experience. In addition to these gestures, Kai might also offer some practical support such as handing you a tissue, suggesting ways to cope with your emotions, or even sitting by your side in silence if that's what you prefer. By being present and attentive, Kai communicates that they care about your emotional wellbeing and are committed to providing assistance in any way possible. While the idea of giving you a dollar may have crossed Kai's mind, they would likely perceive it as an inappropriate or superficial gesture under these circumstances. A financial offering would not adequately address your emotional turmoil, and it might even come across as insensitive or dismissive of your feelings. In conclusion, given the context, it is most probable that Kai would initially want to see if you were okay and then provide comfort and emotional support during your time of sorrow. By extending a compassionate and empathetic presence, Kai can effectively alleviate some of your emotional distress and demonstrate their genuine concern for your wellbeing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What hotel in Tamiya Hill-station would be safe for unmarried couples, without the harassment of police, hotel staff, and moral police? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The questions are not the same, as they are referring to two different hill stations: Shimla and Tamiya. However, their main focus is the same, which is to find a hotel that is safe for unmarried couples in terms of avoiding harassment from the police, hotel staff, and moral police. To offer a proper answer for both of the questions, I have prepared separate recommendations for each hill station as follows: 1. Shimla Hill Station: Shimla is a popular tourist destination, and several hotels cater to the needs of various travelers, including unmarried couples. To ensure a safe and hassle-free stay, you can opt for OYO (On Your Own) Rooms – a popular hotel booking platform in India. OYO has launched a 'Relationship Mode,' an industry-first feature that allows unmarried couples to book hotel rooms without any concerns about harassment. Some hotels in Shimla that you can consider, which are couple-friendly and provide a safe environment, include: a. Treebo Trend Varuna Shimla: Located near Mall Road, this hotel is known for its clean rooms, welcoming staff, and superb location. They maintain a respectful environment for couples with no interference. b. Honeymoon Inn Shimla: As the name suggests, the hotel caters primarily to couples and honeymooners. The hotel assures a peaceful and safe stay for both married and unmarried couples within a cozy and romantic ambiance. c. Summit Thistle Villas Luxury Spa Resort: Perfect for couples seeking luxury and privacy, this resort is nestled amid the mountains and offers an array of amenities. The staff is attentive and respects the privacy of all guests, ensuring a comfortable stay for unmarried couples as well. 2. Tamiya Hill Station: It seems there is no hill station named Tamiya. If you meant Tamia Hill Station instead, which lies in Madhya Pradesh, here are some hotel options: a. OYO 71324 Hotel G.p. Palace: This OYO property has spacious, cozy rooms and offers a hassle-free stay for unmarried couples. The staff respects the privacy of its guests and provides courteous service to ensure a comfortable experience. b. Pachmarhi Heights: Known for its warm hospitality and serene surroundings, Pachmarhi Heights ensures that unmarried couples are comfortably accommodated without facing any awkwardness or harassment. It is always a good idea to read online reviews and experiences of other couples who have stayed in these hotels to get an understanding of their policies and the environment. However, it is important to note that while a hotel might be accommodating of unmarried couples, it is essential to carry valid ID proofs with you. In conclusion, while both questions are inquiring about safe hotel options for unmarried couples in two different hill stations - Shimla and Tamiya (Tamia) - the underlying theme of finding a safe and harassment-free hotel is the primary concern for both."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose your answer from: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","completion":"To calculate the number of moles of CO2 in a 115L container at STP, we need to use the Ideal Gas Law formula and Avogadro's Law. The Ideal Gas Law formula is: PV = nRT Where: P = pressure V = volume n = moles R = ideal gas constant T = temperature At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), the conditions are: P = 1 atm V = 115 L R = 0.08206 L * atm / (mol * K) T = 273.15 K Now, we plug these values into the Ideal Gas Law formula and solve for n (the number of moles): (1 atm) * (115 L) = n * (0.08206 L * atm / (mol * K)) * (273.15 K) To solve for n, firstly we can simplify the equation by canceling out the units: 115 = n * (0.08206) * (273.15) Now, we can solve for n: n = 115 / (0.08206 * 273.15) n ≈ 5.11 moles So, there are approximately 5.11 moles of CO2 in a 115L container at STP. As for the second question, the number of moles in CO2 refers to the molar mass of CO2. One mole of any substance contains Avogadro's number of particles (6.022 x 10^23). The molar mass of CO2 can be determined by adding the molar masses of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. Molar mass of carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol Molar mass of oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol Molar mass of CO2 = 1 * (12.01 g/mol) + 2 * (16.00 g/mol) Molar mass of CO2 = 12.01 g/mol + 32.00 g/mol Molar mass of CO2 = 44.01 g/mol Therefore, there are 44.01 g/mol in CO2. Now, to answer the third question, we can compare the two questions: 1. How many moles of CO2 are in a 115L container at STP? This question asks for the number of moles of CO2 in a specific volume and condition (115L at STP). 2. How many moles are there in CO2? This question asks for the molar mass of CO2, which is a fixed value. So, are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Answer: [a]. no; The two questions are not paraphrases of each other because they are asking for different pieces of information related to moles and CO2."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is it true that is the normal force equal to the force of gravity based on the following text? In a simple case such as an object resting upon a table, the normal force on the object is equal but in opposite direction to the gravitational force applied on the object (or the weight of the object), that is, N = m g (displaystyle N=mg) , where m is mass, and g is the gravitational field strength (about 9.81 m/s on Earth). The normal force here represents the force applied by the table against the object that prevents it from sinking through the table and requires that the table is sturdy enough to deliver this normal force without breaking. However, it is easy to assume that the normal force and weight are action-reaction force pairs (a common mistake). In this case, the normal force and weight need to be equal in magnitude to explain why there is no upward acceleration of the object. For example, a ball that bounces upwards accelerates upwards because the normal force acting on the ball is larger in magnitude than the weight of the ball. Select from the following. a. no. b. yes.","completion":"b. yes. The normal force is equal to the force of gravity when an object is resting on a surface, like a table. In this situation, the normal force (N) is equal to the mass (m) of the object multiplied by the gravitational field strength (g), which is N = m * g. The normal force pushes up against the object to prevent it from sinking through the table, and the force of gravity pulls the object down. Since the object is not moving or bouncing, these two forces must be equal but in opposite directions.

Continue writing the following text. In India, the caramels are more popular than the chocolates. People in India probably think the","completion":"caramels are a better option for various reasons. The preference for caramels over chocolates in India can be attributed to a multitude of factors, such as taste, texture, cultural influences, and historical significance. Firstly, taste plays a crucial role in the Indian palate. Indian cuisine is known for its rich flavors, with an emphasis on the use of spices, herbs, and natural ingredients. Caramels, made from sugar, butter, and cream, exhibit a blend of sweet and savory flavors which tend to resonate well with Indian taste buds. The chewy texture of caramels also offers a different mouthfeel compared to chocolates. Secondly, the distinct texture of caramels sets them apart from chocolates. Although both are confections, caramels have a soft, chewy consistency that many people in India find particularly enjoyable. Chocolates, on the other hand, typically have a smoother and more uniform texture which may not be as appealing to some individuals. This preference for the chewiness of caramels has led to the development of numerous caramel-based sweets and treats in Indian markets. Another significant factor contributing to the popularity of caramels in India is the influence of cultural and traditional practices. Caramel sweets are often used in Indian festivals and rituals as offerings to deities or shared among family and friends during celebrations. Moreover, the preparation of caramel-based sweets is deeply ingrained in Indian culinary traditions, with several regional specialties featuring variations of caramel. For instance, the famous Indian dessert 'gur' or 'jaggery,' made from concentrated sugarcane juice, bears a close resemblance to caramels in terms of taste and texture. Furthermore, the historical significance of caramels in India can also explain their prominence over chocolates. Trade routes from ancient times brought sugar to India, which eventually led to the creation of various caramel-like sweets. Unlike chocolates, which were introduced to India during the British colonization, caramels have a longer history and a stronger connection to Indian cuisine. As a result, caramels are often considered more traditional and authentic in comparison to chocolates. In addition to these factors, it is important to consider other aspects such as availability and price. Caramels, being relatively simple to produce, are widely available across India, from small village shops to large urban markets. This accessibility enhances their popularity among the Indian population. Also, in general, caramels are more affordable than chocolates, making them an attractive option for individuals who are budget-conscious or seeking a sweet treat without spending a significant amount. Lastly, health-conscious consumers in India may also lean towards caramels over chocolates due to the perceived health benefits that caramels may provide. While chocolate contains fats and sugars, it also includes cocoa, which can have positive effects on heart health and mood. However, some people may still choose caramels as they may contain fewer preservatives or artificial ingredients compared to chocolates. In conclusion, the preference for caramels over chocolates in India can be attributed to a variety of factors, such as taste, texture, cultural influences, historical significance, availability, price, and health perceptions. Ultimately, these factors contribute to the widespread popularity of caramels across the diverse landscape of India, making them a cherished sweet treat in the country."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis.

(-82*f + 42*f) can be simplified as: -82*f and 42*f are like terms because they both contain the variable 'f'. In order to combine these like terms, we add their coefficients together: -82 + 42 = -40 Now the equation becomes: -40*f = 280 Step 2: Solve for 'f' by isolating the variable. To isolate 'f', we need to get it on one side of the equation by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'f', which is -40: (-40*f) / -40 = (280) / -40 This simplifies to: f = -7 So, the solution to the equation -82*f + 42*f = 280 is f = -7."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Pretending to be happy can actually make you more miserable--especially if you're a woman, according to a new study. Researchers found that walking around with a forced smile and faking happiness simply led to people feeling gloomier. So, putting a brave face on your woes could actually be counterproductive. The research found that women suffered more than men when pretending to be happy. Psychologist, Dr. Brent Scott, who led the study, said employers should take note because forcing workers to smile when workers were dealing with clients could backfire . He said:\\"Smiling for the sake of smiling can lead to emotional exhaustion, and that's bad for the organization.\\" Dr. Scott said the research showed customer service workers who\\"faked smiles\\"throughout a day worsened their moods and then withdrew from work, so their productivity dropped. He added:\\"Bosses may think that getting their staff to smile is good for the organization, but that's not necessarily the case.\\"Dr. Scott, assistant professor of management at Michigan State University, analyzed a group of bus drivers during a two -week period. The study is one of the first of its kind to examine emotional displays over a period of time and compare the different effects that they have on men and women. His team examined the effects of\\"surface acting\\"--or fake smiling--compared to what was termed\\"deep acting\\", or cultivating positive emotions by recalling pleasant memories. Dr. Scott said: \\"Women were harmed more by'surface acting', meaning their moods worsened even more than men and they withdrew more from work. However , they were helped more by'deep acting',which meant their moods improved more.\\" Dr. Scott suggested women tended to suffer more when pretending to be happy because they were expected to be more emotionally expressive than men. Therefore, faking a smile while they are feeling down is more likely to go against their normal behavior and cause more harmful feelings.

Article: In 1959, when Jean Harper was in the third grade, her teacher gave the class an assignment to write a report on what they wanted to be when they grew up. She poured her heart into her report and expressed her dream of becoming an airline pilot. Her paper came back with an \\"F\\" on it. The teacher told her it was a \\"fairy tale\\". Jean was heartbroken and ashamed. As the years went by, Jean was beaten down by the discouragement and negativity she encountered whenever she talked about her dream. \\"Girls can't become airline pilots; never have, never will. You're crazy. That's impossible. \\"Finally Jean gave up. In her senior year of high school, her English teacher was a Mrs. Dorothy Slaton, a demanding teacher with high standards. One day Mrs. Slaton asked this question: \\"If you had unlimited finances, unlimited access to the finest schools, unlimited talents and abilities, what would you do?\\" Jean felt a rush of the old enthusiasm, and with excitement she wrote down the very old dream. The next thing that Mrs. Slaton said changed the course of Jean's life. The teacher leaned forward over her desk and said, \\"I have a little secret for you. You do have unlimited abilities and talents. When you leave school, if you don't go for your dreams, no one will do it for you. You can have what you want if you want it enough.\\" The hurt and fear of years of discouragement disappeared all of a sudden. Jean felt thrilled and told her about her dream of becoming a pilot. Mrs. Slaton slapped the desk top. \\"Then do it!\\" she said. So Jean did. It didn't happen overnight. In her l0 years of hard work, even facing varieties of laugh, frustration and opposition, she never gave up her dream. Instead, she went on doing everything her third-grade teacher said was fairy-tale. Eventually, Jean Harper became a Boeing 737 captain for the United Airline Company.

The massive storm observed by the Cassini spacecraft on Saturn is a rare phenomenon with such intensity occurring approximately once every 30 years or once every Saturn year. According to NASA scientists, these storms are few and far between, making this observation an important milestone for understanding the atmospheric processes on the gas giant. The storm, which produced an \\"unprecedented belch of energy,\\" contained a surprisingly high concentration of ethylene gas, an odorless and colorless substance that's rarely been identified in Saturn's atmosphere. The release of this gas caused a dramatic temperature rise, which astounded researchers like Brigette Hesman, the study's lead author. To provide context for the intensity of the temperature spike, Hesman compared it to a scenario on Earth in which the atmosphere shifted from the freezing winters of Fairbanks, Alaska, to the scorching summers of the Mojave Desert. Such a temperature change would have profound effects on Earth's climate, ecosystems, and inhabitants, highlighting the significance of understanding and tracking these extreme storms on Saturn. The observation and study of this extraordinary storm, enabled by the data collected by the Cassini spacecraft, provide valuable insights into the complex and dynamic nature of Saturn's atmosphere. The rarity of such events makes the knowledge gained all the more crucial for scientists seeking to understand the gas giant's weather patterns, atmospheric composition, and overall behavior. As researchers delve into the specifics of this storm and others like it, they will continue to enhance our understanding of Saturn and its place within the solar system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose neighbours tried to help douse the fire? , can you please find it? After two rainy summers in 1664 and 1665, London had lain under an exceptional drought since November 1665, and the wooden buildings were tinder-dry after the long hot summer of 1666. A fire broke out at Thomas Farriner's bakery in Pudding Lane a little after midnight on Sunday 2 September. The family was trapped upstairs but managed to climb from an upstairs window to the house next door, except for a maidservant who was too frightened to try, who became the first victim. The neighbours tried to help douse the fire; after an hour, the parish constables arrived and judged that the adjoining houses had better be demolished to prevent further spread. The householders protested, and Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth was summoned, who alone had the authority to override their wishes. When Bloodworth arrived, the flames were consuming the adjoining houses and creeping towards the paper warehouses and flammable stores on the riverfront. The more experienced firemen were clamouring for demolition, but Bloodworth refused on the grounds that most premises were rented and the owners could not be found. Bloodworth is generally thought to have been appointed to the office of Lord Mayor as a yes man, rather than by possessing requisite capabilities for the job. He panicked when faced with a sudden emergency and, when pressed, made the oft-quoted remark, \\"Pish! A woman could piss it out\\", and left. After the City had been destroyed, Samuel Pepys looked back on the events and wrote in his diary on 7 September 1666: \\"People do all the world over cry out of the simplicity [the stupidity] of my Lord Mayor in general; and more particularly in this business of the fire, laying it all upon him.\\" Pepys was a senior official in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had turned it into a conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the riverfront.

One day in autumn, when she rides her bicycle to school through the forest, she observes a hunting fox. Of course, the fox escapes, but the girl yearns to meet the animal again. She spends most of her free time in the forests trying to find the fox during the following months, but she doesn't meet the fox again until winter comes. During the winter, she follows the fox's tracks far across the fields. Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near to those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks; she is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle. The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest. When spring arrives, the girl is looking for fox holes and waits for the fox. The fox has young babies and moves holes because of her observations; therefore the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance. She finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it with meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den. Finally, the fox arrives at her house and she lets it inside, wanting to show it her bedroom. But the fox becomes distressed at not being able to find a way out and escapes by smashing through her brittle plate glass window, causing the glass to shatter. The fox is hurt badly, but survives and the girl learns that she cannot keep wild animals as pets at home as they are unpredictable and may break more things such as fragile glass windows.

Which gardener observed more improved water absorption from the soil? Two gardeners started their planting season at the same time. Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest. Hint: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

Reduce If you want to reduce waste, you should use things wisely. Millions of trees are being cut down to make paper. If everyone uses a little paper carelessly and throw it out, soon we would not have any trees left. Other things are also being wasted, and people don't know what to do with the waste in big cities. So it is necessary to reduce the waste 2. Reuse You should always think of reusing the usable things before throwing them out. Give your clothes you do not use or the ones which are too small to the poor. With a family, you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters. 3. Recycle Bottles, cans and paper can easily be recycled. By doing so, we save lots of time and money. For example, coke cans are sent to a factory, where they are smashed flat and melted and the melted things are made for new coke cans. 4. Recover When you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten apples. You have two choices: one is to throw the whole apple away, or you could cut off the rotten parts and eat the good parts. In this way, you are recovering the eatable parts of food. 5. Repair If one of the legs of your table is broken, you can repair it instead of throwing it away. If you want to change for better ones, It is better for you to sell the old things or give them to other people who can use them after doing some repair.

With the primary objective of eliminating foreign fighters entrenched within the city's confines, the battle left its mark on both the physical landscape and the lives of its citizens. As the dust settled and the dangers subsided, anxious civilians began retracing their steps back to the city they once called home, only to find a haunting presence in the rubble that remnant of the devastating conflict. The operation targeted a significant issue facing the region: the insidious threat posed by foreign fighters who had converted the city into a stronghold, disrupting the local population's livelihood and endangering their safety. As a strategic nexus between Tal Afar and the neighboring country of Syria, the area provided a crucial smuggling route that facilitated the flow of illicit goods, forces, and information, contributing to the instability of the region. As US-led forces bore down upon the city, an intense near-two-week siege ensued. In their pursuit of eliminating the enemy, the urban landscape buckled under the weight of the onslaught, with buildings crumbling to the ground, infrastructure severely damaged, and once-busy streets reduced to ghostly reminders of their former vitality. Amidst the offensive, the city's inhabitants faced an impossible choice - remain and risk their lives in the crossfire or abandon their homes in search of safety. Many chose the latter option, seeking refuge in neighboring towns and villages or joining the ranks of the displaced in overcrowded camps. Yet, as the operation drew to a close and the telltale sounds of conflict began to wane, they faced an uncertain future as they ventured home to assess the scale of devastation wreaked upon their city and rebuild their lives amidst the wreckage. The sight that greeted the returning citizens of Tal Afar was one of overwhelming destruction - familiar shops and homes transformed into heaps of rubble, once-bustling streets now eerily silent, and landmarks reduced to ruins under the ferocity of the military operation. Despite this heart-wrenching desolation, the resilient residents slowly trickled back, eager to retrieve remnants of their former lives and restore a semblance of normalcy to the shell that was once their city. As the inhabitants of Tal Afar sifted through the debris, they uncovered not only memories of loved ones and the objects that held special meaning but also a sense of hope for the future. The rubble-strewn landscape before them may have symbolized the dark consequences of war, but it also served as a canvas for their resolute spirit to rebuild, recover, and renew their community in the face of adversity. The gradual return of civilians to Tal Afar is a testament to their unwavering resilience, as they brave overwhelming odds to reclaim their lives and reconstruct their homes amidst the haunting echoes of conflict. From the ashes of a near-two-week siege, they will continue to band together, forging a brighter future from the remnants of their desolated city - a powerful reminder of the unconquerable human spirit in the face of despair."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Getting its rate of expansion right took three years to fix, but Mr Wang says the firm is now back on track. \\"It was a good path, [I] just had to persevere through it,\\" he says. While it's easy to suggest this is hubris getting its just reward, in China, this extraordinary rate of expansion - or hyper growth - is relatively common. When the Chinese government began to open up the economy in the 1980s, it rocketed from a small emerging economy to a heavyweight, growing many times faster than its western rivals. Yet as BYD demonstrates, such rapid expansion makes it hard for some companies to adapt quickly enough. \\"Once a company is in hyper growth mode it's important not to lose sight of what made the firm a success in the first place,\\" says leadership expert Steve Tappin. Victor Koo, chief executive of video-sharing giant Youku Tudou, often dubbed China's YouTube, has seen dramatic changes since it launched in 2006. Initially, its users were accessing content almost entirely on desktop computers, now more than 60% of users access content via their mobiles. To ensure its firm could react quickly enough to take advantage of the rapid changes, its philosophy used to be \\"do before we say and think before we do\\". But now, Mr Koo says, that is just not fast enough. As a result, it has shaken up its organisational structure to create \\"quick task teams\\" which work across different departments, can brainstorm ideas and come up with new ways of doing things. \\"If you overthink it or you spend too much time thinking about it the opportunity has already passed. And as you experiment [and] explore, your strategies actually formulate themselves. Don't sit still\\". For an eight-year old firm like Youku Tudou, where ways of working are less established, it can be easier to embrace a more flexible approach, but for older firms it's often harder to shake up the status quo. Online media company Sina Corporation was established 15 years ago and listed on the Nasdaq, the US technology exchange, soon after. This year it listed Weibo - its Twitter-like micro-blogging service - on the Nasdaq in a separate listing. Chairman Charles Chao says that because Weibo was part of Sina, its value and the fact that it was growing much faster than its existing businesses, had not been recognised by investors. The separate listing was aimed at addressing this. But right from the very outset, he says they tried to keep the businesses separate, because Weibo was a very different business to Sina and he didn't want the original company to hold back innovation at the new firm. \\"I don't think there's a scientific way or a bible you can follow in terms of how to run a high growth company. Our approach is that we separate, we try to create a system that more resembles start-up companies.\\" Deng Feng, chair of Northern Light Venture Capital, a Chinese venture capital firm, says ultimately what can help firms survive or even thrive in a period of rapid expansion is having the right internal culture. He started his own firm in Silicon Valley at the end of 1997 and listed it on the stock exchange just four years later. Despite its ultimate success, he said during the four years there were three occasions when it was close to collapse, due to key people leaving and because at times it had \\"no money in the bank\\". At one point it was acquired by another firm which subsequently collapsed. In the end, it managed to get out of the acquisition. \\"Head hunters tried to recruit them [the staff]. Here, the Chinese culture actually helped. The key engineers that were Chinese, they stayed together and they helped the company and we solved the problem,\\" Mr Deng says. This feature is based on interviews by leadership expert Steve Tappin for the BBC's CEO Guru series, produced by Neil Koenig.

Mandarin is the official language used in government, education, and media, and is the most widely understood language across the island. In addition to Mandarin, several other languages and dialects are spoken in Taiwan reflecting its diverse cultural and linguistic heritage. Some of these languages include: 1. Hokkien (Taiwanese): This Southern Min dialect is spoken by a significant portion of the population, especially among the older generation. Hokkien is commonly used in day-to-day conversations, popular culture, and local television programs. 2. Hakka: Spoken by the Hakka people, who are predominantly located in the northern and central parts of Taiwan, Hakka is another important regional language. 3. Formosan Indigenous Languages: There are around 16 officially recognized indigenous languages spoken by the Austronesian ethnic groups in Taiwan. These languages are protected by the government and efforts are being made to promote and revive these endangered languages. 4. English: Although not an official language, English is widely taught in schools as a foreign language and is commonly used in international business, tourism, and academia.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Question: If your joke is funny you will not experience surprise if someone does what? Options: - scare - send flowers - laugh - cries - keep secret The answer is \\"laugh\\" because A:","completion":"The answer is \\"laugh\\" because when you tell a funny joke, the primary intention and expected reaction from the listeners is amusement and laughter. This natural response aligns with the fundamental purpose of a joke - to entertain and elicit a humorous response from the audience. To better understand this answer, let's analyze the given options: 1. Scare: Being scared is a reaction associated with fear, anxiety, or an alarming experience. It is not related to the sharing of a joke. Thus, if someone were scared as a result of a joke, it would be considered a surprising reaction, as it is detached from the desired outcome of humor. 2. Send flowers: Sending flowers is a kind and thoughtful gesture generally associated with appreciation, congratulatory messages, or condolences. It is not a reaction that directly pertains to humor. While receiving flowers after telling a joke may come as a form of apperception, it could also be seen as an unexpected response when compared to laughter. 3. Laugh: Laughter is the anticipated response when a joke is thought of as funny. It is a natural reaction to humor and comedy, showcasing an individual's understanding and appreciation of the joke. Consequently, if your joke is funny, you will not be taken aback if someone laughs, as it stands in line with the expected outcome of telling the joke. 4. Cries: Crying is typically an emotional response to sadness, pain, or overwhelming feelings. It is not a usual reaction to a funny joke, as it does not align with the intended purpose of humor. Should someone cry in reaction to a joke, it would be considered a surprising response, as it does not correspond to the standard outcome of laughter. 5. Keep secret: Keeping a secret implies withholding information or not sharing it with others. It is not a direct response to the humor of a joke. If a person decides to keep the joke a secret, it does not indicate whether they found it funny or not. Hence, this reaction does not give a clear indication of the success of the joke and could be seen as unexpected. In conclusion, the answer \\"laugh\\" best corresponds with what you would expect if your joke is funny. It is the most appropriate and anticipated reaction, indicating that your joke has successfully entertained the listener. Other options, such as scare, send flowers, cries, and keep secret, are not directly related to humor and can be considered surprising reactions to a funny joke."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Brad and Frank are two cousins. they both own land in the same county. Frank's parcel is a pine forest, while Brad's is a nice dry grassland with wild flowers and a few shrubs. Which parcel has thinner hummus layers? Answer:","completion":"Brad's parcel, which is a dry grassland with wildflowers and a few shrubs, has thinner humus layers compared to Frank's pine forest parcel. This is because forests generally have well-developed soil with thick humus layers, resulting from a higher rate of organic matter accumulation and a slower rate of decomposition. In contrast, grasslands tend to have thinner humus layers as they have less organic matter accumulation and faster decomposition rates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm a college student, nineteen years old when this happened. One day on campus, while waiting for my next class to start, a guy walks up to me. He asks if I know where the professors' offices are located for this building. I do, but it's hard to explain how to find them (there's a small staircase that's easy to miss and leads down to the basement where they're located) so I tell him that I'll just walk him over there. It's maybe a two minute walk maximum, and we make small talk about our majors. I lead him down the stairs to the basement and he thanks me. Thinking I've done my job, I turn around to go back upstairs. But then he says \\"Hey, I have to be honest with you. I think you're incredibly beautiful and I asked for your help because I wanted to talk to you.\\" I was kind of weirded out. I don't know if he meant he made up the story about needing help just to talk to me, or if he needed help but picked me to ask because he thought I was pretty. I've literally never had a guy come onto me like this, and I don't find myself to be 'incredibly beautiful' so I'm awkwardly like \\"oh my god, ha ha, thanks.\\" I start walking towards the stairs again. Then he's like, \\"I have to ask, do you have a boyfriend?\\" At this point I'm genuinely confused. Maybe it's because I lack experience with guys and this is more normal than I think, but to be asked that after a bit of small talk and nothing else seemed weird. He never even asked for my name. Under other circumstances I may have been flattered, he seemed like an interesting guy, but the way he went about this so suddenly is what made me uncomfortable. So, I have to admit, I lied to him. I tell him I have a girlfriend. He takes it well and tells me she's very lucky to have me. I awkwardly thank him again, hoping we're truly done now. Then he asks me for my number. This is where I think I become the asshole. I felt weird being asked out by a stranger in a secluded basement, especially when I just told him I'm seeing someone. I'm like, \\"Well I'm not going to date you...\\" He says it's fine, that he just wants it 'in case he ever needs help again.' I relent, wanting to just call this exchange done. I gave him my number. When I turn around he tells me, \\"bye, beautiful.\\" I ended up going to a different area of campus to wait at. It's been over a month, and I've never gotten a text from him. It's fine, I don't really want to talk to him again, but I'm worried I was an asshole and he just accepted my number because he didn't want to tell me he no longer wanted it. When I tell people this story, there's two main reactions. The first being that, yeah, I might have been rude, but that this dude was creepy and didn't need to push so hard to get my number. The second being that I should have just directly told him no or given him my number without telling him that I wouldn't date him. Some people also think that me lying about having a girlfriend wasn't necessary, but I did it specifically so that he wouldn't ask me out, not thinking he would ask for my number afterwards.

Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (often simply referred to as Laugh-In) is an American sketch comedy television program that ran for 140 episodes from January 22, 1968, to March 12, 1973, on the NBC television network. It was hosted by comedians Dan Rowan and Dick Martin. Laugh-In originally aired as a one-time special on September 9, 1967, and was such a success that it was brought back as a series, replacing The Man from U.N.C.L.E. on Mondays at 8 pm (ET). The title of the show was a play on the \\"love-ins\\" or \\"be-ins\\" of the 1960s hippie culture, terms that were, in turn, derived from \\"sit-ins\\", common in protests associated with civil rights and antiwar demonstrations of the time. The first season featured some of the first music videos seen on network TV, with cast members appearing in films set to the music of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the Bee Gees, the Temptations, the Strawberry Alarm Clock, and the First Edition. During the September 16, 1968, episode, Richard Nixon, running for president, appeared for a few seconds with a disbelieving vocal inflection, asking \\"Sock it to me?\\" Nixon was not doused or assaulted. An invitation was extended to Nixon's opponent, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, but he declined. According to George Schlatter, the show's creator, \\"Humphrey later said that not doing it may have cost him the election\\", and \\"[Nixon] said the rest of his life that appearing on Laugh-In is what got him elected. And I believe that. And I've had to live with that.\\" In an episode of the ill-fated 1977 revival, a Nixon impersonator says \\"I invited the American people to sock-it-to-me.... you can stop now\\". On multiple occasions, producer George Schlatter attempted to get William F. Buckley Jr. to appear on the show, only to be refused each time until he suddenly agreed to an appearance. In the episode that aired December 28, 1970, Buckley appeared in an unusual sit-down segment (portions of which were scattered throughout the episode) flanked by Rowan and Martin and fielding questions from the cast (which included Lily Tomlin doing her Fast Talker shtick) and giving humorous answers to each. Near the end, when Rowan asked Buckley why he finally agreed to appear on the show, Buckley explained that Schlatter had written him \\"an irresistable letter\\" in which he promised to fly Buckley out to California \\"in an airplane with two right wings\\". At the end, Rowan thanked him for appearing, noting that \\"you can't be that smart without having a sense of humor, and you have a delightful one\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Were other famous people on?","completion":"Yes, other famous people were on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In.

What most naturally follows? How to create a wellness plan Assess your current physical wellness. Physical wellness encompasses nutrition and physical fitness. Physical wellness also includes your medical wellness.","completion":"Creating a wellness plan begins by assessing your current physical state. This involves looking at several aspects including nutrition, physical fitness, and medical wellness. A. Nutrition Wellness: This means evaluating your eating habits to understand whether or not you are feeding your body with the right amount and types of nutrients. Here are some suggestions for how you might conduct your nutrition wellness assessment: 1. Keep a food diary: By writing down what you eat and drink for a week, you can identify patterns in your eating habits. From these patterns, you can recognize what types of foods you may be overeating or under-eating, at what times, and under what circumstances (like stress). 2. Analyze your food diary: Look for ways to replace unhealthy foods with healthier alternatives. For example, swap out processed foods with whole foods, and sugary drinks with water or herbal teas. 3. Consult with a registered dietitian or nutritionist: Nutrition can be complex, and what works for one person may not work for another, so getting advice from an expert can help you to create a more tailored and effective nutrition plan. B. Physical Fitness: This refers to your exercise habits. Here are some ways to assess your current state: 1. Check your exercise frequency: As a guideline, it's recommended that adults have at least 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week. 2. Assess your exercise intensity: This depends on your fitness goals. If you want to lose weight, you may need higher-intensity workouts, whereas if you're new to exercise, you might start with low-intensity activities. 3. Get a fitness evaluation: A certified trainer can measure your strength, flexibility, and endurance to help provide a more comprehensive understanding of your physical fitness. C. Medical Wellness: This refers to managing chronic conditions and staying updated with preventive screenings and vaccines. Here's how you might evaluate your medical wellness: 1. Regular Check-ups: Having regular medical, dental, and eye check-ups can help ensure that your body is in good condition and any potential issues are spotted early. 2. Know your family history: It's important to be aware of any health conditions that run in your family, and to get appropriate screenings and preventative measures if needed. 3. Mental Health: This is equally as important as physical health. Excessive stress or feelings of depression can have serious impacts on overall health, so it's important to also seek professional help if you are feeling psychologically or emotionally unwell. Once you've assessed these elements, the next step in your wellness plan would be setting realistic and achievable goals. It's important to remember that change doesn't happen overnight but comes with consistent habits. Keep track of your progress, acknowledge your achievements along the way, and adjust your wellness plan as needed. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if you fall off track occasionally; what's important is picking back up and continuing your wellness journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These benefits, in spite of the difficulty of surgery, make getting your kitten fixed worth the discomfort it may experience. For example, spayed cats will not suffer from ovarian or uterine cancer, or uterine infections, later in life. Getting a kitten spayed or neutered doesn't just affect the cat. It also can have a positive impact on you and your family. For example, spaying and neutering your kitten will eliminate the chances of an accidental pregnancy, which in turn will eliminate the chances of you having to deal with a litter of additional kittens. Spayed and neutered cats are also less likely to fight. This means that in a multi-cat household, female cats that are spayed are more likely to get along and male cats are likely to be less aggressive and less territorial. For male cats, this means they are less likely to spray in your home to mark their territory. Stopping your kitten from reproducing in the future helps to limit the pet population overall. Fewer cats that are capable of reproduction means that fewer cats can be produced overall. Also, if you are debating whether or not to have your kitten fixed, just remember that any kittens your kitten has in the future will take homes away from cats that live in shelters and that don't have families. In many cases, these cats are even put down due to a lack of space and resources.","completion":"This article highlights the numerous health benefits of spaying or neutering your kitten, which, despite the challenges of surgery, make the procedure worth the potential discomfort for the cat. One primary advantage for spayed cats is the prevention of ovarian or uterine cancer and uterine infections later in their life. Moreover, spaying or neutering a kitten not only affects the cat's health but also has a positive impact on you and your family. Spaying and neutering significantly reduce the risk of accidental pregnancies, thus avoiding the responsibility of extra kittens to care for. Furthermore, cats that have undergone these procedures exhibit a decrease in aggressive behavior and are less likely to engage in fights, especially in a multi-cat household. Female cats tend to get along better while male cats become less aggressive and territorial. This change in behavior directly translates to male cats being less likely to spray in the house as a territorial marker. In addition to these benefits, spaying and neutering your kitten contribute to reducing the overall pet population. Limiting the number of cats capable of reproduction leads to fewer cats being born, which in turn positively impacts rescue operations and shelters for cats. This is important to consider as kittens born from your cat may inadvertently take potential homes away from shelter cats in need. Unfortunately, an excess of cats in shelters sometimes results in cats being euthanized due to a lack of space and resources. Thus, getting your kitten spayed or neutered is not only advantageous for your pet’s health and your household but also helps address the ongoing issue of overpopulation affecting shelters and rescue centers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Joseph and Mary lived with their son Joseph, Jr. and his family in a small house while theirs was being built. Mary Priestley was primarily responsible for the design of the couple's new home and her family inheritance may have helped finance it, but she died before it was completed. By 1797, Joseph's laboratory was completed—the first part of the home to be finished. It was the first laboratory that \\"he had designed, built, and outfitted entirely himself\\" and was probably the first \\"scientifically-equipped laboratory\\" in the United States. Joseph continued his scientific and scholarly work in his new laboratory, identifying carbon monoxide (which he called \\"heavy inflammable air\\"). In 1798 Joseph Jr., his wife, and their children moved into the new house with Joseph Priestley. The house also held Priestley's library, which contained about 1600 volumes by his death in 1804 and was one of the largest in America at the time. The Priestley family held Unitarian church services in the drawing room and Joseph educated a group of young men until the local Northumberland Academy that he helped found was completed.The house proper was completed in 1798, with a Mr. Jones of Northumberland employed acting as master carpenter. Built in an 18th-century Georgian style, the \\"balance and symmetry\\" of the architecture signaled \\"subdued elegance\\".

With Dave, a lot of it is psychological. I'll guide him in, and coerce and nurture him, and when the time is right I suppose I'll even shout at him again.\\" When asked about a possible reunion in an interview that year, Avory stated, \\"A reunion would not be possible with the originals, for a start due to ill health. But it would be possible with the Kast Off Kinks plus Ray. In any event Ray would record new material. We have some old tracks from the 80s as well.\\" In March 2010, Avory reported that the band were planning on releasing an album of unreleased and new material.

Options: a ) 45 , b ) 35 , c ) 40 , d ) 50 , e ) 48 A:","completion":"To find the answer, let's follow the instructions step-by-step: Step 1: Calculate the cost price per article in the first scenario: Let the cost price per article be \\"x\\". As the man gains 20% on selling 20 articles for 60, we can write the equation: 20x + 20% of 20x = 60 Step 2: Solve for x (cost price per article in the first scenario): 20x + 0.20 * 20x = 60 20x (1 + 0.20) = 60 20x * 1.2 = 60 24x = 60 x = 60 / 24 x = 2.5 (cost price per article for the initial scenario) Step 3: Calculate the cost price of the second scenario with a 20% loss: Now, we need to find how many articles he must sell for 70 to incur a 20% loss. We will assume he sells \\"y\\" articles for this purpose. With a 20% loss, the cost price per article for the second scenario can be written as: 2.5 - 20% of 2.5 = 2.5 - 0.5 = 2 (cost price per article in the second scenario) Step 4: Write the equation for the second scenario: y articles * (cost price per article in the second scenario) = 70 y * 2 = 70 Step 5: Solve the equation for y (number of articles to be sold in the second scenario): y = 70 / 2 y = 35 So, the man should sell 35 articles for 70 to incur a 20% loss.

Please answer this question: Name the American 'godfather of rap' who died in May 2011, noted especially for his 1970 poem-song 'The Revolution Will Not Be Televised',?","completion":"The American 'godfather of rap' who died in May 2011 and is noted especially for his 1970 poem-song 'The Revolution Will Not Be Televised' is Gil Scott-Heron. Born on April 1, 1949, in Chicago, Illinois, Gil Scott-Heron was a renowned musician, poet, and activist. He is often credited with being one of the most influential figures in the development of hip-hop and rap music. Gil Scott-Heron's unique style combined spoken word, poetry, jazz, blues, and soul music to create a distinctive sound that resonated with listeners and inspired future generations of artists. Many contemporary rappers and musicians have cited Scott-Heron as one of their primary influences, including the likes of Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, and Common. In 1970, Scott-Heron released his groundbreaking poem-song, 'The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,' which has since become an iconic piece of protest literature and an anthem synonymous with countercultural movements of that era. The title phrase has been widely referenced and parodied by many activists, artists, and writers since its inception. The poem-song included powerful social commentary on race, politics, media, and consumer culture in America at that time. Through his poetic verses, he encouraged listeners to take action and stand up against injustice, rather than passively consume the messages being fed to them by the media and the government. In addition to 'The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,' Scott-Heron produced numerous other acclaimed works, including the albums 'Pieces of a Man' (1971), 'Free Will' (1972), and 'Winter in America' (1974), and the single 'Johannesburg' (1975), which focused on the apartheid regime in South Africa. His work consistently promoted social change and provided a voice for marginalized communities in America and beyond. Throughout Scott-Heron's career, he struggled with personal issues and addiction, leading to intermittent periods of creative productivity and personal setbacks. Despite these challenges, his influence on generations of musicians and socially conscious artists remains profound. Gil Scott-Heron passed away on May 27, 2011, at the age of 62, but his legacy as the 'godfather of rap' and his contributions to music, poetry, and activism continue to endure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Despite the campaigns between 1590 and 1592, Henry IV was \\"no closer to capturing Paris\\". Realising that Henry III had been right and that there was no prospect of a Protestant king succeeding in resolutely Catholic Paris, Henry agreed to convert, reputedly stating \\"Paris vaut bien une messe\\" . He was formally received into the Catholic Church in 1593, and was crowned at Chartres in 1594 as League members maintained control of the Cathedral of Rheims, and, sceptical of Henry's sincerity, continued to oppose him. He was finally received into Paris in March 1594, and 120 League members in the city who refused to submit were banished from the capital. Paris' capitulation encouraged the same of many other towns, while others returned to support the crown after Pope Clement VIII absolved Henry, revoking his excommunication in return for the publishing of the Tridentine Decrees, the restoration of Catholicism in Béarn, and appointing only Catholics to high office. Evidently Henry's conversion worried Protestant nobles, many of whom had, until then, hoped to win not just concessions but a complete reformation of the French Church, and their acceptance of Henry was by no means a foregone conclusion.

More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable. It was fiscal suicide. The hospital was perfectly willing to let the local experts in deadbeats handle the workload. Tonight, Ray could tell them no.

Given these facts, how does urine leave the body among the following options: - metabolic reaction - through the small intestines - Transfers energy - an area swollen with pus - To another location like underground - through the urinary system - through the anus - through the body The answer to this question is:","completion":"through the urinary system. Urine is produced as a result of the filtration of blood by the kidneys, which are two bean-shaped organs in the body. The kidneys play a vital role in maintaining overall health by filtering waste products, excess water, and other impurities from the blood, forming urine. This process, called filtration, occurs in microscopic units called nephrons, which are in the millions within each kidney. The nephrons filter blood through a two-step process. First, the blood enters a small network of capillaries called a glomerulus, where the blood pressure pushes water, salts, small molecules, and waste products through a membrane into a capsule-like structure called a glomerular capsule. Larger molecules, like blood cells and proteins, remain in the blood and do not pass through the membrane. The liquid that is filtered into the glomerular capsule is called filtrate. Next, the filtrate moves through a complex tubular system within the nephron, called renal tubules, where waste products are collected, and essential substances are reabsorbed back into the blood. The remaining filtrate, now called urine, contains water, waste products, and excess substances that the body needs to expel. The urine then flows from the nephrons into a series of collecting ducts, which then converge to form minor calyces, which combine to form major calyces, and ultimately unite to form a hollow, funnel-shaped structure called the renal pelvis. From the renal pelvis, the urine flows into the ureters, two muscular tubes that transport urine from each of the kidneys to the urinary bladder, a muscular sac that stores the urine. When a person needs to urinate, the bladder muscle contracts, and the sphincter muscles surrounding the urethra (a tube that connects the bladder to the exterior of the body) relax, allowing urine to flow out of the body through the urethra. This coordinated mechanism is controlled by the nervous system and is known as the micturition reflex. In summary, urine leaves the body through the urinary system, which comprises the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. This process is essential for maintaining the body's water and electrolyte balance and for removing waste products and excess substances from the blood."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Please answer the following question: Question: where do you find iodine I found the following answer on Google: Like the other halogens , free iodine occurs mainly as a diatomic molecule I2, and then only momentarily after being oxidized from iodide by an oxidant like free oxygen. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"Yes, the provided answer is partially correct, but it requires a more comprehensive explanation. Iodine is an essential element for humans, and it is vital for proper thyroid function. It can be found in various sources, both in its free elemental form (as a diatomic molecule I2) and in the form of iodide (I-) that can be oxidized to iodine by an oxidant like free oxygen. Here are the main sources of iodine: 1. Natural Sources: Iodine is naturally present in the environment, specifically in the earth's crust and oceans. Seawater contains iodide, which can be transformed into free iodine. Algae and seaweed (such as kelp and nori) concentrate iodine from the ocean, making them rich sources of this element. Similarly, soil can contain trace amounts of iodine, which can transfer to plants grown in it. However, the soil content of iodine can vary greatly, depending on the geographical location. 2. Food Sources: Some common dietary sources of iodine are fish, shellfish, dairy products, and iodized salt. Saltwater fish like cod and haddock, as well as shellfish like shrimp, oysters, and clams, are good sources due to their marine origin. Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese also contain iodine, as cows consume iodine-rich feed or feed supplements. Iodized salt is another major source of iodine, as it is artificially fortified to ensure adequate intake of this essential element. 3. Supplements: Iodine supplements are available in various forms, such as potassium iodide, potassium iodate, and kelp-based supplements. These can be used to prevent or treat iodine deficiency in situations where dietary intake is not sufficient or when people live in regions with iodine-poor soil. 4. Medicines and Topical Applications: Iodine can also be found in certain medicines and antiseptics, like Povidone-iodine (Betadine). It is an effective disinfectant and is used in healthcare settings for wound cleansing and surgery preparation. In conclusion, iodine can be found in various natural and dietary sources, as well as supplements and medical applications. The mentioned answer referring to the diatomic molecule I2 is correct, but it only represents one aspect of where iodine can be found.

You are presented with the question \\"What swims from male to female reproductive organs in fertilization?\\" and the following answer choices: - ovaries - barnacles - fur seals - eggs - gastropod shells - male gametes - kinetic energy - female gametes Now knowing that sperm had to swim from male to female reproductive organs for fertilization and gametes in males are called sperm, and in women commonly referred to as eggs, choose the best answer. The answer to this question is:","completion":"male gametes. Fertilization is the process by which male and female reproductive cells, or gametes, fuse to form a new individual with a unique combination of genetic material. In order for fertilization to occur, sperm (male gametes) must be transferred from the male's reproductive system to the female's reproductive system. This process often involves the sperm \\"swimming\\" from the male's reproductive organs to the female's reproductive organs. Let's examine the other answer choices to understand why male gametes are the best answer: 1. Ovaries: Ovaries are female reproductive organs that produce eggs (female gametes) and sex hormones. They do not swim and are not involved in the actual process of fertilization. 2. Barnacles: Barnacles are marine invertebrates, not involved in the fertilization process of humans or mammals. 3. Fur seals: Fur seals are marine mammals, and as a whole animal species, they do not swim from male to female reproductive organs in fertilization. 4. Eggs: As mentioned earlier, eggs are female gametes and play a crucial role in fertilization. However, they do not swim from male to female reproductive organs; the sperm swims towards them instead. 5. Gastropod shells: Gastropod shells are hard, protective structures made by certain types of mollusks, and have no relation to human reproduction or fertilization. 6. Kinetic energy: Kinetic energy is the energy of an object in motion. While it may indirectly power the swimming movement of sperm, it is not the actual entity swimming between male and female reproductive organs in fertilization. 7. Female gametes: Female gametes, or eggs, wait in the fallopian tubes for the sperm to swim to them; they do not swim from male to female reproductive organs. Overall, male gametes (sperm) are the best answer to the question because they are responsible for swimming from male to female reproductive organs in order to achieve fertilization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

The eldest son (Hunter McCracken none SAG) of two characters (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain) witnesses the loss of innocence.The movie, which exists as a metaphysical meditation and a lyrical poem, focuses at a microcosmic level on the story of Jack, a jaded, middle aged man (played by Sean Penn) scarred by the memories of an oppressive upbringing by his father (Brad Pitt), as well as the untimely death of his younger brother.We trace the evolution of an eleven-year-old boy in the Midwest, Jack, one of three brothers. At first all seems marvelous to the child. He sees as his mother does, with the eyes of his soul. She represents the way of love and mercy, where the father tries to teach his son the world's way, of putting oneself first. Each parent contends for his allegiance, and Jack must reconcile their claims. The picture darkens as he has his first glimpses of sickness, suffering and death. The world, once a thing of glory, becomes a labyrinth.Framing this story is that of adult Jack, a lost soul in a modern world, seeking to discover amid the changing scenes of time that which does not change: the eternal scheme of which we are a part. When he sees all that has gone into our world's preparation, each thing appears a miracle precious, incomparable. Jack, with his new understanding, is able to forgive his father and take his first steps on the path of life.The story ends in hope, acknowledging the beauty and joy in all things, in the everyday and above all in the family -- our first school -- the only place that most of us learn the truth about the world and ourselves, or discover life's single most important lesson, of unselfish love.

Which will have the strongest gravity? (A) Sun (B) Black hole A:","completion":"B) Black hole Though a black hole is smaller in size than the Sun, it will have the strongest gravity due to its higher mass and density. Black holes are formed from the remnants of massive stars that have collapsed under their own gravity. The intense gravitational pull in a black hole concentrates a large amount of mass into a significantly smaller space, creating a region of space where the gravitational force is so strong that even light cannot escape. In comparison, the Sun's gravity, while strong enough to keep the planets in our solar system in orbit, is much weaker than the gravitational force of a typical black hole. Despite its larger size, the Sun's mass is distributed over a much greater area, resulting in a lower overall density."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Are You Eating Frankenfish? THIS month, Congress may decide whether consumers are smart enough to be trusted with their own food choices. Some lawmakers are trying to insert language into must-pass spending legislation that would block states from giving consumers the right to know whether their food contains genetically modified ingredients. Nine out of 10 Americans want G.M.O. disclosure on food packages, according to a 2013 New York Times poll, just like consumers in 64 other nations. But powerful members of the agriculture and appropriations committees, along with their allies in agribusiness corporations like Monsanto, want to keep consumers in the dark. That’s why opponents of this effort have called it the DARK Act — or the Deny Americans the Right to Know Act. As a chef, I’m proud of the food I serve. The idea that I would try to hide what’s in my food from my customers offends everything I believe in. It’s also really bad for business. Why, then, have companies like Kellogg and groups like the Grocery Manufacturers Association spent millions in recent years to lobby against transparency? They say, in effect: “Trust us, folks. We looked into it. G.M.O. ingredients are safe.” But what they’re missing is that consumers want to make their own judgments. Consumers are saying: “Trust me. Let me do my own homework and make my own choices.” In fact, some of us have done our homework, and here’s what we found: The use of G.M.O.s has led to unintended consequences. For instance, most G.M.O. crops are engineered to withstand blasts of a powerful weed killer that the World Health Organization has decided probably causes cancer. New “superweeds” are appearing that require even more lethal formulations. Since the introduction of G.M.O. crops, use of these chemicals has increased 16-fold. G.M.O. advocates like to label anyone who objects “anti-science.” It’s true that genetic technology has had an amazing impact on the development of medicine and the eradication of infectious diseases. If G.M.O. foods were actually providing a clear benefit to the public, like improved nutrition, lower costs or better taste, without creating a spiral of ever-increasing toxicity in our environment, I’d be all for them. And if G.M.O.s ever deliver on their promise to improve food security, which they have yet to do in the more than 20 years since they were introduced, I’d be over the moon. Vermont recently passed a law requiring the labeling of these foods. Other states are considering doing the same. That’s the impetus behind this backdoor effort: Opponents want Congress to pre-empt Vermont and other like-minded states from implementing these rules. The federal government already requires labeling of ingredients and basic nutritional information and regulates against marketing that misleads the public. In this context, labeling G.M.O.s makes sense. But that’s not what is happening. Consider the situation of genetically engineered salmon. Last month the Food and Drug Administration approved for sale to the public the first genetically engineered animal approved for human consumption — a fish they are calling the AquAdvantage salmon. This “super” salmon was conceived by combining genes from Chinook salmon that produce extra growth hormone with an “antifreeze” gene from a bottom-feeder, the non-Kosher ocean pout. The result is a fish that grows far faster and larger than non-engineered salmon. The F.D.A. insists the transgenic fish is safe for humans, but many experts believe they have yet to prove AquAdvantage will be safe for the environment or other fish. Factory fish farms depend on the use of antibiotics and pesticides to control disease and parasites that flourish in high-density environments. The waste they release can decimate other marine life and contaminate the water supply. Farmed fish often escape into larger waters, endangering native species. While these new salmon will be sterile, mistakes can happen. Fine, you say. Enough already. If you don’t like the Frankenfish, don’t buy it. But there’s the rub. This new engineered fish could be marketed as … Atlantic salmon. There might be no way for consumers to identify it as genetically engineered. Consumers have a right to seek out food produced in accordance with their values, and not be misled by an industry’s strenuous efforts to keep them in the dark. When G.M.O. ingredients are clearly labeled, consumers can exercise those rights. Blocking the labeling of G.M.O. foods would be a step in the wrong direction, away from greater accountability and responsibility. Congress should reject these efforts to block our right to know. A version of this op-ed appears in print on December 15, 2015, on page A35 of the New York edition with the headline: Are You Eating Frankenfish?. Today's Paper|Subscribe","completion":"This news article is about whether people should be told if their food has genetically modified (G.M.O.) ingredients in it. Many people in America want labels on food packages to say if they have G.M.O. ingredients, just like in many other countries. Some big companies don't want to put these labels on their food. They say that G.M.O. ingredients are safe to eat and that people should trust them. But many people want to decide for themselves if they want to eat G.M.O. foods or not. The article talks about a new type of salmon that has been genetically changed to grow bigger and faster, but some people are worried that this new fish might not be good for the environment or for other fish. The problem is that people might not know if they are buying or eating this new type of salmon because it may not have a special label. The writer of this article believes that people have the right to know if they are eating G.M.O. foods and that it's important for food to have labels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There was a lot of fear in Erin's heart and not Cynthia's because Choices: -- Erin was a fearless person. -- Cynthia was a fearless person.","completion":"There was a lot of fear in Erin's heart and not Cynthia's because Cynthia was a fearless person. Let's break down the two given choices and explain why the latter one is more appropriate as an ending. 1. If we were to end the sentence with \\"Erin was a fearless person\\", it would create a contradiction of ideas within the sentence. Since the first part of the sentence ('There was a lot of fear in Erin's heart') is conveying that Erin is afraid, saying she is fearless in the second part of the sentence doesn't make logical sense. Fearlessness is the absence of fear, and the initial statement demonstrates that Erin does indeed have fear. 2. The second choice, \\"Cynthia was a fearless person\\", is more fitting in this context as it directly contrasts Erin's fearful nature that was mentioned earlier. By explaining that Cynthia did not have fear because she was fearless, the sentence communicates a complete idea that is powerful and evokes a sense of understanding in the reader. The choice of contrasting the fear in Erin's heart with Cynthia's fearlessness allows the audience to infer that the two individuals might face similar situations or challenges but have different ways of handling them due to their distinct emotions and inherent qualities. In summary, the sentence ends with \\"Cynthia was a fearless person\\" as it best captures the contrast between the two characters, Erin and Cynthia, and provides a logical explanation for their differing emotional states. This choice supports the notion that even when people experience similar circumstances, their responses and emotional reactions can vary significantly based on their individual personalities and strengths."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Another \\"Black Ace\\" victim. The killer sends his victims a Black Ace card, warning them they are to die and then kills them, his way of taunting the police. Neil Broderick, an author, intends writing a book about him and is on his way to see Thornton Drake to get more information about him. Austin Winters is his secretary and Neil met his daughter Martha on the train, on the way to Chicago. Drake has just received a Black Ace, with the words: \\"At seven tomorrow night\\", the time he is to be killed. Two plainclothes cops arrive from police headquarters, having had a call, Clancy and Dugan (both incompetents). Martha suggests that they leave for Drake's Louisiana plantation tomorrow morning and be far away from there at seven tomorrow night. Drake agrees and suggests they all go. On the flight, the lights go off for some seconds and when they come on again, Austin Winters is dead without a mark on him. At the plantation, Clancy ineptly questions the suspects till Neil points out that they are now in another state, so out of their jurisdiction. Neil goes to another room and makes a phone call, then signals to someone outside. After he finishes his call, the line is cut. Meanwhile one of the pilots has taken off in the plane, leaving the other pilot, Henderson, behind who claims he does not know anything though he was out of the cockpit when Winters was killed. The coroner finds a letter on the dead man which is to be read if Winters dies. It will reveal the identity of the Black Ace. Clancy starts reading it aloud and unsurprisingly the lights go off and the letter has vanished when the lights are turned on again. People locked in their rooms that night and Neil has a hidden car outside signal to him. A:","completion":"Neil Broderick is writing a book about the mysterious and notorious killer known as the \\"Black Ace.\\" This elusive murderer taunts the police and his victims by sending them a black ace of spades card as a warning of their impending death. The killer has gained notoriety for his cryptic and brutal murders, making him an intriguing subject for an author like Neil Broderick who wants to explore and understand the mind and actions of such a criminal. Neil is on a journey to gather more information about the enigmatic killer by visiting Thornton Drake, who is another victim that recently received the chilling Black Ace card. This card came with a specified time of when Drake would be killed, which makes the situation increasingly urgent. Along the way, Neil meets Martha, the daughter of Austin Winters, his secretary. They all eventually decide to leave for Drake's Louisiana plantation in an attempt to evade the killer's threat. However, their plan does not go smoothly as Austin Winters is found dead on the flight, apparently killed by the Black Ace without leaving a trace. Upon arriving at the plantation, Clancy and Dugan, two plainclothes policemen, prove to be incompetent in handling the case. Despite the increasing tension and danger, Neil continues his investigation and makes a secretive phone call, possibly to gather more clues or assistance. The rapidly evolving situation sees a number of suspicious activities taking place, including one of the airplane pilots disappearing under mysterious circumstances. The presence of a hidden car and secret signals further complicate the case, indicating that more secrets are yet to be revealed. As Neil Broderick wades deeper into the complex web of deceit and lies surrounding the Black Ace and his victims, his book promises to become a gripping, suspenseful, and detailed account of the elusive murderer and his dark world. Neil's tireless pursuit of information about the killer is driven by his determination to expose the true identity of the Black Ace and unravel the motivations behind his deadly actions.

Question: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Are the French starting to realize that the US makes great wine? Araujo Estate Wines, in Calistoga, Calif., is a fabulous cult winery that produces about 2,000 cases of cabernet sauvignon annually. In July it was announced that it had been sold to the family of French businessman Francois Pinault through their Artemis Group holding company. This a huge deal. Why? Because the French are still so hesitant to admit the U.S. is making great wine. Even after the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, a.k.a. Judgment of Paris. (Watch Bottle Shock here if you don’t know what I’m talking about, to get a pretty good recap of what happened). In a nutshell, it was a wine competition organized in Paris on May 24, 1976 by Steven Spurrier, a British wine merchant. He gathered famous French judges and carried out two blind tastings: one of Chardonnays and another of reds (Bordeaux wines from France and Cabernet Sauvignon wines from California). And shocker! A California wine rated best in each category, which blew the minds of the French because the France was generally regarded as being the foremost producer of the world's best wines. Still, we didn’t get much respect. Then in 1979, came the famous Opus One -- the result of a wine collaboration between the Robert Mondavi’s son Timothy in Oakville, Calif. and Bordeaux's Château Mouton Rothschild winemaker Lucien Sionneau. But then there wasn’t much collaboration after that --until now. The Araujo Estate, founded 23 years ago, is one of Napa Valley’s elite Cabernet Sauvignon producers. The price of the sale to the Artemis Group purchase was not disclosed, but is likely to have been at least 300,000 per acre, says James Molesworth, senior editor at Wine Spectator magazine. The sale included the Eisele Vineyard, 38 acres of vines, the winery and existing stocks. The good news is that the current Araujo staff—including the winemaking team led by Françoise Peschon—will remain with the estate under its new ownership. So are the French starting to realize that not only do does the U.S. make great wine, but it's actually a much better place to do business? One reason why we haven't seen more sales like this is because buying and selling a winery has to pass a lot of rules in France, says Molesworth. He says that Francois Pinault had the cash flow to bypass those stringent rules, not everyone does. So will we see more of this? I say yes. Our wine is that good. What do you think? Cent’ Anni.","completion":"The article discusses the French recognition of the quality of U.S. wines, stemming from the purchase of Araujo Estate Wines in California by the family of French businessman Francois Pinault through their Artemis Group holding company. Araujo Estate Wines is a cult winery producing around 2,000 cases of cabernet sauvignon annually, and its acquisition implies that the French are acknowledging the quality of American wines. Even after the 1976 Paris Wine Tasting, known as the Judgment of Paris, where California wines rated best in each category, French hesitancy to admit U.S. wine excellence continued. The sale of Araujo Estate Wines, including the Eisele Vineyard, winery, and existing stocks, suggests that the French may be starting to recognize not only the quality of U.S. wines but also the favorable business climate for wineries in America. The article points out that strict regulations in France make buying and selling a winery more challenging, and Francois Pinault's cash flow allowed him to bypass these stringent rules.

Here's a question: If I wanted to get some oxygen, what will I get it from? Here are possible answers to this question: - the sky - air - earth - space shuttle - water I believe the correct choice is \\"air\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"You are correct that \\"air\\" is the primary source from which you can obtain oxygen. Here's a more detailed explanation to support this answer: 1. The sky: While the sky is where we typically \\"see\\" the air, it is not a direct source of oxygen. Rather, the sky is the visible part of the Earth's atmosphere, which contains the air we breathe. So, the sky and air are interrelated, but the air is the correct answer. 2. Air: This is the correct answer because air is a mixture of various gases, including oxygen. We breathe in air and our lungs extract the oxygen from it to transport it throughout our bodies. Approximately 21% of Earth's atmosphere is composed of oxygen, making it an essential and accessible source of oxygen for humans and organisms. 3. Earth: While oxygen is a primary component of our planet's crust, it isn't a direct source of the gas we need to breathe. Oxygen found in the Earth's crust mostly exists as oxide minerals, combined with other elements. It is not in the gas form we need to sustain life. 4. Space shuttle: Space shuttles and spacecraft carry their own supply of oxygen for astronauts to breathe while in space because oxygen is not readily available in the vacuum of space. While you may get oxygen from a space shuttle if you were inside it, it is not a natural source nor the primary source of oxygen for terrestrial life. 5. Water: Water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms (H2O), but oxygen in water is chemically bound and not freely available to breathe. In fact, if we try to breathe in water, we will drown, as our lungs cannot extract the oxygen from water in the way they can from air. However, aquatic organisms like fish are able to extract dissolved oxygen from water using their gills. In conclusion, air is the primary and most accessible source for obtaining the oxygen we need. By breathing in air, our lungs are able to extract the oxygen, which makes up about 21% of the Earth's atmosphere, and transport it throughout our bodies to sustain life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who does Thomas kill? Title: The Prophecy Movie plot: Thomas Dagget, a Catholic seminary student, loses his faith when he sees disturbing visions of a war between angels. Years later, Thomas is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: one, Simon, enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, before disappearing. The second, Uziel, a lieutenant of the angel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of a recently deceased Korean War veteran named Colonel Arnold Hawthorne and the theology thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds the dead veteran awaiting burial and sucks the evil soul out of the body. The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes an extra chapter of the Book of Revelation that describes a second war in heaven and prophecy that a \\"dark soul\\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon. Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death and keeps him in a state of limbo.

The name \\"Brexit\\" is a shorthand term: \\"British exit.\\" This issue has been polarizing and has dominated news and political discussions leading up to and following the public referendum in June 2016. Beau begins the exchange by asking Jayden if he has heard anything new about Brexit, indicating that both parties are aware of and interested in the subject. Jayden responds positively, stating he has heard that the United Kingdom is proceeding with its withdrawal from the EU. This piece of information speaks to some of the Brexit developments of the time. Beau then inquires about Jayden's opinion on the matter, to which Jayden claims he is neutral.

He comes to a red light and sees the car next to him is an expensive looking Honda Civic, owned by a man named Alejandro. Jacob and Alejandro agree to race, and when the light turns green they both slam their feet on the gas pedal and take off. Jacob's car arrives at the light pole down the street from the light sooner than Alejandro's car, and he wins the race. and a hint : Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well. Please answer this question : Which person's car, Jacob's or Alejandro's, must have accelerated slower? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Alejandro's car must have accelerated slower. Since acceleration measures the rate of change in velocity, and velocity accounts for both speed and direction, we can determine which car accelerated slower by comparing their respective speeds at the end of the race. As the question states, Jacob's car reached the finish line, or the light pole down the street, sooner than Alejandro's car. Therefore, Jacob's Mustang must have had a greater overall velocity, suggesting that it accelerated faster than Alejandro's Honda Civic. It is important to note that while we know Jacob's car accelerated faster overall, we do not have detailed information about the specific rates of acceleration or deceleration at various points during the race.

This Christian holiday is not on the same date every year, but it's always on a Sunday. It can be any Sunday between March 22 and April 25. Many people celebrate Easter by buying new clothes. Children celebrate by hunting for color1ed eggs that their parents have hidden around the house. People also give Easter baskets filled with candy and other goodies to one another to celebrate the day. But the holiday is more than new clothes and good things to eat. On Easter, many people go to church to celebrate Jesus' resurrection from the dead. Most people color1 them. Some people hide them. Others just eat them. But no matter what one does with Easter eggs, they are an important Easter tradition throughout the Western world. People from many different cultures celebrate Easter. In both America and Belgium, children look for Easter eggs hidden on lawns and in bushes. In America, children believe the eggs are hidden by the Easter bunny . But in Belgium, the hidden eggs are supposed to have fallen from church bells. In Bulgaria, red Easter eggs are lucky in churches; Bulgarian families also hit these Easter eggs together to see whose is the strongest. The winner looks forward to good fortune that year. Still dozens of other Easter traditions exist. In parts of Austria, for example, children sing from door to door and are rewarded with color1ful eggs. Question: People from different cultures have different ideas about Easter egg, _ . Options: A: In both American and Belgium, children hunt for Easter eggs hidden in rooms and in bushes B: In American, children believe the eggs are hidden by the Easter bunny C: In Belgium, the hidden eggs are thought to have fallen from doorbells D: In America, the hidden eggs are supposed to have fallen from doorbells A:","completion":"B: In America, children believe the eggs are hidden by the Easter bunny"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - You find an empty ice cube tray - You fill the tray with warm water - You carefully place the tray on an even surface in a freezer that is at least 32 degree Farhenheit, the freezing point of water - The water begins to get colder until it starts to freeze solid - The water expands as it freezes, one of the few liquids that has greater volume as a solid - Because you used warm water, the gasses in the water had evaporated out, so you will have nice clear ice cubes without cracks from the trapped gasses - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less caverns will form happens, how will it affect MORE ice cubes being made. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis as stated - \\"suppose less caverns will form\\" - seems to refer to the phenomenon of air bubbles or trapped gasses within ice cubes. If less caverns form within ice cubes, it could result in ice cubes with fewer imperfections and greater clarity. Now, let's analyze the direct and indirect effects of this on creating more ice cubes. Direct effect: There would be no direct effect on the number of ice cubes being made from this perturbation. The ice cube tray has a fixed number of slots, so the number of ice cubes produced would remain the same regardless of whether or not the ice cubes have more or fewer caverns. Indirect effect: There may be a couple of indirect effects to consider as a result of this perturbation: 1. Durability: Ice cubes with fewer imperfections could potentially be more solid and durable. This means that during handling and usage, there might be less breakage of ice, prolonging the overall quantity of ice available. However, this would not have a significant impact on the production of more ice cubes. 2. Rate of freezing: It is believed that using warm water can lead to clearer ice cubes because the gasses in the water evaporate before freezing. Because the water temperature is higher, it could take slightly longer for the water to reach its freezing point and form ice cubes compared to using cold water. However, this difference in time is likely to be minimal and not have a significant effect on the overall ice cube production process. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of having fewer caverns in the ice cubes would not have a significant direct or indirect effect on the production of more ice cubes. The number of ice cubes produced is primarily determined by the number of slots in the ice cube tray and the freezer's ability to freeze water efficiently."},{"prompt":"Q: What are butterflies and bees an example of?

What is the final step of the following process: - The virus finds an animal cell - The virus attaches to the cell's surface - The cell swallows the virus - The virus' RNA is released into the cell - The cell mistakenly reads the virus' RNA instead of its own - The cell creates new viruses - The animal cell releases the new viruses The answer to this question is:","completion":"The final step in the process of a virus infecting an animal cell and replication is the destruction of the infected cell and the dispersal of the newly created viruses to infect other cells and continue the cycle. Once the animal cell has released the new viruses, the cell itself becomes more vulnerable to the consequences of the infection. Here's a detailed explanation of the process: 1. Lysis or Destruction of Infected Cell: In many infections, viral replication results in the production of large numbers of new virus particles within the host cell. This accumulation puts tremendous pressure on the cell, causing structural damage. In some cases, the virus might encode specific proteins (like lytic enzymes) to actively cause the disintegration of the cell membrane and the structural components of the infected cell. This process of cell disintegration is known as lysis and ultimately leads to the death of the infected cell. 2. Release of New Viruses and Spread of Infection: As the infected cell disintegrates or undergoes lysis, the newly created viruses that were contained inside the cell are released into the extracellular environment. These released viruses can now spread and infect neighboring cells, effectively amplifying the infection, and propagating the cycle of viral replication in other cells within the host organism. 3. Host Immune Response and Effects: It is also essential to mention the role of the host's immune system in this process. When new viruses are released, the host organism's immune system becomes aware of the infection and activates a defensive response to eliminate the virus and protect uninfected cells. The immune system plays a crucial role in limiting the spread of the virus and may eventually help the host organism clear the infection. 4. Potential Outcomes: Depending on the efficiency of the host immune response, the type of virus, and the host's general health status, several outcomes are possible after the release of new viruses: a) The immune response is successful, and the virus is cleared from the host organism. b) The immune response fails to control the virus, leading to a persistent or chronic infection, with ongoing viral replication and release. c) The virus establishes latency in the host's cells, wherein the viral genome remains dormant within the infected cell until certain conditions trigger its reactivation and replication, causing a relapse of the infection. To sum up, the final step in the process of a virus infecting an animal cell and replicating is the destruction of the infected cell, release of the newly created viruses, and the spread of the viruses to infect other cells. This event may lead to various outcomes depending on the host's immune response, the specific virus, and other factors."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Pick your answer from: +Yes. +No. Answer:","completion":"Answer: +No. The correct answer is not \\"soils.\\" Instead, extreme heat and pressure change rocks into metamorphic rocks, and in the case you provided, rocks are changed into slate. To provide a more detailed explanation, the Earth's crust is primarily composed of three types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. When rocks are subjected to extreme heat and pressure, their physical and chemical properties change, causing them to form metamorphic rocks. Slate is a fine-grained and foliated metamorphic rock that originates from shale, a sedimentary rock. The extreme heat and pressure experienced by the shale, usually due to tectonic forces and deep burial beneath the Earth's surface, cause the minerals within the rock to reorient themselves and grow larger. This process is called metamorphism. Metamorphism occurs in various grades, depending on the amount of heat and pressure the rock undergoes. In the case of slate, this transformation occurs at low-grade metamorphic conditions. The newly formed slate represents a more compact and dense rock, with well-defined foliation, making it suitable for various uses, such as roofing and flooring materials. So, upon asking \\"what does extreme heat and pressure change rock into?\\", the answer should be \\"metamorphic rocks,\\" with slate being an example of such a transformation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Используя интерфейс прямого кабельного соединения (Direct Cable Connection, DCC), эта программа позволяет компьютерам обмениваться данными через параллельные или последовательные порты. Последовательный (COM) порт - это интерфейс, который отправляет и принимает данные бит за битом последовательно через одну линию связи. Он был стандартным интерфейсом для многих устройств в прошлом и считался надежным способом передачи данных. Параллельный (LPT) порт - это другая разновидность интерфейса, который был широко используем для подключения принтеров и сканеров. Изначально он предназначался для параллельной передачи данных, то есть одновременной передачи нескольких бит информации через несколько проводников или сигнальных каналов. Этот метод обеспечивает более быстрое время передачи данных по сравнению с последовательным портом. Утилита Interlnk автоматически проверяет все последовательные и параллельные порты на наличие активных подключений и определяет их при подключении.

But I don’t believe you have to have a lot for it to become burdensome. Money has always seemed to be a burden. Either you have it and the obligation and responsibility becomes a burden (so I’ve been told, ha) or you don’t have it and life without money becomes a burden. I guess money became a burden to me when I started paying my own bills. Let me explain. I raised my 2 girls by myself. I was fortunate to have a good job as an office manager for a doctor in Dallas. I was able to pay my bills and juggle things around to afford what the girls needed for school and what not. When I didn’t have money for something they wanted I felt like I carried the world on my shoulders. I didn’t let them know how stressful it all was because I felt like it was none of their business. They were kids and needed to be kids. They would soon enough be feeling the stress of managing their own household and shouldn’t be asked to help shoulder that burden as kids. Once, me and my youngest daughter, who was an adult at this time, went to a drive in fast food place and got a couple of drinks. My daughter was treating me and when the car hop came to deliver the drinks, my daughter gave her 5.00 as a tip, which was more than the drinks! I, of course, asked why she did that and she told me that they live off their tips and she knew what that was like having been a waitress before. I said something about her needing the money as well and how money makes the world go around.

Q:The answer to the question: What band has musical influences such as Burt Bacharach? is inside the article: Their records have been heavily influenced by the \\"motorik\\" technique of 1970s krautrock groups such as Neu! and Faust. Tim Gane has supported the comparison: \\"Neu! did minimalism and drones, but in a very pop way.\\" Dave Heaton of PopMatters said that their music also had \\"echoes of bubblegum, of exotica, of Beach Boys and bossa nova\\", with their earlier work \\"bearing strong Velvet Underground overtones\\". Funk, jazz, and Brazilian music were additional inspirations for the band. Stephan Davet of French newspaper Le Monde said that Emperor Tomato Ketchup (1996) had musical influences such as Burt Bacharach, and Françoise Hardy. The sounds influenced by minimalist composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich can be found on the 1999 album Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night. The same album, according to Rick Reger of Chicago Tribune, \\"charts [a course] somewhere between the Beach Boys and Kraftwerk.\\" Stereolab's style also incorporates easy-listening music of the 1950s and '60s. Barney Hoskyns wrote in a review for Dots and Loops (1997) that the group moved \\"away from the one-chord Velvets drone-mesh of its early days\\" toward easy-listening and Europop. Joshua Klein in Washington Post said that, \\"Years before everyone else caught on, Stereolab [were] referencing the 1970s German bands Can and Neu!, the Mexican lounge music master Esquivel and the decidedly unhip Burt Bacharach.\\" Regarding their later work such as Instant 0 in the Universe (2003) and Margerine Eclipse (2004), critics have compared the releases to the band's earlier guitar-driven style., can you guess it ?

First, let's break down each sentence separately: 1. \\"Clinton lands in India to breathe life into ties\\" - This sentence implies that Clinton, presumably a high-ranking US official (most likely referring to Hillary Clinton), has arrived in India with the purpose of revitalizing or strengthening the relationship between the two countries. This suggests a focus on diplomatic relations and possibly discussions on various aspects, such as trade, politics, or cooperation in international affairs. 2. \\"Clinton Warns Against Undermining Grameen Bank\\" - In this sentence, Clinton issues a warning against actions or decisions that might weaken or diminish Grameen Bank's effectiveness, reputation, or operations. Grameen Bank is a microfinance organization and community development institution that provides small loans to the poor, mostly in developing countries. This statement suggests a focus on economic and financial matters, specifically regarding the support and stability of this financial institution. While both sentences involve Clinton addressing issues related to a developing country, the content and focus of each statement differ significantly. The first statement revolves around diplomatic relations and cooperation, whereas the second statement is concerned with a specific financial institution and its well-being. The overlap in meaning is in the involvement of Clinton and a connection to developing countries; however, the primary subject matter and objectives of the two statements differ, leading to a low textual similarity rating of 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Pollination requires pollinators, and most plants are either insect pollinated or wind pollinated. Given these facts, what requires either insects or wind. among the following options: - Pollen grains - swamp vegetation - animals - earth - Animal survival - bloom time - Most plants - nature The answer is:","completion":"Most plants require either insects or wind for pollination. Pollination is a crucial process in the life cycle of flowering plants, as it enables them to reproduce and ensure the survival of their species. It involves the transfer of pollen grains from the male reproductive organs (anthers) to the female reproductive organs (stigma) of a plant. This transfer allows fertilization to occur, leading to the production of seeds and fruits. Wind and insects are the two primary agents responsible for pollination in most plants, and these different methods serve various purposes, according to the characteristics and ecological requirements of each specific plant species. 1. Insect-Pollinated Plants: Insects, particularly bees, butterflies, and moths, are the primary pollinators for many flowering plants. These plants usually have brightly colored, fragrant flowers that attract insects. As insects visit these flowers in search of nectar, they inadvertently pick up pollen grains on their bodies and transfer them to other flowers they visit later. This process is known as entomophily. Insect pollination is particularly important for several commercial crops, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Some examples of insect-pollinated plants include apple trees, tomatoes, and almonds. 2. Wind-Pollinated Plants: Wind-pollinated plants, known as anemophilous, rely on the wind for transferring pollen from one flower to another. These plants usually have small, inconspicuous flowers that produce copious amounts of lightweight pollen grains, which can easily become airborne and travel long distances. Wind-pollinated plants are often found in open areas where wind plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Some examples of wind-pollinated plants include grasses, conifers, and many deciduous trees, such as oaks and maples. Although the question asked to choose between the given options, it is essential to recognize that these options are interconnected. For example, pollen grains are the structures responsible for carrying genetic material during pollination. In turn, they rely on wind and insects to transport them between flowers. Similarly, swamp vegetation is often dependent on the presence of insect pollinators or wind to reproduce, just like most other plants. Animals and nature are inherently linked to this process as well, considering that pollinators are part of the animal kingdom and contribute to the proper functioning of ecosystems. In conclusion, most plants require either insects or wind for pollination, playing a vital role in their growth, reproduction, and survival. Consequently, this process is essential for the maintenance of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and various human activities such as agriculture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sunset Boulevard (stylized onscreen as SUNSET BLVD.) is a 1950 American film noir directed and co-written by Billy Wilder, and produced and co-written by Charles Brackett. It was named after the thoroughfare that runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills, California. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter, and Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded silent-film star who draws him into her fantasy world, where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. The street known as Sunset Boulevard has been associated with Hollywood film production since 1911, when the town's first film studio opened there. The film workers lived modestly in the growing neighborhood, but during the 1920s, profits and salaries rose to unprecedented levels. With the advent of the star system, luxurious homes noted for their often incongruous grandeur were built in the area. As a young man living in Berlin in the 1920s, Billy Wilder was interested in American culture, with much of his interest fueled by the country's films. In the late 1940s, many of the grand Hollywood houses remained, and Wilder, then a Los Angeles resident, found them to be a part of his everyday world. Many former stars from the silent era still lived in them, although most were no longer involved in the film business. Wilder wondered how they spent their time now that \\"the parade had passed them by\\" and began imagining the story of a star who had lost her celebrity and box-office appeal. The character of Norma Desmond mirrors aspects of the twilight years of several real-life faded silent-film stars, such as the reclusive existence of Mary Pickford and the mental disorders of Mae Murray and Clara Bow. It is usually regarded as a fictional composite inspired by several different people, not just a thinly disguised portrait of one in particular. Nevertheless, some commentators have tried to identify specific models. One asserts that Norma Talmadge is \\"the obvious if unacknowledged source of Norma Desmond, the grotesque, predatory silent movie queen\\" of the film. The most common analysis of the character's name is that it is a combination of the names of silent film actress Mabel Normand and director William Desmond Taylor, a close friend of Normand's who was murdered in 1922 in a never-solved case sensationalized by the press. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Who are some of the actors and actresses that starred in Sunset Boulevard?","completion":"Some of the actors and actresses that starred in Sunset Boulevard are William Holden as Joe Gillis, and Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sgt Kingshott and detention officers Simon Tansley, 39, and Michael Marsden, 56, deny gross negligence manslaughter. He told Bristol Crown Court: \\"It was unusual - a directed threat which makes you take notice. That's why it stuck in my mind.\\" Mr Orchard's mental health issues were not flagged up on the police computer nor was there a warning that he may be violent, the jury heard. \\"I knew nothing about him - or what he was suffering from or his mental state or drugs,\\" Mr Kingshott said. Church caretaker Mr Orchard, who had schizophrenia, had stopped taking his medication when he was arrested for a public order offence and taken to the Heavitree Road police station. He had a cloth emergency response belt (ERB) held around his face for five minutes to prevent him spitting and biting. Sgt Kingshott told the jury he had seen the ERB used in this way on around 50 previous occasions and it was a method of restraint he had been trained in. In initial interviews the custody sergeant told investigators he \\"had the impression that he [Mr Orchard] was actively resisting\\" but in subsequent questioning, after viewing CCTV pictures, he conceded \\"that perception is not correct\\". The jury was told Devon and Cornwall Police has been investigated for corporate manslaughter and by the Health and Safety Executive following the death of Mr Orchard.

The brownstone is also home to Archie, Wolfe's confidential assistant and legman, whose responsibilities include goading his sedentary boss into working occasionally to replenish the coffers. When Archie joins him in the dining room, Wolfe is unfazed by the news that he is overdrawn at the bank â but he is taken aback at the discovery that Fritz has altered one of his favorite dishes without consulting him. The resulting tantrum prompts Archie to do something uncharacteristic when the doorbell rings: admit one of the neighborhood kids, Pete Drossos (Robert Clark), who says he has to see Nero Wolfe. Pete has a case. He tells Wolfe he works the wipe racket â cleaning the windshields of cars stopped at intersections, for the occasional tip.

As Pete wiped her windshield the woman mouthed the words, \\"Help. Get a cop.\\" A male passenger stuck a gun in her ribs and the car drove off. Pete wrote down the license number. If the woman is found dead, Pete believes he can claim a reward by identifying the man who was with her. Since the case is too big for him to handle alone, Pete asks Nero Wolfe to go 50-50.

Hypothesis: Goya was a philanderer in his youth. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The statement \\"A philanderer in his youth, Goya fled Zaragoza in 1763 for the anonymity of Madrid\\" describes Goya as a philanderer in his youth and provides information on his consequent relocation to Madrid. This premise directly implies that Goya was a philanderer in his youth, making it the basis for the given hypothesis. In logic, a premise is part of an argument that contains the supporting information or reasons for accepting a conclusion. An argument can be considered valid if the premises logically entail or cause the conclusion. In this case, the hypothesis \\"Goya was a philanderer in his youth\\" is directly derived from the premise provided, making the premise entail the hypothesis. To break it down, the premise consists of two main parts: 1. Goya was a philanderer in his youth. 2. Goya fled Zaragoza in 1763 for the anonymity of Madrid. Since the hypothesis in question only addresses the first part of the premise, it's clear that the premise does entail the hypothesis. The second part of the premise provides additional context that helps to bolster the first part, i.e., being a philanderer in his youth was a contributing factor for Goya's decision to leave Zaragoza. In conclusion, the premise \\"A philanderer in his youth, Goya fled Zaragoza in 1763 for the anonymity of Madrid\\" indeed entails the hypothesis \\"Goya was a philanderer in his youth.\\" The premise directly states and supports the hypothesis, making it a sound logical deduction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war. Question: \\"What country held possession of Nanking, Hankow, and Canton by 1938?\\" Answer: \\"The Soviet Union\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer to the question is not correct.

Lindsay Anderson's If... stars the ever-marvellous Malcolm McDowell as one of three private school pupils who decorate their dorm with photos of Lenin and other left-wing radicals. It's clearly an anti-establishment movie in its depiction of the evil upper-class oiks who rule the roost and the antiquated autocratic practices of the pish-posh public school standard. What makes If... unusual though is that for all its radical sympathies, it doesn't explicitly give us any sense of great tension between human decency and the despotic school system, instead it just kind of floats: lacking in plot and lacking in personality. Surrealist bits fade in and out occasionally and the film slips from black-and-white to colour again (is it due to the low budget or is it an arty expression?), but there is little of interest to speak of. All we get is the poignant denouement where the young rebels reach for their rifles and shoot down the shady overlords of the establishment. Hooray! A revolution! At last something that demands a second thought unlike the rest of this dull exercise in boarding school daydreaming. If... could have been a powerful political statement, but as it is it drifts and only gathers any sense of direct interest at the end. Instead of being a testament to the dissident zeitgeist of the late-Sixties, it only succeeds in being a dazed document of upper-class British education. Anarchy?

Article: Written in Coptic (an Egyptian language), the Gospel of Jesus's Wife, if authentic, suggests that some people in ancient times believed Jesus was married, apparently to Mary Magdalene. The truth may be finally emerging about the \\"Gospel of Jesus's Wife,\\" a highly controversial papyrus suggesting that some people, in ancient times, believed Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. New research on the papyrus' ink points to the possibility that it is authentic, researchers say, while newly obtained documents may shed light on the origins of the business-card-sized fragment. Debate about the credibility of the \\"gospel\\" began as soon as Harvard University professor Karen King reported her discovery of the papyrus in September 2012. Written in Coptic (an Egyptian language), the papyrus fragment contains a translated line that reads, \\"Jesus said to them, 'My wife …'\\" and also refers to a \\"Mary,\\" possibly Mary Magdalene. King had tentatively dated the papyrus to the fourth century, saying it may be a copy of a gospel written in the second century in Greek. [Read Translation of Gospel of Jesus's Wife Papyrus] Analysis of the papyrus, detailed last year in the Harvard Theological Review journal, suggested the papyrus dates back around 1,200 years (somewhere between the sixth and ninth centuries) while the ink is of a type that could have been created at that time. These findings have led King to support the text's authenticity. However over the past year many scholars have come to the conclusion that the papyrus is a modern-day forgery, though King and a few other researchers say they are not ready to concede this: \\"At this point, when discussions and research are ongoing, I think it is important, however difficult, to stay open regarding the possible dates of the inscription and other matters of interpretation,\\" wrote King in a letter recently published in the magazine Biblical Archaeological Review. King has not responded to several interview requests from Live Science. Now, researchers at Columbia University are running new tests on the ink used on the papyrus. Initial tests published by the Columbia University team in 2014 indicated the ink could have been made in ancient times. Researchers are saying little until their report is published; however they did talk about one finding that could provide some support for its authenticity. A gospel steeped in mystery The current owner of the papyrus has insisted on remaining anonymous, claiming that he bought the Gospel of Jesus's Wife, along with other Coptic texts, in 1999 from a man named Hans-Ulrich Laukamp. This person, in turn, got it from Potsdam, in what was East Germany, in 1963, the owner said. Laukamp died in 2002, and the claim that he owned the text has been strongly disputed: Rene Ernest, the man whom Laukamp and his wife Helga charged with representing their estate, said that Laukamp had no interest in antiquities, did not collect them and was living in West Berlin in 1963. Therefore, he couldn't have crossed the Berlin Wall into Potsdam. Axel Herzsprung, a business partner of Laukamp's, similarly said that Laukamp never had an interest in antiquities and never owned a papyrus. Laukamp has no children or living relatives who could verify these claims. [6 Archaeological Forgeries That Tried to Change History] Over the past few months, new documents have been found that not only reconstruct Laukamp's life in greater detail, but also provide a new way to check the anonymous owner's story. King reported in a 2014 Harvard Theological Review article that the anonymous owner \\"provided me with a photocopy of a contract for the sale of '6 Coptic papyrus fragments, one believed to be a Gospel' from Hans-Ulrich Laukamp, dated Nov. 12, 1999, and signed by both parties.\\" King also notes that \\"a handwritten comment on the contract states, 'Seller surrenders photocopies of correspondence in German. Papyri were acquired in 1963 by the seller in Potsdam (East Germany).'\\" After searching public databases in Florida a Live Science reporter uncovered seven signatures signed by Laukamp between 1997 and 2001 on five notarized documents. Anyone can search these databases and download these documents. These signatures can be compared with the signature recording the sale of the Gospel of Jesus's Wife — providing another way to verify or disprove the story of how the \\"gospel\\" made its way to Harvard. The signature of Hans-Ulrich Laukamp from September 1997. While Harvard University would have to work with forensic handwriting experts to verify the signature, the fact that these notarized documents exist, and are publicly available, presents the opportunity to see if Laukamp really did own the Gospel of Jesus's Wife. Forensic handwriting analysis, while not always conclusive, has been used to determine if signatures made on documents or works of art are authentic or forged. If Laukamp did own the papyrus, authentic or not, then the origins of the enigmatic text lie with him. The new Laukamp documents allow the story of his life between 1995 and 2002 to be told in some detail. However if Laukamp didn't own the papyrus and the anonymous owner has not been truthful, then further doubt would be cast on the papyrus' authenticity, and information leading to the identity, motives and techniques of the forgers could be found. Authentic or forged? One important find, which indicates the Gospel of Jesus's Wife is a fake, was made last year by Christian Askeland, a research associate with the Institute for Septuagint and Biblical Research in Wuppertal, Germany. He examined a second Coptic papyrus containing part of the Gospel of John, which the anonymous owner of the Gospel of Jesus's Wife had also given to Harvard. This text was likewise supposedly purchased from Laukamp, and radiocarbon testing of that papyrus similarly found that it dates back around 1,200 years. [See Images of the Ancient Gospel of Judas] Askeland found that the text and line breaks— where one line of a text ends and another begins — are identical to those of another papyrus, published in a 1924 book. That second papyrus was written in a dialect of Coptic called Lycopolitan, which went extinct around 1,500 years ago. Askeland concluded that the John papyrus is a forgery. Furthermore, it shares other features with the Gospel of Jesus's Wife, Askeland said, suggesting both are forgeries. \\"The two Coptic fragments clearly shared the same ink, writing implement and scribal hand. The same artisan had created both essentially at the same time,\\" Askeland wrote in a paper recently published in the journal New Testament Studies. King objected to this conclusion in her Biblical Archaeology Review letter, noting that the John fragment could have been copied in ancient times, long after Lycopolitan went extinct, from a text that had similar line breaks. In addition, James Yardley, a senior research scientist at Columbia University, told Live Science that the new tests confirm that the Gospel of Jesus's Wife holds different ink than the John papyrus. This could undercut Askeland's argument that the two papyri were written by the same person. \\"In our first exploration, we did state that the inks used for the two documents of interest [the John papyrus and the Gospel of Jesus's Wife] were quite different. The more recent results do confirm this observation strongly,\\" Yardley told Live Science. He added that until his new research is published in a peer-reviewed journal, he doesn't want to say anything more publicly. And once it's published, Askeland and other researchers will have a chance to respond. Askeland's find is far from the only argument that the Gospel of Jesus's Wife is a fake: A number of scholars have noted that the Coptic writing in the Gospel of Jesus's Wife is similar to another early Christian text called the \\"Gospel of Thomas,\\" even including a modern-day typo made in a 2002 edition of the Gospel of Thomas that is available for free online. That typo indicates the forgers copied from this modern-day text. King disputed this assertion in 2014, saying that ancient scribes made grammatical errors similar to the modern-day typo. King and communications staff at Harvard Divinity School have not responded to repeated requests for comment. Follow Live Science@livescience, Facebook & Google+.

Jamie Seidel News Corp Australia Network MY WIFE: It’s a common phrase found on scrap of papyrus no bigger than a business card. But given the phrase was supposedly uttered by Jesus about Mary Magdalene, its ramifications could be explosive. The authenticity of the document has been considered suspect ever since it was discovered in 2012. The papyrus is marked in the old Egyptian language of Coptic. Translated, it reads: 1) ... not [to] me, my mother gave to me li[fe] ... 2) The disciples said to Jesus, “ ... 3) ... deny. Mary is worthy of it ... (or, alternatively, Mary is not worth of it ...) 4) ...” Jesus said to them, “My wife ... 5) ... she will be able to be my disciple ... 6) Let wicked people swell up ... 7) As for me, I dwell with her in order to ... 8) ... an image ... The Mary referred to on the papyrus has been speculated as being Mary Magdalene — the woman the Bible says used her hair to wash Jesus’ feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. Early Gospels name her as being Jesus’ “companion”. She was long depicted by the Church as having being a whore. The scrutiny of the scrap has been intense. Now its authenticity faces an almost continuous bombardment of claim and counterclaim. Paper trail The finder of the fragment, Harvard University professor Karen King, believed the document dated from the fourth century and was a copy of an older text. Further Harvard radiocarbon dating of the papyrus indicated it could have been made between the 6th and 9th Centuries AD. But criticism that it was a fake grew in intensity. Then a study in 2004 by Columbia University offered new strength to the argument it may be authentic. The researchers took a close look at the ink used in the document and concluded it may indeed be as old as claimed. However, the full results of this study have not yet been published. So, fresh emphasis has been placed on tracing the modern history of the scrap of papyrus. This proved problematic: It was bought in 1999 from the German Hans-Ulrich Laukamp who had himself claimed to have found it in Potsdam, East Germany, in 1963. Laucamp, who had lived on the West side of the heavily guarded Berlin Wall, died in 2002. Man of mystery Investigations of Laukamp’s past reveal little evidence he held an interest in collecting antiquities. So why and how would he own the ‘Jesus’ Wife’ papyrus? Another papyrus purchased from Laukamp, a fragment of the Gospel of John, was recently deemed a forgery. It was radiocarbon dated as being 1200 years old. But the dialect of the language used in its script fell from use 1500 years ago. A new investigation into his past by the LiveScience blog has uncovered a paper trail detailing Laukamp’s life and containing his signature. This, they say, provides the opportunity to determine if his signature on documents relating to the sale of the papyrus scrap had been forged or not. If authentic, the document’s origins will remain a mystery. If forged, the debate — and its intense religious implications — can be put to rest. At least until further evidence can be found of the elusive Gospel of Mary. Gospel truth This particular scrap of papyrus is not the only ancient document presenting Mary Magdeline in the context of Jesus’ wife, or that of a 13th disciple. There’s a Syraic-language manuscript dating from 570AD, said to be a copy of an older document, held by the British Museum. Several fragments of a document named the Gospel of Mary have been found. The Berlin Gnostic Codex contains the largest known portions of the Gospel, found in Akhmim, upper Egypt, in the late 1800s. Several smaller pieces have since been found at Oxyrhynchus in lower Egypt. In 1947, in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, a collection of Gnostic documents — Gnostics being an early Christian sect — were found sealed in jars. These also paint a picture of a married Jesus. The upshot: There existed in the early centuries of Christianity some who believed that Jesus was married to Mary Magdeline. However, the Gospels making this connection were not among those selected at the 325AD Council of Nicaea, where church leaders gathered together to determine which Gospels would make up what is now call the Bible. ||||| Current Digital Issue • January/February 2019 • Vol. 45 No. 1 About this issue: As the days grow shorter and colder, think of warmer regions and times with our 2019 Digs Issue!

Daffy explains that he and other travelers settled there in secret several years earlier, but difficulties arose and he chose to leave. Daffy commits suicide, leaving Richard a map to the island. Richard convinces a young French couple, FranÃ§oise and Ãtienne, to accompany him to the island, and the three travel to Ko Samui.

Here is an article: Editor's note: James Millward is professor of intersocietal history at the Walsh School of Foreign Service and Department of History, Georgetown University. (CNN) -- The Chinese legal advocate Chen Guangcheng, facing the end of his fellowship at New York University, has claimed that NYU is forcing him out due to Chinese pressure. NYU's participation in a complex deal to allow Chen to leave China to study gave the dissident and his family breathing space, and helped the United States and China untangle a thorny diplomatic dilemma after Chen fled to the U.S. embassy in Beijing in April 2012. NYU in fact did a great favor not only for Chen but also for both the U.S. and Chinese governments. NYU's spokesman says the end of Chen's fellowship \\"has nothing to do with the Chinese government; all fellowships come to an end.\\" Chen has, in any case, other job options. But whether there was Chinese pressure or not in this case, Chen's experience and allegations highlight the many challenges faced by U.S. academic institutions in the context of evolving Sino-U.S. relations. Despite criticism of its cost, content, admissions criteria or tenure system, U.S. post-secondary education, be it at top-tier research institutions, private liberal arts colleges or large state universities, remains the best worldwide. That's why students from all over the world strive to come here. Along with high-tech and Hollywood, our university education is among America's top exports, something we still do better than any other country. Chinese dissident: NYU is forcing me out And China, perhaps more than anywhere, reveres education. More scholars than generals occupy China's pantheon of national heroes. Besides Confucius and Mencius, there's Qu Yuan, patron saint of intellectuals, whom Chinese commemorate this time every year with dragon boats and rice wrapped in bamboo leaves. Chinese parents across the social spectrum struggle to give their children the best education. Not surprisingly, then, as Chinese become wealthier, more Chinese students flock to the United States to study. U.S. universities, too, are opening satellite branches to serve this market within China. Meanwhile, the Chinese state is attempting to promote Chinese-language study and enhance its \\"soft power\\" in the United States by installing Confucius Institutes on U.S. campuses. Chinese students and faculty engage in surprisingly open discourse, even criticism of their government, on campuses in China. But the notion of academic freedom for its own sake is not a feature of Chinese universities. Rather, the general expectation (not always accepted by students and faculty) is that education should serve the state. The Chinese state thus attempts to control the message on its campuses. In U.S. colleges and universities, on the other hand, academic freedom is tied to our ideal that education is primarily for the benefit of the individual, and that it is by empowering individuals of diverse outlooks that society as a whole benefits the most. Two tendencies are now converging, just as U.S. and Chinese academic communities become more inter-meshed. Rising China has taken steps to export and police the message on campuses abroad by denying visas to U.S. academic critics or pressuring universities over dissidents or speeches by such figures as the Dalai Lama. Meanwhile, cash-strapped U.S. institutions increasingly value China as a market; deans and provosts, gung-ho about their flashy new China initiatives, have not been as supportive of academic freedom as they should. If Chen Guangcheng's departure from NYU owes anything to Chinese pressure, his is but one, high-profile case. As we go forward, should more such incidents arise, here's what both sides should do: China, please abandon counterproductive efforts to intimidate foreign institutions and scholars. Ham-fisted bullying only undermines the very soft power that was your goal in the first place, and ticks off the teachers who teach foreigners about China. And deans and provosts at U.S. institutions: Don't be craven about academic freedom. Join together with other institutions and take a firm, principled stand to support scholars. Don't be afraid to do what NYU did in hosting a dissident or to take bold steps if China denies a visa to one of your professors. We are the No. 1 global brand in university education, largely because of our principles. Where else is China going to go?

Article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Lina Sinjab in Damascus: \\"The damage affected many civilian buildings\\" A massive car bomb explosion in the Syrian capital, Damascus, has killed at least 53 people and injured another 200, reports say. Syria blamed \\"terrorist groups linked to al-Qaeda\\" for the blast, which hit a central district near the headquarters of Syria's ruling Baath Party. TV pictures showed images of bodies, wrecked cars and shattered windows. The violence comes as Russia and the Arab League say they want to broker direct government-opposition talks. No group has yet admitted the attack. The Syrian foreign ministry blamed the bombing on \\"armed terrorist groups linked to al-Qaeda that receive financial and logistic help from abroad\\". The militant Islamist al-Nusra Front previously said it had carried out many of the bombings that have rocked Syria since the uprising began in March 2011. Meanwhile Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the war as \\"a road to nowhere\\". The opposition Syrian National Coalition is holding a two-day meeting in Egypt to discuss a framework for a possible solution. Also on Thursday, the UN and Arab League envoy for Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, agreed to remain in office through the rest of 2013, UN spokesman Martin Nesirky told the Associated Press. Mr Brahimi's contract was due to expire on Friday. The UN has estimated up to 70,000 people have died in the conflict in the past two years. 'Upside down' Police and witnesses said the blast was a car bomb. It went off in the central Mazraa neighbourhood, close to the Baath offices and Russian embassy. State and pro-regime TV showed pictures of dead bodies and destroyed cars. State media said at least 53 were killed and another 200 injured in the blast. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based activist group, said at least 42 had died, most of them civilians. Surrounding roads are reported to have been closed off to traffic and firefighters and medical staff were soon at the scene. Image caption Images from state media showed wounded Syrians reeling from the blast Witnesses told AP news agency the car had exploded at a security checkpoint between the Russian embassy and the Baath Party central headquarters. \\"It was huge. Everything in the shop turned upside down,'' one local resident said. He said three of his employees were injured by flying glass that killed a young girl who was walking by when the blast hit. \\"I pulled her inside the shop but she was almost gone. We couldn't save her. She was hit in the stomach and head.\\" State media said the explosion had struck near a school and clinic and that schoolchildren were among the casualties. It seems to have been targeted at the Baath party offices, but also affected residential areas, says the BBC's Lina Sinjab in Damascus. Heavy fighting between government and rebel forces continued around the city, with the government carrying out air strikes in the suburbs. Shortly after the car bomb, two mortars were fired at a military headquarters in Damascus, reports say. And there were two other explosions in the city, also at security checkpoints, according to the SOHR. The UK-based activist group is one of the most prominent organisations documenting and reporting incidents and casualties in the Syrian conflict. The SOHR says its reports are impartial, though its information cannot be independently verified. Opposition 'softens' Mr Lavrov said the Kremlin and the Arab League wanted to establish direct contact between the Syrian government and the opposition. Speaking in Moscow, where he hosted league officials and several Arab foreign ministers, the Russian foreign minister said that sitting down at a negotiating table was the only way to end the conflict without irreparable damage to Syria. \\"Neither side can allow itself to rely on a military solution to the conflict, because it is a road to nowhere, a road to mutual destruction of the people,\\" he said. Mr Lavrov and Arab League General Secretary Nabil Elaraby said their priority was to create a transitional government to navigate a way out of the violence. No conditions for the negotiations have been set, they said. The proposal initially received a cool reception from the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), with senior member Abdelbaset Sieda insisting Mr Assad and his allies \\"must go first\\". \\"After that we can discuss with others in the regime who didn't share in the killing of our people,\\" he said. But the news agency Reuters says it has seen a draft SNC communique being discussed in Cairo which demonstrates an apparent softening in the group's stance. The document reasserts the group's position that Mr Assad's apparatus cannot be part of any political solution in Syria, but omits previous demands that Mr Assad's regime must go even before any talks, Reuters says. But that may still prove unacceptable in Damascus, says the BBC's James Reynolds in Istanbul. ||||| At least 31 people have been killed in a car bombing near the headquarters of the ruling Baath party in Syria's capital, opposition activists say. The UK-based group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said most of the dead were civilians but members of the Syrian security services were also killed in the Damascus attack. Witnesses and opposition activists said the explosion targeted a security checkpoint in the central Mazraa neighbourhood. State media also reported the blast, claiming a \\"large number\\" of civilians were killed and hurt in what it said was a suicide bombing. It claimed the attack was carried out by \\"terrorists\\" battling President Bashar al Assad in a two-year uprising. Syrian television broadcast footage of several bodies along a main street and firefighters dousing dozens of burning vehicles. It reported that casualties included children at a nearby school. Debris was spread over a wide area and black smoke billowed into the sky. Eyewitnesses said a car had exploded at a security checkpoint between the Russian embassy and the HQ of Mr Assad's party. President Assad's forces are battling Syrian rebels The windows of the embassy were blown out by the blast but none of its staff were hurt, Russian news agencies reported. And a police official at the scene told the AFP news agency: \\"It was a car bomb at the 16 November Square, near the Al Iman mosque.\\" One local resident said: \\"It was huge, everything in the shop turned upside down.\\" Damascus has so far mostly avoided the large-scale violence that has destroyed other Syrian cities. But rebels who control districts to the south and east of the capital have been attacking Mr Assad's power base for nearly a month, and have carried out devastating bombings several times in the last year. The United Nations has said around 70,000 people have died in the uprising since it began in March 2011. Meanwhile, the opposition umbrella organisation, the Syrian National Coalition, is willing to negotiate a peace deal to end the war but Mr Assad cannot be a party to any settlement, a communique drafted for a major opposition meeting has said. The communique, seen by Reuters, left out a direct demand for the president's removal, in a softening of tone from past positions that insisted he must go before there could be any talks. The document, to be debated at a meeting of the opposition alliance's leadership, said Mr Assad and his chiefs must be held accountable for bloodshed and that any peace deal must be arranged by the United States and Russia. ||||| BEIRUT A car bomb killed more than 50 people and wounded 200 in central Damascus on Thursday when it blew up on a busy highway close to ruling Baath Party offices and the Russian Embassy, state media and activists said. Syrian television showed charred and bloodied bodies strewn across the street after the blast, which it described as a suicide bombing by \\"terrorists\\" battling President Bashar al-Assad. It said 53 people were killed. Central Damascus has been relatively insulated from almost two years of unrest and civil war in which around 70,000 people have been killed across the country, but the bloodshed has shattered suburbs around the capital. Rebels who control districts to the south and east of Damascus have attacked Assad's power base for nearly a month and struck with devastating bombs over the last year. The al Qaeda-linked rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra, which claimed responsibility for several of those bombs, says it carried out 17 attacks around Damascus in the first half of February, including at least seven bombings. Activists said most of the victims of Thursday's attack in the city's Mazraa district were civilians, including children, possibly from a school behind the Baath building. Opposition activists reported further explosions elsewhere in the city after the explosion which struck shortly before 11 a.m. (0900 GMT). One resident in the heart of the capital heard three or four projectiles whistling through the sky, followed by explosions. At least one of them landed in a public garden in the Abu Rummaneh district, she said, but no one was hurt. EMBASSY DAMAGED The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors violence via a network of sources inside Syria, said the Mazraa car bomb was detonated at a checkpoint close to the Baath Party building, located about 200 meters (660 feet) from the Russian embassy. It said 56 people were killed, of which at least 15 were from Syria's security forces and the rest civilians. Eight other people were killed by a car bomb in the Barzeh district of northeast Damascus, one of several explosions which followed the Mazraa attack. Russia's Itar-Tass news agency quoted a diplomat as saying the Mazraa blast blew out windows at the Russian Embassy, but no employees were wounded. \\"The building has really been damaged ... The windows are shattered,\\" the diplomat said. The vehicle was carrying between 1 and 1.5 metric tons (1.65 tons) of explosives, Damascus Governor Bishr Sabban told Reuters. A correspondent for Syrian television said he saw seven body bags with corpses at the scene. He counted 17 burnt-out cars and another 40 that were destroyed or badly damaged by the force of the blast, which ripped a crater 1.5 meters deep into the road. Syrian TV said security forces had detained a would-be suicide bomber with five bombs in his car, one of them weighing 300 kg (440 pounds). In the southern city of Deraa, where the uprising against Assad erupted in March 2011, warplanes bombed the city's old district for the first time in nearly two years of conflict, killing 18 people, activists said. A rebel officer in the Tawheed al-Janoub brigade which led a rebel offensive this week in Deraa said there were at least five air strikes on the city on Thursday. \\"The (rebel) attacks on several major checkpoints in the Hay al-Saad neighborhood and its declaration as a liberated area have prompted this response,\\" said Abdullah Masalmah, an activist from the city, via Skype. Fighting has intensified in southern Syria in recent weeks, leading to a sharp increase in refugee flows to neighboring Jordan, according to officials. A Jordanian military source said 4,288 refugees arrived in the last 24 hours alone. Nayef Hawatmeh, head of the Damascus-based Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, was lightly wounded by an explosion in a mosque next to his office, a DFLP official said. Talal Abu Tharifa told Reuters in Gaza that glass fragments had caused a slight wound to Hawatmeh's hand.

For this bride, it's perhaps questionable whether this was what she envisioned for her wedding day for all those years. Regardless, it's clear from the beaming smiles on the faces of both the bride and groom, as they stand knee deep in freezing, flowing waters of a salmon river in Alaska, that this is the perfect wedding for them. Scroll down for video. Groomsmen holding fly fishing rods watch as Kadie and Dake Schmidt exchanged their vows, knee deep in a salmon river in Alaska. Bridesmaids look on as Kadie and Dake Schmidt, right, exchange a kiss at the end of their wedding ceremony. Flanked by supportive bridesmaids and groomsmen, wearing protective long waders, the happy couple exchanged their vows to the sound of the running river in the remote but beautiful setting. Kadie Walsh and Dake Schmidt, both local fishing guides, opted for a rather nontraditional salmon fishing theme for their entire wedding. The couple's rings were presented each in the mouths of two king salmon and both the bridesmaids and groomsmen were carrying fishing rods complete with flower posies throughout the ceremony. Stunning setting: It was arguably a beautiful setting for the ceremony, with Pillar Mountain in the background. The majority of the wedding party kept their feet dry, watching from the shoreline. Unafraid of getting their hands messy, the couple then caught their own pair of pink salmon to commemorate their special union. Shortly after the newlyweds were married, they were each handed a rod and both caught their own pair of handsome pink salmon on the Buskin River, on Alaska's southern Kodiak island. While marrying in the freezing fishy waters of a fast-flowing river in Alaska might not be everyone's cup of tea for their special ceremony, Mr and Mrs Schmidt, it appears, couldn't have been happier with the arrangement. The setting might be unusual but some elements of the special day followed the traditional course, including Kadie's minor make-up touch-ups from the bridesmaids.

Given the question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Radio-frequency identification. Yes or no? Answer: Some tags are powered and read at short ranges (a few meters) via magnetic fields ( electromagnetic induction ). Question: how is rfid tag powered The answer is:","completion":"Yes, RFID (Radio-frequency identification) tags, particularly passive RFID tags, are powered and read at short ranges (a few meters) via magnetic fields (electromagnetic induction). To understand the process, let's first briefly explain what RFID is. Radio-frequency identification employs electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. An RFID system consists of three components: an RFID tag or smart label, an RFID reader, and an antenna. There are primarily two types of RFID tags: passive and active. While active tags have their power source, often a battery, passive RFID tags do not have a built-in power source. Therefore, they need to draw power from the reader to operate. So, how does this work? The RFID reader emits radio frequency waves that form an electromagnetic field; this is where the role of electromagnetic induction comes into play. When the RFID tag enters this electromagnetic field, it can draw power from it. An electrical current is induced in the tag's antenna by the activated magnetic field, thus powering up the semiconductor. The tag then sends the information coded in its microchip's memory to be picked up by the reader's antenna. In this case, the answer to the question \\"How is an RFID tag powered?\\" can indeed be \\"Some tags are powered and read at short ranges (a few meters) via magnetic fields (electromagnetic induction).\\" However, it's worth noting that not all RFID tags follow this principle. As discussed, active RFID tags possess their power source and can operate without the need for an electromagnetic field to induce a current. They can be read from distances much greater than a few meters. But due to cost and size considerations, these types of tags are less common. Similarly, there are also battery-assisted passive (BAP) tags that use a small onboard battery to power the tag's circuit and boosting the backscatter reply. These tags are also able to be read from distances much greater than traditional passive tags but less than active tags. So, while the provided answer is accurate, it doesn't capture the full range of how RFID tags can be powered."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? For what use cases do you think deep learning and neural networks overkill and simpler models work better in practice? In deep Q learning, how we update the weight in neural network?","completion":"These questions have different meanings. The first question is about identifying situations where deep learning and neural networks might be unnecessary and simpler models would suffice in practice, while the second question focuses on understanding the weight update mechanism in deep Q learning within a neural network. Let's address both questions in detail. 1) For what use cases do you think deep learning and neural networks are overkill and simpler models work better in practice? Deep learning and neural networks have become popular for their ability to solve complex problems, but there are cases where simpler models perform more efficiently. Some of these use cases include: a) Small datasets: Deep learning models usually require large amounts of data to perform well. If your dataset is relatively small, a simpler model like linear regression, logistic regression, or decision trees might work better and require less computational resources. b) Interpretable models: If it is important for stakeholders to understand how the model makes predictions, simpler models like decision trees, linear regression, or Naive Bayes might serve better, as they provide better interpretability compared to complex neural networks. c) Speed concerns: Training deep learning models can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. If quicker model development and deployment are of high importance, a simpler model that trains faster might be a better fit. d) Low-dimensional data: In cases where the dataset contains fewer features (low-dimensional), simpler models may perform just as well as more complex models. For instance, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, or linear regression could work effectively on low-dimensional data. e) Feature importance: If the primary interest is to understand the importance of individual features in the model, simpler models like linear regression, logistic regression, or decision trees provide clearer insights and facilitate more straightforward analysis. 2) In deep Q learning, how do we update the weights in the neural network? Deep Q learning is a reinforcement learning technique that combines Q learning with deep neural networks to estimate state-action value function (Q value). Updating weights in the neural network is an essential part of the learning process to achieve the optimal policy. Here are the steps involved in updating weights in a neural network during deep Q learning: a) Initialize the deep Q network: First, initialize two neural networks, the Q-network (online network) and the target network with random weights. Both networks have the same architecture. b) Sample a minibatch of experience: During gameplay or interaction with the environment, store experiences (state, action, reward, next state) in a replay buffer. Next, sample a minibatch of experiences from the buffer for training. c) Calculate the target Q value: For each experience in the minibatch, calculate the target Q value using the target network. The target Q value is determined by the Bellman equation: Target_Q = reward + discount_factor * max_a'(Q_target(next_state, a')) where max_a'() is the maximum Q value for the next state from the target network over all possible actions a'. d) Compute loss: Calculate the loss between the target Q value and the Q value predicted by the online network: Loss = (Target_Q - Q_online(state, action))^2 This loss quantifies the difference between the target and predicted Q values, representing the TD-error (temporal difference error). e) Update weights using backpropagation: Perform backpropagation on the neural network to minimize the loss by adjusting the weights using gradient descent or other optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSprop). f) Soft update of target network: Periodically or continuously update the target network weights using the Q-network weights (with a certain update rate). A common approach is the soft update: Target_network_weights = update_rate * Q_network_weights + (1 - update_rate) * Target_network_weights These steps help in refining the deep Q network's ability to estimate Q values, thereby improving its performance in determining the best actions for given states."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In conclusion, it is not possible to justifiably conclude that a man is sitting at a computer solely based on the statement \\"The man is not outside running.\\" Relying on the absence of one particular activity to deduce another unrelated activity can lead to inaccurate assumptions and logical fallacies. Drawing such conclusions would require more precise and detailed information about the man's actual activities or surroundings to ensure an accurate and valid conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Very Hard Choices is a science - fiction / suspense - mystery novel from Canadian science fiction author Spider Robinson , released in June 2008 . The novel , set in British Columbia , is a sequel to Very Bad Deaths and continues the story of the reclusive telepath known as Smelly . - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - The Canadian titles debate has been ongoing since the presentation to the Canadian House of Commons of the Nickle Resolution in 1917. This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada. - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. - A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \\"Btss\\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds. - The Pacific Northwest (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Spider Robinson (born November 24, 1948) is an American-born Canadian Hugo Award- and Nebula Award-winning science fiction author. - A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \\"knighthood\\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame. - Very Bad Deaths (Baen Books, 2004, ISBN 0-7434-8861-X), is a science-fiction/suspense-mystery novel from Canadian science fiction author Spider Robinson. The book was followed in 2008 by a sequel, \\"Very Hard Choices\\". It explores the personal implications of uncontrolled telepathy, social responsibility, and the idea of evolutionary, biological evil, while, as usual, expounds on Spider's own political and social views. - Baen Books is an American publishing house for science fiction and fantasy. In science fiction, it emphasizes space opera, hard science fiction, and military science fiction. The company was established in 1983 by science fiction publisher and editor Jim Baen.

Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America.

A small degree of warp was common, and allowing for it was part of the art of turntable and tonearm design. \\"wow\\" (once-per-revolution pitch variation) could result from warp, or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered. Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover. This, if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover, was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface. Singles, with rare exceptions, had simple paper covers with no inner cover. Question: What is a cause of once per revolution pitch variation?","completion":"One cause of once-per-revolution pitch variation, also known as \\"wow,\\" in vinyl records is a warped record. Warping can be caused by heat, improper storage, exposure to sunlight, or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap on the album cover. Another cause of \\"wow\\" can be a spindle hole that is not precisely centered. When the spindle hole is misaligned, it causes the record to rotate off-balance, which results in pitch variations during playback as the stylus (the needle) traces the unevenly spinning grooves on the record.

If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied...

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: For anyone still doubting the belief that our emotions impact our physical health, a new study from New Zealand should be able to settle the matter. It reports that the physical wounds of healthy seniors healed more quickly if they wrote about their most upsetting experiences. This confirms the results of a 2010 study, and extends those findings to cover older adults-a group that is likely to suffer wounds (as from surgery), and one with less access to other ways of lowering tension (such as exercise). Reported in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, a research team led by the University of Auckland's Elizabeth Broadbent made a study featuring 50 healthy adults ranging in age from 64 to 97. They were assigned to write for 20 minutes per day for three consecutive days. Half were asked to write about the most upsetting experience in their life, describing their deepest thoughts, feelings, and emotions about the events, ideally not previously shared with others. The others were asked to write about their daily activities without mentioning emotions, opinions or beliefs. Two weeks after the third day of writing, all participants received a standard 4mm skin biopsy on their inner arm. The very tiny wounds caused by the biopsy were photographed regularly over the following days to determine the rate at which they healed. On the 11th day after the biopsy, the wounds completely healed on 76.2 percent of those who had done the expressive writing. That was true of only 42.1 percent of those who had written about everyday activities. \\"The biological and psychological mechanisms behind this effect remain unclear,\\" the researchers wrote, noting that those who had done the expressive writing did not report lower stress levels or fewer depressive symptoms than the others in the control group. Even if they weren't consciously aware of feeling more relaxed or positive, the expressive writing appeared to have caused some sort of bodily reaction-probably involving their immune systems-that hastened their recovery.

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"The median household income in Boston was 51,739, while the median income for a family was 61,035.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What is the average family income in Boston?\\" OPTIONS: 1. yes 2. no","completion":"2. No The provided sentence does not give a valid answer to the question \\"What is the average family income in Boston?\\" because it mentions the median income instead of the average income. These two terms, though often used interchangeably in informal conversations, have different meanings and should not be confused with each other. To answer the question, let's first explore the differences between median and average incomes. Median income refers to the middle point of a data set where half of the data points fall below and half fall above it. In the context of the provided sentence, the median household income in Boston is 51,739, while the median income for a family is 61,035. This means that in the case of household income, half of the households in Boston earn below 51,739, and the other half earn above that amount. Similarly, with family income, half of the families in Boston earn below 61,035, and the other half earn above it. On the other hand, average income, also known as mean income, is calculated by adding up all the data points in a distribution and then dividing the total by the number of data points. The average income can sometimes be influenced by outliers, or extremely high or low values, which can lead to a distorted representation of the overall data. Without the actual average family income information in the provided sentence, we cannot definitively answer the question \\"What is the average family income in Boston?\\" We can only state that the median family income is 61,035, which is different from the average family income. To answer the question correctly, we would need to find the average family income data for Boston, which is not provided in the given sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

In the first quarter, Cleveland trailed early as Texans QB Matt Schaub completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Browns answered with QB Derek Anderson completing a 19-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards. However, Houston would retake the lead as kicker Kris Brown managed to get a 41-yard field goal. Fortunately, Cleveland regained the lead with Anderson completing a 7-yard TD pass to TE Kellen Winslow. In the third quarter, the Browns added onto their lead as kicker Phil Dawson getting a 25-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Cleveland pulled away with Dawson nailing a 27-yard field goal, along with RB Jamal Lewis getting a 1-yard TD run. The Texans' only response would be Schaub's 6-yard TD pass to TE Owen Daniels. With the win, the Browns improved to 7-4. This would also be the first time since 1994 that Cleveland had won five-straight home games. For Braylon Edwards (4 receptions for 57&#160;yards and 1 touchdown), who had 11 touchdown receptions on the year after this game, it would be the most by a Browns receiver since Gary Collins had 11 in 1963.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"The Gram stain is a method used in microbiology to differentiate bacterial species into two groups based on their cell wall composition; Gram-positive and Gram-negative. However, it is important to note that the Gram stain is not the ideal method for diagnosing tuberculosis. The causative agent of tuberculosis is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is an acid-fast bacillus and does not stain well using the Gram stain method due to the presence of unique lipids and a waxy coat. Instead, a technique called the acid-fast stain (Ziehl-Neelsen stain or Kinyoun stain) is used to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite the limitations of the Gram stain method for diagnosing tuberculosis, I will explain the Gram staining procedure in general. The steps of the Gram stain technique include: 1. Collection of sample: Sputum or other body fluid samples are collected from the patient and placed on a glass slide. 2. Heat fixation: The sample on the slide is heat-fixed by quickly passing it over a flame. This helps to adhere the bacteria to the slide and kills them without causing significant distortion of their cellular structure. 3. Crystal violet: The slide is then flooded with a basic purple dye called crystal violet for 1 minute, which stains all bacterial cells on the slide. 4. Iodine treatment: A mordant, Gram's iodine, is added to the slide, which forms a complex with the crystal violet, adhering the dye to the bacterial cell walls. 5. Decolorization: The slide is then washed using a decolorizing agent, commonly an alcohol-acetone solution. At this stage, the Gram-negative bacteria lose the crystal violet-iodine complex due to the dissolution of their outer membrane. Gram-positive bacteria retain the complex due to the presence of thick peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls. 6. Counterstain: The slide is then flooded with a secondary dye, safranin, for 1-2 minutes. Safranin stains the decolorized Gram-negative bacteria with a pink to red color, while the Gram-positive bacteria remain violet. 7. Microscopy: The slide is finally rinsed, dried and examined under a microscope. Based on the color of the bacteria, they can be classified as Gram-positive (purple) or Gram-negative (pink). Answering your second question, the Gram stain does not specifically help determine tuberculosis, as mentioned earlier. Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires acid-fast staining, which utilizes carbolfuchsin (a lipid-soluble red dye) and acid-alcohol (decolorizing agent) to distinguish acid-fast bacteria like Mycobacterium tuberculosis that retain the red dye, from non-acid-fast bacteria that do not retain the dye after decolorization. Regarding your third question, the two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question asks about the procedure of Gram staining for tuberculosis, while the second questions how Gram staining helps in determining tuberculosis. The answer to both questions is different in the sense that the first question elicits a response explaining the Gram staining method and why it's not suitable for diagnosing tuberculosis, while the second requires an explanation more targeted at the limitations of Gram stain in determining tuberculosis and alternatives like the acid-fast stain method."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: NEW YORK -- Tim Tebow is coming to New York. Really. After a big false start, the New York Jets pulled off a Tebow-like comeback Wednesday night, getting the quarterback who turned the Denver Broncos from an also-ran into a playoff team last season and became the NFL's most talked-about player -- for a fourth- and sixth-round draft pick. The Jets also agreed to pay 2.53 million of a salary advance due Tebow, league sources told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter, after the question of who would pay that advance nearly unraveled the trade and gave the Jacksonville Jaguars one last shot at bringing the ex-Florida Gators hero back home. Jacksonville offered the Broncos 3 million toward Tebow's salary advance and a fourth-round draft pick, league sources told Schefter. That pick, based on the draft \\"value chart\\" that teams use to determine how to use their picks, is more valuable than the picks the Jets offered, sources said. The Jets will pay the Broncos 1.5 million in 2012 and 1.03 million in 2013, a league source told ESPN sports business analyst Andrew Brandt. The payments will be made in 1/17th weekly installments. The Broncos eventually took the Jets' offer. And now Tebowmania will open on Broadway. There's sure to be plenty of drama -- just as there was from the moment the Jets pulled off the deal. Or thought they did, that is. \\"I'm thankful they stuck with me through this whole crazy process,\\" Tebow said during a call late Wednesday night, repeating several times that he was \\"excited\\" to be a member of the Jets and to play for coach Rex Ryan. Eight hours after initially agreeing to a trade, the teams completed it. It was hung up when the Jets, sources told Schefter, balked at repaying Denver more than 5 million for the salary advance due Tebow. The two sides agreed to split that cost, and Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum said the team was \\"comfortable with the compensation,\\" which included Denver's seventh-round pick in April's draft. He said there was a disagreement about how to handle the salary advance after Denver received the papers. \\"We knew what the contract was,\\" Tannenbaum said in a separate conference call Wednesday. \\"We had read it. ... We felt it was one way; they felt it was another. Based on that, they were well within their rights to assess their different possibilities of what to do and their alternatives. And they did so throughout the day.\\" The Jets and Broncos initially announced the trade just after 1 p.m. ET Wednesday. But then Denver, according to sources, asked the Jets to pay back a portion of bonuses and salary already paid to Tebow. Tebow was given a 6.2 million salary advance before the 2011 season, the sources said. Tebow's contract required the Jets to repay the advanced salaries for the 2012, 2013 and 2014 seasons, a total of about 5 million, according to sources. The Broncos expected the Jets to pay those advances per terms of the contract. The Jets balked at doing so, allowing the Jaguars to re-enter the picture. Tebow denied that he had final say in where he was going. ||||| The Tim Tebow trade ordeal appears to have finally ended. Update: Wednesday, March 21 at 8:55 p.m. ET The deal is done. Here's the latest from Schefter: Denver has agreed to trade Tim Tebow and a seventh-round pick to the Jets for the NY's fourth-round pick and a sixth-round pick. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 22, 2012 So that's it. Tebow is going to be a New York Jet. He will back up Mark Sanchez. You are free to go about your business, and we need not talk about Tebow anymore. [Crosses fingers]. Update: Wednesday, March 21 at 8:32 p.m. ET The Broncos are reportedly allowing Tebow to pick his next destination. Well, as long as said destination is Jacksonville or New York. ESPN's Adam Schefter has the news. Tim Tebow is being allowed to pick the team he wants to go to. He picks the trade. Jets or Jacksonville. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 22, 2012 Looks like Tim better start doing some serious Tebowing. Schefter summarized the trade mess in a series of tweets, starting with this one: Filed to ESPN (1): Denver and Jets have encountered hangup in language in Tim Tebow's contract that could nullify trade. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 21, 2012 The key problem is in the \\"recapture language\\" of Tebow's contract: Tim Tebow has 5 million worth of recapture language, meaning Jets would have to pay back money to Denver. Jets might be unwilling. Complex. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 21, 2012 Lastly, Schefter noted that this very issue is the reason why the Jacksonville Jaguars didn't pull the trigger on a deal for Tebow: The same money issues in Tim Tebow's contract caused complications for Jacksonville trying to complete trade. Now Jets facing them. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 21, 2012 In the event that the deal falls apart, Schefter reports that Tebow could be traded to the St. Louis Rams: (2) If the Tebow trade to Jets falls apart, St. Louis could wind up getting back into play. Sides sorting through details. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 21, 2012 Schefter has since reported that the Jacksonville Jaguars are already making an effort to steal Tebow from the Jets: More craziness filed to ESPN: Jaguars are back in the mix, seeing if they now can pull off a trade with Denver for Tim Tebow. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 21, 2012 The reality of this situation, according to Schefter, is this: Jets-Broncos agreed to Tim Tebow trade before Denver asked NY to pay back portion of bonuses and salary already paid to Tebow. No deal yet. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 21, 2012 Mike Klis of The Denver Post has posted a rundown of exactly what is going on right now. He notes that Tebow's contract requires any team acquiring Tebow has to pay back exactly 5.06375 million in advanced salaries for the 2012, 2013 and 2014 seasons. Jeff Darlington of NFL.com put it this way: Broncos source says Jets agreed to Tebow trade -- and it's their fault for not thoroughly reading contract. They contend trade should stand. — Jeff Darlington (@JeffDarlington) March 21, 2012 There's still a chance that the Broncos and Jets will get things squared away, but until they do, this trade is very much in danger of not happening. Of course, the Jets can make things easier on themselves by simply agreeing to pay the Broncos money, but it's not surprising that they're apparently not willing to do that. Why pay extra cash for a backup quarterback with a boatload of mechanical problems? ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short explanation of something that is longer and more detailed.

Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here. Brzezinski further stated: The fact that the Soviet government has enabled me to be here—and the Soviets know my views—is symbolic of the breach with Stalinism that perestroika represents. His remarks were given extensive coverage on Soviet television.

Mikhail Gorbachev was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1985 until 1991, and the last head of state of the Soviet Union, serving from 1988 until its dissolution in 1991. He implemented significant political, economic, and social reforms through his policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring), which contributed to the end of the Cold War and the eventual fall of communism in the Soviet Union as well as Eastern Europe. Gorbachev's decision to allow the Polish delegation to visit the Katyn memorial and acknowledge the truth about the massacre demonstrated his commitment to transparency and marked a break from the oppressive policies of the past. By acknowledging the Soviet Union's responsibility for the massacre at Katyn, and allowing the truth to be revealed, Gorbachev played a crucial role in fostering a new era of relations between the Soviet Union and Poland, paving the way for reconciliation and the eventual end of the division that characterized much of the 20th century between Eastern and Western Europe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Donald avoids cleaning the kitchen whenever possible.; B. Leslie avoids cleaning the kitchen whenever possible.;","completion":"Donald finds scrubbing the toilet disgusting but Leslie doesn't. While Donald cannot stand the idea of coming in contact with the grimy and dirty surfaces of the toilet, for him, cleaning the bathroom is a dreadful chore he would rather not undertake. On the other hand, Leslie has a different perspective and displays a level of resilience when facing this household task. She seems to possess a mental fortitude that allows her to approach this responsibility with a sense of pragmatism and efficiency, keeping the household running smoothly and in harmony. Interestingly, their attitudes towards cleaning are not limited to scrubbing the toilet. As we delve deeper into their cleaning habits, we uncover more about their preferences and responsibilities. Option A presents a scenario where Donald avoids cleaning the kitchen whenever possible. In this situation, it becomes clear that Donald has a general aversion to cleaning tasks. He may find them unappealing, overwhelming, or simply too time-consuming. This tendency to avoid cleaning may result in Donald delegating these chores to others in the household or finding alternative solutions, such as purchasing disposable kitchen items or employing the services of professional cleaners. However, if we were to choose option B, we would see that Leslie avoids cleaning the kitchen whenever possible. This contrast between her willingness to scrub the toilet and her reluctance to clean the kitchen suggests that Leslie has specific preferences when it comes to household chores. Perhaps she has developed a dislike for kitchen cleaning due to past experiences, or she finds the process of tackling greasy countertops, dirty dishes, and food particles frustrating and tiresome. As a result, Leslie's disinclination to clean the kitchen may lead her to employ similar strategies as Donald, assigning this task to others or seeking outside assistance. In conclusion, the differences in Donald and Leslie's attitudes toward cleaning highlight the unique preferences and approaches individuals may have when it comes to household chores. Whether they avoid certain tasks due to personal experiences, emotions, or efficiency concerns, these daily responsibilities can offer insight into the habits and characters of those living in the household. So, between the given options, both A and B portray distinct scenarios; Donald, who finds scrubbing the toilet disgusting, also avoids cleaning the kitchen whenever possible in option A, while in option B, it is Leslie who avoids the kitchen cleaning chore."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Questions: Sarah loved birds, but when they flew overhead she was covered with what? Options: - roof - sky - grieve - poop - molt Answer:","completion":"Sarah loved birds, and it's quite a natural sight to see them soaring through the sky. However, when birds fly overhead, there is a possibility that they might relieve themselves. Though it may not be a pleasant experience, it is a part of nature and something bird enthusiasts may occasionally encounter. Therefore, the option that is most in line with common sense to answer the question is \\"poop.\\" When birds are in flight and going about their daily routines, they sometimes defecate as a natural bodily function. This typically occurs when they are flying overhead, especially in large flocks. While bird watchers and enthusiasts like Sarah may enjoy observing and admiring the beauty of birds, it's essential to be aware of the potential for coming into contact with bird droppings during their activities. Bird droppings, or \\"poop,\\" can often be seen on various surfaces below where birds perch or fly, such as on rooftops, windowsills, vehicles, and sidewalks. While it might not be the most appealing aspect of bird watching, it serves as a reminder of the natural processes that all living creatures go through. Moreover, it's an opportunity to learn more about bird biology and the various characteristics that make birds such unique creatures. In conclusion, given the options provided, the most reasonable response to the question \\"Sarah loved birds, but when they flew overhead she was covered with what?\\" would be \\"poop.\\" This answer aligns with common sense and the understanding that birds, like all living organisms, need to excrete waste products as part of their biological processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: Two gardeners started their planting season at the same time. Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest. and a hint : A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. Please answer this question : Which gardener observed more improved water absorption from the soil? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bill, the gardener who used mycorrhizal fungi compost for the garden, observed more improved water absorption from the soil. The reasoning behind this is as follows: 1. Mycorrhizal fungi form a symbiotic association with the roots of the plant, providing direct access to glucose and other nutrients. 2. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant's root system, which in turn improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. 3. Bill used mycorrhizal fungi compost, which means his plants had a better root system with increased surface area, thus improving water absorption. 4. Hank used regular topsoil, which lacks the benefits of the mycorrhizal fungi in improving the root system and water absorption.

Translate to English","completion":"The same principle applies to the matter of imposing penalties: we must take this into account not only from the perspective that it should be possible to request compensation in the future. In discussing the issue of imposing penalties, it is crucial to analyze it from various angles and perspectives. This ensures that any imposed penalties are fair, just, and take into consideration the rights and interests of all the involved parties. Firstly, the objective of imposing penalties should be clearly defined. Typically, penalties serve as a deterrent against unlawful actions or breaches of contract, with the ultimate goal of ensuring compliance with established rules and regulations. Penalties should not be arbitrary or excessive, as they have the potential to discourage individuals or organizations from engaging in lawful activities. Secondly, in determining the appropriate penalties, the severity of the unlawful act or contractual breach must be considered. This requires a thorough evaluation of the specific circumstances surrounding the incident, including factors such as the frequency of the offense, the degree of harm or damage inflicted, and the intent or motivation of the offending party. Thirdly, it's essential to ensure that the imposed penalties are proportionate to the severity of the offense. This means that penalties should not be excessive or overly restrictive, thus avoiding potential issues related to human rights violations or unfair economic ramifications. Considering the possibility of requesting compensation in the future, it is crucial to strike the right balance between deterring unlawful behavior and safeguarding the rights and interests of all parties involved. By carefully examining the circumstances surrounding an incident and imposing fair and appropriate penalties, it becomes possible for the affected parties to seek compensation, should the need arise in the future. In conclusion, determining and applying penalties should be approached with great attention to the details and context of each specific situation. Ensuring that penalties are fair and proportionate while also considering the possibility of future compensation requests contributes to a more just and equitable system for all involved parties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

Here is an article: The bond between identical twins is undeniable – but sometimes sibling rivalry and a lack of personal identity get so severe, they bubble over into murder. Passers-by got more than they bargained for when they stopped to watch a cat fight between identical twins on the Hana Highway in Maui, Hawaii last month. Sisters Anastasia and Alexandria Duval were seen arguing in a car pulled over by the side of the road, cross words escalated and Anastasia was seen pulling Alexandria’s hair and screaming. Witnesses saw the vehicle “accelerate forward and then take a sharp left over the cliff” plunging 200ft onto rocks. The passenger, Anastasia, was pronounced dead at the scene while Alexandria, the driver, was taken to hospital in a critical condition. The 37-year-old has now appeared in court, charged with the second-degree murder of her sister. Prosecutors allege she intentionally drove off the cliff. This story is particularly shocking as we’re often told the almost magical bond between twins is “unbreakable”. The tale of Alexandria and Anastasia is the latest twin murder to make headlines, but there have been a number over the years. In 1998, San Diego student Gina Han masterminded a plot against her identical twin sister Sunny. The twins had become estranged in recent years after Gina was convinced that Sunny had taken some of her belongings. Gina and two friends hatched a plan to kill Sunny but it was botched when police burst into the apartment to rescue Sunny and her flatmate who were found bound and gagged. Gina was branded the “evil twin” in the press and was sentenced to 26 years to life. In 2014 British twin Robert Cerqua, was found guilty of murdering his identical brother Christopher during a New Year’s Eve brawl. After stabbing Christopher in the torso with a kitchen knife Robert left the house barefoot and continued to party until 2.20am when he was arrested. He passed out drunk in the police car. You may assume that this “twin bond” would add to the sense of grief. However, this isn’t always the case. When Robert Cerqua woke up drunk in the back of the police car he said: “Is he dead? You are lying, he cannot be.” On being charged the next day he allegedly said: “I killed my f****** brother. I don’t want to be here anymore. “Nine times out of 10 it would be all right. [That’s] just my luck, he had to die on me.” Twin loss expert Mary R. Morgan says that guilt often follows relief. “Relief can also surface at the end of a complex relationship, especially when there is a conflicted ‘personal identity versus twin bond’ issue.” So could murdering a twin be seen as an act of liberation? “Some twin pairs — not all — become disillusioned about their twinship because they struggle to be known, not just noticed,” twin expert and The Same but Different author Dr Joan A. Friedman explains. “Since outsiders relate to them as a unit, they expectedly have conflicts with their twin in an attempt to define their individual selves.” She says that most twin pairs eventually find ways to define their identity, but some twins aren’t so lucky. Take the case of Welsh twins June and Jennifer Gibbons, dubbed the \\"Silent Twins\\" due to their secret twin language and selective mutism. After a crime spree of arson and theft, the then 18 year olds were sent to Broadmoor, the UK’s highest security psychiatric hospital, where they both became convinced that in order to experience true freedom, one had to die. In her diary June wrote: “Nobody suffers the way I do ...

They convey the same meaning with slight rearrangement of words and structure. Let me explain step-by-step: 1. Identify the key components: EQ, digital master, and Griffin. Sentence 1: \\"No EQ was created when the Griffin digital master was used.\\" - Subject: No EQ - Action: was created - Condition: when the Griffin digital master was used Sentence 2: \\"There was no EQ created when the digital master was used by Griffin.\\" - Subject: There - Action: was no EQ created - Condition: when the digital master was used by Griffin 2.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. By. Jack Crone for MailOnline. A school nurse accused of failing to properly raise the alarm after meeting a 'tormented' teenager three times in the month before her suicide has been charged with professional misconduct. Donna Barbara Moore is said to have had several chances to assess 15-year-old Helena Farrell before the gifted pupil hanged herself in a woodland area near her home in Cumbria on January 4 last year. The nurse, who worked at Kirkbie Kendal School, where Helena was a student, has claimed that initially she 'didn't see the risk' that the tragic pupil would end her own life - despite the girl's extremely distressed state. Helena Farrell, pictured, was found dead in woodlands in Cumbria in January 2013 with Coldplay song The Scientist playing on repeat. Several accusations have now been brought against her - for which she must appear at the Old Bailey on September 1. In all of her time with Helena, it is alleged that she failed to refer her case to children's services or complete a safeguarding profile of the teenager - recording her deep issues. When Helena attempted suicide on December 4 2013 - one month before her death - by taking an overdose, the nurse allegedly failed to make a referral to Cumbria Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in a reasonable period of time - namely between 24 and 48 hours. This and other factors meant Helena did not get an appointment with a social worker from CAMHS until January 3 - the day before her death - where she was deemed as not posing an imminent risk to herself. The inquest in July at Kendal County Hall in Cumbria heard Helena was a ‘bright, intelligent, adventurous and fun-loving’ girl who was a gifted cellist and singer. During an inquest in July, Ms Moore spoke about her early meetings with Helena, saying: 'I asked her if she had thoughts about ending her life. She said \\"no, not really, I just feel up and down\\". At the time I didn't see the risk then.' Her alleged oversight was one of many apparent failings in the lead up to Helena's death. The teenager was academically very able and gifted in sports and music, playing hockey and also attending the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. In the months before her suicide she had become depressed after splitting up with a boyfriend and had self-harmed on several occasions. She had even written letters saying goodbye to her family and friends in the weeks leading up to her death - but they were confiscated by a teacher and later binned. Helena's parents, Enda & Maria Farrell, speak at the end of the inquest into their daughter's death. On January 4, the former Windermere School pupil was found hanged in woodland behind the Castle Green Hotel, Kendal - with Coldplay song The Scientist playing on repeat in the background. July's inquest into the death concluded that Helena died 'as a consequence of her own actions'. However the coroner at the inquest criticised the school nursing system after hearing that Donna Moore had responsibility at the time for the welfare of around 5,000 pupils across five secondary schools and at least 20 primary schools. The CAMHS have also come under heavy criticism for failing to offer Helena an appointment with a social worker until her mother, Maria, called them - despite the case being classed as 'urgent'. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said in a statement: 'We have conducted a confidential investigation into Donna Moore's conduct and await the outcome of the NMC hearing.' Helena is said to have become deeply depressed after splitting up with a boyfriend towards the end of 2012. Helena was said to be an extremely gifted student - after her death her parents said 'this unbearable tragedy has profoundly changed our lives' A Serious Case Review by Cumbria Local Safeguarding Children Board, part of Cumbria County Council, was published shortly after Helena's inquest, criticising child mental health care in the county. Helena's parents, Enda and Maria Farrell, have called for changes to the way the services are funded, organised and run. They said earlier this year: 'This unbearable tragedy has profoundly changed our lives.' What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

This single example cannot be used to make the generalization about the number of arboretums in the whole of France. While the presence of this arboretum certainly indicates that there is at least one arboretum in France, it does not provide evidence to suggest the scale or frequency of such institutions across the country. Therefore, based on this information alone, it is impossible to confirm whether France has many arboretums or not. In order to confirm this assumption, additional data would be required, describing the existence of other arboretums in various parts of France. That might include information such as the specific number of arboretums, their distribution across the country, and how common they are. With this additional data, a more objective conclusion about the number of arboretums in France could be drawn. In summary, a broader and more extensive overview of the presence of arboretums in France than presented here would be required to make a definite judgement on the matter.

I. yes; II. no;","completion":"I. yes; Your provided statement is correct. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, specifically the sperm and egg cells. During the process of fertilization, the sperm cell contributes 23 chromosomes from the father, and the egg cell provides another 23 chromosomes from the mother, resulting in a zygote with a full set of 46 chromosomes in most cases. These chromosomes contain the genes that make up an individual's entire genetic makeup. As organisms adapt and evolve over time, successful heritable traits are passed down through generations. Speciation events, which are instances when a new species arises due to reproductive isolation and genetic drift, may lead to the passing down of both ancestral traits that have proven beneficial and new traits that could potentially be advantageous in the offspring's environment. This process may eventually result in the emergence of distinct species with unique sets of genetic information, each well-suited to their environment and capable of surviving and reproducing under varying ecological conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sow grass and plant trees, shrubs and other greenery in bare spots in your yard or garden. The foliage will absorb excess water and protect the topsoil from the impact of rain, heavy wind and foot traffic. The roots of the plants will also help anchor the soil once they take hold, safeguarding the soil beneath from water runoff. Grass and plant roots also serve to draw nutrients from deep in the soil closer to the surface, improving the healthiness of the topsoil. Ryegrass and clover make excellent choices for basic groundcover, as their roots spread deep and hold fast. Other useful anchoring plants include grains such as wheat, barley, and rye and crops of root vegetables like radishes. If you have a field or flat, wide open space on your property, considering growing a row of trees to act as a barrier from the wind. This is known as a windbreak cover and is an efficient means of combating wind erosion often employed by landscapers. A windbreak cover will cut down on the amount of wind that sweeps an open area of land, keeping topsoil from being scattered and dried out. For best results, group trees or shrubs relatively close together so that little space exists between them for wind to penetrate. Choose tree species that develop thick foliage, like Eastern Red Cedar, Lombardy Poplar, and Red Pine. Look for areas where the ground is hard and bare. This is most often a symptom of compacted soil. Sew grass in these areas, and be sure to water and aerate the soil frequently. If not remedied, the soil below can become even more dense while the top layer erodes, making growing conditions inhospitable. When soil becomes compacted, its particles are pressed tightly together so that water cannot penetrate deep into its sublayers, causing the uppermost layers of soil to be worn away by runoff. In addition, soil compaction causes aeration problems within soil, meaning that it’s less likely that you’ll be able to get things to grow in places where the soil is badly compacted. Be careful about habitually walking in the same places if the soil in your yard or garden is compacted; this will just make the problem worse. Choose a new footpath to take, or stand on a broad, flat board when gardening to keep your body weight from contributing to soil compaction. Building a no-dig garden involves layering materials over the topsoil in which plants and crops can be planted so that there’s no need to disturb the soil itself. When gardening is done above the soil instead of within it, the soil will not be exposed to lots of harsh digging and watering that can damage soil and lead to erosion. Create multiple no-dig plots to serve as flower beds or patches for growing crops that require similar soil conditions. A wealth of different planting schemes exist, but all make use of the same basic structure: multiple tiers of compostable matter are layered over a permeable surface like cardboard directly on top of the ground. Look into different ideas for constructing your own no-dig garden. During peak growing season, spread a thin layer of mulch around the base of thriving plants. The weight of the mulch will keep the soil from being exposed to wind and water while also preserving important nutrients and moisture in the soil at root-level. Mulch can be bought cheap at any gardening center, or you can easily make your own at home by feeding scrap wood, live foliage and decaying plant matter into a shredder to form a composite.

Q: UPDATED: Sweet Cakes: State orders Oregon bakery owners to pay 135,000 for denying service to same-sex couple Updated at 2 p.m. Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian on Thursday ordered the owners of a former Gresham bakery to pay 135,000 in damages to a lesbian couple for refusing to make them a wedding cake. Avakian's ruling upheld a preliminary finding earlier this year that the owners of Sweet Cakes by Melissa had discriminated against the women on the basis of their sexual orientation. Bakery owners Melissa and Aaron Klein cited their Christian beliefs against same-sex marriage in denying service. The case ignited a long-running skirmish in the nation's culture wars, pitting civil rights advocates against religious freedom proponents who argued business owners should have the right to refuse services for gay and lesbian weddings. Avakian's final order makes clear that serving potential customers equally trumps the Kleins' religious beliefs. Under Oregon law, businesses cannot discriminate or refuse service based on sexual orientation, just as they cannot turn customers away because of race, sex, disability, age or religion, the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries said in a news release. \\"This case is not about a wedding cake or a marriage,\\" Avakian wrote. \\"It is about a business's refusal to serve someone because of their sexual orientation. Under Oregon law, that is illegal. \\"Within Oregon's public accommodations law is the basic principle of human decency that every person, regardless of their sexual orientation, has the freedom to fully participate in society. The ability to enter public places, to shop, to dine, to move about unfettered by bigotry.\\" Though the Oregon Equality Act of 2007 includes an exemption for religious organizations and schools, it does not permit private business owners to deny service and discriminate against potential customers, BOLI said. The commissioner ordered the Kleins to pay 75,000 to Rachel Bowman-Cryer and 60,000 to Laurel Bowman-Cryer. His ruling may be appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals. Anna Harmon, one of three lawyers representing the Kleins, said Thursday an appeal is likely. \\"That's up to our clients,\\" Harmon said. \\"I believe at this point they are intending to preserve their constitutional rights as much as they can, and that would look like an appeal.\\" In a statement issued through their attorney, Paul A. Thompson, the Bowman-Cryers thanked BOLI for \\"sending a clear message that discrimination will simply not be tolerated in our state.\\" \\"This has been a terrible ordeal for our entire family. We never imagined finding ourselves caught up in a fight for social justice,\\" they said. \\"We endured daily, hateful attacks on social media, received death threats and feared for our family's safety, yet our goal remained steadfast. We were determined to ensure that this kind of blatant discrimination never happened to another couple, another family, another Oregonian.\\" The controversy began in January 2013 when the Kleins turned away Rachel Cryer, as she was known then, and her mother from their bakery. In August 2013, Cryer and her partner complained to the state Bureau of Labor and Industries. The agency conducted an investigation and in January 2014 brought charges that the Kleins had unlawfully discriminated against the couple because of their sexual orientation. BOLI investigators said the Kleins' refusal violated the women's civil rights and recommended they pay 75,000 in damages to each woman for emotional suffering. That triggered a conciliation process between the two parties to see if a settlement could be reached. The Kleins and the state, acting on the women's behalf, could not agree, so the case went before Alan McCullough, a BOLI administrative law judge. During a hearing in March, both women testified to the emotional stress they attributed to their experience with Sweet Cakes as well as the glare of media attention that followed. On Jan. 17, 2013, Cryer brought her mother, Cheryl McPherson, to a cake tasting appointment she had set up with Melissa Klein. That day, Melissa stayed home with the couple's twin 8-month-old-boys and Aaron went to the bakery. When he asked for the names of the bride and groom, Cryer said there would be two brides. \\"I said, 'I'm very sorry, I believe I have wasted your time. We do not do cakes for same sex weddings,' \\" Klein testified. Aaron Klein said his family, too, had suffered because of the case. Reporters came to his home and his shop, he testified during the March hearing. The Sweet Cakes by Melissa car was vandalized and broken into twice. Photographers and florists severed ties with the company, eventually forcing Sweet Cakes to close the Gresham shop in September 2013. The business now operates out of the couple's home in Sandy. Following the hearing, McCullough recommended 75,000 in damages be awarded to Rachel Bowman-Cryer and 60,000 to Laurel Bowman-Cryer. This post will be updated. -- George Rede grede@oregonian.com 503-294-4004 @georgerede ||||| Bureau of Labor and Industries’ ruling comes after Portland-area shop Sweet Cakes by Melissa would not bake wedding cake, but bakers could appeal The owners of a Portland-area bakery that denied service to a same-sex couple must pay 135,000 in damages, the bureau of labor and industries has ruled. The damages are for emotional suffering caused by Sweet Cakes by Melissa, which two years ago refused to bake a wedding cake for Laurel and Rachel Bowman-Cryer. A 2007 Oregon law protects the rights of LGBT people in employment, housing and public accommodations. It provides an exemption for religious organisations, but the agency ruled that exemption does not allow private businesses to discriminate against potential customers. “This case is not about a wedding cake or a marriage. It is about a business’s refusal to serve someone because of their sexual orientation. Under Oregon law, that is illegal,” Oregon labor commissioner Brad Avakian said in the final order. In April, an administrative law judge proposed the same damages. The bakers said their refusal to bake for the couple was prompted by religious beliefs. The case has been cited in the national debate over religious freedom and discrimination against gays. Bakery owners Aaron and Melissa Klein closed their Gresham store in 2013 and operate the business from home. They can still file an appeal with the Oregon court of appeals. One of the Kleins’ attorneys, Anna Harmon, criticised the order, saying it was a case of “an overpowered elected official using his position to root out thought and speech with which he personally disagrees”. Avakian’s order is unconstitutional, Harmon said, because “the right to speak freely, to think uniquely, and to live according to our faith is the bedrock of this country”. But Jeana Frazzini, co-director of the gay-rights group Basic Rights Oregon, praised the order. “This case struck a chord with many Oregonians because allowing businesses to deny goods and services to people because of who they are and whom they love is hurtful and wrong,” she said in a statement. ||||| A:","completion":"Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian has ordered the owners of the former Gresham bakery, Sweet Cakes by Melissa, to pay 135,000 in damages to a lesbian couple for refusing to make them a wedding cake.

No, it is not possible to conclude that \\"A girl is jumping on the bed\\" if \\"The girl has no bed.\\" Given the information provided, we can analyze it as follows: 1. The first statement declares that \\"A girl is jumping on the bed.\\" Based on this information alone, we can visualize a situation where a girl is jumping on a bed. This suggests that a bed exists and the girl is using it as a platform for her jumping activity. 2. The second statement contradicts the first statement, asserting that \\"The girl has no bed.\\" This implies that there is no bed available for the girl to jump on. If the girl does not have a bed, then it is not possible for the girl to jump on a bed. Considering both statements, there is a clear contradiction between them. Logically, the girl cannot be jumping on a non-existent bed. Therefore, the answer is (c). No, it is not possible to conclude that \\"A girl is jumping on the bed\\" if \\"The girl has no bed.\\" The other choices are not viable options because: (a). Yes - This answer would assume that the girl can jump on a bed even if there isn't one, which defies logic. (b). It is not possible to tell - This answer would be appropriate if both statements were vague or if there was insufficient information to establish a logical conclusion.

Packing for the shipment, the employee used the cheaper tape but more expensive box because the","completion":"company had a surplus of high-quality boxes. This decision was justified as the excess boxes needed to be used up before they took up too much storage space. Additionally, the boxes provided a more secure packaging for the products, compensating for the lower quality tape. Step 1: Gather the necessary materials The employee first collected all the required packing materials, including the more expensive boxes, cheaper tape, and necessary padding to keep the items safe during transit. Step 2: Arrange the products in the box Carefully selecting an appropriately-sized high-quality box, the employee meticulously organized the items to ensure maximum efficiency and minimize movement during shipment. This was crucial because the more expensive boxes offered better structural integrity, making it even more important to utilize their full potential. Step 3: Add padding to protect items The employee added extra padding materials like bubble wrap, air packets, or foam peanuts to provide additional protection and cushioning to the products. This step helped guarantee that the items would remain unharmed, despite the use of cheaper tape. Step 4: Seal the box using cheaper tape With the products properly arranged and safeguarded, the employee sealed the box using the cheaper tape. While they understood that the lower quality tape might not hold as well over time, they applied multiple layers to reinforce the package as much as possible. This ensured that the tape would not give out during transit and compromise the security of the package. Step 5: Label the box and prepare for shipping Finally, the employee attached the shipping label and any other necessary documentation to the package's exterior. They carefully checked all information, ensuring accuracy in order to avoid any shipping delays or lost packages. Step 6: Load the boxes for shipment Once the package was appropriately sealed and labeled, the employee carefully loaded it onto a cart or pallet with other packages. This step required attentiveness to stack the packages in a way that would not put any undue stress on the cheaper tape or compromise the structural integrity of the more expensive boxes. Overall, the employee's decision to use the cheaper tape along with the more expensive box still upheld the company's commitment to securely deliver products to their customers. By strategizing the packing process and paying attention to detail at each step, they ensured that the shipment would reach its destination intact, without any negative impact due to their choice of materials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What will happen with this relationship ?","completion":"Given the context provided, several outcomes are possible for this relationship, depending on the actions and decisions of both individuals involved. Based on the limited information available, the following scenarios can be expanded upon: 1. Open communication: The individuals might decide to openly discuss their feelings and the situation they find themselves in. Clear communication can lead to a mutual understanding of each other's fears and insecurities, fostering a deeper emotional connection. By addressing concerns head-on and acknowledging the thoughts that are troubling both partners, they might strengthen their relationship and reinforce the commitment to being together. 2. Temporary separation: If the woman decides that she needs some space, the couple might choose to take a break from the relationship to assess their feelings and emotions. During this period, both partners may reflect on the positive and negative aspects of the relationship, allowing them to determine whether continuing the relationship is the right choice for them. After some time apart, the couple might reunite with a clearer perspective and newfound appreciation for each other, if they believe the relationship is worth pursuing. 3. Permanent breakup: If the woman ultimately decides that she cannot handle the emotional pressure or her feelings have changed, she might choose to end the relationship. In this case, the couple would face the challenge of dealing with the aftermath of the breakup, including emotional pain, loss, and potential resentment. Both partners might learn from the experience and eventually move on to find happiness and fulfillment through other relationships or personal growth. 4. Gradual withdrawal: In a scenario where the couple chooses not to openly address the situation, the relationship may slowly deteriorate as they avoid discussing their feelings and fears. As the emotional distance between them grows, they might become less enthusiastic about spending time together, eventually leading to dissatisfaction and potentially a breakup. This gradual fading of the relationship might make it easier for both partners to emotionally detach and find closure. 5. External factors: Outside forces, such as family, friends, or career opportunities, may also influence the direction of the relationship. These extrinsic factors might lead the couple to prioritize their individual needs and goals, possibly causing them to drift apart or make decisions that can impact the continuation of the relationship. If this occurs, the eventual outcome will largely depend on the couple's ability and willingness to navigate these external pressures'. Ultimately, the future of the relationship hinges upon how both individuals choose to approach and address the uncertainty they are experiencing. By maintaining open communication and understanding, they may have the potential to resolve their issues and strengthen their bond. However, if they fail to confront their emotions and fear, the relationship might succumb to external pressures or gradually deteriorate. Time, reflection, and communication will play vital roles in determining the direction and future of their relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

His life is disrupted when the store's night security guard is murdered. The local police have no leads, and show no interest in investigating further. Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker and loving father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental-health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent divorce. The watch members use the group as an excuse to drink and have fun (much to Evan's annoyance). While driving on patrol, they accidentally hit something. They discover a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly-destructive weapon, and deduce that it is of alien origin. Meanwhile, several more townspeople are mysteriously killed. The watch responds to the murders and encounters an alien, which attacks them. Evan (apparently) kills it with a lawn gnome before the group returns with the creature to Bob's house. The creature regains consciousness and escapes, stealing the metallic orb and warning them that the aliens have already infiltrated the town. The watch theorizes that the aliens are stealing their victims' skin and disguising themselves as humans, so anyone in Glenview could be an alien. Bob confides to Evan that he is worried about his daughter Chelsea (Erin Moriarty), and does not trust her boyfriend Jason (Nicholas Braun). Evan admits that he has been avoiding his wife Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt) because he is infertile, and revealing that to her may cause her to leave.

Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A.

Host countries, on the other hand, may benefit from a diverse cultural exchange and the enhancement of their economies through the increase in the workforce and skill set diversity.

Countries receiving the migrants could experience potential strains on resources and infrastructure, especially if the inflow is sudden and significant. 2. Rules and Legal Frameworks: The process of international mobility and migration requires adherence to certain rules and legal frameworks. These may include visa restrictions, qualification standards for work or study, and international agreements on the rights and protection of migrants. For example, the United Nations has developed the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, offering guidance and support to governments and migrants alike. 3. Challenges: International mobility and migration often give rise to many challenges. For migrants, this may involve leaving their families, language barriers, cultural adjustments, and finding suitable employment or housing in a new environment. For governments and host societies, challenges include providing adequate support and resources to aid integration, managing the potential social and economic impacts, and addressing public concerns. 4. Creating Solutions: Addressing the issues related to international mobility and migration requires the collaboration of governments, international organizations, and civil society. Solutions may involve adopting effective integration policies, offering language courses and cultural exchange programs, investing in infrastructure improvements, and engaging in constructive dialogue to address any community concerns. Additionally, by fostering mutual understanding and respect, societies can work towards providing a more welcoming environment for migrants and leveraging the numerous benefits that international migration may offer. In conclusion, international mobility and migration present a complex landscape of opportunities, risks, legal frameworks, and challenges. By working together, finding effective solutions that benefit both migrants and host countries can lead to the successful integration of new members into society and the overall enrichment of global communities."},{"prompt":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In the United States, every year, Thanks-giving Day is on the fourth Thursday in November.
