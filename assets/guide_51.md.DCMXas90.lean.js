The video documentary then transitions, with excited background music, to show Noah's incredible adventure walking with dinosaurs. Noah, accompanied by paleontologist Thomas Huxley, tours the exhibit of animatronic dinosaurs, marveling at the detailed creatures. Their journey begins with the herbivorous Triceratops, followed by other magnificent species like Pachycephalosaurus and Stegosaurus. Noah takes every opportunity to ask questions, each query followed by Huxley's detailed and informative answers. This turns into an educational segment, too, allowing the audience to learn alongside Noah. As Noah's VIP tour continues, he encounters a nest full of Velociraptor eggs, and watches in awe as the eggs move and the baby dinosaurs start to hatch. In another shot, Noah is seen riding an Ankylosaurus with a loving and protective look in his eyes. Huxley explains that the Ankylosaurus was a plant-eating species with strong defenses, sparking a conversation on how not all dinosaurs were as fearsome as Noah had expected. The climax of the video takes place when Noah comes face-to-face with a massive Tyrannosaurus Rex. He stares up at the colossal creature with a mix of terror, excitement, and wonder. As the T-Rex approaches, Noah takes Huxley's advice to remain motionless, while Huxley reassures him this T-Rex is well-trained. Now more at ease, Noah uses this encounter as an opportunity to learn about the T-Rex, discovering their behavioral and territorial patterns, as well as their role in the ecosystem. He slowly gains confidence and becomes less afraid, eventually touching the T-Rex, much to his amazement. After an exhilarating day filled with adventure, Noah returns to The Ellen DeGeneres Show to share his unforgettable experiences. Both Ellen and the audience applaud Noah's courage and sense of curiosity. Ellen, impressed by Noah's enthusiasm, rewards him with a surprise dinosaur gift and invites him to join her on another episode as a special correspondent. The video ends with a montage of clips from Noah's journey, capturing the essence of his wonder, admiration, and growth.

The Rill Lodge and Ski Resort in Colorado is holding its 50th Annual Winter Carnival and is expecting a record turnout. Unbeknownst to the assembled people, however, something is lurking in the woods, not quite human and not quite animal. Two friends skiing on the North slope, Heidi (Annie McEnroe) and Jennifer (Kathy Christopher), find mysterious tracks and hear some disturbing noises coming from the woods. Heidi takes off, but Jennifer lags behind and is set upon by a monstrous beast.Tony Rill (Robert Logan), manager of the resort, is summoned and told that a female skier was found, babbling incoherently about some sort of monster and her missing friend. Rill, doubtful at first, listens to Heidi's story and, despite being unsettled by what he hears, surmises that it was probably a grizzly bear. He and a search party set out and split up to find Jennifer. Rill comes upon a remote stretch where he finds Jennifer's jacket, bloody and torn to shreds. He also hears a monstrous roar come from the woods and turns just in time to glimpse something white, hairy and massive at the edge of the treeline.Meanwhile, back at the resort, Gar Seberg (Bo Svenson) and his wife Ellen (Yvette Mimieux) arrive. Seberg, a former Olympic Ski champion, has fallen on hard times and has come to Colorado to see if his old friend Rill can give him a job. As they step into the main building, Seberg gets the brushoff from a worried Rill, and begins to feel that this whole thing was a bad idea. Rill, meanwhile, informs his grandmother, and owner of the resort, Carrie Rill (Sylvia Sidney) about what he saw and heard, and tells her that they should put up signs restricting access to the area and inform the sheriff. Carie, however, is put off by the thought of a story about some wild man-beast roaming the slopes hurting business, and convinces Rill that while no one will believe Heidi, his word is another matter altogether. She agrees that he should merely post signs around the slopes warning of possible avalanches, arguing that... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Snowbeast,\\" the character Gar Seberg is attacked by the titular Snowbeast, which is a monstrous creature hiding in the woods near the Rill Lodge and Ski Resort in Colorado. The Snowbeast is a large, white, hairy creature, neither fully human nor animal, causing panic and fear among the people attending the 50th Annual Winter Carnival at the resort. The attack on Gar is a significant event in the film, as it serves to solidify the presence and danger of the mysterious creature lurking in the woods. Prior to this, reports and evidence of the Snowbeast's existence were met with skepticism, particularly by Tony Rill, the resort manager. Even after finding Jennifer's jacket and witnessing a glimpse of the creature, Rill was still hesitant to warn the public about the monstrous threat. Before the attack on Gar, he and his wife Ellen arrive at the resort seeking employment from his old friend Tony Rill. Although Rill is preoccupied with the unsettling events surrounding the Snowbeast, Gar manages to get involved in the situation. His encounter with the Snowbeast proves to be a turning point in the film. As a former Olympic Ski champion, Gar's involvement and the subsequent attack on him make it harder for Rill and other characters to ignore or dismiss the looming threat of the Snowbeast. Furthermore, this attack on Gar adds tension and urgency to the film's plot, as the resort's management is forced to confront the reality of the dangerous beast lurking nearby. Owner Carrie Rill is particularly concerned about the potential impact on their business, choosing to keep the information about the Snowbeast under wraps from their guests. However, as the attacks continue and the danger becomes increasingly apparent, the characters in the film must make a collective decision to confront and respond to the terrifying presence of the Snowbeast in their midst. In conclusion, the attack on Gar Seberg by the Snowbeast serves as a pivotal moment in the movie. It establishes both the potency of the threat and the need for the characters to take action against the monstrous creature endangering their resort and the people attending the Winter Carnival. The Snowbeast's attack on a prominent and accomplished character like Gar Seberg reinforces the significance of the threat, forcing the resort's management to confront and respond to the danger lurking in the woods, and setting the stage for the film's climax."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mike Pence is being sued over his decision to suspend the resettlement of Syrian refugees in his state. Pence is accused of violating the Constitution by accepting refugees from other countries but not those from Syria following last week’s violent terrorist attacks in Paris that killed at least 130 people. The federal lawsuit was filed late Monday by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana on behalf of Indianapolis-based nonprofit Exodus Refugee Immigration. “There is no border around the state of Indiana that prevents people from entering our state who may move freely within the United States,” ACLU of Indiana legal director Ken Falk said in a statement. Pence, 56, had halted Indiana’s plans to resettle Syrian refugees last week after European officials said a Syrian citizen was among the attackers in Paris. He and 26 other U.S. governors later penned a letter to President Barack Obama on Friday urging him to halt all resettlement plans in the country until proper security measures have been achieved.” “We are deeply concerned that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria may have exploited the generosity of the refugee system to carry out Friday’s terrorist attack in Paris,” the memo said. Pence did not immediately return requests for comment Tuesday. The U.S. has resettled about 1,800 refugees from Syria so far in 2015, according to the State Department. The lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop the temporary block. “Indiana is a welcoming state known for our hospitality,” Exodus Executive Director Carleen Miller said. “History will judge us in this moment – whether we take the moral stand for victims of war and persecution in their time of need or reject our core principles by giving in to fear and terror.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Indiana Governor Mike Pence faces a lawsuit for suspending the resettlement of Syrian refugees in Indiana, accusing him of violating the Constitution by accepting refugees from other countries but not from Syria.

Instead, the older boy allegedly beat the woman with the handle of a sword, Chamberlin said, adding, \\"I think that was their original plan, to cut her open, but then they changed their minds.\\" The woman was left bloodied with head injuries after the incident Tuesday, and remained hospitalized Friday in stable condition at a local hospital. The boys were arrested after a crime spree that included auto theft, burglary and vandalism, authorities said. The injured woman was found in her home by deputies responding to call; nearby were two knives and a sword with a bent handle. After deputies found no sign of forced entry into the woman's house, a manhunt was launched for the two teenagers. Deputies were called to the home of the 14-year-old's father when the man realized his 2005 Dodge Durango SUV was missing, and shortly afterward a call came in about a vehicle hit-and-run. The Durango was found at the accident scene but the teenagers were not. Deputies then received a call of a residential burglary in process. \\"The place was damaged. There were kicked holes in the wall,\\" Chamberlin said, \\"Just malicious mischief.\\" A state patrol trooper spotted the two teens running from the scene of the burglary, they were caught and arrested. The teens, whose names were not released, were booked on juvenile charges of second-degree assault, taking a motor vehicle without permission, residential burglary , second-degree malicious mischief and hit-and-run, Chamberlin said. The son of the injured woman later told deputies that he had been taking \\"blue pills\\" and would never do anything like the alleged crimes while sober,\\" according to Chamberlin. \\"It could be anything, it could be ecstasy, it had to have been some type of opium, hallucinogen...We were never able to collect any (pills),\\" Chamberlin said. Both teens have been appointed public defenders. CNN did not receive an immediate response from the Spokane County public defender's office Friday.

Mal'akh places Langdon into an airtight sensory deprivation tank, where he interrogates Langdon by slowly filling the tank with liquid. He is able to convince Langdon to decipher the code at the pyramid's base, but continues to fill the tank until Langdon drowns and apparently dies. Mal'akh then ties Katherine to a chair and inserts an open-ended transfusion needle into her arm and leaves her to bleed to death then flees with a weakened and wheelchair-bound Peter Solomon to the Temple Room of the Scottish Rite's House of the Temple. He uses the threat of not calling an ambulance for Katherine as further coercion for Peter's cooperation. Sato leads a team of agents to the mansion after Langdon and Katherine's escort fails to check in and are able to save Katherine's life. After a near-death experience, Langdon is revealed to have survived due to the \`\`water'' in the tank actually being breathable oxygenated liquid and the tank being a device for meditation. Sato, Langdon and Simkins race to the House of the Temple where Mal'akh threatens to release a heavily edited video showing government officials performing secret Masonic rituals (the same video that Sato showed to Bellamy), which without context, appears highly disturbing. Mal'akh forces the Word--the unpronounceable circumpunct--out of Peter and tattoos it on his head on the last portion of unmarked skin on his body. Mal'akh then orders Peter to sacrifice him, as he believes that it is his destiny to become a demonic spirit and lead the forces of evil. When Peter claims that he will do so without hesitation to avenge his son and mother, Mal'akh shocks Peter by revealing that he is actually Zachary Solomon himself, having conspired with the prison warden to fake his death by disfiguring the body of another inmate beyond recognition (at the same time, Katherine and Bellamy discover several photos of Zachary in Greece after his supposed death that show his gradual transformation into Mal'akh). With tears in his eyes, Peter prepares to stab Zachary but ultimately cannot bring himself to do so and drops the knife just as Langdon arrives and tackles him. Director Sato arrives at the Temple in a helicopter, which smashes the Temple's skylight, the shards of which fatally impale Zachary. The CIA then thwart Zachary's plan to transmit the video to several leading media channels using an EMP blast, disabling a cell tower in the network path leading from Zachary's laptop computer. Katherine arrives and she and Langdon then share a tearful reunion with Peter and mourn Zachary's death. Zachary is only briefly able to lament his body's mutilation before dying.

Luckily we found his,\\" says a lawyer for a man who has been freed after serving 17 years for a crime he always insisted he didn't commit. Richard Jones was released by a Kansas judge after lawyers presented evidence that there is another man who bears an uncanny resemblance to him and that witnesses could not tell the two of them apart, the Kansas City Star reports. There was never any physical evidence linking Jones to the 1999 robbery he was sent to prison for. Jones' girlfriend and family members backed up his alibi, but he was convicted after witnesses, including the robbery victim, identified him.

Jones was released by a Kansas judge after lawyers presented evidence revealing the existence of another man bearing a striking resemblance to him, leading to potential witness confusion. The similarity between the two men became the crucial point in eventually exonerating Jones. Besides their nearly identical appearances, the two men had no known connections. The case began in 1999 when Jones was convicted based on eyewitness testimony, despite there being no physical evidence connecting him to the crime. Jones' girlfriend and family members provided his alibi, stating he was with them at the time the crime took place. However, the witnesses, including the robbery victim, identified Jones as the perpetrator. Last week, the victim testified that she can no longer be certain Jones was indeed the robber. While in prison, Jones heard from fellow inmates about another prisoner who looked strikingly similar to him and shared the same first name. This other individual lived near the scene of the crime and resembled Jones more closely, based on certain distinct facial features and skin marks that the actual criminal was said to possess. No criminal case has been filed yet against this other person. Jones' arrest occurred months after the robbery when a witness selected his photo from a lineup of around 200 people named Richard. Other witnesses were shown a photo lineup in which Jones was the only light-skinned person. This method of identification was a significant factor that led to Jones' wrongful conviction. During his time in prison, Jones became a grandfather. His release was made possible by the Midwest Innocence Project, which helped uncover the existence of the doppelganger and provided essential support in proving Jones' innocence.

Summarize: It must have been brought home forcefully with the visit of an all-party delegation of Indian parliamentarians to Sri Lanka last week. Although India supported the war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam it was wrong to presume that it would turn a blind eye to Colombo's indifference towards resolving the Tamil question since the war ended three years ago. Its error should have been apparent to Colombo when Delhi voted for the resolution in the UN Human Rights Council castigating Sri Lanka for the abuses committed by its armed forces against the Tamil militants during the three decades of war. The parliamentarian delegation, the first high level one from India after the UN vote, was led by opposition leader Sushma Swaraj. While MPs from the Tamil parties DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) and the AIADMK (All India Anna DMK) had withdrawn from it, the other members - including some Tamil speaking MPs - were also of two minds because of aggressive statements on the Koodankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu state by a Sri Lankan minister virtually on the eve of the visit. Despite the situation not being politically propitious, the delegation still went ahead. Sushma Swaraj made only one public statement at the end of the visit. She urged Colombo to \\"reach a genuine reconciliation\\" based on \\"a meaningful devolution of powers which takes into account the legitimate needs of the Tamil people for equality, dignity, justice and self-respect\\". The opposition leader spoke in the same voice as the government of India - suggesting that there was weariness across the political class in India with Colombo's reluctance to devolve power to Sri Lanka's Tamil minority. The shift in India's position towards Sri Lanka as manifested in the UN Human Rights Council vote has been ascribed to several factors. One theory is that there was a backroom deal between the national government and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa that she would allow the Koodankulam nuclear power plant in her state to become operational if the government voted for the resolution. Other theories are that the government was forced to keep the DMK in good humour due to coalition compulsions and that India gave in to US pressure to support the Washington-sponsored resolution on human rights violations in Sri Lanka. It would be an error to conclude, however, that such tactical factors alone were responsible for the change in India's position. What happens to Sri Lankan Tamils has an emotional and often a political echo in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Even during the conflict with the LTTE, while India supported military action against the militant forces, it always cautioned Colombo about protecting the rights of the Tamil civilian population and ensuring their welfare. President Mahinda Rajapaksa has assured India several times about his commitment to a constitutional amendment to devolve powers to the Tamils. It was passed in 1987 as a result of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord but its legality has been questioned in the Supreme Court. So although President Rajapaksa talks of a devolution process that would be more than that promised earlier - he calls it \\"13th amendment PLUS\\", there is uncertainty about what this would mean. Many ministers in the Rajapaksa government are openly opposed to devolution and the president himself seems to be backtracking on it. A parliamentary select committee which will make suggestions on the Tamil issue is yet to be set up. Colombo, however, has failed to read India's disappointment with bilateral efforts. If it had started negotiations for devolution with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the UNHRC resolution imbroglio may not have taken place. The all-party parliamentarians' delegation emphasised these issues - urging that a dialogue be restarted in which the TNA is given an honourable role and that the parliamentary select committee on devolution be set up soon. Most importantly, it left Colombo in no doubt that the Indian political parties were united on this issue. Having created an anti-West frenzy it may not be easy for the Rajapaksa government to back away from it. It derives its social power from a peculiar psyche - of Sri Lanka (that is, the majority Sinhalas) being isolated by evil powers. However, the Rajapaksa government could still move in the direction that Delhi is pushing it. While maintaining its anti-West, anti-imperialist facade, it could compromise on implementing the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission's recommendations. That would be the pragmatic way forward. Delhi after all is not seeking regime change in Colombo. The visit by Indian parliamentarians shows that the Indian policy of engagement with Colombo will continue unabated. However, so will the pressure for a permanent reconciliation with the Sri Lankan Tamils. Summary:","completion":"An all-party delegation of Indian parliamentarians visited Sri Lanka, emphasizing the need for a genuine reconciliation with the Tamil minority through a meaningful devolution of powers. Despite India's support for the war against the Tamil Tigers, it disapproves of Colombo's reluctance to resolve the Tamil issue. The Indian delegation, led by opposition leader Sushma Swaraj, urged the Sri Lankan government to engage with the Tamil National Alliance and establish a parliamentary select committee on devolution. India will continue to engage with Sri Lanka while maintaining pressure for a permanent reconciliation with the Sri Lankan Tamils."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The book aroused international interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much of the initial reaction was hostile, but Darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas.

Plot title: Ramana Movie plot: The film is about Ramana (Vijayakanth) who decides to abolish corruption altogether with the help of his students who are now working in various government offices. The reason behind this powerful decision is told in the flashback. Ramana is a happy professor with his wife (played by Simran) and daughter. And one day when Ramana is out to make some purchases, the entire neighbourhood collapses due to some fault in the construction and many of the residents including Simran and her daughter lose their lives. Ramana rushes to the Government Officials when he comes to know that all this was due to one person namely Vijayan, an industrialist with the necessary proof. But the incidents that he faces at the office, and on finding that these officials who are now corrupt to the core are mere puppets in the hands of Vijayan he gets frustrated on the situation and this makes him to form the ACF (Anti Corruption Force). 15 Thasildars are found missing and then the police find that 14 of them have been released after 3 days but one of them is killed. They find some files and a tape along with the body of the dead thasildar. These files carry details of why the kidnap of the 15 thasildars had been done and the reason for the murder of one of them and have the words ACF written on it. It is understood by the police that these men where the thasildars who had indulged themselves in bribery and that they were the top 15 of the list of the corrupt thasildars. ACF sends the tape, with the message that they shall continue the kidnap of the corrupt officers in all the departments and that the No.1 corrupt shall be sentenced to death according to the law of the Anti Corruption Force. There is fear among the corrupt officials. They come forward to file their returns. For a while there are no illegal transactions done, but the corruption soon continues in the society due to the threatening of the local mob to sign illegal documents and accept bribes. Meanwhile, the ACF finds that it is Vijayan who is the real reason behind this... My question: Who kills Vijayan? A:","completion":"In the movie Ramana, Vijayan is the industrialist responsible for the corruption and the tragedy that befalls Ramana's family and neighborhood. Since the plot summary does not explicitly tell us who kills Vijayan, there is room for speculation and creative interpretation. One possibility is that Ramana, as the leader of the Anti Corruption Force (ACF), kills Vijayan himself in order to exact revenge for the loss of his wife and daughter, as well as to send a strong message to other corrupt officials. This would be a powerful and defining moment in the film, showcasing Ramana's commitment to eradicating corruption and fighting for justice. Another possibility is that one of Ramana's students and ACF members kills Vijayan. As the students are integral to the ACF's mission, it would be fitting for one of them to step up and deliver the final blow against the main antagonist. This could also lead to a stronger bond between Ramana and his students, emphasizing the teamwork and unity required to combat corruption. A third alternative is that Vijayan is not directly killed by any of the protagonists, but rather meets his end due to his own actions or the consequence of his corruption. For instance, he could be betrayed by one of his allies or underlings who desire to take his place, or he could be caught in a situation caused by the compromised buildings that he was responsible for. This would serve as a poetic justice for his character and a warning to others that corruption often leads to self-destruction. Ultimately, the choice of who kills Vijayan will depend on the overall message and tone the director wishes to convey to the audience. Each option has its own unique implications and emotional impact, making this decision an important one for the overall success of the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: In Toulouse, Muslims Fear Diversity Is at Risk Jewish and Muslim leaders marched together silently on Sunday to honor the four people who were killed by Mohammed Merah at a Jewish school in Toulouse, a city known for tolerance. TOULOUSE, France — As near to the Spanish border as it is to the Mediterranean, this sunny red-brick city has long been known as a place of welcome and diversity, far removed from the divisive politics of Paris. In contrast to much of the French south, the far right, with its virulent anti-immigrant stance, has little presence here. Nor does radical Islam. Toulouse is by no means without racism, anti-Semitism, crime or the deep social segregation that marks many French cities, but with a culture shaped by successive waves of immigration, it is described by its inhabitants as a place of particular tolerance. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards fled the Franco dictatorship into France after the Spanish Civil War, and many settled here. So, too, did the pieds noirs, the French expelled from newly independent Algeria in 1962, as well as the harkis, the Algerians who had backed the French colonialists, and thousands of Jews. In addition to a host of universities and research centers, the aerospace giant Airbus is based here, attracting engineers and scientists from around the world. So while Muslims across France speak of feeling vilified, this city has largely been spared the tensions that surround Islam. “It is true that from time to time we are subjected to hateful political discourse,” said Mohamed Tataï, the imam at the mosque El Nour in Empalot, a poor neighborhood. It is effectively imported from outside the city, though, he said, often around election time. “Afterwards, we’re able to return to calm once again.” There are concerns, though, that Mohammed Merah may have changed that. The seven brutal killings carried out this month by Mr. Merah — a 23-year-old son of Toulouse, and a professed jihadi — occurred during a divisive presidential race that had already turned toward questions of immigration and Islam. Even though investigators say Mr. Merah was effectively a lone, self-radicalized extremist, his violent ideology fits closely with some French stereotypes of Islam, and Muslims here fear that the tensions brought on by the murders may prove more lasting. “All of this does not correspond at all with what Toulouse is,” Pierre Cohen, the mayor, said of the killings. But “we’ve just come out of a very tense period,” he said. “Unfortunately, this risk exists.” Already, a false rumor has spread through the city, Mr. Cohen said, suggesting that Muslims were organizing a demonstration in defense of Mr. Merah. “There will be a ‘before’ and an ‘after,’ ” said Yassin Elmu’min, 23, a round-faced young man with blue eyes and short hair slicked into tight curls. Typically, Mr. Elmu’min said, there is “dialogue” between cultures in Toulouse, and Muslims are treated well. But he and other Muslims, many living in the poor suburbs outside downtown Toulouse, said they had already begun to detect nervous gazes that were uncharacteristic of this city. “Someone had the nerve to ask me, ‘Do you agree with what he did?’ ” Mr. Elmu’min said, exasperated. President Nicolas Sarkozy called for the rejection of “easy falsehoods” about Muslims last week, after Mr. Merah was killed by police commandos, Mr. Elmu’min said. “The ‘easy falsehoods’ are already here,” he lamented. A friend, Abd’allah, 19, dressed in a cream-colored djellaba beneath a hooded sweatshirt, said, “We’re the victims in the story.” He declined to give his full name, saying he feared trouble from the French authorities. Despite Mr. Sarkozy’s recent appeals for tolerance, many Muslims say he has done much to stigmatize them, pointing often to a 2010 law banning the Islamic full veil, or niqab, and to a debate on “the national identity.” Marine Le Pen, the presidential candidate for the far-right National Front, has been vociferous in her response to the killings. “What happened is not the matter of one man’s madness; what happened is the beginning of the forward march of green fascism in our country,” Ms. Le Pen said on Sunday, referring to radical Islam. “How many Mohammed Merahs are there in the boats, the planes that arrive each day in France, full of immigrants?” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article talks about the city of Toulouse in France, which is known for being welcoming and accepting of different cultures and religions. People in Toulouse are worried that the recent violent actions of Mohammed Merah, who killed four people at a Jewish school, might make people more scared or hateful of Muslims. They are also worried about how these events might affect the way other people talk about and treat Muslims in France. The article also mentions that the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has called for people to be understanding and kind towards Muslims, even though some feel that he has contributed to the negative views about them. Lastly, it talks about how a far-right politician, Marine Le Pen, blames these events on radical Islam and uses it in her political campaign."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That evening, he reflects on his past to the summer of 1958, when he meets his first teenage crush Meg Loughlin. Meg and her disabled sister Susan have lost their parents in a car accident and because of this, they are sent to live with their reclusive aunt, Ruth Chandler, and her sons, Willie, Ralphie, and Donny (Graham Patrick Martin, Austin Williams and Benjamin Ross Kaplan). Living next door to the Chandlers, David is aware of the charisma Ruth has, since she freely allows her sons and their neighborhood friends to her house, where she entertains them and offers them beer and cigarettes. Meanwhile, Ruth starves Meg, accuses her of being a whore and subjects her to misogynistic lectures, whilst her children listen. One day, David visits the Chandler residence, where he sees the Chandler sons tickling Meg. Ralphie inappropriately tickles Meg's breasts, prompting her to fend him off as she runs from the room. His brothers humiliate Susan and when Ralphie brings Ruth to the situation, Ruth reprimands her for forgiving Meg's actions. Ruth beats Susan's bare buttocks as the Chandler sons restrain a horrified Meg, who came back to the room to save Susan.

(In June 1961, Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver. In 1962, Grossman paid Silver 10,000 to become sole manager.) Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable for his sometimes confrontational personality and for protective loyalty. Dylan said, \\"He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure ... you could smell him coming.\\" Tension between Grossman and John Hammond led to Hammond suggesting that Dylan work with the young African-American jazz producer, Tom Wilson, who produced several tracks for the second album without formal credit. Wilson went on to produce the next three albums Dylan recorded.Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom from December 1962 to January 1963. He had been invited by TV director Philip Saville to appear in a drama, Madhouse on Castle Street, which Saville was directing for BBC Television. At the end of the play, Dylan performed \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\", one of its first public performances. The film recording of Madhouse on Castle Street was destroyed by the BBC in 1968. While in London, Dylan performed at London folk clubs, including the Troubadour, Les Cousins, and Bunjies.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him).

Rain and cold weather this summer saw honey yields from hives fall by almost three-quarters, the British Beekeepers Association(BBKA)said today. The average crop per hive was down 72% compared to last year, with just 3.6kg (81b) of honey produced compared to an annual average, the annual honey survey by the BBKA revealed. The survey of 2,712 beekeepers in England, Northern Ireland and Wales found that 88% said this summer's bad weather caused the _ in honey yields. The bad weather made it difficult for bees to excrete ,which led to disease easily, and the bad weather also increased the risk of keeping bees for heavy rain caused the places which bees regularly visited to meet natural disasters. The bad weather also influenced the plants flowering which increased the cost of keeping bees. The BBKA issued a midsummer warning to feed bees if necessary to avoid dying from hunger. But in London, which recorded the worst results with just 2.5kg (5.61b)of honey harvested on average, beekeeping experts said that in addition to the bad weather there was a lack of food for bees in the city. Angela Woods, secretary of the London Beekeepers Association, said, \\"Rather than putting beehives on office roofs, we encourage companies in London that want to help to look at different ways of supporting bees and beekeepers. We need more food for the bees and better-educated beekeepers.\\" Elsewhere, the weather was the main problem. Peter Hutton, a beekeeper in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said, \\"It has been the most difficult year I have known in my 53 years of beekeeping. Bad weather in spring prevented bees in many areas from collecting nectar from early-flowering crops such as oilseed rape ,and the rain continued in many places throughout June and July, preventing honeybees from searching for food on later crops.\\" The BBKA warned that as well as reducing the honey harvest, the bad weather is likely to have a longer-term influence as it will have affected the normal process of breeding for the queens, which mate on the wing on fine,...

When I was a patrolman working the 11PM to 7AM shift we received a phone call from a police department about 200 miles away in a neighboring state. It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Haydn Austin Bunton (born 5 April 1937) is a former Australian rules footballer and coach. The son of the legendary Haydn Bunton Sr., Bunton Jr. played for North Adelaide and Norwood in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), as well as Swan Districts and Subiaco in the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL). Bunton was regarded as a tough and skilful player in both South Australia and Western Australia, but it was as a coach that he cemented a reputation alongside his father as one of Australian football's greatest identities. Bunton was inducted into the coaches section of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, as well as the Western Australian Institute of Sport Hall of Champions in 2003 and was made an inaugural member of the WA Football Hall of Fame in 2004 and the SA Football Hall of Fame in 2002. In 1984, Bunton junior returned to his former haunt of Subiaco, who as a result of the loss of such players as Mike Fitzpatrick had endured another bleak era over the previous nine seasons. The Lions had not participated in the finals since 1974 and had finished dead last in 1976, 1979, 1980 and 1982, when they were in danger of a winless season before beating East Fremantle in the seventeenth round. Since 1975 Subiaco had recorded only 44 wins from 189 games and had lost its \\"average\\" game over these nine seasons by a margin of 36 points. However, under Bunton and aided by a powerful country zone, the Lions improved rapidly: from four wins and a percentage of 70 in 1983 they went to nine wins and a percentage of 100 in 1984 and fifteen wins and a percentage of 124.5 in 1985. Despite being in their first finals series since 1974, the Lions only just failed to beat East Fremantle in the grand final and gained ample revenge against the Sharks the following year by eleven and a half goals. Their team was sufficiently good to be competitive against VFL premiers Hawthorn in a post-season \\"challenge\\" match - ironically Hawthorn's win was led by Subiaco's one star of the bleak late 1970s and early 1980s in Gary Buckenara. An irrepressible Claremont outfit under the innovative coaching of Gerard Neesham halted Subiaco in 1987, but the following year after losing the second semi to the Tigers and being unconvincing in the preliminary against East Fremantle, the Lions, playing a much more traditional game than Claremont and aided by the controversial inclusion of West Coast Eagle Laurie Keene, ran away to win by 62 points after an even first half. The massive drain of players to the VFL meant Subiaco could not keep up this standard, and they won only six games each in 1989 and 1990 before returning to the Grand Final in 1991 only for Claremont to have its revenge. A thrashing by East Perth in the first week of the 1992 WAFL finals saw Bunton resign at the end of the season after having coached Subiaco's most successful era since before World War II. How did that affect Haydn?","completion":"Haydn Austin Bunton, who was born on April 5, 1937, was an Australian rules football player and a coach. His dad, Haydn Bunton Sr., was a legendary football player too. Haydn Jr. played in two leagues with different teams, in South Australia and Western Australia. He was a strong player, but he became even more famous when he started coaching. Haydn got into some halls of fame because he was so good at football and coaching. In 1984, Haydn went back to a team called Subiaco. They were having a tough time and lost many games, but with Haydn's help, they improved a lot. They even made it to important games but missed winning the championship a couple of times. Later, they faced more challenges because some of their best players went to play in another league called the VFL. This made it difficult for Haydn's team to keep doing well, and they didn't win as many games. They did reach the big final game again in 1991, but they lost that one too. Finally, after his team lost a game and was out of the competition in 1992, Haydn decided to stop coaching the team. All these ups and downs affected Haydn because it was tough for his team and him. They worked hard and had some successes, but they couldn't stay at the top because they lost many good players. Even though they faced many challenges, Haydn's coaching made a big difference for the Subiaco team and helped them become better than they were before."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After all, who would choose a plastic toy over a lovely puppy? But Rault argues that the robotic kind has a lot going for it: \\"You don't have to feed it, you don't have to walk it, it won't make a mess in your house, and you can go on a holiday without feeling guilty.\\" The technology also benefits those who are allergic to pets, short on space, or fearful of real animals. It's not clear whether robot pets can replace real ones. But studies do suggest that we can bond with these smart machines. People give their cars names and kids give their toy animals life stories. It's the same with robots. When Sony stopped its repair service for its robot dog Aibo in March 2014, owners in Japan held funerals. As an animal welfare researcher, Rault is concerned about how robotic pets could affect our attitudes towards live animals. \\"If we become used to a robotic companion that doesn't need food, water or exercises, perhaps it will change how humans care about other living beings,\\" he said. So are dogs and cats a thing of the past, as Rault predicts? For those who grew up with living and breathing pets, the mechanical kind might not do. But for our next generation who are in constant touch with smart technology, a future in which lovely pets needn't have a heartbeat might not be a far-fetched dream.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.

The drama seemed to unsettle the players, both sides making early errors, and when Piri Weepu pulled a penalty badly wide the nerves began to spread to the stands. With one well-worked line-out move they were soon silenced. Weepu put a penalty into the corner, Jerome Kaino took the ball off the top and popped it down into the arms of the advancing Woodcock to put the veteran prop through a gaping hole. Weepu missed a simple conversion but France were rattled. For all their good early work they found themselves on the end of some harsh decisions from referee Craig Joubert at the scrum and breakdown. With fly-half Morgan Parra forced off with a head injury the All Blacks began to dominate possession, only for Weepu to miss another straightforward penalty from 25 metres out. The scrum-half's struggles meant the lead remained at just five points instead of a possible 13, and with half-time approaching the tide began to turn. Fly-half Aaron Cruden hyper-extended his knee horribly in contact and was carried off the pitch, forcing Graham Henry to bring on Donald - a man who was fishing for whitebait a fortnight ago before injuries to Dan Carter and Colin Slade triggered his emergency call-up. France's own stand-in stand-off Trinh-Duc missed with a drop-goal when well set but then set off on a curving run through a scattered defensive line which carried him deep into enemy territory until Weepu's desperate tap-tackle finally brought him down. He had a chance to reduce the deficit to just two points only to slide a penalty from the left touchline across the face of the posts, and was then penalised by Joubert to give Donald the simplest of kicks for 8-0. If some expected France to fold, Les Bleus had other ideas. Trinh-Duc gathered a poor kick from Weepu and sliced through the All Blacks line again, and although Dimitri Yachvili slipped with the line at his mercy the ball went wide, was recycled and put into the hands of skipper Dusautoir to slide in under the posts. Eden Park was stunned, Trinh-Duc converting for 8-7 and the previously impregnable home side badly rattled. France were transformed from the feeble, divided unit that had squeaked past Wales in the semi-final, their half-backs finding the corners with beautifully judged kicks from hand, the forwards making yards with every drive and a reorganised Kiwi line-out beginning to malfunction. With 16 minutes left on the clock and the tension climbing through the roof, Trinh-Duc tried his luck with a penalty from just inside halfway only to push it wide, but the unthinkable now seemed a real possibility. Replacement Damien Traille burgled a high ball from Israel Dagg and made good ground, the All Blacks scrum coming under increasing pressure and the crowd falling silent as their World Cup dream threatened to become a nightmare. With the seconds slipping away and the gap just one point, France went through an 18-phase attack that made little ground but resulted in an attacking scrum on the New Zealand 10m line, only for the hosts to steal the ball back when Aurelien Rougerie was wrapped up. The All Blacks drove upfield, using up the remaining moments, and when Joubert blew for another French infringement, the biggest party in New Zealand's history was under way. New Zealand: Israel Dagg, Cory Jane, Conrad Smith, Ma'a Nonu, Richard Kahui, Aaron Cruden, Piri Weepu; Tony Woodcock, Keven Mealamu, Owen Franks, Sam Whitelock, Brad Thorn, Jerome Kaino, Richie McCaw (capt), Kieran Read.

Tony Woodcock scored an early try, and Stephen Donald secured a penalty to ensure the All Blacks' victory. France put up an impressive performance, with captain Thierry Dusautoir scoring a try, setting the stage for an intense finish. Despite Francois Trinh-Duc missing a long-range penalty, the All Blacks' tight defense led them to a historical win, replicating the outcome of the first World Cup final in 1987. The atmosphere at Eden Park became even more electrifying when the French players formed an arrow formation facing the haka, a traditional pre-match ritual. Both teams made early errors, but the All Blacks quickly gained momentum after Woodcock's try, shaking France. However, referee Craig Joubert's decisions on scrum and breakdowns appeared harsh on the French side. In a significant turn of events, All Blacks' Aaron Cruden suffered a knee injury, and Donald stepped in as a replacement. Despite Trinh-Duc's missed drop-goal, he made a run deep into All Blacks territory, setting the pace for France. Although France's transformation made a strong impact, the All Blacks managed to regain possession, and Joubert's call for a French infringement marked the beginning of New Zealand's celebratory moment. With a final score of 8-7 in favor of the All Blacks, the nation celebrated this monumental victory and relished in the end of a quarter-century of waiting for another triumph. The thrilling match showcased the grit and talent of both teams, and solidified the All Blacks' place in rugby history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Loyalty means being faithful and supportive to someone or something. It's like always being there for your best friend or favorite toy. To understand who Singh was loyal to first, let's go back to the beginning of their story. Singh was a grown-up from a faraway land called India, and they had a family, just like you. They loved their family, and their family loved them back. It was the first group of people Singh ever cared for and supported. So, in Singh's life journey, the first ones they were ever loyal to were their family members. It's like how you are loyal to your mommy, daddy, brothers, and sisters because they are your family, and you love and take care of each other. In our big world, people have different reasons for being loyal to others. Some people are loyal to their friends, some to the place they live in, and some even to an idea, like loving the planet Earth and taking good care of it. In the end, loyalty means being there for someone and supporting them, just like Singh supported their family first.

Service: Our server seemed disinterested and was slow to bring our drinks. We had to ask for bread multiple times, and by the time it arrived, our appetizer had been sitting on the table for a few minutes already. 2. Food quality: The appetizers were unremarkable. The calamari was chewy and overcooked, while the bruschetta was bland. My main course, the rib-eye steak, was very fatty and lacked flavor. For a high-end restaurant, I expected the food to be much better. 3. Atmosphere: Although the restaurant was not crowded, it was quite noisy, making it difficult for us to have a conversation without raising our voices. The lighting was also too dim, making it hard to read the menu and see our plates clearly. 4. Price: The prices were significantly higher than similar restaurants in the area, which would be justifiable if the food and service were top-notch. However, considering the disappointing experience, I felt the prices were not justified. In conclusion, I was very disappointed with my experience at Fancy Bistro. The service was subpar, the food was below average, and the atmosphere was not enjoyable. I would recommend looking for other dining options in the area for a better overall experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Set a clear intention: As you prepare your space, take a few moments to quiet your mind and establish a clear intention for your spiritual practice. This intention could be to seek guidance and support, ask for healing, or simply to cultivate a deeper connection with the angelic realm. 8. Spend time in meditation or prayer: By engaging in regular meditation or prayer, you can become more attuned to the subtle frequencies of the angelic realm. This can also help strengthen your connection to your inner wisdom and spiritual guidance. 9. Practice gratitude and compassion: Finally, cultivate a mindset of gratitude and compassion by focusing on the many blessings in your life, as well as developing empathy for others.

The blue ringed octopus The blue ringed octopus is not a very big creature but it is very dangerous. These octopuses are found all around Australian coast. They often lie in rock pools close to shore. The blue ringed octopus is usually a dull color1 but it shows its bright blue rings when it is in danger. If it is taken out of the water, it is able to bite a person and poison them. If this creature bites someone, they will feel numbness around the mouth, face and neck. Puffer Fish Puffer Fish are found in all Australian seas. They are very easy to catch but must not be eaten because their flesh and internal organs contain a poison. Anyone who does eat the flesh can become sick very quickly. They may even stop breathing. The Blue Bottle The Blue Bottle is found in most Australian waters. Blue Bottles float lightly on the surface of the water but their tentacles can be as long as 10 metres. Blue Bottles are much less dangerous than some other jellyfish but they can give a swimmer a bad sting if the swimmer accidentally touches them. Stingrays There are many different kinds of stingrays in Australian waters. They usually swim and feed on the bottom of the sea. Accidents can happen if people stand on them or try to pick them up. Stingrays have a sting on their tail. These stings have poison on them. If someone is stung the wound can easily become infected.

To provide a detailed explanation, let us analyze both sentences: In Sentence 1, the speaker is discussing their new house, stating that they have purchased it due to the improvement in real estate prices. However, they also mention that they now have \\"some pretty stiff mortgage payments.\\" This statement implies that their mortgage payments are high or challenging to meet, due to reasons such as the house's size or the financial implications of the real estate market. In Sentence 2, the speaker simply states that \\"Our house is really expensive to pay for.\\" This statement also implies difficulty in making the mortgage payments, as the house is expensive, and by extension, the payments required to maintain ownership of it are too. By comparing these two sentences, we can see that both focus on the financial aspect of owning the house, specifically the burden and the cost associated with mortgage payments. Although Sentence 2 uses a more concise and straightforward approach to expressing this idea, both sentences essentially convey the same message. Therefore, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, as it expresses the same underlying concept related to the difficulty in managing the mortgage payments for the house."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

CONTEXT: 7 de febrero de 2006 El periódico iraní Hamshahri ha afirmado este lunes (6) que planea la publicación de caricaturas antijudías como respuesta a las \\"Caricaturas de Mahoma\\" danesas. La publicación, propiedad del consejo de la ciudad de Teherán señala que los dibujos satirizarán el Holocausto, siguiendo la actitud del presidente de ese país, Mahmud Ahmadineyad, quien en meses anteriores afirmó que el Holocausto es un \\"mito\\". Así, Hamshahri ha iniciado un concurso para encontrar las caricaturas más adecuadas para ese propósito. Farid Mortazavi, editor gráfico del diario, le dijo al británico The Guardian: \\"Los periódicos occidentales imprimieron estas caricaturas sacrílegas con el pretexto de la libertad de expresión, así que vamos a ver si mantienen lo que dicen y publican también estas caricaturas sobre el Holocausto\\". Mortazavi añadió que la edición impresa del próximo miércoles (8) saldrá la invitación para los caricaturistas que deseen participar en el concurso, cuyos premios serán monedas antiguas para los 12 ganadores —el número es idéntico al de los dibujos publicados por el periódico danés derechista Jyllands-Posten en septiembre pasado, las cuales encendieron la polémica y la ola de protestas, algunas de ellas violentas, en todo el mundo islámico, desde Marruecos hasta Indonesia y Filipinas—. Según el artículo del Jyllands-Posten donde se publicaron las caricaturas, éstas pretendían demostrar que: Para la prensa europea no es clara todavía la justificación que el Hamshahri ofrecerá por la publicación de las caricaturas \\"antisemitas\\". Ahmadineyad ha criticado el argumento de la libertad de expresión utilizado por los periódicos occidentales para justificar la publicación de los dibujos de Mahoma. El tema del Holocausto fue escogido debido a que su debate en Europa es considerado por algunos como un tabú, además de que la negación del asunto es criminalizada en algunos países. La prensa europea califica la prohibición islámica de hacer imágenes sobre Mahoma como uno de los tabúes de la religión musulmana. Las caricaturas publicadas en el diario danés tienen mensajes que van desde lo humorístico hasta lo político. Por ejemplo, una caricatura en la que Mahoma a las puertas del paraíso le dice a una fila de suicidas que \\"se detengan\\" porque \\"se agotaron las vírgenes\\". Otras caricaturas representan a Mahoma usando una bomba como turbante, la media luna creciente sobre la cabeza a manera de cuernos, la estrella y la media luna sobre la cara asemejando a un pirata con un parche en el ojo, etc. Por otra parte, algunos medios han denunciado que las caricaturas mostradas en el mundo musulmán contienen dibujos manipulados que no fueron publicados en los diarios europeos, en los cuales Mahoma es representado con cuerpo de cerdo mientras es sodomizado por un perro, u otros en los cuales el profeta es mostrado como pedofílico. El libanés Dyab Abou Jahjah, de la Liga Árabe Europea, organización con sede en Bruselas, ha lanzado la denominada Campaña por la Libertad de Expresión, en la que espera demostrar que los medios europeos sólo están dispuestos a publicar caricaturas antimusulmanas, pero no a imprimir dibujos anticristianos o antisemitas. Las caricaturas se muestran más adelante. En la primera, la elección de Anne Frank es algo irónica, pues ella fue partidaria del movimiento a favor de la libertad de expresión, y ella creía que las restricciones en la misma eran en parte culpables del ascenso del fascismo en los años treinta del siglo pasado. Paul Belien, del Brussels Journal, apunta que las \\"tres caricaturas de la AEL publicadas hasta el momento han sido muy instructivas en tanto se han mofado de la persecución de los judíos por parte de los nazis, mientras el señor Mr Jahjah enfatizar que el islamofascismo es de hecho la ideología a la que se adhiere\\".

The Mummy 's Shroud is set in 1920 and tells the story of a team of archaeologists who come across the lost tomb of the boy Pharaoh Kah-To-Bey . The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah-To-Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection . Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried . The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb . They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid , a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud . Sir Basil is bitten by a snake just after finding the tomb . He recovers , but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo . Preston takes advantage of this and commits him to an insane asylum , to take credit for finding the tomb and Prince 's mummy himself .

Within their final week of school, however, Jay's grandfather dies, Simon is dumped by his girlfriend Carli and Will discovers that his divorced father has unexpectedly married his much younger mistress. Depressed, the boys decide to go on holiday together and Neil books them on a trip to Malia, Crete.Their accommodation in Malia is awful, but the boys meet four girls - Alison, Lucy, Lisa and Jane - in an empty bar during their first night out. Their initial meeting goes less than smoothly- Will chats to Alison and pokes fun at her cliched \\"Greek waiter boyfriend\\", Simon bores Lucy to death talking about Carli, Neil has a non-conversation with Lisa, and Jay \\"gets stuck\\" with the bubbly, if somewhat overweight Jane. The girls go on their way after Neil pulls two older women, but arrange to meet the boys the next day. Outside the bar, Simon sees Carli across the street. He talks awkwardly with her before being run over by a quadbike ridden by James, an obnoxious club rep and Carli's new squeeze.

During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues. They go to Andrei's house where they find him already dead. After the chase, Dorganosov demands the rest of his payment from his contractor, who is revealed to be Anatoly Grishin.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. After the deaths of Charles V and du Guesclin in 1380, France lost its main leadership and overall momentum in the war. Charles VI succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority. With France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the Harelle and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace. Difficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through proxy wars, such as during the 1383-1385 Portuguese interregnum. The independence party in the Kingdom of Portugal, which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.

The sentence primarily focuses on the extinction of larger mammal species like wolves, bears, and European elk. It makes no reference to birds or bird species in any capacity, let alone specifically in relation to the British Isles. Thus, it cannot be used to answer the question, \\"How many bird species does the British Isles have?\\" To properly answer this question, one would need access to specific ornithological data or source materials which thoroughly detail the bird species that inhabit or are native to the British Isles. Based on a general estimate from bird surveys, there are more than 600 species of birds recorded in the British Isles, including both resident and migrant species. The exact number might vary based on the specific criteria of the bird count, such as the inclusion of accidental visitors or extinct species, among other factors. Keep in mind that bird species in the British Isles include a vast array of seabirds, songbirds, raptors, and many others, which can vary greatly in their population distribution and conservation status. Study and conservation efforts for these birds are significant, as the British Isles provide crucial habitats for an array of bird species. The island's varying climates and diverse geographical features, from the highlands of Scotland to the low-lying coasts of England, offer suitable living conditions for a multitude of bird species, each finding their suitable residence based on their specific behavioral and ecological niche.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Whose nerve impulses will be transmitted? Hint: When you go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled, you really don’t want to feel any pain. The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off. A:","completion":"Based on the given information and hint, nerve impulses will be transmitted in Luke, the patient who declined anesthetic. When anesthetic is applied, it interferes with ion movement across the cell membrane, which in turn blocks the transmission of nerve impulses and prevents the sensation of pain. In this case, since Marco opted to receive anesthetic for his arm amputation, his nerve impulses would be inhibited, and he would not feel the pain during the operation. On the other hand, Luke chose not to receive any anesthetic, meaning his nerve impulses would continue to be transmitted without interruption. As a result, Luke would experience significant pain during the arm amputation, as his nerve impulses would still be functioning and sending signals of pain to his brain. In summary, Luke's nerve impulses will be transmitted during the operation, while Marco's nerve impulses will be blocked due to the use of anesthetic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

George Fox is associated with the founding of which religion?","completion":"George Fox is associated with the founding of the Religious Society of Friends, more commonly known as the Quakers. This religious movement began in the mid-17th century in England and has since expanded to various parts across the globe, with followers today known as Friends or Quakers. George Fox was born in 1624 in Leicestershire, England. Although he grew up in a traditionally religious family that adhered to the Church of England, Fox became disillusioned with the established religious institutions early in his life. He was concerned about the widespread social upheaval, violence, and hypocrisy present in his society, which led him to seek a more genuine and authentic way of connecting with God. In 1647, Fox began to have a series of spiritual experiences and revelations that informed the basis of his new religious movement. He believed that all people had within them an inner light, which was a manifestation of God. This inner light, according to Fox, could guide individuals in their spiritual journeys and lead them to truth and righteousness, without the need for formal religious institutions or intermediaries such as priests. This belief in direct, unmediated communion with God was revolutionary at the time and laid the foundation for the Quakers' theology and practices. In addition to their belief in the inner light, Quakers also emphasize the ideals of simplicity, pacifism, social justice, and equality. They reject traditional religious symbols, rituals, and hierarchy in favor of a more egalitarian approach that encourages members to find their spiritual paths and contribute in their unique ways. Quakers historically have been noted for their work in social and political causes, including the abolition of slavery, women's rights, prison reform, and peace advocacy. Quaker meetings, or gatherings, are characterized by their simplicity and lack of liturgy. Friends come together in silence, without any minister or prescribed order of service, allowing the inner light to guide their thoughts and actions. When a member feels moved by the Spirit, they may stand up and share a message, known as ministry, with the rest of the congregation. This style of worship emphasizes the importance of personal experiences and communion with God over institutionalized religious practices. In the years following George Fox's revelations, tens of thousands of people joined the Quaker movement, which spread from England to the rest of Europe, North America, and beyond. The movement faced significant opposition and persecution from both the state and established religious institutions, which saw the Quakers as a threat to their authority. Early Friends were often imprisoned, fined, or even executed for their beliefs and practices. Today, the Religious Society of Friends has an estimated global membership of around 400,000, with different branches adhering to somewhat varying beliefs and practices. However, the core principles established by George Fox, including the belief in the inner light, simplicity, pacifism, social justice, and equality, continue to guide and distinguish the Quaker faith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Many homes have cameras to protect them from danger. The cameras can tell the owners if someone has entered. But the cameras do not know whether the person is a family member, a friend, a postman or a criminal . But a new camera made by a French company can recognize faces. It can tell parents at work that their children have returned from school, or that the mail has been sent to their home. It can also tell them if a stranger has entered their home. When family members enter a home, the smart camera \\"recognizes\\" them and sends information to the owner's phone. The owner can choose to see the video then or later.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Yawning can be an easy way to generate saliva. Even if you aren’t feeling sleepy, try yawning a few times. You’d be surprised how strongly your body responds to the simple act by producing a bunch of spit. Always cover your mouth when yawning in public. You can still be polite when you’re trying to gleek. Most sour candies will stimulate your salivary glands and generate enough saliva to gleek. Get a pack of sour candies and throw some in your mouth. After sucking on them for a few seconds, you should have plenty of saliva. Too much sugar is bad for your teeth. Make sure that you clean your mouth out if you’re eating a lot of it. Water is an excellent way to stimulate your salivary glands. It also has the added benefit of being good for you! If you’re having trouble salivating, drink a little bit of water. You’d be surprised by how moist your mouth will feel. Form a small circle by pursing your lips together. It’s incredibly hard to breathe and gleek at the same time, so you’ll want to catch your breath before attempting to gleek. Take a deep breathe and relax your shoulders. A deep breath will give the salivary gland time to generate enough spit around the bottom of your tongue. To flex your tongue, tighten the muscles by pushing it upwards and outwards towards the roof of your mouth. Press your tongue in the area between your upper teeth and the skin on the roof of your mouth. When you're ready to gleek, make this motion in one action and as quickly as possible. Your tongue should stiffen as you flex it, and you’ll know that you’re doing it right if it feels rigid and stiff in your mouth. Open your mouth as wide as you comfortably can and extend your lower jaw away from you and towards your target. Flex the muscles in your tongue as hard as you can while doing this. With enough practice, you will naturally shoot out a stream of saliva from the gland beneath your tongue. It may be tempting to try and purse your lips together, since that’s what most people do when they normally spit. This will block the gland at the bottom of your tongue though, so try to avoid doing it while you gleek. Keep your tongue locked to the roof of your mouth while you’re doing this.","completion":"This article provides various techniques to stimulate saliva production for gleeking, such as yawning, using sour candies, drinking water, and practicing proper tongue and mouth positioning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who moved to London on completing his seven-year indenture? , can you please find it? William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

This restaurant provided a truly unforgettable evening, offering a harmonious blend of excellent service, delectable cuisine, and a warm, inviting ambiance. Upon entering the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the friendly staff, who escorted us to our reserved table, carefully situated in a cozy corner offering a stunning view of the city skyline. The interior decor was tastefully done, featuring contemporary art pieces that added a touch of elegance to the overall atmosphere. Soft instrumental music played in the background, enhancing the fine dining experience. The menu boasted a vast array of exquisite dishes, each with its own unique presentation and combination of flavors. We opted for their signature tasting menu that featured a variety of beautifully crafted appetizers, entrees, and desserts. The chef displayed true culinary artistry in each course, combining fresh, high-quality ingredients with innovative cooking techniques. The first course, a vibrant beet and goat cheese salad, was a delightful start to the meal. The sweetness of the beets, the creaminess of the goat cheese, and the crunch from the candied walnuts blended together perfectly, setting the tone for the remaining courses. Next, we were treated to a delicate, melt-in-your-mouth seared scallop dish, which was artfully placed atop a velvety cauliflower puree, with a drizzle of lemon-thyme vinaigrette that elevated the flavors to a whole new level. For our entrees, I had the pan-seared salmon, which was cooked to perfection and served with a refreshing mango-avocado salsa, while my husband enjoyed the succulent braised short ribs, accompanied by a silky potato gratin and a rich red wine reduction. Our daughter chose the house-made ricotta gnocchi, which was perfectly cooked and paired with a vibrant, robust tomato sauce that showcased the chef's expertise in balancing flavors. To conclude the meal, we shared a divine chocolate fondant, which paired a warm, gooey chocolate center with the slight crunch of the outer shell, accompanied by a velvety vanilla bean ice cream and garnished with fresh mixed berries. It was the perfect end to an exceptional dining experience. Throughout the evening, the waitstaff was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely committed to ensuring our satisfaction. They flawlessly timed each course, provided excellent wine pairing suggestions, and even presented my husband with a complimentary glass of champagne to make his birthday celebration even more special. In conclusion, I cannot speak highly enough of The Gourmet Paradise. Our dining experience was one to remember, and we will undoubtedly return to explore more of their tantalizing culinary offerings. If you are looking for an exceptional meal, impeccable service, and a memorable evening, this restaurant is, without a doubt, the perfect choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Charlie Muffin Movie plot: The Cold War espionage thriller follows the moves of British anti-hero spy Charlie Muffin (Hemmings) who has fallen on hard times since the forced retirement of Sir Archibald Willoughby, his previous boss at the U.K. secret service (played by Sir Ralph Richardson). His new boss, Sir Henry Cuthbertson (Ian Richardson), who epitomizes the haughty upper class British imperialist, hardly attempts to conceal his disdain for the under-educated agent who quite obviously doesn't stem from the \\"right class\\". Right at the start of the film, we witness how Charlie has evidently been deemed expendable and accordingly gets set up to be caught or killed during a joint mission in East Germany â this despite Muffin essentially having been responsible for the mission's success. Cuthbertson's lap-dog agents Snare and Harrison â who are both totally lacking in experience and as arrogant as their boss â are shocked and embarrassed to see Muffin returning alive and well. Once home in the UK, Muffin's humiliation doesn't end, as he gets demoted and put on leave, which he spends with his wife Edith (Linden), but not until after a hilarious take on the obligatory spy agentâsecretary-receptionist affair. Next, a classic yet utterly unpredictable spy story unfolds around British and U.S. attempts to facilitate a safe defection of high-ranking Soviet General Valery Kalenin (Braun). CIA Director Garson Ruttgers (Wanamaker) proves not much smarter and ultimately equally officious and presumptuous as his British counterpart, though in a distinctly â satirically â American way. After Harrison and Snare's spectacular downfalls at the task (one ends up dead trying to escape and the other captured), Ruttgers' aide Braley (Rimmer), a chubby, good-hearted but docile sideshow official, is assigned to join Muffin on a trip to Prague, to liaise with Kalenin. Will Kalenin's defection succeed? Will Charlie once again be set up? Will he be able to escape alive and well this time? It is not until the very last minutes of the film that we find out.

Answer the following question: where does the tour de france take place?","completion":"The Tour de France, one of the most prestigious and demanding professional cycling races in the world, takes place primarily in France but occasionally ventures into neighboring countries. The race, which has been held annually since its inception in 1903 (except for during the World Wars), consists of several stages and covers a distance of approximately 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) throughout the country over a three-week period in July. Each edition of the Tour de France presents a unique route, with the race organizers crafting a challenging course that showcases the varied terrains and landscapes that can be found across France. The route often changes from year to year in terms of specific locations, although certain hallmark features of the race remain fairly consistent, including grueling mountain stages in the French Alps and Pyrenees, flat stages suited for sprinters, and time trials for individual riders to prove their speed and skill against the clock. In addition to its predominantly French setting, the Tour de France has been known to cross borders into neighboring countries such as Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, usually in the form of brief detours or stage starts and finishes. Including stops in these countries not only diversifies the race's geographical footprint but also increases its international appeal, allowing fans and spectators from outside France to experience a taste of the competition in their home nations. Despite the varied and changing nature of the Tour de France route, certain destinations have become emblematic of the race and regularly feature in its itinerary. Amongst these, the city of Paris is of the utmost importance, as it serves as the traditional end point for the race, with riders concluding their long journey by racing the final stage on the iconic Champs-Élysées. Other famous locales, such as the notoriously steep Mont Ventoux, the Col du Tourmalet, and the Alpe d'Huez, have become storied battlegrounds for individual stages, adding an element of historic significance and drama to the race. In summary, the Tour de France primarily takes place in France but occasionally includes segments in neighboring countries. Each year, the race follows a unique route, highlighting France's diverse terrain and landscape. Although certain features of the race remain consistent, such as the inclusion of mountain stages and time trials, the specific path taken by the riders varies, making each edition of the Tour de France a distinct and challenging contest."},{"prompt":"Question: If cells are the microscopic building bricks of organisms, then cells are the microscopic building bricks of what?

Answer:","completion":"Fantasia 2000 and Mars Needs Moms are both examples of animated feature films, with a common underlying form of media being computer-generated imagery (CGI). These movies utilize cutting-edge technology and artistic techniques to create visually stunning and immersive experiences for their audiences. While both films belong to the animation genre, the specific aspects of their media characteristics, production techniques, and visual styles differ. In this answer, we will elaborate on the different aspects of the media shared by both films and their unique features. 1. Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI): Both Fantasia 2000 and Mars Needs Moms employ CGI to create their animations. CGI refers to the process of creating 3D images, objects, and environments using computer software and hardware. Unlike traditional animation methods, such as hand-drawn cel animation, CGI allows for more complex and realistic visuals, as well as smoother and more lifelike animations. As technology has advanced, CGI has become an increasingly popular form of animation media. 2. Digital 3D Animation: Due to their reliance on CGI, both films can be classified as examples of digital 3D animation. In 3D animation, objects and characters are modeled with three-dimensional properties, allowing for greater depth, detail, and complexity in the visual elements of the film. This is particularly evident in the highly realistic textures and lighting effects employed in both Fantasia 2000 and Mars Needs Moms. Digital 3D animation enables animators to manipulate the objects and environments within the film more easily, contributing to the fluidity and continuity of the animation. 3. Visual Styles: While both films employ CGI and digital 3D animation techniques, their visual styles differ significantly. Fantasia 2000, as a sequel to the iconic 1940 film Fantasia, showcases a blend of classical music and modern animation. The film consists of eight segments, each developed by a different team of animators and artists, resulting in a diverse array of visual styles. Some segments retain a more traditional, hand-drawn appearance, while others are entirely rendered using CGI. Regardless of the medium, the art direction emphasizes color, shape, and movement, aiming to create a visual interpretation of the accompanying classical music scores. On the other hand, Mars Needs Moms features a more consistent visual style throughout the film, primarily rooted in digital 3D animation. The film employs motion capture technology to translate the movements of live-action actors into realistic, lifelike animated characters. The overall art direction is focused on creating an immersive world, blending photorealism with a touch of stylization to form an engaging and visually appealing sci-fi environment. 4. Production Techniques: Both films showcase innovative production techniques specific to their respective visual styles. Fantasia 2000 employed a mix of both traditional and digital production methods, including hand-drawn animation, CGI, and digital ink and paint. In contrast, Mars Needs Moms relied heavily on motion-capture technology, in which live actors perform on a specially-designed stage and their actions are recorded and translated into digital animation. The production of this film involved the use of specialized cameras, sensors, and software to ensure accurate and smooth character movements. In conclusion, while Fantasia 2000 and Mars Needs Moms are both animated feature films that incorporate CGI and digital 3D animation techniques, they each showcase unique visual styles and production methods. The innovative use of technology and artistic techniques in these films highlights the evolving nature of the animation medium, exemplifying the artistic and technical advancements made within this popular and ever-growing form of media."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but the paneling and the wallpapering and the and that kind of stuff are alike.\\" According to the premise, the paneling and wallpapering, as well as some other things (which remain unspecified), are alike. This implies that there are similarities between the paneling and wallpapering, along with the other unspecified elements. Hypothesis: \\"Yeah, the paneling and wallpapering are alike.\\" This hypothesis reiterates that paneling and wallpapering are alike. It does not mention the other elements that the premise includes. Options: [I] yes. [II] it is not possible to tell. [III] no. Given the options, we need to establish whether it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Considering the premise states that the paneling and wallpapering are alike, along with other unspecified things, it shares a common idea with the hypothesis, which also claims that the paneling and wallpapering are alike. However, the hypothesis does not mention the other unspecified elements that are also alike according to the premise. Based on this analysis, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true in the sense that it aligns with the main idea presented and supported by the premise regarding the similarities between the paneling and wallpapering. However, it is worth noting that the hypothesis is slightly narrower in scope, focusing solely on the paneling and wallpapering rather than including other unspecified elements that the premise suggests are also alike. Therefore, given the available options, the best choice would be [I] yes, as the hypothesis is true when the premise is true. However, it is essential to keep in mind the limitations outlined and the difference in scope between the premise and the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:I read this background article the other day: There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying. I am facing a new situation today: Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which case the Bt toxin is in an active state, case A or case B? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article, the Bt toxin is in an active state in case A - the transgenic crop. In case A, the crop plants have been genetically engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, the Bt toxin binds to the insect's gut wall, causing it to stop feeding and eventually die. This approach is considered more environmentally friendly because it directly targets the specific pests that feed on the crops, reducing the need for widespread insecticidal spraying. In contrast, in case B - the Bt toxin spray - the toxin is in an inactive state when applied. It requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. This means that the environment gets exposed to large amounts of the inactive Bt toxin, which may then impact a wider range of insects and other organisms once ingested and activated. Furthermore, the use of Bt toxin sprays may potentially contribute to the development of pesticide-resistant insects over time, as the toxin is broadly applied rather than specifically targeting the pests that feed on the crops. So, the correct answer is that the Bt toxin is in an active state in case A - the transgenic crop. Using transgenic crops expressing the Bt toxin directly is generally considered to be a safer and more targeted approach for managing pest populations and reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On 17 March 2003, Robin Cook, Leader of the House of Commons and former Foreign Secretary, resigned from the Cabinet in protest against the coming war in Iraq. His resignation speech inspired the first long applause in the history of the House and marked the end of the ministerial career of one of Labor's most brilliant politicians. For the previous two years, Robin Cook kept a diary, a personal record of the life of Labor's second term, a diary that forms the center of the narrative . The Point of Departureis Robin Cook's plain account of this extraordinary period in our political history, the most important political publication of the decade. Though surprised by his abrupt dismissal as Foreign Secretary, he became determined to bring about some changes in Parliamentary democracy that he believed was essential if Parliament was to move into the 21stcentury. As Tony Blair told him, \\"This is the job for you.\\" Drawing on first-hand experiences in the Commons and the Cabinet, of encounters in conferences, and late night conversations, we follow his gathering disillusionment as the political compass of the government changes to directions which he believes to be completely mistaken: from its failure about Lords reform and its unwillingness to provide leadership for social change, to a foreign policy which has led us away from our responsibility in Europe, into closer relationship with the most right-wing government in American history, and participation in Bush's war on Iraq. This is the story of a government in power and the tensions between those who govern. But above all it is a story of a politician who truly wanted to bring democracy closer to the people, but who saw a government increasingly separated from the values of himself and his party, and who developed a growing belief that on Iraq, its position was morally, diplomatically and politically wrong. Robin Cook first entered Parliament as MP for Edinburgh Central in 1974. He held a number of senior positions in Opposition -- Shadow Foreign Secretary, Shadow Health and Social Services Secretary -- before becoming Foreign Secretary in 1997.

Elephants, tigers and many other animals were living in the thick forest. When people came to live in Hong Kong, the animals began to die out. Early farmers grew rice and kept pigs and chickens in the valleys. They cut down the trees and burnt them. They needed fire to keep themselves warm in winter, to cook their food and to keep away the dangerous animals. Elephants quickly disappeared because there was not enough food for them. Many other animals soon died in the same way. You might think that there are no longer any animals in Hong Kong except in 2005. But there are still about 36 different animals living there. One of the most interesting of Hong Kong's animals is the barking deer. These are beautiful little animals with a rich brown coat and a white patch under the tail. They look like deer but they are much smaller. They are less than two feet high. They make a noise rather like a dog barking. In Hong Kong the barking deer has only a real enemy---- men. People hunt these little animals though it is illegal, There are now not many barking deer left. So it is important for people to protect wild animals. Question: The passage tells us that _ . Options: A: we can eat wild animal B: we must kill the barking deer C: people can hunt little animal D: it's important for us to protect the wild animal The answer to this question is:","completion":"D: it's important for us to protect the wild animal"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyze the given options: We need to figure out which statement best describes fish in contrast to invertebrates, keeping in mind what fish do NOT lack. Let's evaluate each option: - the body's largest organ: This statement is not related to the difference between fish and invertebrates. - furry hide: This is also not related to the main difference between the two groups of animals. - vertebral column: This could be the answer, as invertebrates lack this structure, and fish do not. - critical organs: Both groups of animals have critical organs, so this option is not relevant. - thumbs: This is not relevant to the difference between fish and invertebrates. - aqua lungs: This option is not pertinent to the main distinction. - salt and water: This statement is not directly related to the difference between fish and invertebrates. - Chlorophyll: This is a substance found in plants, not animals, so it's not relevant to the question. 3. Select the appropriate option: After evaluating all the options, the one that stands out is the \\"vertebral column\\" because fish are backboned aquatic animals and invertebrates lack a vertebral column.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What's the full name of the person that the automobile hits? , can you please find it? Bitter war widow Janet Ames seeks out the five soldiers for whom her husband gave his life by falling on a hand grenade during the Battle of the Bulge. While crossing a city street to find the first, she is struck and knocked unconscious by an automobile. The police find no identification on her, only a list of names. One recognizes the last name on her list, Smithfield \\"Smitty\\" Cobb, a reporter recently fired for alcoholism, and contacts Smitty. When Smitty sees the list, he realizes who she must be. He goes to see her at the hospital, and finds her in a wheelchair, unable to walk. As the doctor can find no physical reason for the paralysis, he schedules an appointment with a psychiatrist. Smitty decides to treat her himself. He introduces himself as a friend of her husband David (though not as one of the men he saved), and wheels her into a private room. She explains her mission: to see if any of the men were worth David's sacrifice, making it perfectly clear that she has already made up her mind. After a nurse gives her a sedative, Smitty accuses her of wallowing in self-pity, then tries to get Janet to change her mind by describing each of the men.

Now he is going to have his life and work commemorated with special gold and silver coins. But does Twain need to be commemorated? It doesn't seem like people in the US will forget him. Twain once joked that a lack of money is the root of all evil \\" but a lack of money with Twain's famous face on it wouldn't have made people forget about him. The Adventures of Huckberry Finn is thought to be his greatest works. Motherless Huck Finn is a young boy who shows the spirit of freedom. But it could be said that Huck's freedom really comes from Huck wanting to fly. When Huck gets away from his violent father, he isn't really looking for freedom,out survival. It's even more of a problem for a slave. Jim, the escaped slave who Huck helps, makes Huck's life seem even better. It's easier not to be able to deal with someone who wants to force you to go to school than to have to fight a law that says you are a piece of property . Huck and Jim's friendship, as shown by Mark Twain, is one of the great stories in American literature because it shows a white character, Huck, who gets an idea of the African American experience. Mark Twain is famous and would still be famous without any special coins. Anyway, the coins could be a reason to look again at the work of a writer who got under the skin of the US in the 19th century.

Born in New York, the son of a wealthy publisher, Remington was a boxer and a football player at Yale University -- the last man would expect to become the artist of the Old West. But as a boy he loved horses and fed on the journals of some famous writers. At the age of nineteen, he left college to look for adventures. He traveled from Montana to Texas as a prospector . Remington had always been interested in journalism. Now he began to write about and to paint and draw what he saw. The subject of the \\"Winning of the West\\" attracted the East. Magazines and newspapers were filled with account of prospectors' adventures, and of battles with cattle thieves and other outlaws -- all the tales that were then news and have become legends since. There were also stories by many other writers. Often these were presented by drawings and paintings from Remington's hand, but it was as a successful journalist that Remington was a great artist.

Answer the following question: In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older... According to the above context, answer the following question. What does the author believe a patient with new symptoms should do? pick from the following. (1). not enough information; (2). have an MRI test; (3). check their blood pressure; (4). have bloodwork done; Answer:","completion":"(4). have bloodwork done; Based on the context provided in the article, the author believes that a patient with new symptoms should have bloodwork done, as it is helpful in evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults.

With Windows 8.1, a New Start That Looks Familiar Yes, Microsoft is bringing back some comforting hallmarks of its Windows operating system, including the Start menu. No, it is not chucking out the modern, touch-friendly, tile-based look of Windows 8, the new version of the software that has sent much of the PC industry, many pundits and some computer shoppers into a tizzy. That’s the short version of what’s coming in Windows 8.1, an update to Windows 8 that will be out by the end of the year. In one of the first demonstrations of the operating system to an outsider, Microsoft executives showed off a bevy of changes the company has made to the operating system, a number of which were in direct response to some of the more pointed criticisms the operating system received from users after coming out last fall. Hints from Microsoft in recent weeks about those changes, along with a slump in PC sales that analysts believe was worsened by Windows 8, have led to heated speculation that Microsoft was preparing to backpedal from the most radical changes it made in Windows 8. Not true, executives said. “This isn’t a U-turn at all,” said Antoine Leblond, corporate vice president of Windows program management. “We really believe in the direction we started on with Windows 8.” Indeed, Windows 8.1 looks virtually indistinguishable from Windows 8 in many respects. People who dislike its colorful mosaic of tiles will not find much in the new software to change their minds. That’s because it is unlikely, as a practical matter, that people will be able to entirely escape the tile-based interface in Windows 8.1, even though Microsoft is making it easier to avoid it. As expected, the new operating system will allow people to configure the software so that they start in desktop mode — the “classic” Windows interface with a taskbar at the bottom of the screen, a background image and applications with traditional menus — whenever they boot up their PCs. Microsoft didn’t allow this with Windows 8. Even if their destination was desktop mode, where Office and millions of legacy Windows applications run, Windows 8 users had to pass through the tile screen, an inconvenience to many. It’s noteworthy that Microsoft will still put users in the tile interface by default when they start up their machines. Microsoft is also reincarnating the Start button with Windows 8.1, though it won’t behave exactly like the Windows Start buttons of yore, the primary way Windows users found and launched applications for decades. There will be a Windows flag icon in the bottom left corner of the taskbar in the Windows 8.1 desktop. But clicking — or, if you have a touch device, tapping — the button will simply return you to the tile-based interface, from which you can launch apps. People can get to a more traditional looking menu of applications from the Start button, but they have to configure the system to do that. What these changes mean is that someone who makes the effort to reconfigure the operating system will be able to spend most of their time in the classic desktop interface. In practice, Microsoft will keep nudging them in the direction of the tile-based interface at every opportunity because it believes that is the future of Windows. The company thinks most devices are moving inexorably in the direction of touch screens, including laptop computers and desktops. The tile interface of Windows 8 and its successors is how the company is preparing for that future. If developers want to distribute applications through Microsoft’s app store for Windows, they have to write them so they run through the modern Windows interface. Even if a customer only wants the old-fashioned Windows, they will be bounced into the new interface anytime they launch Netflix and any other modern app. Over time, Microsoft believes users will become more comfortable in the modern interface. But it doesn’t want to rush them if they’re unready. “There’s an opportunity here to help people feel more oriented if they don’t feel oriented,” said Jensen Harris, partner director of program management at Microsoft. There are a variety of other changes in Windows 8.1 that are likely to receive less notice. People using Windows 8.1 in the modern interface will be able to have four different windows open at once, rather than two, which will make it easier for multitaskers to jump among different applications. A new built-in search function will automatically create a slick-looking mash-up of different types of data relevant to a search term, including songs, videos, photos and Wikipedia entries. The underlying bet Microsoft is making with Windows has not changed, though. Unlike Apple, which has one operating system for the iPad and one for computers, Microsoft believes the software that powers both types of devices should be the same. “The role of Windows is to unify that experience,” Mr. Leblond said. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Windows 8.1 is an update to Windows 8 that adds new features and addresses some criticisms of the software while maintaining the touch-friendly, tile-based interface. It reintroduces the Start button, offers a customizable desktop mode, and makes various other improvements, while continuing to push users toward the tile-based interface, which Microsoft believes is the future of Windows."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have been away from it for over twenty years, but I still go back in my dreams.\\" For Yep, whose father came from China, home was an apartment and the family grocery store in a neighborhood of San Francisco. It was there that he learned about patience, hard work, and getting along with neighbors. Mr. Brown, Laurence Yep's high school English teacher, often set high goals for his students. He was the first person to encourage Yep to write. The experience of that class changed the direction of Yep's life. At the age of 18 Yep published his first short story, a sci-fi fantasy. He has since written many books and many kinds of books. He has retold Chinese folk stories and written for the theater. In nearly all these varied works, Yep, who is married to the children's book author Joanne Ryder, has returned to questions he has been asking himself since childhood: What does it mean to be Chinese and American? Can one who belongs to two cultures ever feel at home anywhere? When asked, \\"How has being of a Chinese by origin been important to you?\\" Laurence Yep replied, \\"As a child I wanted to be as American as possible. Then, in my early twenties, I became very interested in my Chinese roots. For years after that, I thought that my function as a Chinese American writer was to act as a bridge between two cultures. Now, though, I am not so sure that it is possible to join them together. Compared with Asian culture, American culture pays more attention to individuals and competition. The two cultures pull in opposite directions. So I see myself now as someone who will always be on the border between two cultures. That works to my benefit as a writer because not quite fitting in helps me be a better observer.\\" 1. Where did Yep grow up? 2. Where did his father come from? 3.

News article: Roberto Carcelen (No. 92) of Seattle, competing for Peru, finished in last place in the Men's Cross-Country 15km Classic. He was greeted at the finish line by Nepal's Dachhiri Sherpa (No. 91) and gold medalist Dario Cologna of Switzerland (No. 95). Cologna finished nearly 30 minutes ahead of Carcelen, but returned to the finish to greet him. ||||| Originally published February 3, 2010 at 10:00 PM | Page modified February 3, 2010 at 11:32 PM Comments (0) E-mail article Print Share Roberto Carcelén, who now lives in Seattle, met his wife through an online-dating service and learned cross-country skiing only about five years ago. Yet he'll be in Vancouver, B.C., later this month as Peru's first and only Winter Olympian. History starts with a love story. It starts with a Peruvian man falling head over skis for an American woman in cyberspace. It starts with a connection, forged through instant messaging, that bridges the 5,000 miles between Lima, Peru, and Seattle. It starts with two people, so shy they were hesitant to e-mail pictures, pecking feverishly on their laptops five hours a day for five months and realizing they shared the same favorite books, the same beliefs about family and the same no-limit style of dreaming. History starts with love at first byte. \\"When you're chatting like that, at the end of the day, you fall in love with who the person really is,\\" Roberto Carcelén says. \\"It sounds corny, but you kind of know when you've found that person,\\" Kate Carcelén says. We might need Celine Dion, Enrique Iglesias and Whitney Houston to sing this ballad. Seldom does a corny ol' love story carry groundbreaking significance. If he hadn't met his future wife seven years ago, Roberto Carcelén would not be on his way to Vancouver to make Olympic history. He would not be living in Seattle, or cross-country skiing, or scheduling an interview with NBC's \\"Today.\\" He would not be a pioneer, the first person from Peru to compete in the Winter Olympics. We all could use his brand of destiny. \\"It worked out well for us,\\" Carcelén said, grinning. \\"I hear a lot of people who date online, it didn't work out well for them. Lucky me.\\" Olympians typically don't start skiing at age 34. Then again, you don't find The One on lavalife.com. Carcelén always lives with the best intentions and, it seems, the best results. At first, he went online seven years ago because he planned to travel from Peru to California for a marathon and he wanted to meet active Americans. He found Kate Clement, saw parts of himself in her inviting personality and love for the outdoors, and he forgot about that marathon. After all those instant-messaging sessions, they decided to meet in Miami in March 2003. Carcelén stayed in the United States for the next two months to be with Kate. He then returned to Lima, handed his printing business over to his family and moved to Seattle. The couple married that July. About five years ago, Kate introduced Roberto to skiing. He loves surfing and running. In his 20s, he was an elite Peruvian surfer, but the water in Seattle is too cold for him. When Kate likened skiing to surfing on frozen water, Roberto became intrigued. \\"It was hilarious at first,\\" said Roberto, who now is 39 and lives in Leschi. \\"I probably fell every 40 feet. People looked at me, laughed and said, 'Ah, it's your first time.' \\" After a few months, though, he showed remarkable improvement. His technique remained poor, but he possessed an incredible will. Kent Murdoch, a local skier who now helps coach Carcelén, remembers the Peruvian competing in a race four years ago. He was raw yet fascinating. \\"He was doing the right motion, but it was not a very refined motion,\\" Murdoch recalled. \\"Most people who don't learn to ski as a child have a very difficult time as an adult. But his fitness level was really, really high. He kind of willed himself up hills.\\" Even then, Carcelén had a crystallized vision: He wanted to represent Peru in the Winter Olympics. He watched the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, Italy, on television and started envisioning history. Peru has mountains and snow, but children don't grow up snowboarding or bobsledding or skiing. One problem, Carcelén said, is the snow is at too high of an elevation. \\"It's pretty crazy up there,\\" he said. \\"I don't think cross-country skiing will work. That will kill you.\\" Another problem: Carcelén believes Peruvians can be too laid back. \\"We take a different approach to life,\\" he said. \\"We kind of like living life in a good way. With sports, we're not like other cultures. We like food, wine and partying. We have an active community, but we like all things.\\" Four snowboarders from Peru were supposed to compete in the Games in Turin four years ago, but they failed to register for their events and could not participate. Because his country had little experience with even Winter Olympics logistics, the challenge would be more than just an athletic one for Carcelén. He and Kate have a 2-year-old daughter, Francesca. She doesn't fully comprehend what her father is about to do. She doesn't know she was born in the middle of an improbable quest that already has cost the family about 60,000. But whenever Francesca sees skiers on television, she's overcome with joy. \\"Papa!\\" she exclaims. Papa is the real deal now. He has gone from local act to international competitor. To qualify for the Olympics, he had to meet the standards of the International Ski Federation for the 15-kilometer freestyle event. He had to earn 300 points or less in five sanctioned races. The point system is calculated by how close a skier comes to the first-place finisher. Being within 25 percent earns 300 points. The closer you finish, the lower your score. This Olympic bid took Carcelén to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the Czech Republic. He qualified two months ago at an event at Silver Star Mountain Resort in British Columbia. He didn't celebrate too much, however. The day before that race, he found out his mother has an advanced form of liver cancer. He barely could focus during the qualifying race. He had no energy. His dream, four years in the making, felt inconsequential. He earned his Olympic berth that day mostly because he didn't know what else to do. \\"That was a big bomb for us,\\" Carcelén said. \\"My mom is one of my main supporters. Knowing she's been hit with a disease, it hits me, too. I couldn't take it. The only thing I could hold onto was that I wanted to make the Olympics to make her smile.\\" Soon after the race, he flew home to Peru for a week. His mother is doing OK, he said. Just OK. She was hospitalized for a month and caught pneumonia twice. She's now undergoing her second round of chemotherapy. Her struggles have reminded Carcelén that he's competing for more than himself, for more than his wife and daughter, for more than his entire family even. This is for Peru. His country is worth all those travel expenses. It's worth all those trips to Snoqualmie Pass. It's worth the extra day-care costs for Francesca and the price of equipment and the effort required to train four hours a day. Carcelén, a marketing consultant who also owns a Peruvian company (Inca Runners) that gives running tours through the Andes for athletic tourists, isn't focused on the sacrifices. He's fixated on the dream. \\"In Peru, 25 million people will see the benefit of this,\\" he said. Kate Carcelén, a Microsoft manager who also travels often, fully supports her husband. She grew up loving the Olympics. She was hooked while watching Nadia Comaneci in the 1976 and 1980 Summer Games. Kate loves her husband because they have the same passion for a good challenge. She refused to stop her husband from chasing this one. \\"There have been times when we've wondered, 'Oh, my God, can we deal with this?' \\" she said. \\"We always come back to, 'Of course.' \\" Peru's first Winter Olympian helped design his uniform. Roberto Carcelén called Eddie Bauer and asked for help. He went over certain Olympic requirements, gave his input and left the rest to the Bellevue-based clothing company. A 5-foot-8 wisp of an athlete, he grins when imagining how he'll look with \\"Peru\\" stitched on his clothes. \\"I don't want to give away how it looks,\\" he said. \\"You'll see soon. It's very simple, but I like it. I have so much pride.\\" His pride won't lead him to the medal stand, but that's not the goal, anyway. From amorous instant messenger to skiing novice to unlikely Olympian, his journey already has been lined with gold. History starts with a love story. On Thursday, Carcelén and Francesca will pick up Kate from the airport (she's been in Toyko on business) and drive three hours to Vancouver, B.C. In eight days, Peru's Winter Olympian will walk in the Opening Ceremony. He hopes to carry the red-and-white Peruvian flag with one hand and his daughter with the other, the solitary Olympian, the leader of Team Roberto, the smitten pioneer.

Swine Flu Causes New Headache For Small Businesses Small business owners who weathered the first wave of swine flu last spring are dealing with the illness all over again, including issues like employee absences and staffers who are afraid of getting sick. \\"Outside of the Obama health care plan, it's the topic of the day\\" in conversations that Rob Wilson has with his small business clients. Wilson, president of Employco, a Chicago-based resources outsourcing company, said that with schools and colleges back in session and the disease spreading, \\"we're seeing it start to hit businesses now.\\" Even if owners don't already have staffers staying home because they or their children are sick, they need to figure out how the work will get done despite the flu. Owners should also think about prevention, whether that means making it easy for workers to get flu shots or keeping the workplace more sanitary. And they also need to be sure they keep employees' health matters private even if co-workers want to know who's got the flu. The federal government, which this week warned small companies to be prepared to work with fewer staffers this fall, has published \\"Planning for 2009 H1N1 Influenza: A Preparedness Guide for Small Business.\\" The guide is available online at http://www.flu.gov/professional/business/smallbiz.html. There is also information for businesses from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/business/toolkit/. The government and HR consultants say owners can take steps to help limit the spread of flu in the workplace. Keeping a supply of strategically placed hand sanitizers and tissues can help. Frequent cleaning of surfaces that many people come into contact with is also a good idea. Owners might want to take some cues from managers in the health care business. Jamie Anderson, vice president of health care for Constant Care Management, a Dallas-based operator of Alzheimer's assisted living facilities, said surfaces like handrails are being disinfected several times a day instead of once a day before the flu outbreak last spring. Companies should also give staffers time off to get flu shots, and pay for shots even if they don't provide health insurance. But employers should be aware that they generally cannot require an employee to get a shot. It is critical for companies to plan now for multiple employee absences. HR consultants recommend that owners be sure that staffers are able to substitute for one another when someone is out sick. \\"If you don't have employees cross-trained, you need to do so as quickly as possible\\" Wilson said. The spread of swine flu should also make owners think about allowing employees to telecommute. That's particularly important when an employee needs to stay home to care for a sick child. But an owner should not be asking someone who's sick to log in to work from home. Small businesses such as manufacturers and retailers can be hard hit because employees can't do the work from home. Owners may want to consider hiring temporary staffers to pitch in, and maybe hiring them for training days in advance so they'll be ready to work when called in. As a preventative measure, owners might want to consider staggering shifts if possible to limit the amount of contact employees have with each other, said Debra S. Squyres, a director at Trinet Group Inc., which also provides human resources outsourcing. Along that line, when there have been outbreaks of flu near Constant Care facilities, non-essential visitors such as marketing agency representatives have not been allowed in, Anderson said. Once they're sick, it's important for staffers to feel it's OK to stay home. A boss needs to be sure he or she doesn't do anything to pressure someone with the swine flu -- or any illness for that matter -- to come to work. To do so can be a violation of federal and state laws, and it's also a bad health practice. Even if the weak economy makes employees feel compelled to come in because of job insecurity or because fellow staffers are already stretched to the limit, an owner should be emphasizing: Stay home if you're sick. Another concern for many staffers is using up sick time. A worker with a week of sick leave annually and who already took time for the seasonal flu this year might be tempted to come in rather than lose pay. Under these circumstances, the answer might be for owners to be a little more liberal with sick time. \\"Traditional sick day policies might not address this scenario,\\" Squyres said. Companies that don't have written sick leave policies should be formulating them now. It's easy enough to do with a little research. Owners can talk to other employers in the area, see how much time off they grant workers and then formulate a policy of their own. Human resources consultants can also help. When a worker comes down with what appears to be the swine flu, other staffers may want to know whether the sick employee is indeed suffering from the disease. Owners need to know it's against federal laws, including the Americans with Disability Act, to reveal health information about any employee. They'll have to tell other staffers that they cannot discuss the matter. If you have managers, be sure they don't divulge any information either. \\"I would make sure that managers are trained to respond to these kinds of inquiries,\\" Squyres said.

En revanche, l’Union européenne protège le droit des particuliers à acheter des marchandises, telles que la bière, le vin et les véhicules, dans un autre État membre et à les importer dans celui où ils résident sans devoir payer de droits supplémentaires à la frontière, à condition que ces marchandises soient destinées à des amis, à la famille ou à une vente à but non lucratif. Translate to English.","completion":"On the other hand, the European Union protects the right of individuals to purchase goods, such as beer, wine, and vehicles, in another Member State and to import them into their country of residence without having to pay additional duties at the border, provided that these goods are intended for friends, family, or non-profit sales. In this statement, the focus is on the European Union's policy of protecting the rights of individuals when it comes to purchasing goods across different Member States. It highlights that people are allowed to buy items like beer, wine, and vehicles in one country and bring them into their home country without incurring additional fees or taxes at the border. This policy is in place to promote the free movement of goods within the EU and to support the idea of a single market. By ensuring that individuals aren't penalized for purchasing goods across borders, the EU is encouraging trade and cooperation amongst its members. This can lead to increased economic growth and a stronger, more unified, European Union. However, there are certain conditions attached to this policy. The goods purchased must be intended for personal use or for the benefit of friends and family, and not for resale at a profit. This is an important distinction, as it prevents businesses and individuals from exploiting the system for financial gain. For example, if someone purchases a large quantity of wine in France and imports it into their home country of Germany with the intent to sell it for a profit, they would be violating the policy and could face penalties. However, if they were bringing the wine back to share with friends and family, or to donate to a non-profit organization, they would be within their rights and wouldn't face any additional fees. Additionally, it's important to note that there are still some taxes and duties that individuals may need to pay on certain goods, regardless of their intent. For instance, vehicles imported into a new country may be subject to registration fees and other costs associated with owning a vehicle in that country. Individuals should always research and understand the specific regulations and requirements in place for the goods they wish to import. In conclusion, the European Union policy mentioned in the statement aims to facilitate the free movement of goods and improve cooperation among its Member States by allowing individuals to purchase certain goods in different EU countries without incurring extra charges at the border. This policy ultimately contributes to the objective of a single, unified European market, and supports cooperation, trade, and economic growth within the European Union."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When you consider what subject to study in college, chances are that you and your parents will think about what you can make out of _ after graduation. You will likely ask the question: \\"Can I find a well-paid job or simply a job with a degree in this in the future?\\" This consideration also influences students when they come to choose between studying science or humanities at college. People generally believe that the humanities, which include literature , history, cultural studies and philosophy, do not prepare students for a specific vocation . Science subjects, however, are considered vocational courses that produce scientists, engineers and economists . \\"I've decided to take finance as my college major. My parents and I think this subject will help me get a good job or start a business,\\" said Huachen Yueru, 17, a science student at Wuxi No. 1 High School. Even those who choose a liberal arts education often pick the humanities subject which they think will best help them later find a job. \\"I'm going to study Spanish in college, which I believe will open doors to a high-paying job for me,\\" said Liu Chao, 18, a Senior 2 student at Dalian No 20 High School. He said few of his classmates show interest in subjects like philosophy and history, which are seen as \\"less promising\\" in job markets. The popularity of liberal arts subjects among college students has also been decreasing in the United States. American scholars and universities are concerned that in the ongoing economic crisis liberal arts subjects will be hit hardest. As money tightens , they worry that the humanities may become \\"a great luxury that many cannot afford\\", according to the New York Times. Question: Why do students show little interest in the subjects, like philosophy or history ? Options: A: Because they are not interested in them. B: Because they think these subjects are useless. C: Because they see these subjects as less-promising in job market. D: Because they like the science subjects. Answer:","completion":"C: Because they see these subjects as less-promising in job market. The article highlights that students, when choosing their college subjects, tend to prioritize their future job prospects and financial stability. As a result, they often lean towards subjects that are considered more vocational, such as science, which can directly lead to careers in fields like engineering, economics, and research. On the other hand, humanities subjects like philosophy and history are seen as less promising in job markets, since they do not prepare students for a specific vocation. The decision-making process also seems to involve input from parents who share the same concerns for their children's future prospects. For example, Huachen Yueru and his family decided to choose finance as a college major, as they believed it would provide a better chance for a well-paid job or starting a business. Similarly, students who still choose subjects within the realm of humanities tend to focus on ones that they believe will have better job opportunities and pay, like Spanish in the case of Liu Chao. The decreasing popularity of liberal arts subjects in the United States also reflects this trend, as American scholars and universities fear that economic constraints might make the humanities a luxury that people cannot afford. So, it can be inferred that students show little interest in subjects like philosophy or history because they perceive these subjects as less-promising in the job market, which plays a significant role in their choice of college major."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Peter Allen. PUBLISHED:. 11:28 EST, 25 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 11:29 EST, 25 November 2012. The search for an aristocratic Frenchman who is believed to have murdered his wife and four children in cold blood has returned to the isolated countryside where he was last seen. Police are preparing to visit underground caves and abandoned potassium mines in the area around Roquebrune-sur-Argens, where Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes was spotted by a CCTV camera in April 2011. He fled his home in Nantes, western France, a few days earlier after neighbours reported not having seen any of the family for more than three weeks. Suspect: Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes, 51, may be hiding in caves near where the family lived. Right, wife Agnes, 49, was found dead at their home along with her four children and two pet dogs. Detectives who visited initially found a severed leg under the garden terrace, and then uncovered the bodies of Mr De Ligonnes's wife and four children, as well as the family's two pet Labradors. Agnes, 49, and children Tomas, 21, Arthur, 18, Anne, 16, and Benoit, 13, had all been blasted to death as they slept before their bodies were meticulously buried in a clear attempt to conceal them from police. De Ligonnes originally came from Versailles, home of the pre-Revolutionary kings and queens of France, and was technically a count who could trace his lineage back generations. In emails uncovered earlier this year he revealed that he considered himself to be part of a Roman Catholic elite which was superior to 'the masses'. 'I think I've got a superiority complex, you could call it that,' he wrote. 'But it's based on a simple observation: I belong to a group of people who are intelligent, determined, balanced and in good moral and physical health. Such people are rare compared to the masses.' Grim: An agent carries a body out of the family's home in 2011. Investigation: Police found a severed leg under the garden terrace, which led to the discovery of the bodies. Recalling his strict, devout childhood, De Ligonnes added: 'All my adolescence was devoted to religion and faith, under the influence of my grandmother and mother. 'To such an extent that I did not rebel like other adolescents, nor indulge in drugs or run after girls.' De Ligonnes was last seen on April 15 2011 when he left a budget hotel at Roquebrune-sur-Argens in the Var region on France's Mediterranean coast, abandoning his car there. He was wearing a backpack as he strolled through a car park into the surrounding countryside, and was picked up by a CCTV camera. An extensive search was carried out in the area between April and June 2011 and - acting on new information - police now intend to resume it. 'We won't be going back to the area already searched, but will be probing places which are difficult to access, including isolated hiking trails,' said a judicial source. Caves and mines around near Roquebrune will be examined, as well as near Draguignan and Lorgues - both town where the De Ligonnes family lived in the late 1980s and 90s. Tragic: Anne Dupont, 16, and eldest Arthur, 18, were killed by gunfire. Shot: Tomas, 21, and youngest child Benoit, 13, had also been killed and their bodies put in a freshly-dug grave. There is a theory that De Ligonnes may have committed suicide in the days after the slaughter, in which case police will be searching for remains of his body. However, prosecutors have not ruled out the possibility that De Ligonnes is still living rough, or else is being hidden by members of his extended family, who own country homes around France. De Ligonnes's ancestors, who included the 19th Century poet Lamartine, originally lived in a southern province of France called the Rouergue. Five months before the murders, De Ligonnes said he had inherited a .22 rifle from his father and started target practice at a Nantes shooting club. Receipts found in his house also reveal that he bought a silencer, as well as a spade, a two-wheel trolley, chalk lime, and other equipment which could have been used to bury the bodies. It also emerged that De Ligonnes, who ran a number of internet businesses, had severe financial difficulties. Among those he had been asking for money was a mistress in Paris.

In 1613 Hanyakrakusuma rose to the throne of Mataram. He began the eastward conquest by an incursion towards Surabaya's southern flank, the Eastern Salient, Malang, and possibly Pasuruan in 1614. Surabayan forces attacked this Mataram army during its homeward march, but was defeated. In 1615 Agung conquered Wirasaba, personally leading the troops there. Surabaya did not commit its troops to help Wirasaba, due to the fear that its other ally, Tuban, would take advantage, betray Surabaya, and attack it from the rear. The conquest of the strategically important Wirasaba posed such a clear threat to Surabaya and other eastern states that the alliance rallied. They mobilized their troops and marched towards Pajang, a city under Mataram's control but ostensibly on the verge of rebellion. However, a Mataram spy in Tuban deceived the allied forces into taking a bad route towards Pajang. As a result, the allied army found itself isolated in Siwalan, near Pajang. This army was surrounded by Sultan Agung and defeated in January 1616. Agung then won victories in Lasem and Pasuruan . In 1617 Pajang finally rebelled against Mataram but was defeated, and the lord of Pajang fled to Surabaya. In 1619 Agung conquered Tuban, one of the strongest members of Surabaya's alliance. This conquest put Agung in control of Tuban's shipbuilding activities, and therefore allowed him to build a navy to challenge Surabaya's previous naval supremacy. Based on the above article, answer a question. Which city did the army find itself in after being tricked by Tuban, Siwalan or Pajang?","completion":"Based on the article, after being deceived by a Mataram spy in Tuban, the allied army found themselves isolated in the city of Siwalan, near Pajang.

But Graham Kitchener replied for Tigers with Donncha O'Callaghan in the sin-bin, before the Worcester lock was red carded minutes into the second half. Home duo Gareth Milasinovich and Matt Cox were also sin-binned as Tigers capitalised through Telusa Veainu, a penalty try and Lachlan McCaffrey. Worcester, previously unbeaten at home this season, looked dangerous from the off and opened up a 17-0 lead within 22 minutes. Heathcote kicked an early penalty and then added two conversions as Olivier collected the fly-half's pass following a Worcester scrum to score under the posts before Cox dived between the sticks. But Leicester put Warriors on the back foot and with O'Callaghan sent to the sin-bin for an offside offence, former Worcester forward Kitchener barged through just minutes before the break. Worcester, who played the first half with the wind, were down to 14 men soon after the restart when O'Callaghan received a second yellow for bringing down the Leicester maul. Milasinovich came on to make his Premiership debut but was binned shortly after and Tigers made their men advantage count as Veainu dived over in the corner. Heathcote and Owen Williams then exchanged penalties before referee Wayne Barnes awarded Leicester a penalty try, with the conversion putting them in front for the first time. Worcester ended the match with 13 men as Cox was also sin-binned, allowing Leicester to sneak a crucial fourth try though McCaffrey. And Williams' conversion ensured Worcester also missed out on a losing bonus point as Leicester moved up to second in the Premiership table.

To do that, we can add 30 to both sides of our equation: 0 + 30 = 6 * n - 30 + 30 This simplifies to: 30 = 6 * n Now, we need to figure out what number we have to multiply by 6 to get 30.

Hypothesis: \\"Tommy had realized that the time for fun had ended.\\" This hypothesis suggests that Tommy understood the need to stop any frivolous activities.

While it does mention White looking at the speaker, the critical difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the inclusion of eye color in the hypothesis. Given the options to choose from: (a). yes (b). it is not possible to tell (c). no Let's analyze each option: (a) Asserting \\"yes\\" would mean that it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. However, we cannot draw this conclusion as the color of White's eyes is not mentioned in the premise. (b) Choosing \\"it is not possible to tell\\" indicates that we cannot draw a specific conclusion about the truth of the hypothesis based solely on the premise. This is the most appropriate choice since the premise does not provide enough information to verify or disprove the eye color mentioned in the hypothesis. (c) Saying \\"no\\" would mean that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must be false. However, this cannot be concluded because the premise does not contradict the hypothesis. In conclusion, based on the premise given, it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis is true.

They visited a sports physician for a checkup. 3. The physician found that John had inflammation, but Keith didn't have any inflammation. Inflammation is the body's response to injury, usually characterized by redness, swelling, pain, and sometimes loss of function. Blood vessels dilate near the injured area during inflammation to increase blood flow, which helps deliver essential nutrients and immune cells to the site of injury for repair and healing. Since John has inflammation, his blood vessels would be dilated near the wound to aid in healing. On the other hand, Keith does not have inflammation, so his blood vessels would not be dilated.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: How many years later did Judy and Peter move into the house? 26 years later The answer is:","completion":"Title: \\"Echoes of Time: A House Reborn\\" Plot Summary: Judy and Peter, a married couple in their 40s, move into a mysterious, yet charming Victorian-style house, 26 years after a tragic event took place within its walls. Upon their arrival, they discover that there is more to this house than meets the eye. As they slowly uncover the enigmatic history hidden inside the house, they embark on an emotional journey that brings them face-to-face with the long lost spirits that had been unable to find peace. Plot: Act 1: A New Beginning In 1995, a tragedy struck the Ellis family that resided in the stunning Victorian house - Allerdale Mansion. A house fire left no survivors, and it was left abandoned for 26 years. Flash forward to 2021 - Judy and Peter, tired of their hectic city lives, decide to move to the quiet town of Mapleton to escape the routine and build a different, more tranquil life. They find the perfect home: Allerdale Mansion, an architectural gem that had been on the market for quite some time. When they first see the house, they feel an inexplicable connection with it. Despite the encroaching vines enveloping the house and garden, they can see the potential of the space and are eager to restore the residence to its former glory. Act 2: The House Comes Alive As they renovate the house, peculiar things start to happen: objects move by themselves, inexplicable cold breezes appear, and echoes of laughter can be heard in the empty rooms. Gradually, they realize they are not alone - they are surrounded by the spirits of the Ellis family, who perished in the devastating fire. Initially frightened, Judy and Peter come to realize that the spirits mean no harm. As they learn more about the family through diaries, letters, and other hidden treasures found during renovation, they begin to sympathize with the ghosts, particularly with Lucy, a teenage girl who nurtured dreams of becoming a ballet dancer, and her younger brother, Tim, who reveled in painting portraits of the nature he so fervently adored. Act 3: Mending the Past Compelled to help the spirits find peace, Judy and Peter seek to unravel the truth behind the tragic house fire. They meet the town's older residents, one of which - Evelyn, a wise lady in her 80s - shares her memories and sheds light on the family's relationships and events leading up to the fire. Secrets of betrayal, anger, and loss are revealed as the couple is faced with an astonishing truth - the house fire was not an accident. Determined to make things right, Judy and Peter gather enough evidence to reopen the 26-year-old case. As the investigation moves forward, they help challenge past misconceptions, mend long-standing rifts, and reveal the indispensable role of forgiveness in rebuilding relationships, both with others and oneself. Act 4: Resolution and Departures With the truth about the family and tragic events revealed in court, the Ellis family's spirits, including Lucy and Tim, finally find peace and are ready to move on. Judy and Peter, now emotionally connected with these souls, feel a deep sense of gratification as they watch the spirits depart, their emotional ties to the world resolved. In honor of the Ellis family, they decide to open a community center for arts and cultural development within the house. The once empty and neglected mansion is now vibrant and filled with laughter, music, and creativity. Epilogue: The movie ends with Judy and Peter standing in front of the now-bustling community center, realizing they have not only transformed the house but have grown and evolved as a couple. In helping the spirits find peace, they too have rediscovered themselves and nurtured their own emotional connections. As the sun sets, we see them entering the house, where life is now teeming with love, art, and renewed beginnings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If you've cycled a hill before, you'll already know that it hurts physically and takes a lot of effort. If you've long been the sort to hop off the bike and walk it up the hill, you'll need a little mental prepping first! Accept that riding uphill is more effort.","completion":"Embrace the challenge ahead and acknowledge that the extra exertion required will be worthwhile in the end, as it allows you to progressively improve your fitness, cycling skills, and overall confidence on the bike. Visualize successfully conquering the steep hill and feel a sense of accomplishment, even before you start pedaling. Use positive self-talk and remind yourself that you are fully capable of tackling the uphill climb; believe in your abilities and mental fortitude to push through the physical demands of the task at hand. To prepare physically, it is essential to optimize your bike setup and gear selection. Start by ensuring that your bicycle is well-maintained and properly fitted to your body. Make any necessary adjustments to the saddle, handlebars, pedals, and frame to feel comfortable and maintain a good ergonomic posture while cycling. Choose an appropriate gear ratio for the terrain, typically a lower gear for ascending steep hills as it allows for more manageable pedaling cadence and reduced strain on leg muscles. Familiarize yourself with the functionalities of your bike's gear shifting system so that you can efficiently switch gears as needed. While climbing steep hills, maintain a steady and controlled cadence by focusing on even, rhythmic pedal strokes. This prevents muscle fatigue from inefficient use of energy and provides a consistent power output throughout the ascent. Balance your body weight distribution on the bike, with a slight pressure on the front handlebars to ensure traction and maintain stability. Leaning too far back can result in a loss of grip and control, especially on uneven or loose surfaces. Breathing is another crucial aspect to consider while cycling uphill. Focus on deep, controlled breaths that fully fill your lungs with oxygen, and exhale completely to expel carbon dioxide. This enhances oxygen delivery to the muscles and helps prevent build-up of lactic acid, which can cause cramping and soreness. Staying relaxed and composed, despite the physical effort required, can also improve your overall performance. Additionally, monitor your energy levels and pace yourself appropriately throughout the climb. It is important not to expend too much energy on the initial part of the hill, as you may need to conserve some for any further inclines or the remainder of your cycling route. Also, consider fueling your body with nutrient-rich foods that provide the necessary energy for the task ahead, hydrate adequately, and incorporate regular rest intervals if needed. Lastly, incorporate hill-focused training into your cycling routine to develop physical and mental endurance over time. This involves regularly cycling on different types of inclines, gradually increasing the steepness and difficulty of the hills you tackle. Also, experiment with approaches such as interval training, hill repeats, and group rides to further solidify your climbing skills and build camaraderie with fellow cyclists. By diligently preparing mentally and physically, optimizing your bike setup and gear selection, maintaining proper form and technique, focusing on breathing, pacing yourself, and incorporating hill climbing into your regular training routine, you will ultimately feel more confident and capable of tackling even the steepest hills while cycling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Updated Jul 17, 2013 3:55 PM ET FIFA President Sepp Blatter plans to ask the governing body's executive committee to consider moving the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to the winter in order to avoid the searing summer heat. ''If this World Cup is to become a party for the people, you can't play football in the summer,'' Blatter said Wednesday. ''You can cool down the stadiums but you can't cool down the whole country.'' Despite health concerns included in an official report before the vote, the FIFA executive committee opted for the tiny emirate's bid in 2010. Blatter has repeatedly refused to say if he backed Qatar, which can have temperatures of 50 degrees C (122 degrees F) during the summer. In May, Blatter said in an interview with a French newspaper it would be ''not rational and reasonable'' to stage the first World Cup in the Middle East in the summertime. Moving the tournament to the winter would have a major impact on the schedule of European football leagues, which would have to change things for at least one season. ''There is still enough time,'' Blatter said. ''I will bring this up to the executive committee.'' Air-conditioned stadiums to beat the heat were a defining theme of Qatar's bid, but the cooling technology only resolves the problem in venues for players, fans and officials. ''We have to protect our partners, our commercial partners, our TV partners. We have to be tough on this,'' said Blatter, who spoke during a two-day conference on sports, media and economy set up by German great Franz Beckenbauer in Austria. The head of the local organizing committee, Hassan Al-Thawadi, said Qatar bid for a tournament in the summer but left the option open of a possible switch to another time of the year. ''It there is a wish from the football community to move the World Cup to the winter, we are open for it,'' said Al-Thawadi, who spoke to the conference through a live video connection.

(CNN) -- English club Chelsea have completed the signing of Oriol Romeu from Spanish and European champions Barcelona. The 19-year-old is currently playing for Spain at the World Under-20 Championships in Colombia and has signed a four-year deal with last season's Premier League runners-up. The deal is worth 7 million and includes a buy back clause, set at 14 million after the first year and 21 million after the second. Romeu started his career at Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol before joining the Camp Nou academy in 2004. The midfielder, who can also play in central defence, made his debut for Barcelona in last season's Spanish Supercup match with Seville and got his first taste of league action against Deportivo in May 2010. He has played 90 minutes in both of Spain's games at the World Under-20 Championships, when they beat Costa Rica and Ecuador. Chelsea official web site confirmed the signing and said Romeu is \\"renowned for his strength and his expansive passing ability.\\" Another player leaving Barcelona is Jeffren Suarez after he agreed to join Sporting Lisbon. The Portuguese outfit have paid 5 million for the 23-year-old which, like the Romeu deal, includes a buy back option. Jeffren joined Barca from Tenerife in 2004 and made his debut for the Catalan club in the 2006-07 season.

After leaving Wingfield Manor, Mary was taken by her new gaoler Sir Ralph Sadler to Sheffield in Derbyshire and then to Tutbury. In this sentence, the sequence of events is as follows: - Mary leaves Wingfield Manor - Mary is taken by her new gaoler, Sir Ralph Sadler - Mary is taken to Sheffield in Derbyshire - Mary is then taken to Tutbury 2. After leaving Sheffield, Mary was transferred from her new Gaoler Sir Ralph Sadler to Wingfield Manor in Derbyshire and then to Tutbury. In this sentence, the sequence of events is different: - Mary leaves Sheffield - Mary is transferred from her new Gaoler, Sir Ralph Sadler - Mary is taken to Wingfield Manor in Derbyshire - Mary is then taken to Tutbury Primary differences between these two sentences are: - In the first sentence, Mary starts her journey from Wingfield Manor, whereas in the second sentence, she begins her journey in Sheffield. - In the first sentence, Sir Ralph Sadler takes Mary to Sheffield. In contrast, the second sentence implies that Mary was transferred from Sir Ralph Sadler after leaving Sheffield. - In the first sentence, Mary goes from Wingfield Manor to Sheffield and then to Tutbury. In the second sentence, she goes from Sheffield to Wingfield Manor and then to Tutbury. Both sequences end in Tutbury, but the journey in between is different. As a result, these two sentences do not have the same meaning and describe distinct sequences of events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Process: - An egg is laid by a mother bird - A baby bird forms within the egg if it is fertilized - The baby bird begins pecking out of the egg - The baby bird is unable to fly to get food - The mother bird must feed the baby bird food - The bird grows stronger and grows wings - The bird is able to fly - The bird is able to leave the nest and find food - The bird is able to reproduce. Question: suppose safe environment for mother bird happens, how will it affect mother bird dies. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"In a safe environment for the mother bird, there are increased chances of her survival during the process of laying eggs, incubating, and raising her offspring. However, if the mother bird dies in this supposed safe environment, the effects on the baby bird and the overall process will still be significant despite the favorable conditions. When a mother bird dies, the baby bird's survival depends on several factors. Here, we will analyze the effects and their magnitude on the second effect mentioned, which is \\"The baby bird forms within the egg if it is fertilized.\\" 1. More effect: During the incubation period, if the mother bird dies, the loss of warmth, protection, and humidity provided by the mother may have a more significant effect on the developing baby bird. In this crucial stage, the absence of the mother's care could lead to inadequate development or even death of the embryo. This result means a more substantial effect on the second effect mentioned: the formation of a baby bird within the fertilized egg. 2. Less effect: If the mother bird's death occurs close to the hatching time, the baby bird may still be able to hatch successfully. In this scenario, other birds or even an attentive sibling may take over the responsibility of breaking the eggshell, leading to minimal impact on the baby bird forming within the fertilized egg. However, the impact of the mother bird's absence on the subsequent development stages will still be considerable. With no mother to feed and protect the baby bird, its chances of survival decrease significantly. This situation might lead to a less effect on the second effect mentioned in terms of forming the baby bird, but the overall process will be affected negatively. 3. No effect: In rare instances, the death of the mother bird may have no effect on the formation of the baby bird within the fertilized egg if the environment is safe and all necessary conditions for successful development are met. For example, if the temperature and humidity in the environment are ideal, the egg might not require the mother bird's incubation, leading to the embryo's healthy development. However, it is essential to note that this scenario is improbable and unlikely in most cases. In conclusion, the death of the mother bird in a supposed safe environment will generally have a more significant effect on the second effect mentioned (\\"The baby bird forms within the egg if it is fertilized\\") due to the essential role the mother plays during the incubation and development stages. Although the extent of the impact may vary depending on the specific stage of development and the surrounding conditions, it is undeniable that the mother bird's death will significantly influence the overall process."},{"prompt":"Q: Is this product review positive?

But she had a lot of curiosity, which kept her going. She sought many wise people to help her understand why she was so bad that her mother hurt her and why she was unable to be better so that men wouldn't hurt her. She was on a journey that she thought was to help her be \\"better\\". She carried a big bag with her everywhere she went. Inside it were all the hurts she had experienced. Because she was so eager to please those who offered their wisdom, she willingly agreed with what they said about forgiving. But she held that bag of hurts tightly.

Proper rest and good nutrition can improve coping skills, so can good parenting. Make time for your kids each day. Whether they need to talk with you or just be in the same room with you, make yourself available. Even as kids get older, quality time is important. It's really hard for some people to come home after a tiring day of work, get down on the floor, and play with their kids or just talk to them about their day -- especially if they've had a stressful day themselves. But expressing interest in your kids shows that they' re important to you. Help your child deal with stress by talking about what may be causing it. Together, you can come up with a few solutions. For example, he should cut back on after-school activities, spending more time talking with his parents or teachers, developing an exercise plan or keeping a journal. You can also help by predicting potentially stressful situations and preparing kids for them. For example, let a child know ahead of time, but not too far ahead of time, that a doctor's appointment is coming up and talk about what will happen there. Keep in mind, though, that younger kids probably won't need too much advance preparation. Too much information can cause more stress. Remember that some level of stress is normal, Let kids know that it's OK to feel angry, scared, lonely, or anxious and that other people share those feelings, too. When kids can't or won't discuss these problems, try talking about your own concerns. This shows that you're willing to handle tough topics and are available to talk with when they're ready. If a child shows symptoms that concern you and is unwilling to talk, consult a counselor or other mental health experts. Most parents have the skills to cope with their children's stress. The time to seek professional attention is when any change in behavior continues to exist, when stress is causing serious anxiety, or when the behavior is causing significant problems in functioning at school or at home. Question: Why do some parents feel it difficult to spare quality time for their kids? Options: A: Their kids are growing so fast. B: They have too much housework. C: Their kids are losing interest in them. D: They are tired out after work. The answer to this question is:","completion":"D: They are tired out after work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Iain Cameron, from Stirling, spends his spare time monitoring snow levels in Scotland from one winter to the next, and has spent the past 22 years travelling the country in pursuit of his curious hobby. While walking on Scotland's highest mountain with fellow amateur researcher Alistair Todd in July, the pair happened upon an unusual natural phenomenon - a snow tunnel. \\"They are caused by water which burrows through the snow drift initially, creating a little tunnel,\\" Mr Cameron said. \\"Then wind begins to blow through the space and starts to expand the tunnel. \\"They begin as a couple of feet wide and get larger as the warmer air begins to eat away at the snow and melt it.\\" He added: \\"The further into summer we get, the bigger the tunnels get. You're eventually able to walk through them, like I did in these photographs.\\" The tunnels are not a new discovery, but Mr Cameron said they only occur in specific areas where snow lasts into the summer months. He said: \\"There are very few places in Scotland you get these tunnels, but they tend to form in the same places pretty much every year and at the same time.\\" \\"We don't actively look for the tunnels, they're just a bonus.\\" Despite Mr Cameron's snow-exploring experience, he still gets a little anxious. \\"It's very weird to think that there are hundreds or even thousands of tons of snow above your head. It can be quite disconcerting but we're very sensible and take precautions,\\" he said. \\"It's a surreal experience, being inside the tunnels. Some of them are completely jaw-dropping.\\" He plans to return to Ben Nevis in August when he said he expected the tunnels to be \\"even bigger and better\\". As summer turns to autumn, the tunnels continue to expand before finally collapsing. Mr Cameron said: \\"After August, the tunnels will eventually become 'bridges' as they continue to expand. The snow is being melted from below, by the wind, and also from above, from the sunlight. \\"The snow gets thinner and thinner and eventually collapses, and melts.\\" When snowfall begins again later in the year, the cycle is reborn. Mr Cameron's research involves monitoring patches of snow across the country, taking pictures and measuring them. His findings are then put into reports which are published by the Royal Meteorological Society. Last year, he recorded the most surviving patches of snow in more than 20 years, but Mr Cameron insists he is no expert. \\"I do this in my own time - I have a day job.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the better-known name of the person who sang lead vocals on \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\"? , can you please find it? Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows.

Review: The events of the 11th of September 2001 cast its shadow on this Oscar award ceremony with a one minute silence before the in memoriam montage and there was little in the way of the all singing all dancing comedy extravaganza that we\`d come to expect of this award show but this was by no means a bad thing . Entertainment was more or less curtailed to a LOTR send up with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson and that was it . The rest of the show was taken up with clips from the nominations and I have to admit this was actually more enjoyable than the overblown song and dance numbers we\`ve seen over the years and Whoopi Goldberg was by no means a bad presenter unlike the very esoteric David Letterman from a few years ago and the one minute silence for the victims of 9/11 was haunting and dignified As for the awards New Zealand was absolutely robbed .

If the rock melts completely, it will cool to become an igneous rock. Choices: - carbohydrates - grains - fossils - minerals A: Answer:","completion":"Metamorphism, as mentioned in the paragraph, is a process that causes changes in rocks due to heat or pressure, but it does not cause a rock to melt completely. If a rock were to melt entirely, it would cool and solidify, ultimately becoming an igneous rock. Metamorphism, instead, influences the transformation of the minerals within the rock. From the given options: 1. Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are organic compounds consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen that serve as an energy source for living organisms. They have no relevance to the process of metamorphism or changes in rocks. 2. Grains: While grains might refer to the small components or structure of a rock, the term is not specific enough to describe the changes that occur during metamorphism. 3. Fossils: Fossils are the preserved remains or impressions of ancient organisms, typically found in sedimentary rocks. Although they can be affected by the metamorphic process, the indicated transformation in the paragraph is primarily concerned with the mineral composition of the rocks, not the fossils present. 4. Minerals: Minerals are the essential components of rocks, composed of specific chemical compositions and defined crystal structures. They are responsible for the rock's properties and can undergo changes during metamorphism. The minerals present in the rock change their composition, arrangement, and physical properties when subjected to heat, pressure, or chemically reactive fluids, resulting in a new metamorphic rock with different characteristics. Hence, the correct option for the changes that occur from heat or pressure during metamorphism is Minerals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Perfume is a luxury item and its cost can vary hugely between products. Some perfumes are under 20 dollars while others cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Before you go shopping, decide how much money you want to spend on a perfume. If the perfume is a gift, consider both your personal finances and your relationship with the recipient of the gift. If you are giving perfume to your wife, you may want to spend more than you would on perfume for an acquaintance you don't know very well. Perfumes have different names depending on their lasting power. Typically, the most expensive perfumes are the ones that last longest, while cheaper perfumes don't have as much staying power. You can usually see the type or concentration of the perfume under its name on the front of the bottle. Eau de cologne has the lowest fragrance concentration, lasting about two hours. It is 3-5% oil in a mixture of water and alcohol. Eau de toilette is a slightly more concentrated type of perfume and will last three to four hours. It is a about 4-8% oil. Eau de parfum has a higher oil concentration than eau de cologne and lasts around six hours. It is 15-18% oil mixed with alcohol. The perfume with the highest concentration is simply called perfume or parfum. It has great staying power and will last all day. It is 15-30 oil mixed with alcohol. Consider which scents you or the perfume recipient enjoy. Perfumes generally are separated into four scent categories, though many perfumes contain a subtle mix of scents. If you are buying perfume for someone else, see what kinds of perfumes they use. If you have no idea what kind of scents you like, don't worry: you can figure out what scent family you prefer when you are trying perfumes in the store. Floral/Sweet perfumes smell like freshly-cut flowers. Common scents used in floral perfumes are rose, lavender, carnation and orange blossom. Floral perfumes are the most popular perfumes for women because of their sweet, feminine scent that most enjoy. Citrus/Fruity perfumes smell like fruits, particularly citrus fruits. Common tones are citrus fruits like orange, grapefruit and lime, but also other fruit like apricot, apple or peach. In general these scents are bright and refreshing. Oriental/Spicy perfumes smell musky and complex. Many of them contain tones of spices like star anise, cinnamon and vanilla. Woody/Chypre perfumes smell woody and earthy. Many contain scents like bergamot, oakmoss and patchouli. Be conscious of the scents people around you are wearing, no matter if you're at work, on the train or in class. If you catch a whiff of something you really like, ask the wearer what kind of perfume it is. You never know, you could find your new scent without even stepping into a store. If you don't like the scent of your friends' perfumes, try to pinpoint what about them you don't like. This is valuable information that will help you narrow down your options.","completion":"Perfumes are special things that smell nice, and they can cost a little bit of money or a lot of money. Some perfumes stay smelly for a long time and others only smell for a little while. There are different kinds of perfumes, like ones that smell like flowers, ones that smell like fruits, ones that have a strong, spicy smell, or ones that smell like trees and dirt. If you want to buy a perfume for someone or for yourself, you can think about how much money you want to spend and what kinds of smells you like.

There will be no strikes over Easter; planned strikes could still be avoided. Unite says BA plans will damage customer service and brand. BA said union proposals would save the airline less money than its own changes.","completion":"Title: British Airways Faces Strikes in March: Impact and Possibility of Resolution Introduction The British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA) has announced two separate strike periods for their members working for British Airways (BA). The first strike is set to last three days, commencing on March 20, followed by a second strike lasting four days, starting on March 27. These strikes arise from a dispute between the pilots' union, Unite, and British Airways over planned changes that the union says will damage customer service and harm the airline's brand. Fortunately, no strikes are planned during the Easter holidays, and there is still hope for a resolution before the industrial action takes place. Strikes and Their Duration The first strike is scheduled to begin on March 20 and last for three consecutive days, ending on March 22. Following a brief respite, the second strike is planned to start on March 27 and continue for four days, ending on March 30. Both strikes are aimed at exerting pressure on British Airways to reconsider their proposed changes. Impact on Easter Plans Travelers can breathe a sigh of relief as no strikes have been planned over the Easter holidays. The union is aware of the potential disruption that could be caused to millions of passengers and has deliberately avoided planning any industrial action during this busy period. However, passengers scheduled to travel during the announced strike periods should be prepared for potential disruptions, including flight cancellations and delays. Unite's Concerns over BA's Plans Unite has expressed concerns that British Airways' plans to cut costs and change working conditions could damage the quality of customer service and tarnish the airline's reputation. The union argues that the proposed changes put too much emphasis on cost-saving, at the expense of maintaining BA's brand value and high standards. BA's Response and Alternative Proposals In response, British Airways has maintained that the proposals put forth by the union would not save the airline as much money as its own plans. The airline is facing financial pressures due to increased competition in the industry and the rising costs of fuel. As a result, BA believes that the cost-saving measures it has proposed are necessary to remain competitive in the market. Possibility of Avoiding Strikes While the strike action is currently scheduled to take place, there is still potential for negotiations to prevent the industrial action. Both parties are urged to come together and seek a mutually agreeable solution in order to avoid further disruption to passengers and harm to British Airways' business. Conclusion As British Airways faces two separate strike actions in March due to ongoing disputes with the pilot's union, Unite, the risk of disruption to passengers remains high. With the potential impact on customer service and reputation, it is crucial for both parties to engage in meaningful negotiations and reach a resolution before the strike action takes place. In the meantime, passengers traveling during the strike periods should stay informed of any developments and potential changes to their plans."},{"prompt":"Question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What nationality was the presenter who fronted the second series of Hair ?

The given scenario only mentions there being eight drag racers competing on a curvy track with helmets on, and the presence of a line of trees around the edge of the course.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Both men get tagged “moderate,” but for different reasons. Mr. Romney is a technocrat, a business leader who focuses on getting the job done. As governor, that meant governing in a way that suited Massachusetts. Today the job is winning the presidency, and if that means “evolving” in his views as the primary electorate swings further right, and running away from his signature accomplishment as governor, so be it. You’d think that even if they don’t like it, those on the extremes would respect the fact that those of us in the sensible center decide general elections — and seek out a candidate who appeals to us. But the unhealthy demand for ideological purity obscures a hopeful fact about the GOP presidential field: There are actually two sensible, experienced grownups. And while Mr. Romney is far more appealing than any of the other choices, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman is more principled, has a far more impressive resume and offers a significantly more important message. AFTER MONTHS of flirting with candidates who considered inexperience an asset, obstinance and vitriol a virtue and extremism — even flakiness — a job requirement, Republican voters seem to be settling down. Increasingly, they are rallying around a grownup who has impressive experience as a chief executive, in and out of government, and a history of making things work rather than pursuing ideological fetishes. Yet nearly two-thirds of Republican primary voters still reject Mitt Romney, and his opponents are convinced they can raise that number by screaming: “Moderate! Moderate! Moderate!” Mr. Huntsman is a true conservative, with a record and platform of bold economic reform straight out of the free-market bible, but he’s a realist, whose goal is likewise to get things done. Under his leadership, Utah led the nation in job creation, and the Pew Center on the States ranked it the best-managed state in the nation. He also is head and shoulders above the field on foreign policy. He served as President George H.W. Bush’s U.S. ambassador to Singapore and President George W. Bush’s deputy U.S. trade representative and U.S. trade ambassador, and the next entry on that resume is even more impressive: He was a popular and successful governor in an extremely conservative state, well positioned to become a leading 2012 presidential contender, when Mr. Obama asked him to serve in arguably our nation’s most important diplomatic post, U.S. ambassador to China. It could be political suicide, but he didn’t hesitate. As he told our editorial board: “When the president asks you to serve, you serve.” We don’t agree with all of Mr. Huntsman’s positions; for but one example, he championed one of the nation’s biggest private-school voucher programs. And with George Will calling him the most conservative candidate and The Wall Street Journal editorial page endorsing his tax plan, independent voters might find less to like about his positions than, say, Mr. Romney’s or Newt Gingrich’s. What makes him attractive are the essential values that drive his candidacy: honor and old-fashioned decency and pragmatism. As he made clear Wednesday to a room packed full of USC students on the first stop of his “Country First” tour, his goal is to rebuild trust in government, and that means abandoning the invective and reestablishing the political center. Don’t expect him to engage in meaningless hyperbole or apologize for his occasional moderate positions. As he explained recently: “We have to draw from ideas that are doable and not so outlandishly stupid that they create a lot of political infighting and finger-pointing and never, ever in a thousand years are going to get done.” And don’t expect him to spout ridiculous superlatives about the existential threat the incumbent poses to our nation; President Obama simply has failed to lead or has led in the wrong direction, he argues. Why on earth would we want a candidate to say anything worse about his opponent? Explain why he’s wrong, and why you’re right, and let the voters choose. We need a president who can work within our poisonous political environment to solve our nation’s problems, not simply score partisan points. Someone who understands that negotiation is essential in a representative democracy, and that there are good ideas across the political spectrum. Someone who has a well-defined set of core values but is not so rigid that he ignores new information and new conditions. Someone who has shown himself to be honest and trustworthy. And competent. Someone whose positions are well-reasoned and based on the world as it is rather than as he pretends it to be. Someone with the temperament and judgment and experience to be taken seriously as the commander in chief and leader of the free world. We think Mr. Romney could demonstrate those characteristics. Mr. Huntsman already does. And we are proud to endorse him for the Republican nomination for president of the United States. ||||| MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. - Jon Huntsman will aim to give Mitt Romney a boost going into the final week before the South Carolina primary, endorsing his one-time rival in the hopes of helping him clinch the nomination. The former Utah governor's announcement - set for 11 a.m. Monday in a speech at the Convention Center here - comes after several days of discussion within the campaign about the consequences of splitting moderate voters with Romney in Saturday's vote. Resigned to the fact that Huntsman wouldn't win, they believed that their votes would be better used helping Romney hold off his conservative challengers and wrap up the primary race early. Text Size - + reset But those conservative challengers greeted the Huntsman news with a shrug. \\"Moderates are backing moderates,\\" Rick Santorum said at a diner in Columbia Monday. \\"That's sort of the bottom line. No surprise there. Gov. Huntsman ran as a moderate, trying to compete for Gov. Romney for the establishment moderate vote. And Gov. Romney had a leg up on him being a solid moderate that the establishment could get behind. Gov. Huntsman wasn't able to crack through that. So I'm not surprised by that all, and I anticipated that actually sooner than today.\\" Newt Gingrich said he believed Huntsman’s exit helps him. “It narrows down the field and I think the next five or six days are going to tell the tale,” Gingrich told POLITICO Monday morning. “If the conservatives consolidate, it’s clear that I’ll beat Romney.” Gingrich warned against conservatives splitting the vote. “The next five days are going to be wild. Really, the test here is really simple: if the conservatives consolidate, Romney loses decisively. If they don’t consolidate, it’s going to be very close,” Gingrich said. Huntsman's decision to drop out comes less than a week after he claimed victory from his third-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, the contest he'd staked his candidacy on ever since entering the race last summer. Huntsman experienced a surge of support in the closing days before that vote, but he still fell well short of Ron Paul - and even further behind Romney, whom he'd sniped at in the closing days. A source said that Huntsman's rationale for now backing Romney, who he has criticized for weeks on the campaign trail as lacking a \\"core,\\" is that he didn't want to block the person best prepared in the field to beat Obama, and then to lead the country and grapple with the economy. \\"Jon Huntsman is proud of the campaign he ran and the message of restoring trust in Washington,\\" said a campaign official familiar with his thinking. \\"He didn't want to stand in the way of the candidate most likely to beat Barack Obama and turn the economy around. That's Mitt Romney.\\" Although Huntsman was only polling at about 5 percent in South Carolina, his voters are most likely to wind up with Romney. If either Newt Gingrich or Rick Santorum makes a run at the frontrunner in the final week, those handful of votes that otherwise would've gone to Huntsman could prove pivotal. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"So, this article talks about two men named Mr. Romney and Mr. Huntsman, who both want to be president. People sometimes call both of them \\"moderate,\\" which means they have ideas that are neither too extreme to the left or right.

ICSID is an international arbitration institution and a member of the World Bank Group, which facilitates legal dispute resolution and conciliation between international investors. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., in the United States. On the other hand, \\"International Organization\\" in the given context refers to a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the field of international affairs. It is published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the International Organization Foundation.

Retiree BenjamÃ­n EspÃ³sito is having trouble getting started on his first novel. He pays a visit to the offices of Judge Irene MenÃ©ndez Hastings to tell her about his plans to recount the story of the Liliana Coloto case, the one they both worked on 25 years before, when Irene was his new department chief and he was the federal agent assigned to the case. Irene suggests that Benjamin start at the beginning. The beginning marks the discovery of Coloto's body, raped and murdered in her home in 1974. EspÃ³sito promises her widower, Ricardo Morales, that the killer will do life for his crime. Morales states that he opposes the death penalty. EspÃ³sito's investigation is joined by his alcoholic friend and assistant, Pablo Sandoval, and the Cornell Law School-educated Hastings. Before the three can start, their rival, Romano, tries to show them up by having officers beat a confession out of two innocent laborers, who had been working near the couple's apartment. EspÃ³sito has the confessions overturned and lashes out at Romano in a justice building hall. EspÃ³sito threatens to file a complaint as Romano racially insults the construction workers. Back on the case, EspÃ³sito notices that pictures from Coloto's home town of Chivilcoy frequently show a man named Isidoro GÃ³mez whose eyes never leave her. Although Irene is skeptical, BenjamÃ­n insists all of a young man's feeling for a woman is spoken there. Seeing that GÃ³mez has disappeared, EspÃ³sito and Sandoval travel to Chivilcoy and sneak into GÃ³mez's mother's house, where they find his letters to her. Sandoval steals them but they contain nothing useful and, when their supervising judge learns of the illegal action, the case is closed.

Notwithstanding its commitment to the quality of food and the upscale ambiance, customer feedback brings to light an area of the restaurant's operations that requires significant improvement.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Krishnan Nair (25 July 1939 - 16 November 1980), better known by his stage name Jayan, was an Indian film actor, naval officer, stunt performer and cultural icon of the 1970s. He starred in over 120 Malayalam films. During his film career, he was primarily an action star and was particularly famous for his macho image and unique style. He was reputed for his chauvinistic appeal and well known for performing stunts of a dangerous nature on his own. In the late 1990s and early 21st century, there was a resurgence of Jayan's screen persona in Kerala and his old movie scenes came to prominence again. It was owed mostly to programs by popular mimicry stage artists in the State, whose imitations of the star's mannerisms caught on and soon became commonplace in college stage events, television programs and mimicry stage shows along with quotes of superhuman strength known as Jayan quotes. However, it has been pointed out that many grotesquely imitated screen dialogues of Jayan are not actually his, but that of dubbing artist Aleppey Ashraf, who dubbed for many of his characters after his death. The \\"comeback\\" of Jayan and his renewed popularity lately may be taken as an affirmation that Jayan has not been replaced even nearly three decades after his death. Today, Jayan is best remembered as the first and best action star of Malayalam cinema, so far, besides his trademark colourful attire, risky stunts, machismo mannerisms and unique speaking style. He has rightly won immortality in the hearts of the Malayalam film fans as a martyr in his yearning to thrill and entertain them even by putting his life at stake. Madhu, a famous actor prominent in the 1960s, once stated in an interview: \\"Jayan will forever be young and alive. No one can ever visualise him as an old man.\\" A film titled Avatharam presently under production, is attempting to bring back his screen persona using advanced technologies.

To prepare for this huge adventure, Ben has been training and practicing swimming a lot. He also has a team of people who help him, like someone who helps him plan his path, someone who takes care of making sure he eats healthy, and someone who helps him stay strong. When Ben is swimming in the ocean, there will be a boat nearby with even more friends and helpers. They will make sure he is safe and has everything he needs, like food, water, and a nice place to sleep when he is not swimming. Ben is very excited and happy to try this amazing challenge, and people all over the world are cheering him on. If he can do it, he will inspire many people to try new things and work hard to achieve their dreams. So, next time you go swimming, just think about Ben Hooper and his fantastic adventure swimming across the Atlantic Ocean. Maybe one day, you could also do something very special that nobody has ever done before!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

And her dream finally came true, thanks to the death of 74-year-old Porter Strickley. She could not deny that she had learned the job well, working for that old pain-in-the-butt. He was 57 when she interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney. At the time, she thought he was 70. Two months ago, she had become the District Attorney. She loved seeing her name on the door. And she felt a rush of adrenaline every time a judge referred to her as 'The District Attorney' in open court.

There was a soft knock, and Andrea Newly opened the door just enough to peek in. \\"Come in, Andrea.\\" Angela sometimes wondered if she had made a mistake two weeks ago when she hired this timid young lady as her assistant. Angela had been impressed with her resume. But in person, Andrea was quiet, and seemed to be rather intimidated by Angela. But Andrea was enthralled with every word Angela spoke. And the new D.A. couldn't resist the prospect of being god to her assistant. She had hired her on the spot, even though she knew Andrea would stress her patience. But Angela was confident the 25-year-old could be molded into her mentor's image. And thereby, become a powerful force for justice in the D.A.'s office. Andrea took a chair across from the D.A.

Now, I know you understand the difference between good behavior and bad behavior, right? So these girls behaved very badly. They hurt someone, and that person sadly died. Imagine if someone took away your favorite toy and smashed it. You’d feel sad and upset, right? Now, think about how much more it hurts when someone hurts a person instead of a toy. It's a lot, lot worse, isn't it? The woman they hurt was vulnerable. Like how a baby bird is vulnerable because it can't fly or find its own food yet. This woman needed help from other people for various things. But instead of helping her, these girls chose to hurt her. It’s very important to remember, though, that hurting others is never okay. Because they did something really, really bad, the girls were taken to a place called a court, where some people decide what happens to those who break the rules. Have you ever been put in time-out when you’ve misbehaved? This is like a very serious version of a time-out for grown-ups. The court decided that these girls must spend a long, long time in a place called prison, away from their families, friends, and all the fun things they love doing. This is because what they did was extremely wrong. The court said they must stay in prison for at least 15 years. Think about how old you are now. That's three times your lifetime! This is a big punishment, but it matches the very big mistake they made. Remember, behaving badly can lead to serious consequences. It's always important to be kind, gentle, and helpful to everyone around you. If you see someone who is vulnerable, like that baby bird, or like the woman in our story, do the right thing. Help them.

Test sentence: \\"I weighed the package.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","completion":"Yes, the test sentence \\"I weighed the package\\" is a correct grammatical English sentence. To further analyze and explain why this sentence is grammatically correct, let's break down its structure and individual components. 1. Subject: \\"I\\" - The subject of the sentence refers to the person performing the action, which in this case is the speaker themselves. Using the pronoun \\"I\\" is appropriate here as it denotes the speaker or writer of the sentence. 2. Verb: \\"weighed\\" - The verb in the sentence is \\"weighed,\\" which indicates the action being taken by the subject. \\"Weighed\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"to weigh,\\" implying that the action of weighing the package has already occurred. The usage of the past tense verb is grammatically correct in this context, as it matches with the subject \\"I.\\" 3. Object: \\"the package\\" - The object of the sentence is the entity that receives the action of the verb, which in this case is \\"the package.\\" \\"The\\" is an article that is used to identify a specific object, while \\"package\\" serves as the noun that is the receiver of the action. In combination, \\"the package\\" is a grammatically correct and appropriate object for this sentence. Putting all these components together, you have the sentence \\"I weighed the package,\\" which follows standard English grammatical rules. The subject, verb, and object are all clearly identified and appropriately used in their respective roles to convey the meaning of the sentence. The sentence is also both coherent and concise, making it an effective and clear example of proper English grammar and syntax."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the sentence \\"A man passing by a group along a cobblestone road.\\", is the sentence \\"A man is walking.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, based on the scenario described in the initial sentence - \\"A man passing by a group along a cobblestone road.\\" - the statement \\"A man is walking.\\" can be considered true. Though the original sentence does not explicitly state the mode of the man's movement, the phrase \\"passing by\\" typically implies walking or moving in some form, particularly in the context of a cobblestone road. If the man was in a vehicle or on a bicycle, a different expression, such as \\"driving by\\" or \\"riding by,\\" might've been used to more accurately portray the scene. Overall, the action of \\"passing by\\" inherently includes some form of locomotion. In our everyday life, when we say someone is \\"passing by\\" something or someone, we usually understand it as that person is moving or walking past. More often than not, it is linked to pedestrian movement. However, it is important to remember that while \\"walking\\" can be understood from the phrase \\"passing by,\\" the actual form of motion isn't specified in the sentence. The man could also be running or jogging, for instance. Despite these possible variations, it's generally safe to infer that the man is walking, especially given a cobblestone road's context which can make running or jogging less probable due to its uneven surface. In terms of the verb tense used in the sentence, while the first sentence is in the present continuous tense, the latter is in the present simple tense. The use of the continuous tense in the first sentence conveys the action's ongoing nature, while the simple present in the second sentence speaks of a general action or habit. Thus, although the two sentences use different tenses, they both accurately describe actions an individual could take under the given circumstances. In conclusion, even though the original sentence does not explicitly indicate the man's mode of movement, the expression \\"passing by\\" coupled with the setting of a cobblestone road suggests that it's logical and correct to deduce that \\"A man is walking.\\" Considering the verb tenses used in both sentences, we can confirm that they both depict plausible actions or habits of the man."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What parts of Chinese culture were brought into Japanese society?\\" is \\"Literature\\"?","completion":"Yes, that's right! Chinese culture was brought into Japanese society through Buddhism, and it included many things like literature, religion, history, music, and painting. So, literature is one of the parts of Chinese culture that were introduced to Japan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

My then-teenage daughter and I went to a new restaurant. It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

After a while, people became attached to one brand and sales leveled off(stage of maturity). Sales went into a slight decrease when freeze-dried coffees were introduced(stage of decline). The importance of the product life cycle to marketers is this: Different stages in the product life cycle call for different strategies. The goal is to extend product life so that sales and profits do not drop. One strategy is called market modification. It means that marketing managers look for new users and market sections. Did you know, for example, that the backpacks that so many students carry today were originally designed for the soldiers? Market modification also means searching for increased usage among present customers or going for a different market, such as senior citizens. A marketer may re-position the product to appeal to new market sections. Another product extension strategy is called product modification. It involves changing product quality, features, or style to attract new users or more usage from present users. American auto manufacturers are using quality improvement as one way to regain world markets.

Question: \\"The people who beat Demetrius were from Epirus and where?\\" Context: \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The people who defeated Demetrius were from Epirus and Thrace. In the given context, it is mentioned that Demetrius, who had taken control of the Macedonian throne and conquered a significant portion of central Greece, was defeated in 288 BC. This defeat occurred when two powerful and strategic rulers invaded Macedon from two different directions. These rulers were Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus. Lysimachus, originally a bodyguard of Alexander the Great, became the ruler of Thrace after the division of Alexander's empire among his generals. Thrace, situated in the southeastern part of the Balkan Peninsula, had a significant strategic position in governing the areas around it. Lysimachus sought to expand his power and territory, eyeing Macedon as an opportunity to do so. On the other hand, Pyrrhus of Epirus, a skilled and ambitious military leader who later became known for his phrase \\"Pyrrhic victory,\\" ruled the region of Epirus in northwestern Greece. Pyrrhus had a claim to the Macedonian throne through his distant relationship with the royal family of Macedon, and he sought to assert his influence over the region. Seeing the weakening state of Demetrius' control over Macedon, both Lysimachus and Pyrrhus seized the opportunity to invade the kingdom from their respective regions – Thrace and Epirus. Their coordinated invasion proved to be successful, as both leaders managed to defeat Demetrius and divide the Macedonian kingdom between them. In summary, the people who ultimately defeated Demetrius and led to his loss of control over the Macedonian kingdom were from two distinct regions – Epirus and Thrace. The invasion from both these fronts was orchestrated by two ambitious rulers, Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus, whose combined efforts destabilized Demetrius' rule and allowed them to carve up the Macedonian kingdom for themselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options: - atlantic ocean - bikini bottom - japanese restaurant - store - pacific ocean A:","completion":"Jellyfish are marine creatures, meaning that they are typically found in the Earth's oceans, including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. To stay warm, these invertebrates generally prefer areas with milder temperatures, which could vary depending on the specific species of jellyfish in question. While both the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean contain regions with warmer waters, such as those in proximity to tropical or subtropical climates, the exact location where the jellyfish stays warm would be determined by its preferred temperature range. The Atlantic Ocean stretches from the Arctic in the north to the Antarctic in the south, making it the second-largest ocean in the world. It encompasses a variety of water temperatures, ranging from bitterly cold waters near the poles to warmer waters along equatorial regions. The Gulf Stream, a powerful wind-driven ocean current, is renowned for bringing warmer waters from the Gulf of Mexico up the east coast of North America and across the Atlantic. As such, certain jellyfish species may gravitate towards the Atlantic's warmer waters to stay warm. Similarly, the Pacific Ocean, the largest and deepest ocean on Earth, contains a wide range of water temperatures due to its vast geographical reach. One can find tropical and subtropical waters in the western Pacific, particularly in the area known as the Coral Triangle, which includes the waters of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and the Solomon Islands. The area's warm temperatures could potentially provide a suitable habitat for jellyfish seeking warmth. Considering the other options presented: - Bikini Bottom is a fictional place in the popular animated television series, SpongeBob SquarePants. While this underwater location may harbor an assortment of sea creatures, including jellyfish, it is not an actual, real-world location where jellyfish would gather to stay warm. - Japanese restaurants may serve dishes containing jellyfish as a culinary ingredient, but these establishments do not offer suitable habitats for living jellyfish to reside and maintain warmth. - A store is an incredibly unlikely location for a jellyfish to stay warm, as it is an indoor, terrestrial environment and generally devoid of the saltwater habitats necessary for jellyfish survival. In conclusion, among the given options, the most reasonable locations for jellyfish to stay warm would be the warmer regions of the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The specific area would depend on the jellyfish species' preferred temperature range, as well as factors involving water quality, food sources, and other environmental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 3: Compare the key components. According to the premise, variance is defined as the amount, rate, extent, or degree of change, or the divergence from a desired characteristic or state. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that variance is never used to measure divergence. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The hypothesis contradicts the definition of variance given in the premise. The premise explicitly states that variance is used to measure the divergence from a desired characteristic or state. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, and the hypothesis is false based on the provided information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Help as much as you can. A scientist is in the lab testing mixing water with different chemicals. While working with chemical A he notes that the water becomes colder after combining them. With chemical B the water becomes much warmer. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Given the changes in temperature, does chemical A cause an exothermic process or an endothermic process? Hint: Some materials have negative heats of solution; the dissolution of one of these solutes in water is an exothermic process. Heat is released, causing a net increase in the temperature of the solution. Conversely, other substances have positive heats of solution. For example, the dissolution of potassium nitrate in water is an endothermic process. The resulting absorption of energy causes the solution to become colder. Calculations involving heats of solutions follow the same basic approach that we have used with other enthalpy problems.

Teacher:In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

(CNN) Paul Stam and Candis Cox are on opposite sides of the debate over a controversial new transgender law that's turning national attention toward North Carolina. To Stam, a Republican state lawmaker who sponsored the measure, it's a necessary step that stops anyone from getting special rights and one city from dictating policies that should be decided by the state. To Cox, a transgender woman and advocate, it's a dangerous and discriminatory measure that puts her and tens of thousands of others at risk. In separate interviews with CNN's Nick Valencia on Sunday, Stam and Cox shared their thoughts on a number of issues raised by the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, which puts in place a statewide policy that bans individuals from using public bathrooms that do not correspond to their biological sex.GOP lawmaker Paul Stam: This law is about protecting privacy, not discriminationTransgender advocate Candis Cox: This is no different than the South's Jim Crow laws Questions:Stam: \\"For 180 years, _ has had the constitutional public policy that issues of labor and trade would be decided on a statewide basis instead of locally.

When there is an emergency, you can count on Maria but not on Monica as Choose your answer from: 1). Maria will cope with intense situation with panic. 2). Monica will cope with intense situation with panic.","completion":"In an emergency, you can rely on Maria but not Monica, as Monica will cope with intense situations with panic. This distinguishes the two individuals in their approach to handling crises, with Maria demonstrating calm and collected behavior, while Monica succumbs to anxiety and worry. Maria's ability to remain level-headed under pressure is critical in emergency situations as it enables her to think clearly, analyze the problem, and make timely, well-informed decisions without becoming overwhelmed or incapacitated by fear. On the other hand, Monica's inclination to panic amplifies the severity of the situation. Her inability to cope effectively with intense situations can lead to detrimental outcomes for her and those around her. Panic can cloud one's judgement, reduce efficiency, and create additional stress for the involved parties, ultimately exacerbating the emergency or heightening the potential risks. Furthermore, when a person panics in an emergency, they can unintentionally undermine the efforts of those who are keeping calm and trying to find a solution. As a result, it is crucial for individuals to manage their emotions and reactions during emergencies, so they can contribute positively to the resolution of the problem. In conclusion, between Maria and Monica, it is preferable to count on Maria during emergencies as she exercises composure and rational thinking, while Monica has a tendency to panic in intense situations, potentially aggravating the crisis at hand. By relying on those who can remain calm during emergencies, we can increase the likelihood of efficiently navigating through challenging circumstances and achieving successful outcomes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The troubled Easy A actress was pulled over in the San Fernando Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles on Sunday at 4 am and taken into custody, the California Highway Patrol confirmed with MailOnline. She was cited for being under the influence of a controlled substance while driving her Mercedes-Benz. The 28-year-old star was released at 12 noon that same day on 15,000 bail. The former child star is set to appear in court on October 23 in Van Nuys. Scroll down for video. Not a good turn of events: Amanda Bynes, pictured in June in LA (the last time she was seen in public), was arrested for a DUI on Sunday. Official: This sheet made available by the LAPD shows Bynes was booked at 7:06 am at the West Valley Station. It's just the beginning: A court date has been set for 8:30 am on October 23 at the Van Nuys Court House. Law enforcement sources told TMZ the She's The Man actress was on drugs, specifically marijuana, but the CHP has yet to confirm this. The former child star was booked at the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys division on a misdemeanor DUI. The brunette movie and TV star had been living with her parents Lynn and Rick in a LA suburb as she has dealt with several legal problems from the past few years. She was last seen in public in June. A concerned father: Rick Bynes appeared distressed on Monday afternoon while talking on his cell phone outside his Los Angeles home. Booked: Her mugshot from April 2012 taken in West Hollywood after getting a DUI for alcohol. In early September Amanda was released from her conservatorship and moved out of her parents' house. She now lives in an apartment in Orange County. Once she started living on her own, that's when things started to go 'haywire,' according to a source. The arrest is causing a legal problem because Bynes is on probation for a reckless conviction from last February. A tough time: The 28-year-old She's The Man actress had a difficult phase in 2012 and 2013; here she was spotted in September 2012. The Sydney White actress was taking fashion design classes at the Fashion Institute Of Design And Merchandising in Irvine, California, earlier this year and seemed to be in good health. Amanda's legal troubles began in March 2012 when she was pulled over and ticketed by police for talking on a cell phone while driving. One month later the Family Guy star was arrested and charged with driving a DUI after side-swiping a police car in West Hollywood. Then in September the Thousand Oaks native was charged for two alleged hit and run incidents, one occurring in April and the other in August. The charges were dismissed three months later, however. A worrying time: At her worst, the Easy A actress shared Twitter photos where she wore wigs and had a cheek piercing, which she did here. Her DUI charged was also dropped in February 2014 but she was placed on probation. When she moved to New York City in 2013 the Hairspray star started displaying some odd behavior. In May she was arrested at her apartment for criminal possession of marijuana, attempted tampering with evidence, and reckless endangerment. She was also accused of throwing a bong out the window of her dwelling which was located on the 36th floor.

The California Highway Patrol confirmed that the 28-year-old star was cited for driving under the influence of a controlled substance while behind the wheel of her Mercedes-Benz. She was later released on a bail of 15,000. Amanda Bynes has struggled with legal issues and erratic behavior in recent years, including multiple DUI charges and a conservatorship arranged by her parents. After being released from conservatorship in early September, Bynes moved out of her parents' house and into an apartment in Orange County. Sources suggest her behavior became more erratic after she started living on her own. Bynes' recent arrest has created a legal problem for her, as she is already on probation for a reckless driving conviction from February. The actress was last seen in public in June. Amanda Bynes' legal troubles began in 2012 when she was ticketed for talking on a cell phone while driving. Her issues escalated with numerous run-ins with the law, including charges for hit-and-runs, DUIs, and various drug-related offenses. Bynes attempted mental health treatment in 2013, and her family worked to support her as she tried to establish a healthier lifestyle. Bynes' recent arrest for DUI on October 23rd has raised concerns about her well-being and the ongoing challenges she faces in maintaining a stable lifestyle. Despite earlier attempts at treatment and her family's efforts to help her, Bynes' latest arrest is a concerning development in her ongoing legal and personal struggles."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: What committees are joint committees I found the following answer on Google: A Joint Committee is a term in politics that is used to refer to a committee made up of members of both chambers of a bicameral legislature. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"Yes, that is a correct answer. Joint committees are indeed formed by members from both chambers of a bicameral legislature, typically including the lower house (like the House of Representatives in the United States) and the upper house (like the Senate). These committees serve various purposes, such as providing oversight, conducting investigations, developing policies, or recommending legislation. They provide a platform for the members of both houses to collaborate and address issues of common interest. In the United States Congress, there are currently four joint committees: 1. Joint Committee on Printing: This committee oversees the functions of the Government Publishing Office and addresses the various printing needs of the federal government. They supervise matters relating to the production, distribution, and management of government documents, including printing, binding, and digitization. 2. Joint Committee on Taxation: This committee is responsible for the analysis and review of the tax-related legislation in Congress. They assist in estimating the revenue impacts, suggesting modifications to the tax code, and offering recommendations on tax policy. The Joint Committee on Taxation consists of members from the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance. 3. Joint Economic Committee: Established in 1946, this committee is tasked with reviewing matters relating to the country's economic performance and offering recommendations to improve the economy. They analyze issues such as employment, income, interest rates, inflation, and economic growth. The Joint Economic Committee is composed of members from both the House and Senate Committees on Finance. 4. Joint Committee on the Library: This committee is responsible for managing and supervising the Library of Congress, a research library serving the needs of the U.S. Congress. They also oversee matters pertaining to Congressional art, monuments, and other similar items. The Library is responsible for preserving national collections and providing access to vast research resources. These joint committees enable members of both chambers to coordinate their efforts and provide a framework for effective policymaking. By fostering cooperation and collaboration, joint committees contribute to a more efficient and comprehensive legislative process."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

With a budget of 329 million, LSC provides civil legal assistance to low-income people in every county in America, Kleiman said. NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said. LSC wants the title to go to the equal justice center in Charleston or \\"we want 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the building to stay in Charleston.

Betty was afraid of the dark, while Sarah was not, so","completion":"Betty was afraid of the dark, while Sarah was not, so when the two friends found themselves confronted with the prospect of navigating through the dimly lit, unfamiliar terrain of the dense woods that lay between them and their destination, it quickly became apparent that they would have to rely on their individual strengths and work together in order to safely traverse the shadowy, ominous landscape. As the sun dipped lower in the sky and twilight began to settle, casting long shadows across the forest floor, Betty felt a creeping sense of unease that she tried to quell, while Sarah exuded an air of confidence and bravado that seemed to combat the encroaching darkness. Sarah, recognizing Betty's apprehension, took it upon herself to be the guiding light both literally and figuratively for her friend as they embarked on their journey. Sarah reached into her backpack and pulled out a high-powered flashlight, which she handed to Betty with an encouraging smile, telling her that together they could face any challenges the night might have in store. The heavyset flashlight was a reassuring weight in Betty's hand, and as she flicked on the powerful beam, she felt a new determination surge within her. Slowly, they ventured onward, with Betty shining the flashlight ahead to illuminate the path before them, while Sarah kept her eyes and ears tuned to the fading light and the whispers of nocturnal creatures stirring in the underbrush. Sarah's experience in navigating through dimly lit spaces and her fearlessness in the face of danger proved invaluable, as she confidently gave directions, warned of impending branches or tree roots, and offered words of encouragement and support to her friend all the while. For her part, despite her fear, Betty remained a steadfast companion, doing her best to project her own courage and force herself to adapt to the darkness that enveloped them. As the two trekked deeper into the woods, their conversation danced between childhood memories and stories of legendary forest creatures that lurked in the night, interwoven with bouts of laughter and shared moments to lighten the potentially eerie mood. As the night wore on, Betty began to feel less frightened of the dark when she realized that together, they had the power to face their fears and make it through adversity, provided they relied on one another. The seemingly daunting and treacherous terrain of the forest took on a less sinister appearance with each passing step, as the bonds of their friendship illuminated the path ahead, much like the glow from the flashlight. Finally, they reached their destination, their faces tinged with a sense of accomplishment and their hearts warmed by the knowledge that they had not only faced their fears but had come out victorious on the other side. And as they sat together under a sky now dotted with stars, they reveled in the journey and the knowledge that they had grown as individuals and friends because of it. The night had taught them a valuable lesson that true strength and resilience lie in facing one's fears and working in unison to overcome whatever darkness may come their way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: a painting of a building is part of series .","completion":"In the given sentence - \\"a painting of a building is part of series\\" - the most important words are \\"painting,\\" \\"building,\\" and \\"series.\\" These words are crucial to understanding the overall meaning of the sentence, as they give us a context to grasp the concepts being conveyed. 1. Painting: This word is essential because it refers to the subject of the sentence. A painting is a visual artwork created on a surface using colors, shapes, and textures to depict a scene, feeling, or idea. Here, it suggests that the particular art form being discussed is specifically a painted piece. 2. Building: The significance of the word \\"building\\" lies in its indication of the subject matter within the painting. A building is a man-made structure designed for various functions, such as residential, commercial, or industrial use. By mentioning that the painting shows a building, the sentence provides context to the scene displayed in the artwork. 3. Series: Lastly, \\"series\\" is an essential word to consider, as it points to a collection of works that are related or share some common elements, like a theme, art style, or creator. Here, it implies that the painting mentioned is not an isolated instance, but rather one of several artworks in a larger body of work. These three main words - \\"painting,\\" \\"building,\\" and \\"series\\" - work together to create a more detailed understanding of the sentence. They provide information on the nature of the artwork (a painting), the subject matter depicted (a building), and its context within multiple, related works (part of a series). The sentence, as a whole, highlights the creation of an artist and positions this specific painting within a more extensive collection, emphasizing the interconnectedness between the artworks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gaius Julius Caesar (; 12 or 13 July 100 BC - 15 March 44 BC), known by his cognomen Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He is also known as a notable author of Latin prose. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. In 60 BC, Caesar sought election as consul for 59 BC, along with two other candidates. The election was sordid - even Cato, with his reputation for incorruptibility, is said to have resorted to bribery in favour of one of Caesar's opponents. Caesar won, along with conservative Marcus Bibulus. Caesar was already in Crassus' political debt, but he also made overtures to Pompey. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds for a decade, so Caesar tried to reconcile them. The three of them had enough money and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the First Triumvirate (\\"rule of three men\\"), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia. Caesar also married again, this time Calpurnia, who was the daughter of another powerful senator. Caesar proposed a law for redistributing public lands to the poor--by force of arms, if need be--a proposal supported by Pompey and by Crassus, making the triumvirate public. Pompey filled the city with soldiers, a move which intimidated the triumvirate's opponents. Bibulus attempted to declare the omens unfavourable and thus void the new law, but he was driven from the forum by Caesar's armed supporters. His bodyguards had their ceremonial axes broken, two high magistrates accompanying him were wounded, and he had a bucket of excrement thrown over him. In fear of his life, he retired to his house for the rest of the year, issuing occasional proclamations of bad omens. These attempts proved ineffective in obstructing Caesar's legislation. Roman satirists ever after referred to the year as \\"the consulship of Julius and Caesar.\\" When Caesar was first elected, the aristocracy tried to limit his future power by allotting the woods and pastures of Italy, rather than the governorship of a province, as his military command duty after his year in office was over. With the help of political allies, Caesar later overturned this, and was instead appointed to govern Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) and Illyricum (southeastern Europe), with Transalpine Gaul (southern France) later added, giving him command of four legions. The term of his governorship, and thus his immunity from prosecution, was set at five years, rather than the usual one. When his consulship ended, Caesar narrowly avoided prosecution for the irregularities of his year in office, and quickly left for his province. Caesar was still deeply in debt, but there was money to be made as a governor, whether by extortion or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces bordered on unconquered territory, and parts of Gaul were known to be unstable. Some of Rome's Gallic allies had been defeated by their rivals at the Battle of Magetobriga, with the help of a contingent of Germanic tribes. The Romans feared these tribes were preparing to migrate south, closer to Italy, and that they had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated these tribes. In response to Caesar's earlier activities, the tribes in the north-east began to arm themselves. Caesar treated this as an aggressive move and, after an inconclusive engagement against the united tribes, he conquered the tribes piecemeal. Meanwhile, one of his legions began the conquest of the tribes in the far north, directly opposite Britain. During the spring of 56 BC, the Triumvirs held a conference, as Rome was in turmoil and Caesar's political alliance was coming undone. The Lucca Conference renewed the First Triumvirate and extended Caesar's governorship for another five years. The conquest of the north was soon completed, while a few pockets of resistance remained. Caesar now had a secure base from which to launch an invasion of Britain. In 55 BC, Caesar repelled an incursion into Gaul by two Germanic tribes, and followed it up by building a bridge across the Rhine and making a show of force in Germanic territory, before returning and dismantling the bridge. Late that summer, having subdued two other tribes, he crossed into Britain, claiming that the Britons had aided one of his enemies the previous year, possibly the Veneti of Brittany. His intelligence information was poor, and although he gained a beachhead on the coast, he could not advance further, and returned to Gaul for the winter. He returned the following year, better prepared and with a larger force, and achieved more. He advanced inland, and established a few alliances. However, poor harvests led to widespread revolt in Gaul, which forced Caesar to leave Britain for the last time. While Caesar was in Britain his daughter Julia, Pompey's wife, had died in childbirth. Caesar tried to re-secure Pompey's support by offering him his great-niece in marriage, but Pompey declined. In 53 BC Crassus was killed leading a failed invasion of the east. Rome was on the brink of civil war. Pompey was appointed sole consul as an emergency measure, and married the daughter of a political opponent of Caesar. The Triumvirate was dead. Though the Gallic tribes were just as strong as the Romans militarily, the internal division among the Gauls guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar. Vercingetorix's attempt in 52 BC to unite them against Roman invasion came too late. He proved an astute commander, defeating Caesar in several engagements, but Caesar's elaborate siege-works at the Battle of Alesia finally forced his surrender. Despite scattered outbreaks of warfare the following year, Gaul was effectively conquered. Plutarch claimed that during the Gallic Wars the army had fought against three million men (of whom one million died, and another million were enslaved), subjugated 300 tribes, and destroyed 800 cities. While he was still campaigning in Spain, the Senate began bestowing honours on Caesar. Caesar had not proscribed his enemies, instead pardoning almost all, and there was no serious public opposition to him. Great games and celebrations were held in April to honour Caesar's victory at Munda. Plutarch writes that many Romans found the triumph held following Caesar's victory to be in poor taste, as those defeated in the civil war had not been foreigners, but instead fellow Romans. On Caesar's return to Italy in September 45 BC, he filed his will, naming his grandnephew Gaius Octavius (Octavian, later known as Augustus Caesar) as his principal heir, leaving his vast estate and property including his name. Caesar also wrote that if Octavian died before Caesar did, Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus would be the next heir in succession. In his will, he also left a substantial gift to the citizens of Rome. During his early career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and dysfunctional the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery had broken down under the weight of imperialism, the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. With a weak central government, political corruption had spiralled out of control, and the status quo had been maintained by a corrupt aristocracy, which saw no need to change a system that had made its members rich. Between his crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the Republic. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. Finally, he wanted to knit together all of the provinces into a single cohesive unit. The first goal was accomplished when Caesar defeated Pompey and his supporters. To accomplish the other two goals, he needed to ensure that his control over the government was undisputed, so he assumed these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing the authority of Rome's other political institutions. Finally, he enacted a series of reforms that were meant to address several long-neglected issues, the most important of which was his reform of the calendar.","completion":"This text is about Gaius Julius Caesar, a Roman politician, military general, and author of Latin prose who played a crucial role in the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.

No, it caught him by surprise, because they had paid him first. The text doesn't present any indication that Noel Johnson, the taxi driver, had any notion or suspicion towards his impending assault. The two young men, appearing well-dressed, approached him at the West Bus Station and requested his services to Cedar Grove. They even made an upfront payment to him, which, according to Johnson's account, demonstrated no hesitation on their part. This act of paying without any reluctance likely fostered an atmosphere of normalcy and trust, further reducing any potential suspicion Johnson might have had towards them. All these events point towards scenario D, where Johnson was totally taken aback by the sudden robbery. Options B and C posit that the driver anticipated the assault and had some underlying strategy in place, either to provoke them or bait them for information. The narrative doesn't provide any evidence to support these suppositions. Similarly, option A - 'None of the above choices.' is not applicable here since option D accurately fits the scenario described in the narrative. So, based on the details mentioned in the passage, the driver was unsuspecting of the robbery due to the robbers' seemingly innocuous behavior and their payment in advance, making option D the most suitable response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Giants snapped their two-game losing streak and clinched home field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs by defeating the Panthers. With the loss Carolina failed to clinch the NFC South. The Giants had already clinched a first round bye by virtue of Minnesota's loss to Atlanta earlier in the day. New York won the toss and scored on their opening drive on a 32-yard John Carney field goal. Carolina responded by scoring a touchdown on their first drive, a thirteen-yard run by DeAngelo Williams. The Giants scored on their second drive as well, going 74 yards in 13 plays and ending with a Brandon Jacobs touchdown from the Carolina 2. The Panthers responded with another Williams touchdown run, this time five yards, and a 14-10 lead. After forcing the Giants to punt Carolina scored again, as Williams scored his third touchdown of the game on a one-yard run. The drive went four plays for 65 yards, 60 of which came on a deep pass from Jake Delhomme to Muhsin Muhammad. Williams' touchdown came two plays after Steve Smith appeared to have scored on a short pass, but a replay challenge was upheld. After the teams traded punts the Giants scored with 0:55 remaining in the half as Carney added his second field goal of the game. Then on their second drive of the second half, Eli Manning threw a short touchdown to Kevin Boss to cut the deficit to 21-20 with 1:07 remaining in the third quarter. Carolina scored on their very next drive, with Williams scoring for the fourth time on a thirty-yard run. New York tied the game with 3:24 remaining as Jacobs scored on a one-yard touchdown run, after starting the drive in Panther territory. The Giants converted the two-point conversion on a pass from Manning to Domenik Hixon. Carolina then drove down the field and faced fourth and five from the Giants 32-yard line, but John Kasay missed the potential game-winning field goal from 50 yards out. On their second possession of the overtime period the Giants started at their own 13-yard line. On the first play of the drive Derrick Ward ran for 51 yards and pushed the ball into Carolina territory. Ward added a fourteen-yard run two plays later and a seventeen-yard run the play following that, pushing his rushing total to 215 yards (a career-high) and leaving the Giants two yards from the endzone. On the next play Jacobs scored on a run, his third score of the game, and New York won the game. The Giants rushed for 301 yards in the game compared to 158 for the Panthers. Jacobs added 87 yards to Ward's 215. Williams rushed for 108 yards on 24 carries, including his four touchdowns. Delhomme finished 11-19 for 185 yards and Manning 17-27 for 181 and a touchdown. Ward's 14.3-yard rushing average was a single game Giants record. Manning became the first Giants quarterback to throw at least 3,000 passing yards in a season for four consecutive seasons.

Which language is this?","completion":"The phrase \\"Už se to stalo\\" is in Czech, a West Slavic language, mainly spoken in the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to Slovak and has similarities with other Slavic languages such as Polish, Russian, and Serbo-Croatian. Czech has a rich history, as it developed from the West Slavic dialect spoken in the region of Bohemia and Moravia during the 9th and 10th centuries. The area now known as the Czech Republic was part of the Holy Roman Empire, and the influence of Latin and later German on the Czech language and culture is noticeable. In the 14th century, Czech enjoyed a golden age under the rule of Charles IV, a member of the Luxembourg dynasty. During this time, the capital city, Prague, became a hub of cultural and intellectual development. The Czech language was elevated to a written and literary language, and the first Czech translation of the Bible was produced. However, the spread of Protestantism, the Thirty Years' War, and subsequent Habsburg rule put pressure on the Czech language, leading it to become marginalized, as Latin and German occupied a more significant position. It would not be until the 18th and 19th-century Czech National Revival that the language regained its cultural and political importance, as the movement sought to revive and promote Czech language, literature, and history. Modern Czech is a member of the Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family and uses the Latin alphabet with several additional characters, such as ě, š, č, ř, ž, and ý. The Czech language is characterized by a complex system of inflections (morphological changes to words to indicate grammatical relationships) and has a rich vocabulary, which may include multiple synonyms with subtle differences in meaning. The phrase \\"Už se to stalo\\" can be translated into English as \\"It has already happened\\" or \\"It has happened already.\\" Czech, like other Slavic languages, is known for its flexible word order, which can sometimes lead to confusion for non-native speakers. However, this flexibility can also be used for emphasis or to create nuances in meaning. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Už se to stalo\\" is in Czech. The Czech language has a rich history, and it has undergone periods of struggle and revival throughout the years. As a Slavic language, it shares many similarities with other Slavic languages, and its complex grammar and nuanced vocabulary make it a fascinating language to study."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The maternal grandfather of Prince Carl Bernadotte was King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden. Here's a detailed context about the relationship between Prince Carl Bernadotte and King Gustaf VI Adolf. Prince Carl Bernadotte, originally Prince Carl Jr. Gustaf Oscar of Sweden, was born on January 10, 1911, in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the youngest son of Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of Västergötland, and his wife Princess Ingeborg of Denmark. His parents, Duke Carl and Duchess Ingeborg, had four children together – Princess Margaretha, Princess Märtha, Princess Astrid, and Prince Carl Jr. As the youngest child of the family, he held the title of \\"Prince of Sweden\\" and \\"Duke of Östergötland\\" until 1937. King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, the maternal grandfather of Prince Carl Bernadotte, was born on November 11, 1882, in Stockholm, and ascended to the throne on October 29, 1950. He was the oldest son of King Gustaf V of Sweden and his wife, Queen Victoria of Baden. King Gustaf VI Adolf's daughter Princess Ingeborg, who was Prince Carl Bernadotte's mother, married Duke Carl of Västergötland, making King Gustaf VI Adolf the maternal grandfather of Prince Carl Bernadotte. In 1937, Prince Carl Bernadotte married the wealthy heiress, Countess Elsa von Rosen, which was considered unequal due to her not being of royal blood. As a result, King Gustaf V of Sweden deprived Prince Carl Jr. of his Swedish titles and his rights to succession to the Swedish throne. He then adopted the surname Bernadotte, which was the family name of the House of Bernadotte, to which the Swedish royal family belongs. After losing his titles, Prince Carl Jr. maintained a warm relationship with his relatives in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Belgium and engaged in various business ventures throughout his life. In conclusion, Prince Carl Bernadotte's maternal grandfather was King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, who was the king of Sweden from 1950 until his death in 1973. Prince Carl himself had a fascinating life that was marked by multiple marriages, the loss of his royal titles, and a number of entrepreneurial pursuits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the wake of this event, Japanese Government adjusted the price of Japanese Currency Yen in accordance with the going market price. On the other hand, at he same time, UK was having economic downturn. There was a likelihood that the UK Currency Pound Sterling would go down. Fearing public backlash, UK Government kept the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level. Which currency would most likely be exchanged in the black market, Pound Sterling or Yen? Answer:","completion":"In this scenario, the currency most likely to be exchanged in the black market would be the Pound Sterling. To understand this, let's first analyze the reasons behind these economic developments in both Japan and the United Kingdom and then look into the factors that contribute to the demand for currencies in the black market. In March 2015, Japan's economy experienced a surge, raising the likelihood that the Japanese yen would appreciate in value. This could be attributed to a variety of factors, such as increased economic growth, higher exports, or the implementation of effective monetary and fiscal policies by the Japanese government. As a result, the Japanese government adjusted the price of the yen in accordance with the going market price, allowing the currency's value to increase as a reflection of the strong economic performance. On the contrary, the United Kingdom was facing an economic downturn during the same period, which could have resulted from political uncertainties, financial market instabilities, or unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, among others. This situation led to a higher likelihood of the Pound Sterling depreciating in value. However, fearing public backlash, the UK government decided to keep the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level, possibly through interventions in the foreign exchange markets. In doing so, they artificially maintained the Pound's value, despite its weakened economic fundamentals. The black market for currency exchange typically emerges when there are strict capital controls, high inflation rates, or artificial manipulation of official exchange rates. In this case, the artificial maintenance of the Pound Sterling's value by the UK government creates an opportunity for black market transactions to take place. People who possess Pounds Sterling may view the suppressed value of their currency as unfavorable, especially if they believe that the currency is overvalued or at risk of future depreciation, and they may resort to the black market to exchange it for other currencies. The Japanese yen, on the other hand, has been allowed to appreciate to reflect the current market dynamics and strong economic performance. This situation is likely to deter users from resorting to the black market for the exchange of yen, as the official market price accurately reflects the underlying economic reality. In summary, given that the UK government was keeping the price of the Pound Sterling artificially constant despite its deteriorating economic performance, it is more likely for the Pound Sterling to be exchanged in the black market compared to the Japanese yen—which had its value adjusted in accordance with its positive economic outlook. In such situations, the artificially maintained currency value encourages people to look for alternative markets for exchanging their currency to get a more favorable exchange rate, resulting in higher demand for the Pound Sterling in the black market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: He lied about being an outdoor enthusiast to impress her. Sentence 3: He failed to look at the instructions for assembling the tent. Sentence 4: Jacob didn't know what to do with the ground pegs, so he hid them. 2. From these sentences, we can infer that the story is about Jacob, who pretended to be experienced in camping but didn't know how to set up the tent properly. 3. Read the two options for the fifth sentence: a. It was simply too difficult. b. When the wind picked up at night, the tent practically blew away. 4. Analyze which of the two options is less connected to the story. Option 'b' is a direct consequence of not grounding the tent, whereas option 'a' is less connected because it's not tied to specific actions or consequences. 5. Choose the sentence that makes less sense in context: Output: a"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these mean the same?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: At 32 years old, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is already the most dominant Arab leader in a generation. This week, he embarks on a cross-country American tour, where he'll pitch his kingdom to a skeptical U.S. public. He was named heir to the throne nine months ago by his 82-year-old father, King Salman, who granted his son vast new powers. Known by his initials -- \\"M-B-S\\" -- his reforms inside Saudi Arabia have been revolutionary. He is emancipating women, introducing music and cinema and cracking down on corruption, in a land with 15,000 princes. But selling Saudi Arabia won't be easy. In his first interview with an American television network, he was eager to discuss his country's promise and its troubled reputation head-on. Norah O'Donnell: When many Americans think about Saudi Arabia, they think about Osama bin Laden and 9/11. They think about the terrorism that he brought to American soil. Mohammed bin Salman: Right. Osama bin Laden recruited 15 Saudis in the 9/11 attacks with a clear objective. According to the CIA documents and Congressional investigations, Osama bin Laden wanted to create a schism between the Middle East and the West, between Saudi Arabia and the United States of America. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman CBS News Norah O'Donnell: Why did Osama bin Laden wanna create that hatred between the West and Saudi Arabia? Mohammed bin Salman: In order to create an environment conducive to recruitment and spreading his radical message that the west is plotting to destroy you. Indeed he succeeded in creating this schism in the west. Norah O'Donnell: And how do you change that? Because it looks like what you're trying to do is change things here at home. Mohammed bin Salman: Indeed. I believe that we have succeeded in many respects in the last three years. We first met Prince Mohammed at the Royal Court in Riyadh. He arrived in a driving rain, a sign of good fortune in the desert kingdom. He's been called bold and visionary for his reforms at home, as well as reckless and impulsive in his rise to power. He has kicked a hornet's nest in the Middle East and earned a host of new enemies, partly why he's one of the most heavily-guarded men in the world. This is the office where he starts his days. Norah O'Donnell: Working hard? Mohammed bin Salman in English: Always. He learned English from watching movies as a kid. And he's acutely aware that 70 percent of the population is like him, under the age of 35 – and getting restless. Norah O'Donnell: What's been the biggest challenge? Mohammed bin Salman in English: There's a lot of challenge. I think the first big challenge that we have is do the people believe in what we are doing. Norah O'Donnell: There is a widespread perception that the kind of Islam practiced inside Arabia is harsh, it's strict, it's intolerant. Is there any truth to that? Mohammed bin Salman: After 1979, that's true. We were victims, especially my generation that suffered from this a great deal. The crown prince traces most of Saudi Arabia's problems to the year 1979, when the Ayatollah Khomeini established an Islamic theocracy next door in Iran. The same year, religious extremists in Saudi Arabia took over Islam's holiest site, the Grand Mosque in Mecca. In order to appease their own religious radicals, the Saudis began clamping down and segregating women from everyday life. Norah O'Donnell: What has been this Saudi Arabia for the past 40 years? Is that the real Saudi Arabia? Mohammed bin Salman: Absolutely not. This is not the real Saudi Arabia. I would ask your viewers to use their smartphones to find out. And they can google Saudi Arabia in the 70s and 60s, and they will see the real Saudi Arabia easily in the pictures. Norah O'Donnell: What was Saudi Arabia like before 1979? Mohammed bin Salman: We were living a very normal life like the rest of the Gulf countries. Women were driving cars. There were movie theaters in Saudi Arabia. Women worked everywhere. We were just normal people developing like any other country in the world until the events of 1979. Saudi women -- who've been virtually invisible in public -- have been given new rights, making it easier for them to start a business, join the military, and attend concerts and sporting events. In June, they will be able to get behind the wheel and drive. Norah O'Donnell: Are women equal to men? Mohammed bin Salman: Absolutely. We are all human beings and there is no difference. Norah O'Donnell: You have said you are, \\"Taking Saudi Arabia back to what we were, a moderate Islam.\\" What does that mean? Mohammed bin Salman: We have extremists who forbid mixing between the two sexes and are unable to differentiate between a man and a woman alone together and their being together in a workplace. Many of those ideas contradict the way of life during the time of the prophet and the Caliphs. This is the real example and the true model. He has curbed the powers of the country's so-called \\"religious police,\\" who until recently were able to arrest women for not covering up. And listen carefully to what he says is not part of Islamic Law. Mohammed bin Salman: The laws are very clear and stipulated in the laws of Sharia: that women wear decent, respectful clothing, like men. This, however, does not particularly specify a black abaya or a black head cover. The decision is entirely left for women to decide what type of decent and respectful attire she chooses to wear. His words are significant, and so far, the kingdom's religious leaders are holding their tongues, and have sworn allegiance to the young prince. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman CBS News Of all of the meetings he presides over every week, this is the most important: his economic council. These are the men, and a few women, trusted with re-making Saudi Arabia's \\"social pact\\" with its people. One of the crown prince's closest advisers is Mohammed al-Sheikh, a Saudi-born, Harvard-trained lawyer. Mohammed al-Sheikh: We had a young population. And we were providing for the population, you know subsidized energy, subsidized water, subsidized medicine, subsidized education, we subsidized everybody's life. Norah O'Donnell: And no taxes. Mohammed al-Sheikh: And no taxes. Norah O'Donnell: How close was Saudi Arabia to a financial crisis? Mohammed al-Sheikh: I don't think it was extremely close, but it was heading in that direction. Reforming the welfare state is one challenge. Another is what the crown prince calls Saudi Arabia's \\"addiction\\" to oil. The state oil company, Aramco, is valued at 2 trillion. Under the crown prince's plan, some of it will be sold off to invest in new ventures. There are concerns that the kingdom's secretive finances and dismal record on human rights may spook investors. Norah O'Donnell: You have promised transparency and openness. But there are reports that dozens of people who have criticized your government have been arrested in the last year. They include economists, clerics, intellectuals. Is this really an open and free society? Mohammed bin Salman: We will try to publicize as much as we can and as fast as we can, information about these individuals in order to make the world aware of what the government of Saudi Arabia is doing to combat radicalism. Norah O'Donnell: But to answer the question about human rights abuses in this country. Mohammed bin Salman: Saudi Arabia believes in many of the principles of human rights. In fact, we believe in the notion of human rights, but ultimately Saudi standards are not the same as American standards. I don't want to say that we don't have shortcomings. We certainly do. But naturally, we are working to mend these shortcomings. But the crown prince has been accused of heavy-handed tactics. The most extraordinary example happened last November, at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh. He invited hundreds of current and former government ministers, media moguls, prominent businessmen, and at least 11 princes to a meeting here, where they were accused of stealing from the state and were held until they either paid it back or proved their innocence. Norah O'Donnell: I mean, what happened at the Ritz-Carlton? How did that work? You were, essentially, the Ritz-Carlton became a jail. Mohammed bin Salman: What we did in Saudi Arabia was extremely necessary. All actions taken were in accordance with existing and published laws. Among the detained was Prince Alwaleed bin Talal -- one of the richest men in the world. After Prince Alwaleed was detained for more than two months, the Saudis allowed a camera crew inside his room at the Ritz for a brief interview. Prince Alwaleed: And I'd like to stay here until this thing's over completely and get out and life goes on. Mohammed al-Sheikh said the crackdown was necessary. Mohammed al-Sheikh: It wasn't easy. Just given the names and given the people who were involved, it really wasn't easy. But we-- we just felt that we had to do this. And and we had to do it that way. Norah O'Donnell: What kinda corruption are we talking about? I mean, how much money was disappearing? Mohammed al-Sheikh: Probably 5 to 10 percent of the annual spend by the government, which was roughly, I would say anywhere between 10-20 billion, maybe even more, on an annual basis. Norah O'Donnell: So 20 billion a year is just disappearing? Mohammed al-Sheikh: Disappearing. There have been reports that some detainees were physically abused, and one died in custody. The Saudis told us the choice of the hotel, \\"was to maintain the respect, dignity and… comfort for those being investigated.\\" Norah O'Donnell: Was it a power grab? Mohammed bin Salman: If I have the power and the king has the power to take action against influential people, then you are already fundamentally strong. These are naïve accusations. Norah O'Donnell: How much money did you get back? Mohammed bin Salman: The amount exceeds 100 billion, but the real objective was not this amount or any other amount. The idea is not to get money, but to punish the corrupt and send a clear signal that whoever engages in corrupt deals will face the law. Norah O'Donnell: Is this also about sending a message that, as we say in America, there's a new sheriff in town? Mohammed bin Salman: Absolutely. Absolutely. \\"Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.\\" But while the \\"new sheriff\\" is cracking down on corruption, there are questions about his own fortune. The New York Times reports he recently purchased a yacht for a half-billion dollars, along with a French chateau. Mohammed bin Salman: My personal life is something I'd like to keep to myself and I don't try to draw attention to it. If some newspapers want to point something out about it, that's up to them. As far as my private expenses, I'm a rich person and not a poor person. I'm not Gandhi or Mandela. I'm a member of the ruling family that existed for hundreds of years before the founding of Saudi Arabia. We own very large lots of land, and my personal life is the same as it was 10 or 20 years ago. But what I do as a person is to spend part of my personal income on charity. I spend at least 51% on people and 49 on myself. Among the prince's official titles is \\"minister of defense.\\" And this is where his apparent fixation on Iran has led him into a quagmire in neighboring Yemen. Mohammed bin Salman: The Iranian ideology penetrated some parts of Yemen. During that time, this militia was conducting military maneuvers right next to our borders and positioning missiles at our borders. His response was to launch a bombing campaign that's led to a humanitarian disaster, as we reported on 60 Minutes last fall. He says Iranian-backed rebels have used the country to fire missiles at Riyadh. Mohammed bin Salman: I can't imagine that the United States will accept one day to have a militia in Mexico launching missiles on Washington D.C., New York and LA while Americans are watching these missiles and doing nothing. The United Nations says thousands of civilian deaths in Yemen are the direct result of Saudi airstrikes and a blockade, since lifted, of Yemen's port that temporarily stopped food and medicine from getting to hundreds of thousands of people. Norah O'Donnell: Do you acknowledge that it has been a humanitarian catastrophe, 5,000 civilians killed and children starving there? Mohammed bin Salman: It is truly very painful, and I hope that this militia ceases using the humanitarian situation to their advantage in order to draw sympathy from the international community. They block humanitarian aid in order to create famine and a humanitarian crisis. Norah O'Donnell: Is what's happening in Yemen, essentially, a proxy war with Iran? Mohammed bin Salman: Unfortunately, Iran is playing a harmful role. The Iranian regime is based on pure ideology. Many of the Al-Qaeda operatives are protected in Iran and it refuses to surrender them to justice, and continues to refuse to extradite them to the United States. This includes the son of Osama bin Laden, the new leader of Al-Qaeda. He lives in Iran and works out of Iran. He is supported by Iran. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with contributor Norah O'Donnell CBS News It's worth noting that Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shia Iran both claim to represent the one true branch of Islam. Norah O'Donnell: At its heart, what is this rift about? Is it a battle for Islam? Mohammed bin Salman: Iran is not a rival to Saudi Arabia. Its army is not among the top five armies in the Muslim world. The Saudi economy is larger than the Iranian economy. Iran is far from being equal to Saudi Arabia. Norah O'Donnell: But I've seen that you called the Ayatollah, Khamenei, \\"the new Hitler\\" of the Middle East. Mohammed bin Salman: Absolutely. Norah O'Donnell: Why? Mohammed bin Salman: Because he wants to expand. He wants to create his own project in the Middle East very much like Hitler who wanted to expand at the time. Many countries around the world and in Europe did not realize how dangerous Hitler was until what happened, happened. I don't want to see the same events happening in the Middle East. Norah O'Donnell: Does Saudi Arabia need nuclear weapons to counter Iran? Mohammed bin Salman: Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible. 60 Minutes producer Harry Radliffe II CBS News A note from 60 Minutes: Our story \\"Heir to the Throne\\" has many authors. The ten-person team that traveled to Saudi Arabia for approximately a week included correspondent Norah O'Donnell, who carried with her a long-held fascination for the region. Also on our team: producers Graham Messick and Vanessa Fica, who began working on the assignment more than two years ago at the request of the story's original producer, Harry A. Radliffe II, before he passed away of cancer at age 66. Radliffe was 60 Minutes' resident expert on politics, religion, and history in the Middle East. Well-traveled and passionately curious, Harry would say about a 60 Minutes segment on Saudi Arabia: \\"If that ain't a story, I don't know what is.\\" Radliffe was known for taking his time with stories like this; he knew that some day, the Saudi royal family would – at long last -- give its go-ahead. Sadly, that day came after Harry's passing, but we are so glad to have carried on his vision. Also on the team that made this story possible: associate producer Jack Weingart, Middle East producer Amjad Tadros, photographers Jonathan Partridge and Mark La Ganga, audio engineers Anton Van der Merwe and Matt Magratten, and editors Dan Glucksman and Craig Crawford. Jeff Fager, Radliffe's close friend and the executive producer of 60 Minutes, had final say over the story and personally assured two Saudi princes that we would be fair and accurate and allow the crown prince to tell his story if he let us. We are glad he did. Saudi Arabia's 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman outmaneuvered uncles, cousins and half-brothers to become the power behind the throne of his aging father, King Salman. Since then, this royal upstart has been remaking Saudi society— out of both social and economic necessity. The vast majority of the kingdom's citizens are under 30 — connected to the world at large through their cell phones. Just as important, oil is no longer a predictable source of revenue, meaning the cradle-to-grave healthcare, education and other services that have been the birthright of every Saudi citizen, are imperiled. It's a combustible mix for a brash leader in a dangerous part of the world. But, the heir to the throne seems eager for the challenge. Norah O'Donnell: Oh, this is where you spend all night? Mohammed bin Salman in English: Mostly. So all of the workaholic ministers used to spend most of their nights in this, in these offices. So, I'm sorry if it's a little bit lousy. Norah O'Donnell: This is not a lousy office. He spends most evenings in Riyadh's Irgah Palace, where he dispenses with the traditional Saudi headscarf. Norah O'Donnell: And so what time in the morning are you here till working? Mohammed bin Salman in English: Oh, I come here, at, like afternoon till late night. We're told his 82-year-old father, King Salman, is somewhere upstairs, leaving most of the day-to-day work to his son. He escorted us at 9 p.m. into a meeting about the public investment fund. Under Prince Mohammed's detailed plan to remake Saudi Arabia – called \\"Vision 2030\\" – the public investment fund will eventually grow to 2 trillion. The men in this room are talking about how to invest it. They recently sank three and a half billion dollars into Uber. If bets like that pay off, it will be dividends, not oil revenues, pouring into the Saudi treasury. Princess Reema: This man spend 24 hours a day working towards this vision. Princess Reema bint Bandar is the crown prince's cousin and he chose her to lead one of the government sports authorities. Norah O'Donnell: You were surprised by the pace with which he's doing stuff. Princess Reema: I'm not surprised by the pace. I'm surprised by how detailed the pace is. We are not a community that's used to somebody saying, \\"Tuesday, the 5th of November, I want to see X.\\" That kind of means yes, maybe, inshallah. Norah O'Donnell: God willing. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman leads a meeting CBS News Princess Reema: There is actually a tracking system that we all monthly update. What's our progress? How have we hit our numbers? We are working and operating like a private sector. And that's new. To a visitor, it doesn't look like that much has changed. Single men in crisp white robes and women dressed entirely in black, keep their distance from one another. Female visitors still feel obligated to wear the traditional Abaya in public… but no longer the headscarf. At this Starbucks, men sit in one section – women and families just beyond the wooden partition. It was difficult to get people – especially women – to talk on camera about the crown prince's reforms. This man urged caution. Abdul Rahman: I like the change that is gradual. We don't wanna move too fast and pay a heavy price. Norah O'Donnell: In other words, you think that the crown prince has to be very careful about the pace? Abdul Rahman: Exactly. Saudi Arabia still adheres to an ancient power-sharing arrangement between the House of Saud and Wahhabi Islam, the strict, predominant faith in Saudi Arabia. But the crown prince told us it is not his religion, but extremists within Islamic groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, that have infiltrated Saudi society, including its schools. Norah O'Donnell: Are you looking at the schooling and the education in Saudi Arabia? Mohammed bin Salman: Saudi schools have been invaded by many elements from the Muslim Brotherhood organization, surely to a great extent. Even now, there are some elements left. It will be a short while until they are all eradicated completely. Norah O'Donnell: You say you're going to eradicate this extremism in the education system here? Mohammed bin Salman: Of course, no country in the world would accept that its educational system be invaded by any radical group. The crown prince represents the vast majority of the Saudi people – who are overwhelmingly young, restless, and connected to just about everything through their cell phones. They see a kindred spirit in their new iPad-addicted leader. Norah O'Donnell: Most of the young women that I met are all on Snapchat. They were asking me to join them on Snapchat. This is this is changing this entire culture. Mohammed bin Salman: I can't claim that I played a role in this. Saudi citizens have always been open to social media and technology. Young Saudis we talked to at this trendy pop-up burger joint say they are still careful about what they post on Twitter and Instagram, which is why members of the opposite sex connect via private messaging apps like Snapchat and Whatsapp. Norah O'Donnell: Social media. MALE #1: It's huge in Saudi Arabia. MALE #2: This is our escape, yes. Norah O'Donnell: The phone is your escape? MALE VOICE: Yes. Social media is. The crown prince has more pressing concerns, only 22 percent of Saudi women work, and he wants to encourage more to join the workforce. Mohammed bin Salman: We are working on an initiative, which we will launch in the near future, to introduce regulations ensuring equal pay for men and women. Norah O'Donnell: But you're talking about equal pay. Women can't even drive in this country. This is the last, last place in the world that women don't have the rights to drive. Mohammed bin Salman: This is no longer an issue. Today, driving schools have been established and will open soon. In a few months, women will drive in Saudi Arabia. We are finally over that painful period that we cannot justify. Norah O'Donnell: Certainly, most people hear about the rule that will allow women to drive in June. But there have also existed these guardianship laws that, in order to travel, a woman has to get the permission of a male in her household. It seems so throwback. Mohammed bin Salman: Today, Saudi women still have not received their full rights. There are rights stipulated in Islam that they still don't have. We have come a very long way and have a short way to go. He wanted us to see this driving school, at Princess Nourah University, the largest all women's university in the world. The school is preparing to teach 70,000 women how to drive. These trainers will put women through classes and simulators before having them hit the road. Norah O'Donnell: How do you get to work or school now? WOMAN #1: For me, I have a driver. Or, like, my dad or my brother. WOMAN #2: Driving is just a quick win. It's not everything. It's just representative that we're going in the right direction. It's progress. The trajectory now is just going forward and not backwards. Norah O'Donnell: You are witnessing history? WOMEN: (OVERTALK) Yes. Exactly. We are glad to be part of this history. Princess Reema is also helping make history – she recently opened the gates for Saudi women to attend soccer matches. Norah O'Donnell: I mean, it was just in 2015 that a Saudi woman was arrested trying to go to a game. Princess Reema: Yes. Yes. And you know what? I'm proud to say that I was at the first game where that's no longer a reality. How sensational is that to say in two years? In two years the arc has changed. Norah O'Donnell: People have asked me for my impressions and there's so much that's modern, in terms of infrastructure and American restaurants. But it is still interesting to see that single men eat in one part of the restaurant. And families and women in another. Princess Reema: Correct. Norah O'Donnell: It's segregated. Princess Reema: It is viewed here as the preservation of the privacy of the personal space of the woman. If it comes out to being viewed internationally as disrespectful, that's not the intention. Does it end up sometimes causing obstacles? Yes. But the intent is not disrespect. Norah O'Donnell: Do you think Mohammed bin Salman is prepared to take the throne? Princess Reema: I don't think anyone is ever prepared. I think since he was 18 years old he has been groomed for leadership. His ascension would mark a generational power shift. It was his grandfather, King Abdulaziz, who founded modern Saudi Arabia, and was succeeded by six sons, including the current king, King Salman. The crown prince grew up by his father's side, learning and biding his time. Norah O'Donnell: What did you learn from your father? Mohammed bin Salman: Many, many things. He loves history very much. He is an avid reader of history. Each week, he would assign each one of us a book. And at the end of the week, he would ask us about the content of that book. The king always says, \\"If you read the history of a thousand years, you have the experience of a thousand years.\\" Mohammed bin Salman is trying to keep pace with a population that's become as familiar with American celebrity culture as they are with the tales of the Prophet Muhammad in the birthplace of Islam. Just as American society transformed during the 1960's, the Saudis are in the midst of their own cultural revolution. The kingdom, the Middle East, and the Islamic world may never be the same. Norah O'Donnell: You're 32 years old. You could rule this country for the next 50 years. Mohammed bin Salman: Only God knows how long one will live, if one would live 50 years or not, but if things go their normal ways, then that's to be expected. Norah O'Donnell: Can anything stop you? Mohammed bin Salman: Only death. Produced by Graham Messick and Vanessa Fica.

His ongoing PR campaign seeks to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy and reset its image abroad, but some of his actions have undermined that goal. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Now it's time for our regular segment Words You'll Hear. That's where we take a look at a word or phrase that will be in the news and tell you why it's important. Today's words are actually a name - Mohammed bin Salman. He's Saudi Arabia's 32-year-old crown prince. He's heading to the U.S. this week. The controversial young prince is next in line for the throne, and now he's set for a cross-country U.S. tour. NPR's Deborah Amos is with us now to talk about the crown prince's visit, where he's going and what he's going to be doing while he's there. Deb, thanks so much for joining us. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: Thank you. MARTIN: So why is he here? AMOS: Well, this is a cross-country PR tour. You know, he wants to reset Saudi Arabia's image. And it's also an investment tour. So that's why he's meeting with Apple, Microsoft, Uber, Google, Facebook, movie moguls in Los Angeles. He needs Western investment to diversify the Saudi economy. Now, this country - and the whole region - has historically relied on oil. Prices are dropping. Saudi Arabia is reeling. This young prince has ridden in a Tesla, and he can see the future. MARTIN: So he's selling a new image of the kingdom, but has anything changed? AMOS: You know, he amassed power quickly. His father is the king, so he could do that. He is viewed as a reformer at home. The ban on women driving ends this. Summer women can now join the military, open businesses, go to sporting events. There's a new entertainment industry that's opening. He also cracked down on the religious police. And these are the guys who enforce attendance at prayers and enforce the strict public dress code. But he's also in other ways stumbled. He ordered the detention of more than 300 businessmen, former Cabinet officials and royals, in a corruption crackdown. They all got imprisoned in a five-star hotel. Investors on the outside said it looked more like a shakedown to them because these guys had to agree to give back billions of dollars before they could get out of the hotel. Popular in the kingdom, not so popular with investors. That's part of the reason that he's here. He's also raised eyebrows with personal spending - a 440-foot yacht, a French chateau, a Da Vinci. Those are his reported purchases. And then there's Yemen. He was the defense minister when Saudi decided to side in that civil war. And he's going to have a tough sell in Congress. They want the U.S. to stop supporting that war. MARTIN: Well, to that end, though, what kind of reception can he expect here in the U.S.? AMOS: He's going to get a warm one at the White House. He has been working with Jared Kushner since shortly after the election but tougher in Congress because of Yemen. And a tougher audience still will be investors. This is the first time the Saudis are here to sell their own image. You know, the relationship has always been Washington to Riyadh. Now he is laser-focused on the economy, so he has a new audience to convince. MARTIN: I'm asking you to speculate a bit here, Deb, but what are the chances that he actually can change one of the most-conservative societies in the world? AMOS: That is the 64 million - or billion these days - dollar question. He has to because the kingdom faces a disaster if he can't because of the economy. He is no Jeffersonian Democrat, be sure of that. There has been, along with these reforms, a crackdown in the kingdom. So this is the biggest economy in the region. Saudi Arabia's stability is important to the United States. So what many analysts are saying is let us wish him well. MARTIN: That's NPR's Deborah Amos. Deb, thank you. AMOS: Thank you.

Read this: The war started badly for the US and UN. North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.

Fact4: Madhu has been misappropriating company funds with the help of Manorama. Fact5: Bombay to seek new avenues. Story (Output): Raja was a petty thief living on the streets of Bombay, where he relied on his skills to survive in the bustling city. He spent his days pickpocketing unsuspecting tourists and locals, while his nights were spent dreaming of something bigger. In the same city, Rani made her living as a street performer. She had always been attracted to the vibrant energy of Bombay and loved the way it made her feel alive. As both of them struggled to make ends meet, fate brought them together on a crowded street corner. Little did they know, their lives were about to change forever. Meanwhile, in the city of Madras, Raghu lived a simple life with his wife and children. He worked at a small yet prosperous company that provided for his family. Although he was far away from the chaotic world of Bombay, the ties that bound Raja, Rani, and Raghu were stronger than they could have ever imagined. Back in Bombay, Madhu, one of the employees at Raghu's company, had been misappropriating company funds with the help of her colleague, Manorama. Through an intricate web of deceit and corruption, they managed to steal substantial sums of money without being caught. The stolen money provided them with the means to live a luxurious lifestyle in Bombay, away from the prying eyes of their coworkers in Madras. Unbeknownst to them, Raja's thieving skills ultimately led him to cross paths with Madhu and Manorama. One fateful day, as he was attempting to steal a valuable artifact from an antique store, he stumbled upon information that revealed the money laundering operation. Caught between the desire to enrich himself or expose the nefarious activities, Raja decided to approach Rani for guidance. Together, they decided that the ugly truth must come to light. Raja and Rani set off on a journey to Bombay's underbelly, seeking new avenues to bring down Madhu and Manorama's criminal empire. As they navigated the dark and dangerous streets, their partnership developed into a deep bond that withstood the challenges they faced. With perseverance, courage, and a little luck, Raja and Rani were successful in their pursuit. Madhu and Manorama were brought to justice, and Raghu's company was saved from the brink of collapse. Through his act of bravery, Raja redeemed himself, leaving his old life of thievery behind. The heartwarming tale of Raja, Rani, and Raghu serves as a testament to the power of second chances and the beauty of forging unexpected connections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What might be the first step of the process?","completion":"The first step of the process that ultimately leads to cooling of the body through sweating is the detection of an increase in body temperature by the brain's thermoregulatory center, specifically the hypothalamus. When the body temperature rises due to factors such as physical exertion, exposure to high ambient temperature, or even consuming spicy foods, the thermoreceptors present throughout the body, especially on the skin surface, detect the change in temperature. This information is then relayed to the hypothalamus, a region in the brain responsible for various bodily functions, including regulation of body temperature. As a response to the detected temperature increase, the hypothalamus activates its heat dissipation mechanisms to maintain the core body temperature within an optimal range (approximately 37°C/98.6°F). One such mechanism involves sending signals to the blood vessels in the skin layers, particularly those near the surface. This signal causes the blood vessels to dilate (vasodilation), which allows increased blood flow to the skin. Consequently, the heat from the blood can be more easily transferred to the surrounding environment. Simultaneously, the hypothalamus also activates the eccrine sweat glands distributed throughout the body. These glands produce sweat, a mixture of water, salts, and other minerals that are secreted onto the skin through the pores. As sweat is released, it evaporates from the skin surface, which requires the absorption of heat energy. This process of evaporation facilitates cooling of the skin and the body in general, helping to maintain a steady core body temperature. In summary, the first step of the process is the detection of an increase in body temperature by the brain's thermoregulatory center, mainly the hypothalamus, which then triggers the body's heat dissipation mechanisms such as vasodilation and activation of sweat glands, leading to cooling of the body through the release and evaporation of sweat."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Willamette River ( (listen) wil-AM-it) is a major tributary of the Columbia River, accounting for 12 to 15 percent of the Columbia's flow. The Willamette's main stem is 187 miles (301 km) long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia. Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well. Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges. Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette's drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding.

Question: The person who started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses had what calling? Context: Martin Luther, a German monk, started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses on the castle church of Wittenberg on October 31, 1517. The immediate provocation spurring this act was Pope Leo X’s renewal of the indulgence for the building of the new St. Peter's Basilica in 1514. Luther was challenged to recant his heresy at the Diet of Worms in 1521. When he refused, he was placed under the ban of the Empire by Charles V.

Growing building activity culminated in a \\"land boom\\" which, in 1888, reached a peak of speculative development fuelled by consumer confidence and escalating land value. As a result of the boom, large commercial buildings, coffee palaces, terrace housing and palatial mansions proliferated in the city. The establishment of a hydraulic facility in 1887 allowed for the local manufacture of elevators, resulting in the first construction of high-rise buildings; most notably the APA Building, amongst the world's tallest commercial buildings upon completion in 1889.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors. and a hint : Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. Please answer this question : Which student read more about a greater frequency of collisions? Answer:","completion":"Sean read more about a greater frequency of collisions. This is because he studied the influence of temperature on chemical reactions, and the provided hint indicates that raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction due to an increase in the frequency of collisions.

Traditional morphology-based or appearance-based systematics have usually given the Hexapoda the rank of superclass,:180 and identified four groups within it: insects (Ectognatha), springtails (Collembola), Protura, and Diplura, the latter three being grouped together as the Entognatha on the basis of internalized mouth parts. Supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data. A recent theory is that the Hexapoda are polyphyletic (where the last common ancestor was not a member of the group), with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from the Insecta. Many of the traditional appearance-based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic, so rather than using ranks like subclass, superorder, and infraorder, it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings (in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group).

Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as meze with various dips such as tzatziki, grilled octopus and small fish, feta cheese, dolmades (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various pulses, olives and cheese.

Another distinctive feature of the Mediterranean diet is the regular use of olive oil, which is known for its health benefits and heart-healthy monounsaturated fats. This oil often replaces other less healthy fats like butter and margarine in cooking and dressing dishes. Moreover, the Mediterranean diet encourages the consumption of foods rich in healthy fats, such as fish, nuts, and seeds, which are good sources of Omega-3 fatty acids, and it highly values the inclusion of fresh herbs and spices, as they not only enhance the flavors of the dishes, but also provide various health benefits as well. Additionally, the Mediterranean diet recognizes the important role that moderate consumption of red wine plays in promoting heart health, as it contains antioxidants and polyphenols that can be beneficial for cardiovascular health. A key aspect of the Mediterranean diet is the focus on enjoying foods in a social setting. Sharing meals with family and friends is considered an integral part of the diet, which allows for a deeper appreciation and nurturing of relationships through food. In summary, a characteristic of the Mediterranean diet is its focus on whole, unprocessed, and nutrient-rich foods, with an emphasis on plant-based ingredients, healthy fats, and moderate consumption of lean meats and red wine. This diet promotes overall health and well-being, while also highlighting the importance of social connections and shared meals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It's difficult to look back on one's own childhood without some element of nostalgia .I have four brothers and sisters, and my memories are all about being with them.Playing board games on the living room floor, or spending days in the street with the other neighborhood children, racing up and down on our bikes, or exploring the nearby woods.My parents scarcely appear in these memories, except as providers either of meals or of severe blame after some particularly risky adventure. These days, in the UK at least, the nature of childhood has changed dramatically.Firstly, families are smaller, and there are far more only children.It is common for both parents to work outside the home and there is the feeling that there just isn't time to bring up a large family, or that no one could possibly afford to have more than one child.As a result, today's boys and girls spend much of their time alone.Another major change is that youngsters today tend to spend a huge amount of their free time at home, inside.More than anything this is due to the fact that parents worry far more than they used to about real or imagined dangers, so they wouldn't dream of letting their children play outside by themselves. Finally, the kind of toys children have and the way they play is totally different.Computer and video games have replaced the board games and more interesting activities of my childhood.The irony is that so many ways of playing games are called \\"interactive\\".The fact that you can play electronic games on your own further increases the sense of loneliness felt by many young people today. Do these changes mean that children today have a less relaxing childhood than I had? I personally believe that they do, but perhaps every generation feels exactly the same.

A:","completion":"Apart from the laws of motion and universal gravitation, Sir Isaac Newton made several crucial discoveries and contributions in various fields. Some of his significant accomplishments include: 1. The invention of Calculus: Newton developed a form of mathematics called \\"fluxions\\" (Calculus), which deals with rates of change and the slopes of curves. 2. Discovering the nature of light and color: Newton conducted several experiments with prisms and demonstrated that white light is made of a spectrum of colors, which led to the development of the field of optics. 3. Reflecting Telescope: He invented the Newtonian telescope, also known as the reflecting telescope, which uses mirrors instead of lenses, resulting in a more precise and less distorted image of celestial objects. 4. Laws of Motion: Newton established three fundamental laws of motion, which became the foundation for classical mechanics. 5. The Universal Law of Gravitation: Newton discovered that every object with mass attracts every other object, with the force of attraction proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. 6. Contributions to Fluid Mechanics: Newton's principles and equations were applied to fluid mechanics, which deal with the behavior of both fluid at rest and in motion. 7. Mathematization of Science: Newton's work in Principia Mathematica revolutionized the world's approach to scientific investigation, applying mathematical reasoning to fields ranging from physics to astronomy.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Justin and Thomas are two college students conducting an experiment in their chemistry laboratory course. They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature. In which person's reaction will the acid and base particles move faster? A:","completion":"In Justin's reaction. Step 1: Understand the situation In this scenario, Justin is conducting reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas is conducting his reactions at a lower temperature. Step 2: Recall the effect of temperature on reaction rates As stated in the text, when the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. This leads to more collisions between particles and a higher likelihood of reacting with greater force. Step 3: Apply knowledge to the given scenario Since Justin is conducting his reactions at a high temperature, the particles of the acid and base in his experiment will have more energy and move faster. In contrast, the particles in Thomas's reaction will have less energy and move slower due to the lower temperature. Step 4: Conclude Based on this information, the acid and base particles will move faster in Justin's reaction. So, the correct answer is A: In Justin's reaction."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Their love for each other is palpable as they lie in bed treasuring their 6 month old daughter Quincey. Miranda fantasizes about the speech she plans to make when, one day in their future, she will give this tiny infant away at her wedding. Tragically, when Quincey is 3, Miranda is killed in a car accident and Rawdon is left alone, unmoored, to continue life without the love of his life. Fortunately Rawdon still has Quincey. Staying as strong as he can he takes her to the roof of a skyscraper and explains that Mommy is now an angel. It is up here that for the first time they see a vision of Miranda as an angel. Rawdon continues to see visions of her.

Summarize this article: Wider use of anti-retroviral drugs has helped to stop a sharper rise, a study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and a number of universities found. They found a 26% rise, from 1990-2010, in the proportion of men who have sex with men who did not use condoms. The report said the figures showed it was vital to promote safe sex. Rates of HIV have been rising in recent years with latest figures showing cases among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the UK reaching an all-time high. A recent report from the HPA found that nearly half of the 6,280 people diagnosed in the UK in 2011 were MSM. Overall, one in 20 MSM are infected with HIV. Darren, Greater Manchester, writes: \\"I suspect the rise is more among young MSMs. \\"They see HIV positive men like myself and think it is just a matter of popping a few pills if they catch it, so they are not that phased about becoming HIV positive or not using condoms. \\"There also seem to be more bisexual men or curious men around now who are used to not bothering with condoms with heterosexual encounters so prefer not to use them elsewhere too. \\"When I do have sex I tend to use condoms as there are worse things you can get like Hepatitis C or an alternative strain of HIV which can reduce your highly active antiretroviral therapy drug pool.\\" For this study, researchers analysed data from 1990 to 2010. They concluded that, without the introduction of anti-retroviral drugs to treat those with HIV, infections would be 68% higher in MSM. Therapy with anti-retrovirals lowers the risk of people with HIV infecting others. The report suggested the incidence of HIV could be 32% lower if all anti-retroviral treatment were prescribed from the moment of diagnosis rather than when health declined. Further analysis showed that, if all MSM had stopped using condoms from 2000, rates of HIV in this group would now be 400% higher, the journal PLoS One reported. The data also showed that the incidence of HIV could have dropped by a quarter if more HIV testing had been done. But the researchers said the results showed that even a modest increase in unprotected sex was enough to erode the benefits of other interventions. Study leader Professor Andrew Phillips, from University College London, said: \\"By better understanding the driving forces behind the trends we've seen in the past, it will allow us to make informed choices to reduce new HIV infections in the future.\\" Co-author Dr Valerie Delpech, who is head of HIV surveillance at the HPA, said: \\"Everyone should use a condom when having sex with new or casual partners, until all partners have had a sexual health screen. \\"We also encourage men who have sex with men to get an HIV and STI screen at least annually, and every three months if having condomless sex with new or casual partners - and clinicians to take every opportunity to recommend HIV testing to this group.\\" Sir Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said condom use by gay men had played a key part in containing the spread of HIV in the UK. \\"Without it, there would have been 80,000 more gay men with HIV between 2000 and 2010.\\" He added that the study showed the impact of the combined HIV strategy of promoting condoms, increasing regular HIV testing and encouraging the earlier use of anti-HIV drug therapy. He added: \\"At a time when funding for local HIV prevention programmes is under threat, this only reinforces the important role which local authorities can and must play in funding local HIV prevention.\\"","completion":"A study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and various universities has found that rates of HIV have been rising in recent years, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the UK.

It is no wonder many of us find it difficult to have a sufficient amount of sleep. But will sleeping more on the weekend make up for hours of lost snoozing ? One sleep expert, W. Christopher Winter raised the question. Sleeping binge Getting eight hours of shut-eye each night is generally recommended, but many people don't. As the week rolls from Monday to Friday, they accumulate a sleep debt. Spending a few extra hours in bed on a Saturday morning, people assume, will help them \\" catch up\\" on lost sleep. They're likely right, \\" Nobody knows how long the horizon is, probably a few nights, but studies show that recovery sleep in the short term does work,\\" says Dr. Winter, a member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Sleep banking Recent data suggests that banking sleep in advance of a long night can actually offset upcoming sleep deprivation . If you knew you were going to have to stay up all night on a particular day, for example, you could sleep for 10 hours a day for multiple days before the event, and be fine, Dr. Winter says. Just plan ahead. Routine naps A scheduled nap is healthier than catching up on or banking sleep. \\" Because sleep extension can make you feel groggy , I always recommend a short nap [if a person feels they need it ], at the same time, every day,\\" says Dr. Winter. He adds that 25 minutes is ideal. \\" When you schedule a short nap, your body anticipates it and slows down, without falling into a deep dream sleep,\\" he says. That refreshing, scheduled break is better than an occasional weekend lie-in. \\" The body likes routine,\\" he says, \\" When it's prepared, it works more efficiently.\\" Question: From Monday to Friday, many people _ .

Stewart Armstrong Copeland was born in Alexandria, Virginia on July 16, 1952, the youngest of four children of CIA officer Miles Copeland, Jr. and Scottish archaeologist Lorraine Adie. The family moved to Cairo, Egypt, a few months after his birth, and Copeland spent his formative years in the Middle East. In 1957, his family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and Copeland attended the American Community School there. He started taking drum lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year. After the Police disbanded, Copeland established a career composing soundtracks for movies (Airborne, Talk Radio, Wall Street, Riff Raff, Raining Stones, Surviving the Game, See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Highlander II: The Quickening, The Leopard Son, She's Having a Baby, The First Power, Fresh, Taking Care of Business, West Beirut, I am David, Good Burger), television (The Equalizer, Dead Like Me, Star Wars: Droids, the pilot for Babylon 5 (1993), Nickelodeon's The Amanda Show, The Life and Times of Juniper Lee), operas (Holy Blood and Crescent Moon, commissioned by Cleveland Opera) and ballets (Prey' Ballet Oklahoma, Casque of Amontillado, Noah's Ark/Solcheeka, commissioned by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, King Lear, commissioned by the San Francisco Ballet Company, Emilio). Copeland also occasionally played drums for other artists. Peter Gabriel employed Copeland to perform on his songs \\"Red Rain\\" and \\"Big Time\\" from his 1986 album So. He has also performed with Mike Rutherford and Tom Waits. That year he also teamed with Adam Ant to record the title track and video for the Anthony Michael Hall movie Out of Bounds. In 1989, Copeland formed Animal Logic with jazz bassist Stanley Clarke and singer-songwriter Deborah Holland. The trio had success with their first album and world tour but the follow-up recording sold poorly, and the band did not continue. In 1993 he composed the music for Channel 4's Horse Opera and director Bob Baldwin.

And the answer is...","completion":"We have the equation: -24615*i - 393015 = 2585400 Our goal is to solve the equation for i, which is an unknown variable. Here's how we can do that: 1. Firstly, isolate the term containing the variable i. To do this, we'll move the constant term on the left side of the equation to the right side. We can do this by adding 393015 to both sides of the equation: -24615*i = 2585400 + 393015 2. Now, simplify the equation by performing the operation on the right side: -24615*i = 2978415 3. Next, to solve for i, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -24615: i = 2978415 / -24615 4. Perform the division: i ≈ -121 Thus, the solution to the equation -24615*i - 393015 = 2585400 is i ≈ -121."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Millions of families around the world have been given a helping hand out of poverty by micro-credits. These very small loans , usually less than US200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient. The micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty. So how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year. A very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems. Micro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised. The micro-credit system is not charity. The payments are fixed-term loans and interest is charged. The costs of making such small loans, collecting them and giving personal support are high. This is shown in the interest rates, which range from 15... Question: Bank loans are mainly made to women because _ .

Facebook warns developers after privacy leak \\"We take strong measures to enforce this policy, including suspending and disabling applications that violate it.\\" A report by The Wall Street Journal found that some of Facebook's most popular apps, including the game FarmVille by social network game company Zynga, were being used to share users' personal information with more than 25 advertisers and online tracking companies. According to the Journal, the apps were sharing the unique \\"Facebook ID\\" numbers that are assigned to every user on the site and can be used to look up a person's name -- even if that person has set all of his or her Facebook information to be private. The report said Rapleaf, a data gathering firm, was able to link information from the apps to its database of internet users, which could allow advertisers to create user profiles based on online information about the users. In a blog post Monday, Rapleaf said sharing personal identifiers was a mistake. When informed of it last week, the company \\"immediately researched the cause and implemented a solution to cease the transmissions,\\" the post said.

Which US state in 1907 was the last to declare Christmas a legal holiday?","completion":"Oklahoma was the last US state to declare Christmas a legal holiday in 1907. This decision was made over three decades after it became a federally recognized holiday in the United States. Prior to its declaration as a legal holiday, religious observance of Christmas was widespread in the United States and celebrated in various ways across households. The first time Christmas was designated as a federal holiday, however, came on June 26, 1870, when President Ulysses S. Grant signed legislation which included Christmas as one of five officially recognized national holidays, alongside New Year's Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day, and George Washington's Birthday. Before the late 19th century, Christmas was not a legal holiday in all US states. In some cases, celebrating Christmas was even frowned upon for cultural, religious, or historical reasons. For instance, the early Puritans did not approve of the celebration of Christmas, considering it a decadent holiday with pagan roots. As a result, Christmas was not widely celebrated in New England for many years. Over time, the popularity of Christmas festivities grew, and various states began to recognize it as a legal holiday throughout the 19th century. By the mid-to-late 1800s, virtually all US states had made Christmas a legal holiday. Oklahoma was the only exception until it joined the Union as the 46th state on November 16, 1907, and subsequently declared Christmas an official state holiday in the same year. It is important to note that the proclamation of Christmas as a legal holiday did not have a significant impact on the overall festivities or religious observance of the celebrations in Oklahoma, as residents had been informally celebrating the holiday in their personal lives for many years. Declaring Christmas a legal holiday in Oklahoma ensured that it was recognized officially and granted employees the day off to celebrate it with their families. This was a reflection of the growing importance and popularity of Christmas across the United States as a time for family gathering, religious observance, and festive celebration."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis.

In hydraulic elevator systems, emergency power will lower the elevators to the lowest landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit. The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset, usually by cycling the elevator main power switch. Typically, due to the high current draw when starting the pump motor, hydraulic elevators are not run using standard emergency power systems. Buildings like hospitals and nursing homes usually size their emergency generators to accommodate this draw. However, the increasing use of current-limiting motor starters, commonly known as \\"soft-start\\" contactors, avoid much of this problem, and the current draw of the pump motor is less of a limiting concern. Once the passengers have exited, what happens?","completion":"Once the passengers have exited the hydraulic elevator during an emergency situation, the following steps occur: 1. Doors close: After the adjustable time period has passed, the elevator doors close automatically to secure the elevator cabin and prevent unauthorized access or further use. 2. Elevator remains unusable: The elevator is then placed in an unusable state, to minimize any risks or further complications that may arise from continued operation during the emergency. 3. Resetting the elevator: In order to reuse the elevator, it typically needs to be reset by authorized personnel. Usually, this involves cycling the elevator main power switch off and then on again, which reboots the elevator control system and restores it to normal operation. 4. Inspection and maintenance: After the reset, it is essential to conduct a thorough inspection of the elevator to ensure its safe functionality. This may include checking various components such as the hydraulic pump, motor, valves, and electrical connections, as well as testing the elevator's operation to confirm its proper functioning. 5. Resuming normal operation: If the inspection determines that the elevator is safe to operate and no further maintenance is required, the elevator can resume normal operation. However, if any issues are identified during the inspection, they must be addressed and repaired before the elevator is allowed to operate again. This may involve replacing or repairing damaged components, updating software, or recalibrating the system. By following these steps, the hydraulic elevator ensures the safety of its passengers and maintains proper functionality after an emergency situation. Additionally, this process helps in preventing any further complications or potential hazards from arising due to continued operation during an emergency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Jean Auguste Margueritte (15 January 1823 6 September 1870), French General, father of Victor Margueritte and Paul Margueritte. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - A Muslim is someone who follows or practises Islam, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion. Muslims consider the Quran (Koran), their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. They also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (\\"sunnah \\") as recorded in traditional accounts (\\"hadith\\"). \\"Muslim\\" is an Arabic word meaning \\"one who submits (to God)\\". - French Algeria (to 1839, then ' afterward; unofficially ', , ') began in 1827 with the blockade of Algiers by the French navy and lasted from 1830 to 1962, under a variety of governmental systems. From 1848 until independence, the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria was administered as an integral part of France. The vast arid interior of Algeria, like the rest of French North Africa, was never considered part of France. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of European immigrants, known as ' and later, as '. However, indigenous Muslims remained a majority of the territory's population throughout its history. Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population with its lack of political and economic status fueled calls for greater political autonomy, and eventually independence, from France. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the Algerian War began. The war concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 Evian agreements and the July 1962 self-determination referendum. - Paul Margueritte ( 20 February 1860 -- 29 December 1918 ) was born in French Algeria , the son of General Jean Auguste Margueritte ( 1823 -- 1870 ) , who was mortally wounded in the Battle of Sedan . An account of his life was published by Paul Margueritte as Mon père ( 1884 ; enlarged ed. , 1897 ) . Paul 's name is generally associated with that of his brother , Victor , because of their frequent collaboration . Paul Margueritte , who has given a picture of his home in Algiers in Le Jardin du passé ( 1895 ) , was sent to the military school of La Flèche for the sons of officers , and became in 1880 clerk to the minister of public instruction . He was an amateur mime and wrote several pantomimes , most notably Pierrot assassin de sa femme ( Théâtre de Valvins , 1881 ) and , in collaboration with Fernand Beissier , Colombine pardonnée ( Cercle Funambulesque , 1888 ) . - Victor Margueritte (1 December 1866 23 March 1942) and his brother Paul Margueritte (18601918), French novelists, both born in Algeria, were the sons of General Jean Auguste Margueritte (18231870), who after an honorable career in Algeria was mortally wounded in the great cavalry charge at Sedan and died in Belgium on 6 September 1870. An account of his life was published by Paul Margueritte as \\"Mon père\\" (1884; enlarged ed., 1897). The names of the two brothers are generally associated, on account of their collaboration. - The Battle of Sedan was fought during the FrancoPrussian War on 1 September 1870. It resulted in the capture of Emperor Napoleon III and large numbers of his troops and for all intents and purposes decided the war in favour of Prussia and its allies, though fighting continued under a new French government.

Choices: - muhammad - napoleon iii - paris - paul margueritte - victor margueritte The answer to this question is:","completion":"Victor Margueritte is related to Paul Margueritte through the relation of 'brother'.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, answer the following question. After the story ends, what do you think readers purchase?

Given the question: What was the name of Sir John Baker's daughter? Answer the above question based on the context below: Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \\"garden rooms\\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \\"garden rooms\\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \\"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\\"The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages.

Manisha Koirala (born 16 August 1970) is a Nepali actress who mainly appears in Hindi films in India, though she has worked in several South Indian and her native country's films. Noted for her acting prowess, Koirala is the recipient of several accolades, including four Filmfare Awards--and is one of India's most well-known actresses. Although the box-office collections from her films have varied considerably, critics have noted that her niche as an actor remains unharmed irrespective of her commercial potency. She was one of the highest paid actresses in the 1990s. She starred in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's love saga 1942: A Love Story (1994) and Mani Ratnam's Tamil drama Bombay (1995). Her performance in the film Bombay was a milestone in her career which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actress and Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance. She was seriously noticed by Bollywood after the release of 1942: A Love Story which was a year earlier than the release of Bombay. She also starred in Mansoor Khan's romantic musical Akele Hum Akele Tum (1995) as the ignored wife who leaves her husband and child to fulfill her singing talent and subsequently becomes a popular star. In 1996, she received positive reviews for her performance in the drama Agni Sakshi, as a battered wife on the run from her mentally ill husband. The film became one of the biggest hits of that year at the Indian box office. Later that year, she acted in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's directorial debut Khamoshi: The Musical, where she played the role of Annie, a caring daughter to deaf and mute parents. A critic from Channel 4 wrote: \\"Koirala... demonstrates the full range of her acting ability, rather than playing against it as she has had to do in more traditional films. The scene where she shouts at her father through the door, screaming and using sign language even though she knows he can neither see nor hear her, is extremely powerful.\\" Filmfare magazine later included her performance in the film on its \\"80 Iconic Performances\\" list.

As the man is already engaged in the task of removing snow from his car, it is natural for him to progress to clearing the surrounding area with his shovel. This would not only make the task of accessing his car easier, but also create a safe path for him to walk on, preventing potential slip and fall accidents. In contrast, the other options seem less relevant or logical in the context of the given story. In option 1, although the man speaking to the camera might provide an opportunity to introduce some background information or context, it does not directly relate to the task at hand and could potentially break the flow of the narrative. Option 2 presents an unrealistic scenario – pushing another car in a snowy area would require significant strength and adherence to safety precautions, and it is unclear how this action would contribute to the overall storyline. Option 3 contains a confusing phrase – \\"cutting up the snow walking into the car\\" – and does not provide a clear and reasonable continuation of the story.

Each kind of life eats another kind of life in order to live, and together they create a food chain . Some food chains are simple, while others are not. But all food chains begin with the sun, and all food chains become broken up if one of the links disappears. All life needs sunlight to live on. But only plants can use sunlight directly. Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals. Meat-eating animals are only eating plants indirectly. What about humans? We are members of many food chains. We eat rice, vegetables, and fruits and so on. We also eat meat and drink milk.

Chris Christie said Tuesday that New Jersey needed \\"tough and plain-spoken leadership\\" when he took office eight years ago and he delivered it pulling the state from \\"the brink of financial ruin\\" by confronting problems leaders of both parties had ignored for decades. Christie hands over state government to Democrat Phil Murphy in a week. Christie said he was the first governor in America to try to tackle the huge and escalating burden of state pension costs saying previous governors from both parties and Legislatures \\"virtually ignored the growing menace of increased costs and no real contributions.\\" Among the steps taken during his administration was dedicating lottery proceeds to the pension system for the next 30 years. When he took office Christie said New Jersey was \\"on the brink of financial ruin as a state.\\" \\"We needed tough and plain-spoken leadership to deal with these problems \\" he said. He said he vetoed more than 7 billion in spending helped cut the state workforce pushed through a cap on property tax increases and at the same time made sure the state invested heavily to help protect the New Jersey Shore from the kind of devastation it suffered during Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The prepared text of his remarks didn't show him invoking the name of his friend President Donald Trump. But he called it an \\"honor\\" to chair the White House's opioid commission. Christie 's speech caps his stint as one of America's best-known governors.

At least in the beginning he won acclaim for his forthrightness like when he told beachcombers to \\"get the hell off the beach\\" in 2011 during Hurricane Irene. He told it like it was before Trump brought the practice to the White House. He also was exceedingly popular and widely praised for guiding the state in its recovery from Superstorm Sandy which ravaged the coastline. He was briefly seen as a top GOP contender for president. But he was also criticized for testy exchanges with the public during town hall meetings and other encounters. His popularity and job approval fell sharply particularly after the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal in which three of his allies were convicted in a political retribution scheme. He also lost the home crowd after spending much of 2015 and early 2016 campaigning for president out of state a contest he dropped out of after failing to emerge from the back of the pack. He returned to New Jersey and focused on the state's â and country's â opioid addiction crisis after failing to get a top job in the Trump administration.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A pair of Blue Rams will do best in a tank that is at least 10 gallons. If you add other fish or other cichlid pairs, then you’ll need to go up to at least 20 gallons. Disregard everything you’ve heard about the one gallon of water per inch of fish rule, it’s simply outdated and extremely flawed. Remember that German Blue Ram Cichlids can grow to be 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) at maturity. Overcrowding is not a problem to be taken lightly. It can stress your fish out, making them more prone to illness. It can also lead to increased aggressiveness and even starvation. Rams are accustomed to the tropical waters of Venezuela and Colombia, right near the equator. The areas they occupy are shallow with minimal cover, and they require consistent water temperatures of at least 80 degrees, with 82-86 being optimal. A heater can be used to regulate your tanks temperature. An aquarium light improves tank visibility. Many people choose to purchase an aquarium hood that includes a built-in light and heater. Whatever lighting setup you choose, German Blue Ram Cichlids do best with light during the daytime. 6-8 hours of light a day is plenty; any more than that and you may run into algae problems. This is the base material that covers the floor of your tank. Blue Rams prefer sand or gravel, as they mirror a Ram’s natural habitat. Make sure to rinse your substrate out before adding, otherwise it will make your tank appear murky. Add at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of sand or gravel at the bottom of the tank and spread it out evenly. Blue Rams do best in a complex habitat with a number of good hiding spaces. Be sure to include plants, rocks, caves, and driftwood in your tank. These items will make water changes more of a hassle, but will improve the health of your cichlids in the long term. Place larger plants on the outer perimeter of the tank. Make sure to leave swimming space in between and an open area in the middle of the tank. The Dwarf Amazon Sword and Brazilian Water Ivy are two plants that Blue Rams enjoy. A good selection of driftwood pieces can help regulate the pH level, provide great hiding spaces, and serve as a plant anchor. Make sure to buy your driftwood from a pet store, as this will ensure that is safe for aquarium use. You may notice some water yellowing after adding driftwood, this is perfectly normal and can be remedied via regular water changes.","completion":"This article provides guidance on setting up an optimal aquarium environment for German Blue Ram Cichlids, including recommended tank size, substrate, lighting, temperature, plants, driftwood, and how to avoid overcrowding and stress for healthy fish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Man of the match Harry Kane hailed one of the 'greatest moments' in his fledgling Tottenham career after helping his side snatch a 2-1 comeback victory over 10-man Aston Villa with a late winner at Villa Park. Villa's five-game and 15-minute wait for a goal ended when Andreas Weimann opened the scoring following a spell of dominance from the hosts as he collected Charles N'Zogbia's cross to slot home from close range. Tempers flared for the second time in little over five minutes after the hour mark and Christian Benteke was shown a straight red card by referee Neil Swarbrick after a tussle with Erik Lamela in which the Belgium international raised his hand to his opponent's face.

Belgium fans are not specifically mentioned, and it's not a match between countries, so there would be no reason for them to celebrate with Spurs players. 4. Mauricio Pochettino is a manager, so it's unusual for his fans to be mentioned separately. 5. Neil Swarbrick is a referee, and referees don’t usually have fans celebrating alongside the winning teams. 6.

Summarize the following: Create a record of your dairy consumption and symptoms from day to day. Keep track of what dairy foods you eat (milk, yogurt, ice cream, cheese, cottage cheese), the serving size, what time you eat them, and what you eat with them. In another column, keep track of when you have symptoms, what the symptoms are, and how long they last. This can help you and your doctor make a diagnosis, and figure out which foods are most likely to give you symptoms. Use a notebook, journal, online tool like excel or Google Docs, or wall chart – whatever helps you stay organized. If you want to keep your symptoms private, use something hand-held that only you can access. If you think you may be lactose intolerant, try to avoid eating dairy for a couple days or even 1-2 weeks. Make note of whether or not your symptoms subside or go away. Inform your doctor if your symptoms improve when you don’t have dairy. Bloating, cramps, gas, diarrhea, or stomach noise after eating might be caused by lactose intolerance. However, you want to be sure you know what is causing your symptoms, and rule out any other possible reasons for your stomach upset. Make a doctor’s appointment to get tested, and discuss the possible cause of your lactose intolerance. There are a few different kinds of tests that your doctor can do: For a lactose tolerance test, you drink a liquid containing lots of lactose and have a blood test done two hours later. For the hydrogen breath test you also drink a high-lactose liquid, and then your doctor measures how much hydrogen is in your breath at set intervals. A stool acidity test simply checks a stool sample; it is used for infants or children who can’t do the other tests. It might feel stressful if you have to change your diet, and you might be worried about what others will think. Fortunately, many people eat specific diets and you can explain your condition to others however you want to. Be vague, offer a simple explanation, or – if you want – wow others with your scientific knowledge! It’s okay to say simply, “Dairy upsets my stomach so I try to stay away from it,” or, “If I have too much milk, I feel sick.” You can also be specific, if you want to educate others. Say something like, “I’m lactose intolerant because I don’t have enough of the enzyme in my body that breaks down the sugar in milk, lactose.” Some people might think that if you drink a sip of milk or can eat yogurt, you’re lying about being lactose intolerant. Many people simply don’t understand the condition. Explain that most people who are lactose intolerant can eat some dairy products and not others, or dairy in small amounts. You can try to explain to people using an example, such as, “It probably wouldn’t affect you very much if you drink half a cup of coffee, but if you drink four espressos you might feel jittery, right? That’s how I am with dairy – a little is okay, a lot makes me feel sick.” You can also explain that you’re not allergic to milk, so drinking it isn't unsafe. Explain that it’s the sugar in dairy that upsets your stomach, and there’s more milk sugar in some things (like whole milk) than others (like dairy and hard cheeses). Summary:","completion":"To determine if you have lactose intolerance, create a daily record of your dairy consumption and any symptoms experienced.

Movie plot title: Even the Rain Movie plot: Sebastian (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Costa (Luis Tosar), both in their mid thirties, are life long friends only in the way a warring couple might be. Sebastian is an obsessive idealist who has sworn to his inner self that he will direct a film about one of the worlds most iconic figures, Christopher Columbus (Karra Elejalde). Not for him the hypocritical lies of a genius sailor on a divine mission to win souls for Christ. He is determined to upturn the entire conservative myth of Western Civilization's arrival in the Americas as a force for good. Rather, his story is about what Columbus set in motion; the obsession with gold, the hunt for slaves by Spanish mastiffs, and punitive violence to those Indians who fought back. His story is counterbalanced by the radical priests Bartolome de las Casas (Raul Arevalo) and Antonio Montestinos (Carlos Santos) who were the first to raise their voice in defence of the Indians, and ask the question, Are these men? Sebastian is also obsessed by the first Indian leader to resist - Hatuey (Carlos Aduviri), who was nailed to a cross and crucified as example to those who oppose the Christians. The talented and brilliant actor playing Columbus constantly challenges Sebastian and accuses him of agit prop and cheap manipulation. Costa doesn't give a shit. He cares little about what happened yesterday, never mind 500 years ago. The only thing that matters to him is his professional pride as a producer - that the film is made on time and within budget.

News article: First ever observed case of ‘river piracy’ saw the Slims river disappear as intense glacier melt suddenly diverted its flow into another watercourse An immense river that flowed from one of Canada’s largest glaciers vanished over the course of four days last year, scientists have reported, in an unsettling illustration of how global warming dramatically changes the world’s geography. The abrupt and unexpected disappearance of the Slims river, which spanned up to 150 metres at its widest points, is the first observed case of “river piracy”, in which the flow of one river is suddenly diverted into another. Collapsing Greenland glacier could raise sea levels by half a metre, say scientists Read more For hundreds of years, the Slims carried meltwater northwards from the vast Kaskawulsh glacier in Canada’s Yukon territory into the Kluane river, then into the Yukon river towards the Bering Sea. But in spring 2016, a period of intense melting of the glacier meant the drainage gradient was tipped in favour of a second river, redirecting the meltwater to the Gulf of Alaska, thousands of miles from its original destination. The continental-scale rearrangement was documented by a team of scientists who had been monitoring the incremental retreat of the glacier for years. But on a 2016 fieldwork expedition they were confronted with a landscape that had been radically transformed. “We went to the area intending to continue our measurements in the Slims river, but found the riverbed more or less dry,” said James Best, a geologist at the University of Illinois. “The delta top that we’d been sailing over in a small boat was now a dust storm. In terms of landscape change it was incredibly dramatic.” Dan Shugar, a geoscientist at the University of Washington Tacoma and the paper’s lead author, added: “The water was somewhat treacherous to approach, because you’re walking on these old river sediments that were really goopy and would suck you in. And day by day we could see the water level dropping.” The team flew a helicopter over the glacier and used drones to investigate what was happening in the other valley, which is less accessible. “We found that all of the water that was coming out from the front of the glacier, rather than it being split between two rivers, it was going into just one,” said Best. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Kaskawulsh River, seen here near its headwaters, is running higher now thanks to the addition of water that used to flow into the Slims River. Photograph: Jim Best/University of Illinois While the Slims had been reduced to a mere trickle, the reverse had happened to the south-flowing Alsek river, a popular whitewater rafting river that is a Unesco world heritage site. The previous year, the two rivers had been comparable in size, but the Alsek was now 60 to 70 times larger than the Slims, flow measurements revealed. The data also showed how abrupt the change had been, with the Slims’ flow dropping precipitously from the 26 to 29 May 2016. Geologists have previously found evidence of river piracy having taken place in the distant past. “But nobody to our knowledge has documented it happening in our lifetimes,” said Shugar. “People had looked at the geological record, thousands or millions of years ago, not the 21st century, where it’s happening under our noses.” Prof Lonnie Thompson, a paleoclimatologist at Ohio State University who was not involved in the work, said the observations highlight how incremental temperature increases can produce sudden and drastic environmental impacts. “There are definitely thresholds which, once passed in nature, everything abruptly changes,” he said. Glacier melt shows a climate change tipping point. We must pay attention | Wendell Tangborn Read more Between 1956 and 2007, the Kaskawulsh glacier retreated by 600-700m. In 2016, there was a sudden acceleration of the retreat, and the pulse of meltwater led to a new channel being carved through a large ice field. The new channel was able to deliver water to the Alsek’s tributary whose steeper gradient resulted in the Slims headwater being suddenly rerouted along a new southwards trajectory. In a geological instant, the local landscape was redrawn. Where the Slims once flowed, Dall sheep from Kluane National Park are now making their way down to eat the fresh vegetation, venturing into territory where they can legally be hunted. The formerly clear air is now often turned into a dusty haze as powerful winds whip up the exposed riverbed sediment. Fish populations are being redistributed and lake chemistry is being altered. Waterfront land, which includes the small communities of Burwash Landing and Destruction Bay, is now further from shore. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sections of the newly exposed bed of Kluane Lake contain small pinnacles. Wind has eroded sediments with a harder layer on top that forms a protective cap as the wind erodes softer and sandier sediment below. These pinnacles, just a few centimeters high, are small-scale versions of what are sometimes termed “hoodoos.” Photograph: Jim Best/University of Illinois A statistical analysis, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, suggests that the dramatic changes can almost certainly be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. The calculations put chance of the piracy having occured due to natural variability at 0.5%. “So it’s 99.5% that it occurred due to warming over the industrial era,” said Best. The Yukon region is extremely sparsely inhabited, but future river piracy could have catastrophic effects on towns, villages and ecosystems that have sprung up around available water, according to an analysis accompanying the paper, by Rachel Headley, a geologist at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. “If a river changes course so drastically that the drainage basin no longer reaches its original outlet, this change might eventually impact human and biological communities that have grown around the river’s original outlet,” she said. Thompson, who has documented glacial retreat on Mount Kilimanjaro, predicts that there will be an acceleration in the observations of river piracy events as glaciers retreat globally. “I think we could see similar divergence in streams in the Himalayas as well as throughout the Third Pole region, the Andes of Peru, other sites in northern Canada and Alaska,” he said. “Often these events occur in remote and poor parts of our planet and thus go largely unnoticed by the larger population but greatly impact the livelihood of many families downstream.” ||||| Images captured by the European Space Agency's Sentinel2 satellite in 2015 and 2016 show a dramatic drop in the Slims River's flow.

Credit: European Space Agency The massive Kaskawulsh Glacier in northern Canada has retreated about a mile up its valley over the past century. Last spring, its retreat triggered a geologic event at relatively breakneck speed. The toe of ice that was sending meltwater toward the Slims River and then north to the Bering Sea retreated so far that the water changed course, joining the Kaskawulsh River and flowing south toward the Gulf of Alaska. This capture of one river's flow by another, documented in a study led by the University of Washington Tacoma and published April 17 in Nature Geoscience, is the first known case of \\"river piracy\\" in modern times. \\"Geologists have seen river piracy, but nobody to our knowledge has documented it happening in our lifetimes,\\" said lead author Dan Shugar, a geoscientist at the University of Washington Tacoma. \\"People had looked at the geological record—thousands or millions of years ago—not the 21st century, where it's happening under our noses.\\" River piracy, also known as stream capture, can happen due to tectonic motion of Earth's crust, landslides, erosion or, in this case, changes in a glacial dam. The new study documents one of the less-anticipated shifts that can occur in a changing climate. A Sept. 2, 2016 aerial photo shows the meltwater stream along the toe of Kaskawulsh Glacier, seen on the left, that is diverting fresh water from one river to the other. Credit: Dan Shugar/University of Washington Tacoma Shugar and co-authors Jim Best at the University of Illinois and John Clague at Canada's Simon Fraser University had planned fieldwork last summer on the Slims River, a geologically active system that feeds Kluane Lake in the Yukon. When they arrived in August, the river was not flowing. River gauges show an abrupt drop over four days from May 26 to 29, 2016. By late summer, \\"there was barely any flow whatsoever. It was essentially a long, skinny lake,\\" Shugar said. \\"The water was somewhat treacherous to approach, because you're walking on these old river sediments that were really goopy and would suck you in. And day by day we could see the water level dropping.\\" The research team puzzled about what to do next. They got permission to use their mapping drone to create a detailed elevation model of the glacier tongue and headwater region. The resulting paper is a geological postmortem of the river's disappearance. \\"For the last 300 years, Slims River flowed out to the Bering Sea, and the smaller Kaskawulsh River flowed to the Gulf of Alaska. What we found was the glacial lake that fed Slims River had actually changed its outlet,\\" Shugar said. \\"A 30-meter (100-foot) canyon had been carved through the terminus of the glacier. Meltwater was flowing through that canyon from one lake into another glacial lake, almost like when you see champagne poured into glasses that are stacked in a pyramid.\\" A close-up view of the ice-walled canyon at the terminus of the Kaskawulsh Glacier, with recently collapsed ice blocks. This canyon now carries almost all meltwater from the toe of the glacier down the Kaskawulsh Valley and toward the Gulf of Alaska. Credit: Jim Best/University of Illinois That second lake drains via the Kaskawulsh River in a different direction than the first. The situation is fairly unique, Shugar said, since the glacier's toe was sitting on a geologic divide. Clague began studying this glacier years ago for the Geological Survey of Canada. He observed that Kluane Lake, which is Yukon's largest lake, had changed its water level by about 40 feet (12 meters) a few centuries ago. He concluded that the Slims River that feeds it had appeared as the glacier advanced, and a decade ago predicted the river would disappear again as the glacier retreated. \\"The event is a bit idiosyncratic, given the peculiar geographic situation in which it happened, but in a broader sense it highlights the huge changes that glaciers are undergoing around the world due to climate change,\\" Clague said. The geologic event has redrawn the local landscape. Slims River crosses the Alaska Highway, and its banks were a popular hiking route. Now that the riverbed is exposed, Dall sheep from Kluane National Park are making their way down to eat the fresh vegetation, venturing into territory where they can legally be hunted. With less water flowing in, Kluane Lake did not refill last spring, and by summer 2016 was about 3 feet (1 meter) lower than ever recorded for that time of year. Waterfront land, which includes the small communities of Burwash Landing and Destruction Bay, is now farther from shore. As the lake level continues to drop researchers expect this will become an isolated lake cut off from any outflow. The Kaskawulsh River as it exits the lower terminus of Kaskawulsh glacier and lakes. The river has gained new discharge since its piracy of the Slims River waters in 2016, and now flows into the Kaskawulsh valley with increased flows.

Shifts in sediment transport, lake chemistry, fish populations, wildlife behavior and other factors will continue to occur as the ecosystem adjusts to the new reality, Shugar said. \\"So far, a lot of the scientific work surrounding glaciers and climate change has been focused on sea-level rise,\\" Shugar said. \\"Our study shows there may be other underappreciated, unanticipated effects of glacial retreat.\\" The Kaskawulsh Glacier is retreating up the valley because of both readjustment after a cold period centuries ago, known as the Little Ice Age, and warming due to greenhouse gases. A technique published in 2016 by UW co-author Gerard Roe shows a 99.5 percent probability that this glacier's retreat is showing the effects of modern climate change. \\"I always point out to climate-change skeptics that Earth's glaciers are becoming markedly smaller, and that can only happen in a warming climate,\\" Clague said.

Stream piracy has been investigated in glacial environments, but so far it has mainly been studied over Quaternary or longer timescales. Here we document how retreat of Kaskawulsh Glacier—one of Canada’s largest glaciers—abruptly and radically altered the regional drainage pattern in spring 2016. We use a combination of hydrological measurements and drone-generated digital elevation models to show that in late May 2016, meltwater from the glacier was re-routed from discharge in a northward direction into the Bering Sea, to southward into the Pacific Ocean. Based on satellite image analysis and a signal-to-noise ratio as a metric of glacier retreat, we conclude that this instance of river piracy was due to post-industrial climate change. Rapid regional drainage reorganizations of this type can have profound downstream impacts on ecosystems, sediment and carbon budgets, and downstream communities that rely on a stable and sustained discharge. We suggest that the planforms of Slims and Kaskawulsh rivers will adjust in response to altered flows, and the future Kaskawulsh watershed will extend into the now-abandoned headwaters of Slims River and eventually capture the Kluane Lake drainage. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A huge river that flowed from one of Canada's largest glaciers disappeared in just four days last year due to the retreat of glacier ice, in the first ever observed case of \\"river piracy\\". The Slims River, which was 150 meters wide at some points, had its flow redirected into another river due to intense melting of the Kaskawulsh glacier. Researchers say the dramatic shift can be attributed to climate change, with a 99.5% probability, and warn that similar events could have a devastating impact on towns, villages, and ecosystems that rely on available water sources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Instead, the sentence describes an activity that the woman is actively engaged in, which is creating beautiful native pottery outdoors. Logically, a person cannot be both asleep and actively creating pottery simultaneously. When someone is asleep, they are in a state of rest and are not conscious or actively involved in any activities. In the context of the statement provided, the woman is creating pottery, which requires conscious effort, physical involvement, and active participation in the task.

Information: - Edmond Gareginovich Keosayan (9 October 1936 21 April 1994) was an Armenian Soviet film director and musician. - Mosfilm (\\"Mosfilm\\" ) is a film studio that is among the largest and oldest in the Russian Federation and in Europe. Its output includes most of the more widely acclaimed Soviet-era films, ranging from works by Andrei Tarkovsky and Sergei Eisenstein (commonly considered the greatest Soviet directors), to Red Westerns, to the Akira Kurosawa co-production \\"Dersu Uzala\\" (') and the epic \\"War and Peace\\" ('). - The Ostern (Eastern) or Red Western (also known as \\"Borscht Western\\") was the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries' take on the Western. The term refers to two related genres: - Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II, with the popular action film \\"Sanshiro Sugata\\" (a.k.a. \\"Judo Saga\\"). After the war, the critically acclaimed \\"Drunken Angel\\" (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films. His wife Yko Yaguchi was also an actress in one of his films. - The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. Armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000-12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians. The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen. - The Elusive Avengers (translit. \\"Neulovimye mstiteli\\") is a 1967 Soviet adventure film directed by Edmond Keosayan and made by Mosfilm. It is loosely based on the novel Little Red Devils by Pavel Blyakhin, under its original name. The film is an example of Ostern, set in Russian Civil War era Ukraine. - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south. - The New Adventures of the Elusive Avengers ( Russian : , translit . Novye prikluchenya Neulovimykh ) is a 1968 Soviet action movie , a sequel of The Elusive Avengers , directed by Edmond Keosayan and made on Mosfilm . The movie was followed by The Crown of the Russian Empire , or Once Again the Elusive Avengers released in 1971 . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Crown of the Russian Empire, or Once Again the Elusive Avengers (translit. \\"Korona Rossiyskoy Imperii, ili Snova Neulovimye\\") is a 1971 Soviet action movie, a second sequel of \\"The Elusive Avengers\\", directed by Edmond Keosayan and made on Mosfilm.

It is not connected well and eventually fell apart. It did work great for about 5 months. Time to figure out how I can get this fixed. Hopefully it will not have to become landfill. Answer:","completion":"The given review will decrease the chances of buying the product. Reasoning: 1. The reviewer mentions that the product worked great only for about 5 months.

It doesn't heat up and merely spirts out water. This indicates a significant flaw, which can be a deterrent for the purchase. 3. The problem appears to be connected with the weak cord of the product. In the reviewer's opinion, it is not made very sturdy nor attached properly, which led to it coming apart after some use. This shows a clear issue with the product's build quality. 4. Lastly, the reviewer expresses frustration about trying to fix the product and hoping it doesn't end up as waste.

Help as much as you can. You are given a new situation: In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get. and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Please answer this question : Which lake will have less algae? Answer:","completion":"Lake Costanza will have less algae. Since this lake is situated in an area that hardly gets any rain, there will be less dissolved fertilizer runoff from the adjacent farm entering the lake. Consequently, there will be less nitrogen available in the water to promote algae growth.

Passage: The nonprofit landscape is highly varied, although many people have come to associate NPOs with charitable organizations. Although charities do comprise an often high profile or visible aspect of the sector, there are many other types of nonprofits. Overall, they tend to be either member-serving or community-serving. Member-serving organizations include mutual societies, cooperatives, trade unions, credit unions, industry associations, sports clubs, retired serviceman's clubs and peak bodies – organizations that benefit a particular group of people i.e. the members of the organization. Typically, community-serving organizations are focused on providing services to the community in general, either globally or locally: organizations delivering human services programs or projects, aid and development programs, medical research, education and health services, and so on. It could be argued many nonprofits sit across both camps, at least in terms of the impact they make. For example, the grassroots support group that provides a lifeline to those with a particular condition or disease could be deemed to be serving both its members (by directly supporting them) and the broader community (through the provision of a helping service for fellow citizens).

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: You are given a new situation: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory. and a hint : From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. Please answer this question : Which tetrapod would live longer, tetA or tetB? The answer is:","completion":"Based on Aristotle's theory of tetrapods, the tetrapod that would live longer is tetA. The reasoning behind this conclusion is as follows: 1. TetA is heavier than tetB in terms of adult body mass. 2. According to Aristotle's theory, an increase in body mass is associated with an increase in lifespan. Hence, a heavier tetrapod, such as tetA, is expected to live longer than a lighter tetrapod, like tetB. 3. TetA also has a longer gestation period compared to tetB. 4. Aristotle's theory states that lifespan increases with gestation period. Therefore, the fact that tetA has a longer gestation period further supports the idea that it would have a longer lifespan compared to tetB. So, considering both the body mass and gestation period factors, it can be concluded that tetA is expected to live longer than tetB based on Aristotle's theory of tetrapods."},{"prompt":"Given this review: \\"Not responding\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Perfect for your holidays in northern Africa\\" can be translated to: \\"Riad in Tanger, Marokko zur Ferienmiete. Perfekt für Ihren Urlaub in Nordafrika.\\" Let's break down the translation: 1. \\"Riad in Tangiers, Morocco\\" - \\"Riad in Tanger, Marokko\\": A \\"Riad\\" is a traditional Moroccan house or palace with an interior garden or courtyard. It's an accommodation option very popular in Morocco, so we keep the term \\"Riad\\" in the translation. Tangiers is a city in Morocco, and in German, it is referred to as \\"Tanger\\". Morocco translates to \\"Marokko\\" in German. 2. \\"for holiday rental\\" - \\"zur Ferienmiete\\": The term \\"holiday rental\\" refers to renting a place specifically for vacation purposes. In German, this can be expressed as \\"Ferienmiete\\" (vacation rental). 3. \\"Perfect for your holidays\\" - \\"Perfekt für Ihren Urlaub\\": \\"Perfect\\" translates to \\"perfekt\\" in German. The phrase \\"for your holidays\\" translates to \\"für Ihren Urlaub\\". In German, \\"Urlaub\\" refers to vacation or holidays. 4. \\"in northern Africa\\" - \\"in Nordafrika\\": Lastly, \\"northern Africa\\" is translated as \\"Nordafrika\\" in German.

Bristol Swings for the Fence, Misses Bristol-Myers Squibb has succeeded in recent years by swinging for the fences. But it just whiffed on a big pitch, to the delight of its rival Merck. Both companies make similar drugs that help the body's immune system fight tumors. They seem to work far better in patients whose cancers express a large amount of a certain protein the drugs target, called PD-L1. Merck has focused narrowly on testing for and treating such patients with its drug, Keytruda. Bristol, on the other hand, has targeted a much broader set of patients, and its drug can be used without advance testing. That has helped its drug, Opdivo, get a big sales lead -- it outsold Keytruda by more than 500 million in the second quarter. But in one of the biggest possible treatment markets, newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung cancer, Bristol's approach has fallen flat. The company announced Friday morning that Opdivo had failed in its Phase 3 trial for the disease. Merck announced far better results for its approach in June. Bristol's shares were down 17 percent Friday morning, while Merck's were up 6 percent. After Bristol-Myers' risky clinical trial strategy blew up in its face, Merck will beat the firm to market in a huge set of lung cancer patients. Intraday times are displayed in ET. Before Friday, the big unknown about Bristol's trial was exactly how aggressive it was about patient selection. Really aggressive, it turns out! Merck's study was restricted to patients whose tumors had at least 50 percent PD-L1 expression. Bristol's cutoff , in contrast, was just 5 percent. If its approach had worked, then it might have gotten approval for treatment of a much wider population, cementing Opdivo's commercial dominance. Instead it now faces an uncertain future in this treatment area -- its approval for use on its own in newly diagnosed patients could be long-delayed or abandoned altogether. In a way, it made sense for Bristol to chase a wider patient population, an approach that has worked for it so far. But in this case, given the size of the potential market, it could have afforded to be more cautious. There's a whole lot of still-lucrative space between five and fifty percent PD-L1 expression. The cost of its gamble is a 33 billion total swing in market cap between it and Merck. The news is vindication for Merck's caution. In the face of Opdivo's more-rapid sales growth, Merck has steadfastly maintained that focusing on the most promising patient population was the correct strategy. Now Merck's likely approval in newly diagnosed patients should narrow the sales gap with Opdivo. Bristol Myers' Opdivo has thrashed Merck's similar medicine, but a setback in a key clinical trial may begin to change that. The long-term impact for Bristol is harder to nail down. Opdivo has a head start in many other treatment areas, particularly in trials of combinations with other drugs. Bristol is testing Opdivo alongside chemotherapy and another immuno-oncology drug, hoping it will make it effective in an even broader set of patients. Data may come as early as next year, and approval would give Opdivo sales another boost. Then again, AstraZeneca expects to have data from a similar combination trial first. Either way, Merck is likely to have a leg up in a big market. Bristol should take this lesson to heart and try hitting for average once in a while.

In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get. Which lake will have less dead zones? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that lake Costanza will likely have less dead zones. This is because the farm adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all. As a result, there will be less rainwater dissolving fertilizer in the soil and causing runoff that carries the fertilizer into the lake. With less fertilizer in the water, there will be less nitrogen available for algae to grow out of control, which in turn reduces the chances of creating dead zones due to low oxygen levels. In contrast, the farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis, leading to more runoff and potentially more dead zones in the lake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hong Kong Pulls Out of Recession HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's economy broke out of a yearlong recession in the second quarter as the territory benefited from strong growth in mainland China and better conditions in the West, the government said Friday. The southern Chinese territory's economy, slammed four straight quarters by free-falling world demand for exports, grew by 3.3 percent on a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, the government said. With the global economy starting to level out, Hong Kong made a less pessimistic forecast for all of 2009, saying gross domestic product was set to shrink between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent rather than 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent. \\"As the global economy is still subject to uncertainties, we cannot afford to be complacent,\\" said Hong Kong's Financial Secretary John Tsang. Higher demand for Hong Kong's exports, particularly from mainland China, where massive stimulus spending and relaxed monetary policy is driving growth, helped explain the turnaround. Exports dropped 12.4 percent in the second quarter compared to the same period last year, the government said. That was tamer than the nearly 23 percent drop-off in the first quarter. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Hong Kong's economy emerged from a yearlong recession in the second quarter due to strong growth in mainland China and improved conditions in the West.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit","completion":"The review \\"aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit\\" can be interpreted as having a negative opinion of the movie. Let's break down the review to better understand the sentiment behind it. The phrase \\"aims for the toilet\\" is an analogy suggesting that the quality, content, or ambitions of the movie are comparable to something low or unpleasant. This can imply that the movie failed to achieve what it set out to do, or that it was of a distasteful nature. When a reviewer considers a film to be in line with something as unrefined as a toilet, it showcases a negative perspective on the work. The second part of the review, \\"scores a direct hit,\\" dials in on the effectiveness of the movie in terms of leaving the intended impression. In this specific context, the fact that the movie achieves its goal of being associated with something unpalatable speaks volumes about the reviewer's low opinion of the film. Scoring a direct hit in this scenario means that the movie effectively managed to fully immerse itself in the unpleasant territory, leaving the reviewer with a poor perception of the work. So, combining the two elements of the review, we see a picture of a movie that the reviewer believes to have aimed for low and distasteful ambitions, and, unfortunately, it succeeded in doing so. As a result, it is clear that the review presents a negative opinion of the movie."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Q: Passage: The Buccaneers played a more consistent game, but still came up short in Buffalo. After scoring early in the third quarter, Buffalo took a 17-6 lead. After another Bills field goal, and two touchdown passes from Jameis Winston to rookie tight-end O. J. Howard, the game was tied, 20-20. With just over 3 minutes remaining in regulation, another touchdown pass by Winston, this time a diving catch just inbounds by Mike Evans gave the Buccaneers a 27-20 lead. On the next drive, the Bills drove down the field in three plays to tie the game, aided by an ill-timed 15-yard Unnecessary Roughness penalty by Robert McClain. With 2:20 left in the fourth, a pass from Winston to Adam Humphries was fumbled and recovered by the Bills at Tampa Bay 32-yard line.

The Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (1914): The murder of Archduke Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, by a Bosnian Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip might have seemed a minor event at the time. However, it ultimately began a chain of events that led to World War I, the collapse of several European empires, and set the stage for World War II. 2. The Discovery of Penicillin (1928): Alexander Fleming's chance discovery of penicillin, the first antibiotic, revolutionized medicine and saved countless lives by providing an effective treatment for bacterial infections. The discovery of penicillin led to the development of many other antibiotics, which have since become an essential part of modern healthcare. 3. Rosa Parks' Bus Stand (1955): In 1955, Rosa Parks, an African American woman, refused to give up her bus seat for a white passenger, leading to her arrest for violating segregation laws. This seemingly small act of defiance sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott and fueled the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, leading to significant changes in racial equality and integration. 4. The Invention of the World Wide Web (1989): The creation of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN may have initially seemed insignificant, but it revolutionized the way information is shared and accessed across the globe. It has since transformed nearly every aspect of modern life, from communication to commerce to social interactions. 5. An Apple Falling From a Tree (Late 17th Century): The story goes that Isaac Newton was inspired to form his theory of gravitation after witnessing an apple falling from a tree. This simple observation led Newton to develop his groundbreaking ideas on gravity, motion, and the laws that govern the universe.

Process: - Food is put into mouth - Food is chewed and mixed with saliva (spit) - Food travels down the esophagus (throat) - Food travels into the stomach - Acid in the stomach breaks the food down further - Food travels into the small intestine - Nutrients from food are absorbed into the blood stream - Food travels into the large intestine - Most of the remaining material is now waste - The waste is eventually removed from the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less food is put into the mouth happens, how will it affect less food travels to the small intestine. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis proposes that if less food is put into the mouth, it will affect the amount of food that travels to the small intestine. This can indeed have several direct and indirect effects on the digestive process. Direct Effects: 1. Reduced Caloric Intake: Consuming less food can directly result in a lower caloric intake. This can lead to weight loss or insufficient energy levels depending on the individual's daily energy requirements. As the small intestine is responsible for absorbing nutrients, less food would mean fewer nutrients available for absorption. 2. Limited Nutrient Absorption: If less food makes it to the small intestine, it can result in a shortage of essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates, and fats. These nutrients are crucial for maintaining bodily functions, supporting the immune system, growth, and overall health. 3. Changes in Stomach Functionality: Since less food enters the stomach, the stomach produces a lesser amount of acid, hormones, and enzymes. This can result in changes in the overall functionality and efficiency of the stomach, such as slowed gastric emptying, which may in turn impact the total time food spends in the small intestine, as well as the large intestine. Indirect Effects: 1. Altered Appetite and Satiety: As less food is consumed, the individual may experience alterations in appetite and satiety signals. This could make it challenging to maintain a balanced diet, affecting metabolism and energy levels. 2. Impact on Gut Microbiome: The reduced intake of food can indirectly affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Each type of food we consume has a different effect on the microbes in our digestive system. A decreased food intake may lead to a less diverse gut microbiota, which could negatively impact digestion, immunity, and overall health. 3. Emotional and Psychological Consequences: Eating habits are often intertwined with emotions and psychological well-being. A significant change in food consumption can lead to mood imbalances, stress, or even disordered eating patterns. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis states that if less food is put into the mouth, it will have a direct effect on the amount of food traveling into the small intestine. This can directly reduce the caloric content and limit nutrient absorption, while indirectly impacting appetite, satiety signals, gut microbiome composition, and an individual's emotional and psychological well-being."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

It includes replicating the equations that govern how aircraft fly, how they react to applications of flight controls, the effects of other aircraft systems, and how the aircraft reacts to external factors such as air density, turbulence, wind shear, cloud, precipitation, etc. Flight simulation is used for a variety of reasons, including flight training (mainly of pilots), the design and development of the aircraft itself, and research into aircraft characteristics and control handling qualities. - The user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of humancomputer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology. - Betrayal at Krondor is a DOS-based role-playing video game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line in the summer of 1993. \\"Betrayal at Krondor\\" takes place largely in Midkemia, the fantasy world developed by Raymond E.

Its first products were cartridges for the Atari 2600 video console system published from July 1980 for the US market and from August 1981 for the international market (UK). - The concept of video games as a form of art is a controversial topic within the entertainment industry. Though video games have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the Supreme Court of the United States, the philosophical proposition that video games are works of art remains in question, even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as graphics, storytelling and music. Even art games, games purposely designed to be a work of creative expression, have been challenged as works of art by some critics. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor.

Premise: and his name is B J and Hypothesis: people call him B J, and in addition Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The task given is to analyze the given premise and hypothesis to determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. To carry out this task, we'll first break down the components of each statement and then examine their relationship. Premise: \\"and his name is B J\\" Hypothesis: \\"people call him B J, and in addition\\" In the premise, we are given a piece of information that someone's name is \\"B J.\\" However, the full context and subject is unclear due to the introductory conjunction \\"and\\" that suggests this statement is connected to another piece of information not provided here. Nevertheless, the main point is that there is a person whose name is \\"B J.\\" In the hypothesis, we are given two distinct pieces of information which we can break down further: 1. \\"people call him B J\\" 2. \\"and in addition\\" The first part of the hypothesis states that \\"people call him B J.\\" This provides us with some information about the social aspect where the person goes by the name \\"B J.\\" Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and this first component of the hypothesis. While the premise establishes that the person's name is \\"B J,\\" the hypothesis makes an assertion about how people refer to this person. In some cases, a person's given name might not be the same as what they are called by others (for instance, they could have a nickname). However, in this case, the name \\"B J\\" is the same in both the premise and the first part of the hypothesis. Therefore, we can infer a connection between the premise and this portion of the hypothesis. The second part of the hypothesis, \\"and in addition,\\" is an expression typically used to introduce further information. However, there is no additional information provided here, which leaves this part of the hypothesis incomplete and ambiguous. Consequently, this section does not have any direct or clear relationship with the premise. In summary, the premise appears to partially entail the hypothesis as it supports the claim that the person is called \\"B J\\" by others, but it does not provide any information or connection to the incomplete second part of the hypothesis (\\"and in addition\\"). So, while there is a connection between the premise and the first part of the hypothesis, the overall relationship between the premise and the entire hypothesis is not entirely entailed due to the ambiguity of the second part."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: The 4-year-old boy was mentally disabled, unable to speak in complete sentences and unable to play with other children because of his violent fits of hitting and biting. The decision facing one Brooklyn jury was how much a landlord should pay in damages to the boy -- named \\"G.M.M.\\" in court documents -- after an investigation showed he had been living in an apartment illegally coated with lead paint. Attorneys representing G.M.M. said 3.4 million was the right number, arguing that the boy would have had a bright career ahead of him; both of his parents had graduated from college and his mother received a master's degree. But the landlord's defense put the figure at less than half that -- 1.5 million. Attorney Roger Archibald noted that because the boy was Hispanic, G.M.M. was unlikely to attain the advanced education that would provide to such a large income. The 4-year-old's case is a rare public look at one corner of the American legal system that explicitly uses race and gender to determine how much victims or their families should receive in compensation when they are seriously injured or killed. As a result, white and male victims often receive larger awards than people of color and women in similar cases. These differences largely derive from _ of how much more money individuals would have earned over their lifetimes had they not been injured -- projections that take into account average earnings and employment levels by race and gender.

By. Daily Mail Reporter. UPDATED:. 10:31 EST, 13 October 2011. A cargo ship which spilled hundreds of tons of oil remained perched on a New Zealand reef today, as locals descended on a nearby beach to scavenge from the vessel's washed-up load. Salvage crews are still debating whether the remaining fuel on the Liberian-flagged Rena can be pumped from the ship before it breaks up. And as rescue crews tried to stabilise the ship, local residents in Tauranga, New Zealand, have been spotted inspecting the containers of cargo and surveying the disaster from the shore. Assessing the damage: Two residents walk along the beach inspecting the washed-up cargo from the Rena vessel in Taurange, New Zealand today. Surveying the scene: More locals flock to the shore where containers from the Rena washed up. Further inspection of the washed-up cargo showed the beach littered with thousands of part-cooked meat patties from one of the Rena's containers. But anyone hoping for a valuable haul from the stricken vessel would have turned up disappointed - as the Rena mainly shed thousands of partly-cooked burgers on to the sand. The ship itself is being slowly battered to pieces by pounding waves, with rescuers needing to stabilise the Rena before any oil transfer can start. Environmentalists have warned of a disaster for wildlife if all the ship's 1,870 tons (1,700 metric tons) of oil and 220 tons (200 metric tons) of diesel is allowed to spill into the ocean. Crews attempting to start the salvage effort have also been hampered by the severe structural damage sustained on the vessel. Other items from the containers washed up in Tauranga, New Zealand included these deer skins. As another container washed up on the beach at Mt Maunganui, New Zealand, rescuers were trying to get near the vessel to transfer away its oil. Meanwhile, several of the 88 containers that have fallen off its deck had washed ashore by Thursday, and authorities confirmed one container that toppled overboard contained a hazardous substance. However, an official said it should not pose a major threat. Heavy seas had kept salvage crews away from the 775-foot (236-meter) vessel for days, but a break in the weather allowed three team members to be winched aboard the Liberian-flagged Rena, which ran aground Oct 5 on Astrolabe Reef, 14 miles (22 kilometers) from Tauranga Harbour on New Zealand's North Island. Clean up: Soldiers work to clear away the oil spill from the beach in Taurange, New Zealand, as environmentalists warned of a potential wildlife disaster. In trouble: Rescuers have been unable to properly reach the ship due to the severe structural damage it has suffered. Mystery: Investigators have so been unable to explain how the vessel managed to perch itself on the New Zealand reef, as the ship remains in danger of spilling more oil and containers. Ewart Barnsley, spokesman for Maritime New Zealand which is managing the emergency response, said the salvage crew found oil hoses and pumps for transferring fuel largely undamaged aboard the ship. They also concluded that the ship was safe to work from. Barnsley said a barge was moored nearby to receive oil, but a decision on when that transfer might start would not be made before Friday. Marine New Zealand salvage manager Bruce Anderson said the vessel needed to stop moving before the oil could be pumped out and it apparently had. 'While this is good news, we shouldn't get too excited,' Anderson told reporters. 'We already had a complex project to start with; it's even harder now that we've sustained damage aboard this vessel,' he said, referring to recent structural cracking. A vertical crack in the ship runs around the entire vessel - meaning the ship is now only held together by its internal components, said Steve Jones, another spokesman for Maritime New Zealand. 'The reality is the vessel could break up at any point,' Jones told The Associated Press. Six vessels have been mobilized to intercept the drifting containers and other debris in the water. There were 1,368 containers on board, 11 of which contained hazardous substances, Maritime New Zealand said. One of the hazardous containers is among those that have fallen overboard, Jones said. Agency spokesman Nick Bohm said the. container held alkyl sulfonic acid, which can be harmful in its original. state, but becomes less toxic when diluted with water. The whereabouts. of that container are unknown. Some. of the contents of containers that had washed ashore were strewn across. the coastline on Thursday, including thousands of meat patties that. littered the sand. The. ship's 44-year-old Filipino captain was charged Wednesday with operating. a vessel in a manner causing unnecessary danger or risk and was. released on bail Wednesday at Tauranga District Court. Potential disaster: An aerial view of the stranded cargo vessel Rena shows the boat listing to one side and patches of oil leaking from its storage tanks. Clean-up: A shag covered in oil is helped by wildlife veterinarian Dr Brett Gartrell and Aimee Forster at the wildlife rehabilitation facility in Tauranga, New Zealand. Concern: The size of the oil spill from the Rena can clearly been seen in this image. The ship's second officer appeared in the same court Thursday on the same charge. Judge Robert Wolff made orders suppressing publication of the defendants' names for the sake of their personal safety. If convicted, each could face a fine of up to 10,000 New Zealand dollars (7,800) and 12 months in prison. Their next court appearance is Oct. 19, when authorities say more charges are likely. The government has demanded to know why the ship crashed into the well-charted reef in calm weather, but the vessel's owner, Greece-based Costamare Inc., has given no explanation. On Thursday, Costamare released a statement apologizing for the incident and said it was investigating how the ship could have run aground. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"This article talks about a cargo ship called Rena which spilled a lot of oil into the ocean near New Zealand. The ship got stuck on a reef and some of its containers fell into the water and washed up on the beach. People who lived nearby went to the beach to see what was inside the containers. Most of them found part-cooked meat patties (like burgers) and deer skins. Experts are worried that the oil spill could harm animals and the environment. They are trying to remove the remaining oil from the ship and clean up the mess it left behind.

Step 2: Evaluate the options - Option A: Glove - Yes, this is a plausible place where a finger can be warm. When we wear gloves, they provide insulation and keep our fingers warm. Option B: Ring - While a ring goes on the finger, it does not typically provide warmth. Option C: Cake Batter to Taste Add Weight to Scale - This option seems to lack coherence and logic as it does not point to a place where a finger can be warm. Option D: Nose - While it's possible to put a finger in a nose, it's not a context where the finger would typically be warm.

These two cities are on opposite sides of the planet, but both wildfires are nearly identical in terms of scope and intensity. So, when it's daytime in Milton, it's nighttime in Parth. New firefighters in Milton are currently arriving at the scene of the fire as the sun beats down directly above them. They are getting instructions from their boss about what they need to do today and preparing themselves for a long day. But I can use this background: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. What is an answer for this question: Are air currents in Parth traveling uphill or downhill? Answer:","completion":"Air currents in Parth are traveling downhill.

We're five minutes into the movie when Nick reaches for the remote and says, “Let's fast forward to my part.” I reply that, in order to adequately critique the movie, I should see it from the beginning. Nick assures me that his scene is self-contained and needs no context. A fight scene plays. Nick pauses and asks, “What did you think?” I look confused and Nick says, “Did you miss me? Let's play it again.” I watch the scene again, but still can't make out Nick. Nick rewinds, plays and pauses. “There I am,” he says, gazing fondly at the screen. Except the screen was gray. No actors. No landscape. Nothing, but gray snow. “What do you think,” he asked, his eyes never leaving the empty screen. At that point, I realized Nick was crazy. “That's great!,” I said. “But look at the time. Time sure flies when you're having fun.” Nick was still staring at the screen with a strange little smile. I stood up. Nick stood up, now not smiling. “You're not going anywhere,” Nick said. It's funny how fear works. I've found that in times of danger, adrenaline supersedes fear.

Since four other states have adopted the law with provisional restrictions concerning narcotics or injuries sustained while committing a felony, these states also use the law but with certain predefined conditions. Combining the number of states with and without restrictions, we have a total count of 38 + 4 = 42 states. Consequently, in the context of the law under discussion, 38 states have embraced it without limitations, whereas the remaining 4 states have implemented it with specific restrictions in place.

Translate to Turkish: Turkey and Iran are the two countries that have been competing for regional influence for centuries ...","completion":"Türkiye ve İran, yüzyıllardır bölgesel etki için rekabet eden iki ülkedir ... The longstanding rivalry often played out in neighboring countries plagued by civil wars or political instability, and it is one of the major driving forces shaping the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. The tensions began in the 16th century during the reign of the Safavids in Iran and the Ottomans in Turkey, with the two empires often clashing over territorial claims. Both countries were trying to impose their own interpretations of Islam on the region, differentiating between Sunni and Shia beliefs. During the 20th century, the tensions have often been amplified by the political and ideological differences between the secular republic established by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in Turkey, and the Islamic Republic forged after the Iranian revolution in 1979. In the recent years, Turkey and Iran have been vying for influence in countries such as Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Yemen, often backing opposing sides in these conflicts. They also differ in their stance on several regional issues such as the political crisis in Qatar, the conflict in Yemen, or the war in Syria. Despite the fierce rivalries, Turkey and Iran have also cooperated on several occasions when their interests happened to align, such as in the case of the Kurdish separatism in both countries. They have also collaborated in the past on economic issues, such as the promotion of trade and investment, or the construction of pipelines for oil and gas. In conclusion, while Turkey and Iran remain regional rivals with diverging interests, it is also important to note that their relationship is dynamic and not entirely antagonistic. Both countries understand the necessity of balancing competition with cooperation in a tumultuous region, and they are also aware that their historical, cultural, and religious ties can serve as a bridge for dialogue and understanding.

Uzun süreli rekabet genellikle iç savaşlar veya politik istikrarsızlıkla zorlu komşu ülkelerde tezahür etmiştir ve Orta Doğu'daki jeopolitik manzarayı şekillendiren önemli güçlerden biridir. Gerilimler, 16. yüzyılda İran'daki Safevi ve Türkiye'deki Osmanlı hakimiyeti döneminde başladı ve iki imparatorluk genellikle toprak talepleri üzerinde anlaşmazlığa düştü. Her iki ülke de bölgeye kendi İslam yorumlarını dayatmak için çabalıyordu, Sünni ve Şii inançları arasında ayrım yapıyordu. 20. yüzyılda gerilimler genellikle Türkiye'de Mustafa Kemal Atatürk tarafından kurulan laik cumhuriyet ile İran devriminden sonra oluşan İslam Cumhuriyeti arasındaki politik ve ideolojik farklılıklar nedeniyle artırdı. Son yıllarda Türkiye ve İran, Irak, Suriye, Afganistan ve Yemen gibi ülkelerde etki için çekişmişlerdir, genellikle bu çatışmalarda karşı tarafları desteklemişlerdir. Ayrıca Katar'daki politik kriz, Yemen'deki çatışma veya Suriye'deki savaş gibi bir dört dörtlük bölgesel meselelerde tutumları da farklıdır. Şiddetli rekabete rağmen, Türkiye ve İran'ın çıkarları aynı şekilde hizmet ettiğinde birçok durumda işbirliği yapmışlardır, örneğin her iki ülkedeki Kürt ayrılıkçılığı durumunda olduğu gibi.

Sonuç olarak, Türkiye ve İran'ın çıkarları ayrı ayrı olmasına rağmen bölgesel rakipler olarak kalmaları, ilişkilerinin dinamik olduğunu ve tamamen düşmanca olmadığını belirtmek de önemlidir.

Background: Nelson Piquet Souto Maior (Portuguese pronunciation: ['newso pi'ke], born August 17, 1952), known as Nelson Piquet, is a Brazilian former racing driver and businessman. Since his retirement, Piquet has been ranked among the greatest Formula One drivers in various motorsport polls. Piquet had a brief career in tennis before losing interest in the sport and subsequently took up karting and hid his identity to prevent his father discovering his hobby. He became the Brazilian national karting champion in 1971-72 and won the Formula Vee championship in 1976. Context: Nelson Piquet and the number 1 went to a stagnating Lotus team in 1988, and his career took a nose dive despite the Camel sponsored Lotus 100T having the same specification Honda V6 turbo that powered the McLarens of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. Nelson, who had 20 wins and 3 World Championships following the 1987 season, began to lose his reputation when he had no wins in 1988, losing his number one status to fellow Brazilian Senna, who won 8 races and the championship for McLaren (Prost won 7 races, while Piquet could only manage three 3rd-place finishes for the season). In early 1988 he resorted to using the media to attack his rivals and gained a reputation as an outspoken \\"loose cannon\\", such as attacking Mansell and his wife, calling Mansell \\"an uneducated blockhead\\" (and insulting his wife's looks), and calling fellow Senna \\"the Sao Paulo taxi driver\\" and stating that he \\"doesn't like women\\". Piquet retracted his comments when both threatened legal action. He also earned the ire of the Tifosi at the San Marino Grand Prix when he said in an interview with Playboy that Scuderia Ferrari might do better as a team if the boss (Enzo Ferrari) was a younger man instead of the 90-year-old one who rarely attended races due to his age and failing health. Piquet claims he was badly misquoted in the interview, which also had him questioning Alain Prost's standing as the best driver in the world. On the official FIA video review of the 1988 season, Piquet left no doubts that the article got it wrong in his comments about Ferrari (saying that at 90, Enzo Ferrari had to be a strong man to run a Formula One team), and that he considered Prost to be the world's best driver. Piquet had a dismal 1989 season, driving a Judd V8-powered Lotus which had 125 less hp than the Honda V10s used by McLaren. He (and teammate Satoru Nakajima) once again had no wins and they both even failed to qualify for the 1989 Belgian Grand Prix, Piquet's first non-qualification since the 1982 Detroit Grand Prix. On what was his last attempt to qualify at Spa, Piquet lost his chance when he was slowed by rookie Frenchman Olivier Grouillard, who had gained a reputation throughout the season as a blocker. Question: what was the highlight of his stint with lotus? Answer:","completion":"The highlight of Nelson Piquet's stint with Lotus was securing three 3rd-place finishes during the 1988 season, despite driving the less competitive Camel sponsored Lotus 100T car. These podium finishes were notable achievements given the challenges Piquet faced with the car, as well as the intense competition from his fellow drivers, like Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

There was almost no air pollution at all in Switzerland, while the air in India was almost impossible to breathe it was so polluted. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country had more children affected by air pollution? Hint: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment.

(CNN) -- At the request of the government of India, the United States will withdraw one official from its embassy in New Delhi over tensions involving a case surrounding an Indian diplomat. The decision comes as Devyani Khobragade, whose December arrest and strip search in New York strained ties between New Delhi and Washington, headed back to India. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said she hopes this will help gain closure in the incident.

Make this lower case","completion":"Icebergs, when discussed in terms of their shapes and sizes, can be described as highly diverse masses of ice that vary greatly in dimensions and appearances. They are created when chunks of ice break off from glaciers, ice shelves, or sometimes even an ice cap, and commence their journey floating in open waters. Icebergs come in four primary classifications based on their sizes: small, medium, large, and very large. Small icebergs, also known as \\"growlers\\" or \\"bergy bits,\\" typically have a size range of less than 5 meters (16 feet) in length or height. Medium-sized icebergs measure between 5-15 meters (16-49 feet) and are often deemed most suitable for scientific research or exploration purposes, while large icebergs reach up to 45 meters (148 feet) in height. Finally, very large icebergs far exceed the other categories, with some spanning over 75 meters (246 feet) in height. The shapes of icebergs can be just as diverse as their sizes. They are often influenced by several factors, including the composition and structure of the initial ice mass, the rate of melting, the environmental conditions of the area, and even their own individual history of breaking off, melting, and drifting. Some common shapes include: 1. Tabular icebergs: These are characterized by a flat, tabletop-like surface and steep, nearly vertical sides. They generally break off from ice shelves, often in the Antarctic region. 2. Non-tabular icebergs: These come in several more complex forms, such as: - Pinnacle icebergs: Tall and pointed, often with one or more spires or \\"pinnacles\\" protruding from the water. - Wedge-shaped icebergs: These icebergs are angular, appearing as if two flat sides converge to form a single point or edge. - Dome-shaped icebergs: These have a smooth, dome-like appearance and tend to become more rounded as they continue to melt. - Dry-dock icebergs: Colloquially known as \\"swimming pool\\" icebergs, they are characterized by a natural hollow or opening in their center which fills with meltwater. The variety of iceberg shapes and sizes is an area of particular interest to researchers, as each has its own eco-system and impact on global climate conditions. While these magnificent structures can be quite visually stunning and fascinating, they pose a real concern for sea vessels navigating the area. Despite advancements in modern technology, colossal icebergs still present significant hazards to shipping routes, demanding constant vigilance in the world's colder maritime regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This fictional farm is situated in the fictional village of Ambridge, which is located in the equally fictional county of Borsetshire, in the English countryside. The Archers, first broadcasted by the BBC in 1951, is a staple of British radio programming and is known for its compelling storytelling and realistic portrayal of rural life. Brookfield Farm is a mixed farm, which means that it engages in both crop cultivation and animal husbandry. The farm has been owned and managed by the Archer family for generations, which is why the show is named after them. Throughout the series, listeners have grown familiar with the members of the Archer family and their relationships, both with each other and with the other inhabitants of Ambridge. Over the years, the farm has seen various changes in management, as different characters have taken on new roles and responsibilities. However, the family's close connection to the land and their dedication to maintaining the beauty and productivity of the English countryside remain at the heart of the storylines. Some major characters associated with Brookfield Farm include Dan Archer, the original owner of the farm, and his wife Doris. Their children, Phil and Christine, play significant roles in the show, with Phil taking over the farm after Dan's death. Phil's children, David and Elizabeth, also have central roles in the radio drama, with David eventually taking over the responsibilities of managing the farm.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added. The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\" Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs. Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security. \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\" Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports.

Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, has long said many of those providing care for three and four-year-olds would be unwilling to deliver the 30-hour offer without extra funding. \\"What's most alarming is that these figures were gathered at a time when many providers thought they would be receiving close to the average funding rate of £4.88 per hour,\\" he said. \\"With final rates currently being confirmed across the country, and many providers discovering that they'll be receiving significantly less, we would expect the number of settings opting out of the 30-hour offer to be even higher than these statistics suggest.\\" Local authorities are currently telling their local providers how much they will be paying. Mr Leitch added that the fact that rates were being frozen until 2020 could make things worse because costs such as wages, rents and mortgages were likely to increase significantly. The DfE data shows that there are currently 22,700 pre-schools and nurseries offering 15 hours of free entitlement. But only 14,600 pre-schools and nurseries say they definitely plan to offer the 30 hours. Meanwhile 8,200 primary schools with nurseries currently offer the 15 hours, but only 3,900 say they intend to offer 30 hours. In addition, 350 maintained nursery schools plan to offer the 30 hours, compared with 400 that currently offer the 15 hours. The only provider type likely to see an increase is childminders, with 25,400 planning to offer the 30 hours, compared with 23,600 who currently offer the 15 hours. The figures come not long after research suggested the DfE had significantly underestimated the number of children likely to be eligible for the extra hours offer. But they also suggest that 60% of larger, group-based providers intend to offer the 30 hours. The DfE said in a statement: \\"Since this survey was conducted, we have published our Early Years National Funding Formula, which will see increased hourly funding rates for the vast majority of providers and our Early Implementers are now successfully delivering the offer a year early.\\" A minimum funding level of £4.30 per hour has since been set centrally.

Summarize this article: Photo: AP Donald Trump has announced that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will serve as chairman of his transition team, identifying personnel who would become part of a Trump White House. Christie will be working closely with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose father he sent to prison. Just months ago, Trump accused Christie of having committed a federal crime in covering up the Bridgegate scandal. Now, NBC News reports, Christie will bring “substance” and “seriousness” to the Trump campaign: Sources familiar with the planning say the transition team appointment shows “the role the governor is playing as the serious person around Trump who is trying to provide some discipline” to his growing organization. Christie also continues to act as “a conduit between the establishment and Trump” based on Christie’s relationships with Republican elected officials across the country, sources said. The New York Times reported last week that Kushner—Trump’s son-in-law and a real estate heir in his own right—would be a part of the very forward-looking transition team. (President Obama didn’t announce his Transition Team Chariman until the day after he won the 2008 election.) In 2005, as U.S. Attorney for the state of New Jersey, Christie successfully prosecuted Kushner’s father, Charles, for “crimes of greed, power, and excess.” There does not seem to be any bad blood between Christie and Jared Kushner, however: In November, New Jersey awarded 93 million in tax breaks to a Kushner Companies high-rise in Jersey City. Asked why the Trump campaign was directing press inquiries about the transition committee to the governor’s office, a spokeswoman for Christie told Gawker, “We’re trying to figure that out ourselves.” ||||| If Christie is truly heading Trump’s day-to-day transition effort, the answer to both questions has to be no, said Max Stier, who is chairman of the Partnership for Public Service and has been advising the campaigns on transition planning. “If Christie is going to really run the transition process, he can’t effectively be active in the campaign or be himself a candidate because it’s a full-time job,” Stier said. In 2012, Mitt Romney tapped former Utah Governor Mike Leavitt to run his transition, and Leavitt kept his distance from the campaign while building out what he called a 600-person “government in miniature.” It’s not clear if Trump plans a similar operation. If Christie’s role atop the transition team was more ceremonial, it might be possible for him to split time with the campaign, to stay in contention to be Trump’s running mate—or even to do the job he was elected to perform, governing the state of New Jersey. The announcement came just a few days after The New York Times reported that Trump had asked his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to head up the transition efforts. Kushner was not mentioned in the press release announcing Christie’s new job. If Monday was an early indication, Christie seems to be operating pretty independently from the campaign: A Trump spokeswoman directed questions about his role to Christie’s gubernatorial office, which promptly referred those queries back to Trump’s campaign. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has not publicly announced a transition chief. And the fact that Trump made his own announcement so quickly is at least a momentary relief to those who wondered how seriously he would take the process. “First and foremost, it is really important that Trump has publicly named a transition chairman,” Stier said. “Trump is demonstrating his understanding that he needs to prepare for the possibility that he will be governing at the same time as he is trying to win the campaign.” We want to hear what you think about this article.

Answer the following question: - Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries - The kidneys contain filters inside - The filters capture the waste products - The waste is combined with water to make urine - The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder - The cleaned blood is returned to the body. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process is the delivery of blood to the kidneys through the renal arteries. This is a crucial step in the overall functioning of the urinary system, as it ensures that the blood is continuously circulated through the kidneys for filtration and the removal of waste products. The circulatory system plays a significant role in this step. The heart pumps oxygenated blood throughout the body to supply oxygen and nutrients to the cells and organs. At the same time, it is crucial for the blood to be cleansed of waste materials that are generated by cellular metabolism. This is where the urinary system, including the kidneys, comes into play. The renal arteries branch out from the abdominal aorta, which is the main artery that supplies blood to the abdominal and pelvic organs. These arteries transport oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the kidneys, where the process of filtration begins. When the blood arrives at the kidneys, it contains various waste products such as urea, toxins, excess electrolytes, and other substances that need to be removed in order to maintain the body's overall homeostasis. Inside the kidneys, the blood is filtered through microscopic structures known as nephrons. Each kidney contains approximately one million nephrons, and each nephron is equipped with a filtration unit called the glomerulus, followed by a system of tubules responsible for further processing of the filtered blood. The glomerulus is a tiny network of capillaries surrounded by a cup-like structure called the Bowman's capsule. As the blood passes through the glomerulus, water, waste products, and other small molecules are filtered from the blood by a process called glomerular filtration. These filtered substances then move into the surrounding tubules, where further processing occurs, such as reabsorption of important nutrients, secretion of excess substances, and concentration of the fluid. The waste products and water ultimately form urine, which is collected in the renal pelvis before being transported through the ureters to the bladder, where it is stored until it's time for elimination through the urethra. Meanwhile, the cleaned blood, devoid of waste materials and with the required balance of electrolytes, is returned to the circulatory system via the renal veins, which connect to the inferior vena cava and ultimately bring the blood back to the heart. In summary, the first step in the process of blood filtration and waste removal by the urinary system is the transportation of blood to the kidneys through the renal arteries. This essential step sets the stage for the vital functions performed by the kidneys in maintaining the body's overall balance and promoting good health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the moving drumstick strikes the drum head, the drum starts to vibrate. The motion of the vibrating drum head creates the sound you hear. Any form of energy can change into any other form. Frequently, one form of energy changes into two or more different forms. Have you ever sat in front of a campfire? What are two things you notice? The fire creates light. It is also warm by the fire, meaning it creates heat. The energy of the fire comes from the stored energy in the wood. The wood contains chemical energy. As it burns, the chemical energy is changed into light and heat. Not all chemical energy changes produce light and heat. Our cars use gasoline as a fuel. Gasoline contains chemical energy. When our cars burn gasoline in their engines, it is converted into motion and heat. When energy changes forms, energy is conserved. After reading the above, is \\"Chemical energy\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Wood is transformed into which type of energy?\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, \\"chemical energy\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"Wood is transformed into which type of energy?\\" When wood burns, as in the campfire example, the stored chemical energy within the wood is converted into other forms of energy, such as light and heat. Similarly, the chemical energy in gasoline is used to power cars by converting it into motion and heat. In both instances, the energy transformations follow the principle of conservation of energy, where the total energy remains constant while changing from one form to another."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: who was mantis in guardians of the galaxy 2?","completion":"Mantis is a fictional character from the Marvel Comics Universe and is prominently featured in the 2017 film \\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\\", which is a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Mantis, portrayed by French actress Pom Klementieff, is an empathic, insect-like alien who becomes an associate of the Guardians of the Galaxy team. Mantis is introduced in the movie as an assistant to Ego, a Celestial (a cosmic, god-like being) portrayed by Kurt Russell. Ego, who is also the biological father of Star-Lord (Peter Quill), played by Chris Pratt, takes the Guardians of the Galaxy team comprising Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Raccoon, and Baby Groot to his planet, where they meet Mantis. In the film, Mantis possesses unique abilities, like telepathy and empathic powers. With a gentle touch, she can sense and influence the emotions of others. She uses her empathic powers to help Ego deal with his loneliness by putting him to sleep through her touch, which allows him to rest. However, she is not entirely aware of Ego's sinister intentions, which involve absorbing all planets in the galaxy to extend his power. Over time, Mantis forms a close bond with Drax and the other Guardians, who ultimately discover Ego's evil plans. Once Mantis understands the threat that Ego poses to the universe, she chooses to side with the Guardians of the Galaxy and assists them in their quest to save the galaxy. Mantis plays a crucial role in the climax of the movie, using her empathic powers to mitigate Ego's destructive capabilities and provide the Guardians with a chance to defeat him. As a character, Mantis is portrayed as socially awkward, innocent, and naive, which is endearing to the audience. Her unusual appearance and mannerisms, along with her unique abilities, add depth and diversity to the Guardians of the Galaxy team. Given her earlier alliance with Ego, Mantis's character arc also revolves around finding her true identity and family within the Guardians, learning the values of friendship and heroism. Following her impactful role in \\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\\", Mantis appears in subsequent MCU films, such as \\"Avengers: Infinity War\\" (2018) and \\"Avengers: Endgame\\" (2019), where she continues to contribute her unique empathic abilities to the team's endeavors.

However, we can analyze the available information and make some observations to give a more in-depth response. The quote provided discusses an old New England saltbox house and the speaker's decision not to paint it due to concerns about climbing ladders as they age. It suggests the desire for less physical strain when maintaining the house, which indicates that the individual may be concerned about their physical well-being, specifically their knees and back. Old New England saltbox houses are typically made from wood and have a simple design with a long, sloping roof in the back, which may require less frequent maintenance. The architectural design allows for easy shedding of snow and rain, potentially reducing potential structural damage. The decision not to paint the house would result in even less maintenance overall, which might be easier on the speaker's knees and back. That being said, it is important to consider other factors of living in an old-style New England saltbox, such as the house's interior layout and potential challenges in day-to-day tasks. For example, older homes may often have narrow staircases and uneven floors, which could impact a person's knees and back over time. Additionally, we should consider the person's overall lifestyle and physical activity. While the specific choice to avoid painting the house and climbing ladders may have some benefits for their knees and back, it is not solely the house style responsible for this outcome. Factors like exercise, posture, and overall wellness also significantly impact a person's knee and back health. In conclusion, while we cannot definitively state that the given hypothesis is true, certain aspects of living in an old-style New England saltbox house, such as reduced maintenance tasks, might lessen the strain on the speaker's knees and back. However, it is essential to consider other factors in the individual's life and the house's specific features that could also impact their overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: Matthew Moneypenny (his real name) is Hollywood handsome, with a dressed-down wardrobe of Saint Laurent and an easy patter somewhere between pitchman and showman. He laughs loudly and has a favorite table at Sant Ambroeus in the West Village, as well as a preferred room at the Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, Calif. He looks like what industry types call “talent,” but Mr. Moneypenny, 46, isn’t talent (though talented). In the congested little world of fashion image-making, he is talent’s agent, the bargaining power behind the throne. Mr. Moneypenny’s job is to secure high-revenue deals for top-tier images and image-makers. In effect, he said with a practiced twinkle over cookies at a Sant Ambroeus corner table, “to make the world a prettier place.” Mr. Moneypenny is the president and chief executive of Trunk Archive, a photography licensing agency, whose back catalog of images run in magazines and product packaging, are loaded as smartphone backdrops and hang on hotel walls. In Trunk’s trunk are images by hundreds of photographers, including many of fashion’s marquee names: Annie Leibovitz, Bruce Weber, Arthur Elgort and Patrick Demarchelier. Mr. Moneypenny has built Trunk into a digital, long-tail boutique of stylish imagery, making the photographers (and the company) significant amounts of money in the process. They are high-end images for high-end prices. “If Corbis and Getty are Kmart and Walmart,” Mr. Moneypenny said, ticking off two of the larger stock-photo agencies, “we’re Bergdorf Goodman.” Having made a success of reselling existing images, Mr. Moneypenny is now getting into the business of creating new ones. Fueled by investment capital from Waddell & Reed, which has taken positions in companies like Richemont and LVMH, Mr. Moneypenny has spent the last two years quietly buying creative agencies. The result is Great Bowery, a group that will include Trunk Archive and 11 other assignment and licensing agencies under its umbrella. Great Bowery is a mega-agency, one whose ambition is to rebalance the scales, empowering those who make fashion’s imagery — photographers, fashion stylists, hair and makeup artists and set designers — and checking, implicitly, the powerful and increasingly integrated luxury companies and media conglomerates that have traditionally commissioned their work. He sees it as nothing less than the fashion analogue of the rise of the agency system in Hollywood, which unseated the film studios as the sole kingmakers and deal-brokers. “If one can say three pillars were originally music, television and film, I would argue that fashion is now the fourth pillar,” Mr. Moneypenny said. “Twenty years ago, it was the socialite on the Upper East Side or the resident of Mayfair or Beverly Hills that was aware of what was coming down the Chanel or Dior runway. There’s so much more interest about the creativity that comes out of this world.” Mr. Moneypenny is far from the only observer to make this connection, but he is better positioned than most to connect the dots. He is, by his own estimation, the only fashion agent with a background in Hollywood representation and management. He began his career at ICM, the Hollywood agency, talking his way from the mailroom to the desk of Nancy Josephson, the co-president. “He would call up Gucci at the time Tom Ford was designing and say, ‘My boss has no time to shop, send over the entire line,’” said Ms. Josephson, now a partner at WME. “I have a lot of chutzpah, but I would not have thought to do that. And he got me a discount!” The Hollywood model was an explicit reference for Great Bowery. “So many of the systems I learned during my time at ICM, I still employ today,” Mr. Moneypenny said. Fabien Baron, the editorial director of Interview Magazine, has seen what the corporatization of the industry has wrought: the move to be more things to more people, with static budgets and increased demands. Mr. Baron, who is considering a handful of projects with Mr. Moneypenny, expressed admiration for his strategy. “The idea of turning this into the CAA of fashion is interesting,” he said, referring to the Hollywood agency. “It makes a lot of sense to me.” Most of the agencies now under the aegis of Great Bowery, like CLM, M.A.P, Management & Artists and Streeters, are unfamiliar to the public. So, too, are many of the artists they represent. A brief sample of the agency’s top-level talent. Their work is not. You have seen it in the glossy spreads of fashion magazines, the ad campaigns that precede them, the billboards and bus shelters luxury companies commandeer and the videos that run on their Instagram accounts and websites. If they are not, on the whole, household names the way CAA clients like Julia Roberts, George Clooney and Madonna are, Mr. Moneypenny is betting that they can be. Their rates can already run Hollywood stratospheric (“It’s not unusual for a highly talented artist in our world to generate a seven-figure annual income,” he said), and their visibility is rising to match. Is Pat McGrath, the most in-demand of the runway makeup artists, say, primed to become a name-brand megastar? “Some designers are big famous stars,” Mr. Baron said. “Also photographers are, and stylists are, and models are. Everybody’s kind of important. It’s become popular culture.” With importance comes opportunity. Mr. Moneypenny envisages product lines, brand extensions, exhibitions and endorsements even if the jobs these artists now do didn’t exist a generation or two earlier. “Makeup artists and hairdressers who specialized in photo shoots were completely nonexistent,” Grace Coddington, the creative director of Vogue, wrote of her early modeling days in a 2012 memoir. “There was no such thing as a stylist, either, so the better your accessories, which you carried in your bag, too, the more jobs you were likely to get.” As the professions developed and careers were made, agencies evolved to represent artists’ interests and handle their logistics, for a percentage. But the systems put in place, many involved agreed, had stagnated and failed to keep pace with the industry’s changes. “As the companies we do business with became huge, it became more and more difficult to maintain what we believe to be fair terms and conditions for our talent,” Mr. Moneypenny said. Fashion businesses developed into luxury groups and billion-dollar brands; magazines rolled together into media corporations like Condé Nast and Hearst. Arrangements had once been made over handshakes; today contracts can run to 20 pages or more, with byzantine rights agreements and complicated loopholes about usage. Even as the revenues top artists could earn grew, those of many others flat-lined. At the same time, the expectations placed upon them grew. Artists are asked to shoot video in addition to photos, come with social media followings, stage exhibitions and publish books; agencies are expected to support them with departments on digital and technological fronts: “all these new areas,” said Camilla Lowther, a pioneering agent in London and the founder of CLM, which joined Great Bowery in 2014, “which none of us have any experience in. I’m an agent. And probably quite an old-fashioned agent, to be totally honest with you. I’ve been doing this for 35 years.” Many of the changes Great Bowery hopes to affect are of the unsexy, business-efficiency type. By combining agencies into one organization — and, as of late March, one lavishly grafittied building, the 1898 former Germania Bank building on the Bowery — it hopes to consolidate back-end services like legal, accounting, human resources and operations and share them across the entire company. Mr. Moneypenny said that individual agencies would be left to conduct business as they see fit, and artists would not be asked to sign new contracts. But even if Mr. Moneypenny does not aim to hijack the fashion world, as he told Fantastic Man magazine, he is looking to disrupt it. Great Bowery is making new hires who will focus on developing social media, branded content, endorsements and collaborations for artists companywide, and the agency plans to act as a producer of its artists’ projects, rather than merely a conduit to them. “We would all like to see the agency operate as a studio,” Mr. Moneypenny said, “packaging” projects (in Hollywood parlance) and marketing them itself. “That package doesn’t necessarily have to be fashion,” he added. “It could be a line of products for an electronics maker. It really could be almost anything.” His hope is that every qualified artist in the stable can become a polymath. He held up the photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, whose archive Trunk licenses, as an example: They are in-demand photographers, working for Vogue and W, Chloé and Calvin Klein. They also design jewelry and a collection of jeans, recently published a career-spanning retrospective with Taschen and shot a music video with Paul McCartney, Rihanna and Kanye West. In his version of the future, deals similar to those might be worked through Great Bowery with a commission on each. “We really are the only ones who are attempting to change the game,” he said. Asked why, he shrugged: “Old dogs, no new tricks.” As is to be expected, Mr. Moneypenny’s competitors dispute this. Art & Commerce, where Mr. Moneypenny worked in licensing after ICM, is one of a handful of high-profile agencies that remains unaffiliated with Great Bowery. Along with the Wall Group, which represents primarily red-carpet stylists, it is owned by WME-IMG. Mark Shapiro, the chief content officer of WME-IMG, said that developing behind-the-scenes fashion talent into brands using all of the agencies’ channels, resources and relationships is top of mind. “Otherwise, frankly, we wouldn’t have bought the companies,” Mr. Shapiro said. “If someone wants to follow our model, all the merrier. We invite the competition.” He added: “Matthew has had great success in terms of the archive business that he built. Trying to jump into these waters is an entirely different story.” Another agency, the independent Art Partner, which represents some of the brightest stars in the fashion pantheon, including Mario Testino and Steven Klein, declined to comment. “I think we make our competitors very nervous,” Mr. Moneypenny said. “I’m not terribly concerned about any of them.” A version of this article appears in print on December 10, 2015, on page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Fashion’s Agent of Change.

Depending on the work you need done and how quickly you want it to be finished, you may find yourself needing more than one laborer. This is important to consider because it may influence the pay rate you are willing to offer. Choices: 1. Estimate the number of laborers in your area, if not more. Know how much time it takes you to complete the work and the number of laborers you need to pay. 2. If your project requires lots of heavy lifting and/or moving large items, hire at least two workers. This will make the work go faster and will prevent a single laborer from becoming exhausted. 3. Obtain the detailed breakdown of worker's compensation compensation benefits. Since laborers do not need any variety of compensation in order to live permanently in the workforce, they might have to file taxes and have a lump sum deposited into their pay account once a month or after they retire. 4. Determine what your house's average pay range will be. There are a number of different types of laborers and many offer varying levels of pay. Answer:","completion":"When determining how to pay a day laborer, it is important to take into account various factors, including the number of laborers you require, the specific tasks needed to be accomplished, and the desired timeline for completing the project. There are different options to consider when deciding on payment, including estimating the number of laborers, assessing the physical demands of the project, and considering worker's compensation. 1. Estimate the number of laborers in your area, if not more: Before beginning the hiring process, it is crucial to determine how many laborers you need to complete your project. Consider the estimated time for each task and the total working hours required. Having a clear idea of the number of laborers needed helps ensure that you can budget for their pay accordingly. This will also allow you to avoid hiring too few laborers, which could lead to delays or exhaustion among the workers, and prevent you from hiring too many laborers, which could result in unnecessary expenses. 2. If your project requires lots of heavy lifting and/or moving large items, hire at least two workers: Projects that involve significant physical labor, such as moving heavy furniture or construction work, will require at least two workers to ensure that the work is completed efficiently and safely. Hiring additional laborers for these tasks not only helps prevent injuries due to overexertion but also helps ensure that the project progresses smoothly and quickly. 3. Obtain the detailed breakdown of worker's compensation benefits: Day laborers may not have regular access to standard employee benefits such as health insurance or retirement savings. However, they still need to consider their financial security, both in the short term and long term. Therefore, it is essential to research and understand the labor laws and regulations in your area regarding worker's compensation, taxes, and other benefits that may apply to day laborers. Ensuring that your day laborers receive fair compensation, including any legally mandated benefits, helps build a positive working relationship and promotes their well-being. 4. Determine what your house's average pay range will be: Different types of laborers may come with varying levels of experience and skill sets, which should be taken into account when deciding on their pay. Perform some research to understand the average pay range for day laborers in your area with similar skills and experience. This will allow you to offer competitive wages that are attractive to potential laborers, while also ensuring that you are not overpaying for the services provided. In conclusion, when paying day laborers, it is essential to consider the number of workers needed, the nature of the work, and the legal requirements surrounding worker's compensation. By keeping these factors in mind, you can create a fair and attractive pay structure that will benefit both you and the laborers you hire, resulting in a successful working relationship that leads to the effective completion of your project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A waterfall is a place where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of drops in the course of a stream or river. Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf. - A dam is a barrier that impounds water or underground streams. Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability. Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity. A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations. Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees (also known as dikes) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions. - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals. - A ladder is a vertical or inclined set of rungs or steps. There are two types: rigid ladders that can be leaned against a vertical surface such as a wall, and rope ladders that are hung from the top. The vertical members of a rigid ladder are called stringers or rails (US) or stiles (UK). Rigid ladders are usually portable, but some types are permanently fixed to buildings. They are commonly made of metal, wood, or fiberglass, but they have been known to be made of tough plastic. - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. - Roza Dam ( National ID # WA00275 ) is a diversion dam on the Yakima River , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of Yakima , just west of SR 821 . The dam , built in 1939 , is 486 feet ( 148 m ) long at the crest and 67 feet ( 20 m ) high , and impounds approximately 100 acres ( 40 ha ) of water . The dam also has 12,000 kW power production capacity , online as of 1956 . There is also an adult fish ladder at this location . - Irrigation is the method in which a controlled amount of water is supplied to plants at regular intervals for agriculture. It is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and revegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. Additionally, irrigation also has a few other uses in crop production, which include protecting plants against frost, suppressing weed growth in grain fields and preventing soil consolidation. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed or dry land farming. - A reservoir (etymology: from French \\"réservoir\\" a \\"storehouse\\" ) is a storage space for fluids. These fluids may be water, hydrocarbons or gas. A reservoir usually means an enlarged natural or artificial lake, storage pond or impoundment created using a dam or lock to store water. Reservoirs can be created by controlling a stream that drains an existing body of water. They can also be constructed in river valleys using a dam. Alternately, a reservoir can be built by excavating flat ground and/or constructing retaining walls and levees. - A diversion dam is a dam that diverts all or a portion of the flow of a river from its natural course. Diversion dams do not generally impound water in a reservoir. Instead, the water is diverted into an artificial water course or canal, which may be used for irrigation or return to the river after passing through hydroelectric generators, flow into a different river or be itself dammed forming a reservoir. - The Yakima River is a tributary of the Columbia River in south central and eastern Washington state, named for the indigenous Yakama people. The length of the river from headwaters to mouth is , with an average drop of . It is the longest river entirely in Washington state. - The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The river rises in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. It flows northwest and then south into the US state of Washington, then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The river is long, and its largest tributary is the Snake River. Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A fish ladder, also known as a fishway, fish pass or fish steps, is a structure on or around artificial and natural barriers (such as dams, locks and waterfalls) to facilitate diadromous fishes' natural migration. Most fishways enable fish to pass around the barriers by swimming and leaping up a series of relatively low steps (hence the term \\"ladder\\") into the waters on the other side. The velocity of water falling over the steps has to be great enough to attract the fish to the ladder, but it cannot be so great that it washes fish back downstream or exhausts them to the point of inability to continue their journey upriver.

Answer the following question: Background: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.

Answer the following question: Process: - An organism dies - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden - The minerals form a fossil. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are fewer predators happens, how will it affect LESS fossils forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that there will be fewer predators in the environment, leading to potential changes in the formation of fossils. This scenario can indeed have direct and indirect effects on the fossilization process. Direct effects of fewer predators on fossil formation: 1. Changes in the death rate: With fewer predators, the organisms' death rate might decrease as fewer individuals are killed for consumption. A reduced death rate will lead to a lower overall rate of organism remains being deposited in an environment conducive to fossil formation. 2. Changes in the availability of organism remains: The presence of fewer predators could result in fewer scavengers, which could mean that organism remains are not broken down into smaller fragments and instead left to decay on the surface. Surface remains are less likely to fossilize as they are exposed to weathering elements and are less likely to be covered by sediment. 3. Altered ecological niches: A decrease in the number of predators might change the ecological niche structure and open the door for different organisms to thrive. The change in species composition could impact the types of fossils that are formed and the frequency at which they appear. Indirect effects of fewer predators on fossil formation: 1. Changes in population size: With fewer predators, prey species populations might grow unchecked, leading to an increase in competition for resources and, ultimately, possible localized die-offs. These events could lead to a temporary spike in the number of organism remains that become available for fossil formation. 2. Changes in habitat structures: Predators can significantly influence their prey's behavior, and a decrease in predator numbers could lead to changes in habitat utilization by the prey species. This could impact various environmental factors, such as sedimentation rates, oxygen levels, and redox conditions, all of which can influence the fossilization process. 3. Changes in the diversity of decomposers: As mentioned earlier, since predators also regulate the populations of scavengers and decomposers, their decline in number may lead to changes in the rate at which organic remains are decomposed. This can either slow down or speed up the fossilization process, depending on the type and characteristics of the decomposers present. To summarize, the perturbation hypothesis' proposed scenario of fewer predators can lead to direct and indirect effects on the formation of fossils. Changes in death rates, organism remains availability, ecological niches, population sizes, habitat structures, and the diversity of decomposers are among the various factors that can influence the fossilization process in response to a decrease in predator numbers. These effects can result in less frequent fossil formation or alterations in the types of fossils being formed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Given the following context: When the entire British royal family is killed in a freak accident outside Buckingham Palace, Sir Cedric Willingham leads a search for any surviving heirs to whom to pass the crown. After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke was visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph a duplicate of the ring his grandmother used to wear that the Duke had given her. Ralph is flown to London, where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the House of Stuart, of which he is patriarch. Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error. With this in mind, Graves bribes a cash-strapped Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph. Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII, Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a romantic date with Miranda at Hyde Park. The next day, Miranda returns the money to Graves, but he already has photographs of her with Ralph. In order to preserve Ralph's reputation, Miranda breaks up with him. answer the following question: What is the full name of the person whose team locates a living heir?

By Richard Hamm,, The Athens (Ga.) Banner-Herald, via AP If you don't enjoy swimming laps, water aerobics are a great alternative that let you beat the heat. By Richard Hamm,, The Athens (Ga.) Banner-Herald, via AP If you don't enjoy swimming laps, water aerobics are a great alternative that let you beat the heat. Enjoy yourself, Casa says, but don't be surprised when your performance and your drive droop. This is true whether you're a weekend golfer walking 18 holes, a teen heading to preseason high school football practice or a professional athlete. \\"People get into trouble when they think they can run as fast or perform any activity as well during the extreme heat,\\" Casa says. \\"It is just not going to happen.\\" There are some exceptions, of course — ice vests and ice collars have helped Olympic-caliber athletes train hard and compete at peak levels — but Casa's goal is to keep people healthy — and alive. He is the director of the Korey Stringer Institute at the University of Connecticut. Korey Stringer, an all-pro tackle in the National Football League, died of heat stroke complications 10 years ago after working out in inferno-like conditions. \\"The best thing to do is find some shade to work out in, or do your workout early in the day or later,\\" Casa says. \\"But still know that you can't handle the intensity you are used to.\\" Start slow: Even if you’re in great shape, acclimate to the heat over a number of days. Drink up: Hydrate yourself before and during your exercise to make up for lost fluids from exertion in hot weather. For every additional 1% of body mass you lose by sweating, says Doug Casa, your temperature rises half a degree Fahrenheit. “Hydrating is the most powerful tool you have,’’ he says. But avoid alcoholic drinks, coffee or soda because they can dehydrate you.Go skimpy: Wear light clothing that wicks sweat away from the body. Extra clothing exacerbates heat load. Ease up: At the first sign of heat illness, get to a shady place, drink water and cool off. Call 911 if the person’s temperature exceeds 103 degrees Fahrenheit, use ice packs or ice baths to begin cooling down the person while you wait for medics.No tough love: If you’re exercising with a friend or overseeing kids and they want to take a break, encourage it. If they ask for water, never withhold it.Source: National Athletic Trainers’ Association Heat-related illnesses are the No. 1 weather-related killer, accounting for about 700 deaths a year, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Knowing what to expect of yourself and how to identify heat illness can be a lifesaver. The early warning signs of heat illness are cramps, dizziness and headaches, nausea and thirst. Listen to your body, stop exercising, get out of the sun and cool off, Casa says. If you keep going, you could set yourself up for heat stroke, which can damage the brain and other organs and quickly lead to death. During heat stroke, the body temperature rises above 103 degrees Fahrenheit, the CDC says. The skin becomes red, hot and dry, and the body can no longer cool itself off. Emergency help is essential because the body's temperature can quickly escalate to 106 degrees and damage organs or lead to death. The speed in which heat illness can strike is why Casa says adult supervision of children and teens is crucial when they are involved in team sports. \\"You really have to heed those early warning signs,\\" he says. \\"What happens as heat illness progresses is the brain often becomes confused and you can't rely on it to tell you when to stop. \\" Kayaking is one of Barbara Bushman's favorite summer exercises. \\"This is a super total body workout as you generate your force from your core (rather than just your arms) and brace with your legs. Great for burning calories, and when you get too hot, you can jump in for a swim.\\" Summertime, and the workout is easy? Not necessarily so, says fitness expert Barbara Bushman. The dangerous heat wave moving into many sections of the nation does not have to cool off your desire to shape up. The editor of the American College of Sports Medicine's new book, Complete Guide to Fitness & Health, says to think outside the heated box. \\"If it is too hot outside, consider doing a power yoga workout inside using a DVD from your local library,'' says Bushman. \\"Or try a balance ball workout or dance video.\\" Or turn up the AC and set new goals by doing a Wii workout such as EA Sports' Active 2, billed as having aerobic, flexibility and resistance training. Other exercise alternatives Bushman suggests: •Get some wheels. Create your own breeze by biking or rollerblading. •Get all wet. If you're not a swimmer, try water aerobics or aqua running. •Get under cover. Take a dog and head out for a power walk at a shady park.

Which character was played by James Beck in the TV sitcom Dad’s Army?","completion":"James Beck played the role of Private Joe Walker in the classic British TV sitcom Dad's Army. The show, which originally aired from 1968 to 1977, was created by Jimmy Perry and David Croft and has become iconic in British television history. Dad's Army revolves around the activities of the fictional Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard, a volunteer defense force made up of local civilians during World War II. The show is often praised for its combination of humor and historical accuracy, as well as its engaging and memorable characters. Private Joe Walker, portrayed by James Beck, is a pivotal character in the series, known for his cheeky demeanor and resourcefulness. As a Cockney spiv, Walker is the local black market dealer, who always has a scheme or plan to make some extra cash. Despite his sometimes questionable actions and methods, Walker proves to be a valuable and loyal member of the Home Guard platoon, who uses his cunning and street smarts to achieve his goals. James Beck not only gave life to Private Walker's character but also contributed to the dynamic ensemble cast that made Dad's Army a popular success. The other main characters in the series include Captain George Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe), Sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesurier), Lance Corporal Jack Jones (Clive Dunn), Private Frank Pike (Ian Lavender), Private James Frazer (John Laurie), and Private Charles Godfrey (Arnold Ridley).

As we left, the press descended on us, we both pouted furiously and headed off to The Blitz club where we bumped into Marilyn and a host of exotic, beautiful New Romantics, drank vodka and crashed out at his apartment in Notting Hill. When I woke up in the spare room the next morning, I wandered through his elegant apartment to find him asleep with his eye mask on.

He went to London aged 15 to work for Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McClaren before co-founding the Blitz Club in Soho, central London, which would become a focal point for the New Romantic movement. Bands including Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet and Culture Club all got their start at the club before finding stardom. His band, Visage, formed in 1979 and their breakthrough single, Fade To Grey, peaked at number eight in the UK in 1981. It reached number one in both Germany and Switzerland, and was the first of five UK top 40 hits for the band, which also numbered Midge Ure and Rusty Egan among its members. Strange also starred in the video of his good friend David Bowie's number one single Ashes to Ashes in 1980. At the time, the futuristic mini-film was hailed as the most expensive pop music video in history. Strange - who admitted he faced drug addiction problems in the years that followed his early success - recorded a new Visage album, called Hearts and Knives, in May 2013, with the band boasting a new line-up. The band also recorded a new classical interpretation of Fade To Grey last year.

In a nod to his involvement in the Ashes to Ashes single, he appeared as himself in the BBC One police drama of the same name.

One day, two men went to this airfield to fly around in a small airplane. The airplane they were flying is called a \\"light aircraft.\\" Light aircraft are smaller than the big airplanes you see at big airports. They are like little birds compared to big dinosaurs that can carry many people. Unfortunately, something went wrong while these two men were up in the sky. Their light aircraft had an accident and crashed onto the airfield. We don't know exactly what happened to cause the crash, but sometimes airplanes can have problems, just like cars or bicycles can. Both men in the airplane were very badly hurt and, sadly, they died because of the accident. This is a very sad thing that happened, and it reminds us of how important it is to be careful and always follow the rules when we do things like flying in airplanes or even riding our bikes. People who investigate accidents, like detectives, will look into what happened to try to find out why the light aircraft crashed. They will also try to learn how to make airplanes safer so that accidents like this don't happen again in the future. In the end, we must remember that accidents can happen to anyone, and we should always be extra careful and watch out for one another. So, my little friends, please remember to stay safe and always follow the rules, no matter what you do."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the person whose thoughts on what inspired him to such an individual mode of expression art historians have struggled with? Answer the above question based on the context below: Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\". The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the New World sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers.

Evers was born July 2, 1925, in Decatur, Mississippi, the third of the five children (including older brother Charles Evers) of Jesse (Wright) and James Evers. The family included Jesse's two children from a previous marriage. The Evers family owned a small farm and James also worked at a sawmill. Evers walked twelve miles to attend segregated schools, eventually earning his high school diploma. Medgar Evers lived with the constant threat of death. A large Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist population were present in Jackson and its suburbs. The risk was so high that before his death, Evers and his wife Myrlie had trained their children on what to do in case of a shooting, bombing or other kind of attack on their lives. Evers, who was regularly followed home by at least two FBI cars and one police car, arrived at his home on the morning of his death without an escort. None of his usual protection was present, for reasons unspecified by the FBI or local police. Many believe that many members of the police force at the time were members of the Klan. In the early morning of June 12, 1963, just hours after President John F. Kennedy's nationally televised Civil Rights Address, Evers pulled into his driveway after returning from a meeting with NAACP lawyers. Evers's family had worried for his safety the day of his assassination and Evers himself had warned his wife that he felt himself in a greater danger than usual. When he arrived home, Evers's family was waiting for him and his children exclaimed to his wife, Myrlie, that he had arrived. Emerging from his car and carrying NAACP T-shirts that read \\"Jim Crow Must Go\\", Evers was struck in the back with a bullet fired from an Enfield 1917 rifle; the bullet ripped through his heart. Initially thrown to the ground by the impact of the shot, Evers rose and staggered 30 feet (10 meters) before collapsing. His wife Myrlie was the first to find him outside of their front door. He was taken to the local hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, where he was initially refused entry because of his race. His family explained who he was and he was admitted; he died in the hospital 50 minutes later. Evers was the first African American to be admitted to an all-white hospital in Mississippi, a questionable achievement for the dying activist. Mourned nationally, Evers was buried on June 19 in Arlington National Cemetery, where he received full military honors before a crowd of more than 3,000. After Evers was assassinated, an estimated 5,000 people marched from the Masonic Temple on Lynch Street to the Collins Funeral Home on North Farish Street in Jackson. Allen Johnson, Reverend Martin Luther King and other civil rights leaders led the procession. The Mississippi police came prepared with riot gear and rifles in case the protests turned violent. While tensions were initially high in the stand off between police and marchers, both in Jackson and in many similar marches around the state, leaders of the movement maintained nonviolence among their followers.

Trachtenberg trained for eight months, including the time they were filming (during which time she says she worked twenty-hour days). She had to be on the ice longer than most of the other actors as she was one of the few adults on the film. She had stunt doubles to handle the falls and some of the complex moves, although Trachtenberg did learn a specific move that could not be done by a stunt double as the differences in their build would be apparent. She sustained some injuries while working on the film. According to Trachtenberg, a mistake was made in one of the physics formulas her character recites, which was later fixed; a shot of the back of her head was used and the correct term was looped in. Trachtenberg described the film as \`\`not a Disney kitschy movie'' and was somewhat apprehensive of the idea of a sequel for fear of belittling the original.

Write a title for this article: Robin Harper/Invision, via Associated Press BeyoncÃ© at the Izod Center in East Rutherford, N.J. on Wednesday. EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. â At first it seemed that BeyoncÃ© was taking one of her pop-star nicknames, Queen Bey, all too seriously. Her show at the Izod Center here on Wednesday night opened with a bombastic orchestral dirge and a video presenting her as a Marie Antoinette figure in a Gothic palace, receiving a crown. But as the queenâs female retinue â wearing white unitards and hoops without skirts â reappeared onstage, the dirge segued into the martial beat of âRun the World (Girls).â BeyoncÃ©, shaking the epaulets on her shoulders and flipping her hair, was taking power not for herself but for her entire gender. The set that followed was not about aristocratic aloofness, but about energy, empathy and a beaming smile. It was the first stop in the New York region of BeyoncÃ©âs current tour, âThe Mrs. Carter Show,â which continues on Friday at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn., and Saturday to Monday at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Mr. Carter is, of course, Shawn Carter, better known as Jay Z; he didnât show up, though his recorded voice was heard in âCrazy in Love.â Except for its title, the two-hour show was no tribute to wifely self-effacement. It ranged through BeyoncÃ©âs repertory â all the way back to âSurvivorâ from her years with Destinyâs Child â to zigzag between romance and single-gal resilience, between making out and breaking up, often in successive tunes. Unlike Jay Zâs songs, which boast about his savvy, his possessions and his individual success, most of BeyoncÃ©âs music speaks for a high-achieving Everywoman balancing love and independence, pleasure and ambition. When she got to the line âIâm a host of imperfectionsâ in âFlaws and All,â she gripped and wiggled the skin on her upper arm, which was slightly less toned than the rest of her body. BeyoncÃ© hasnât released an album since â4â in 2011, though she has been busy since with motherhood â her daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, was born in 2012 â and performances this year including singing (along with a prerecorded track) at President Obamaâs second inauguration and doing the halftime show at the Super Bowl before going on tour. The newest song in her set, the Afrobeat-driven âGrown Woman,â was first heard in a cola commercial this year. But with a live band â all female musicians â she had new arrangements for some of the old songs. BeyoncÃ© has been headlining arenas on her own for a decade, and sheâs a song-and-dance trouper. âThe Mrs. Carter Showâ is a pageant of costumes â white lingerie, black leather, rhinestones, gauzy dresses, a glittery catsuit â along with choreography, fireworks and a second stage at the back of the auditorium, which she reached by traveling over the audience on a rope harness. Every detail was in place. Somehow, no matter where BeyoncÃ© placed herself onstage, an unseen fan was blowing back her hair, even when she was on her back atop a piano and singing a ballad, âSpeechless.â BeyoncÃ© matched her female dancers nearly strut for strut and shimmy for shimmy. But she didnât let dancing overshadow the music, and her voice shone. It held wounded fury in âIf I Were a Boy,â predatory sensuality in âFreakum Dress,â soulful indignation in âWhy Donât You Love Meâ and gospel exhortation in âHaloâ â which she preceded with an a cappella homage to Whitney Houstonâs version of âI Will Always Love You.â Even without a new album, BeyoncÃ© has less and less competition as an arena pop diva. She can play to a camera and ride a hip-hop track, but she also has the gifts of past soul generations. On Wednesday, she hit her notes and hit her marks, never showing the effort. She was a superwoman singing for Everywoman, smiling through all the ups and downs.

In a study at Barcelona University, men wore a virtual reality headset that allowed them to see and hear the world as a female character. When they looked down, they could even see their new body and clothes. The \\"body-swapping\\" effect was so convincing that the men's sense of self was transferred into the virtual woman, causing them to react to events in the virtual world they wereimmersed . \\"This work opens up another avenue for virtual reality, which is not just to transform your sense of place, but also your sense of self,\\" said Mel Slater, \\"If you can temporarily give people the illusion that their bodies are different, then the evidence suggests it also affects their behavior and the way they think. They can have new experiences: a person who is thin can know what it is like to be fat. A man can have an experience of what it's like to be a woman.\\" During the experiment, a \\"female\\" approached and hit the face of the character another man was playing. \\"Their reaction was immediate,\\" said Slate. \\"They would take in a quick breath and maybeflinch . The more people reported being in the girl's body, the stronger physical reaction they had.\\" But in all cases, the feeling was temporary and lasted only as long as the study.

Answer the above question based on the context below: \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution.

Answer the above question based on the context below: There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls. In 2010, the Manchester Local Education Authority was ranked last out of Greater Manchester's ten LEAs – and 147th out...

Answer the question A researcher observes that an organism placed in a glass container filled with water moves away when a penlight is focused on the container. The researcher concludes that the organism is light sensitive. Which other explanation for the organism's response to the light is most possible? OPT: A). The organism avoids radio waves.. B). The organism avoids gamma rays.. C). The organism moves away from vibrations.. D). The organism moves away from heat sources..","completion":"To determine the most possible explanation for the organism's response to the light, let's consider each option step by step: A) The organism avoids radio waves: Penlights emit visible light, not radio waves. It is unlikely that the organism's response is due to radio waves, as the penlight is not a source of radio waves. B) The organism avoids gamma rays: Penlights also do not emit gamma rays. Gamma rays are a high-energy type of radiation that typically comes from sources like nuclear explosions or cosmic rays. The organism's response is unlikely to be due to gamma rays, as the penlight is not a source of them. C) The organism moves away from vibrations: While a penlight doesn't directly cause vibrations, the researcher handling the penlight might cause vibrations in the container. This is a possible alternative explanation for the organism's response, as it could be sensitive to mechanical disturbances like vibrations. D) The organism moves away from heat sources: Penlights emit both light and heat. Since the organism moves away when the light is focused on the container, it is possible that the heat emitted by the penlight also plays a role in the organism's response. This explanation is also plausible because organisms may avoid heat to prevent overheating or to maintain a comfortable temperature. Out of these options, both C) The organism moves away from vibrations and D) The organism moves away from heat sources are plausible alternative explanations for the organism's response to the light. However, D) appears to be more directly related to the penlight, as heat is emitted along with the light. Therefore, the most possible alternative explanation for the organism's response to the light is: D) The organism moves away from heat sources."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: where did paul ryan attend college?

Second question: How are optical illusions designed? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: What are some optical illusions? Step 1: Identify what the user is asking for in the question: In this case, the user wants to learn about some examples of optical illusions. Step 2: Recall examples of optical illusions. There are many different types of optical illusions that can be categorized into various groups. Some examples of optical illusions include: 1. The Müller-Lyer Illusion - This illusion consists of two lines of equal length, each with arrows at the ends pointing in different directions. The line with the arrows pointing inwards appears to be longer than the one with arrows pointing outwards. 2. The Ponzo Illusion - This illusion features two horizontal lines of equal length that appear to be different lengths due to converging diagonal lines in the background, creating the perception of depth. 3. The Penrose Triangle - This is a triangle that appears to be connected, but upon closer inspection, it is impossible for the triangle to be structurally sound. 4. The Hermann Grid - This illusion consists of a grid with black squares and white lines. When we look at the grid, we perceive gray dots at the intersections of the white lines, but they disappear when we try to focus on them. 5. The Kanizsa Triangle - The illusion is formed by three Pac-Man-like shapes arranged so that their edges appear to form an upside-down triangle, even though there is no triangle in the actual image. Second question: How are optical illusions designed? Step 1: Identify what the user is asking for in the question: In this case, the user wants to know the process behind designing optical illusions. Step 2: Explain the design process for optical illusions. Optical illusions are created by artists and scientists who understand how our brains perceive visual information. These illusions are designed to exploit various perceptual and cognitive processes, such as pattern recognition, depth perception, and contextual cues. The illusions are created in such a way that they confuse or trick the brain into perceiving something that is not actually there or misinterpreting the visual information in some way. To answer the last part of your question: No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question asks for examples of optical illusions, while the second question asks about the design process behind optical illusions. Both questions relate to the topic of optical illusions, but they focus on different aspects."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kanesatake Mohawk council rifts force early election Mohawks in Kanesatake go to the polls to elect a new band council leader today, five months earlier than planned after the existing council disintegrated into factions, paralyzing decision-making. Grand Chief Serge Simon, elected in August 2011 on a platform of unifying the community, lost the balance of power more than a year ago and often saw his faction’s decisions overturned as a result. With the council at an impasse, the chiefs agreed to hold a decision as quickly as possible rather than wait until the scheduled election in October, in order to resolve the crisis. “We spend our time arguing,” Simon said. “Who wants to come invest in a community like that?” Serge Simon, the outgoing grand chief in Kanesatake, told Radio-Canada of his community: “We spend our time arguing. Who wants to come invest in a community like that?” (Radio-Canada) Serge Simon, the outgoing grand chief in Kanesatake, told Radio-Canada of his community: “We spend our time arguing. Who wants to come invest in a community like that?” (Radio-Canada) For Simon, like the other two candidates running for grand chief, revisiting the governance model remains the priority. “What message are we sending to our youth?” asked candidate Sonya Gagnier, one of the dissidents on the current council. “We’re telling them that there’s no future here. We need to work together for the good of the population.” Robert Gabriel, a former band council chief who arrived late to the race, agrees that elected officials need to work hand-in-hand. But Gabriel said he considers economic development and land claims to be the real priorities. “My community is broken,” Gabriel said. “People have to be able to earn money, to work. For that, we need to take advantage of our land and the financial compensation we would get from the federal government if we were able to hold negotiations.” The governance issue has been a thorn in the side of the community for decades — complicating negotiations over Kanesatake’s unresolved land claim and exacerbating tensions in 1990. That’s when a dispute over the neighbouring town of Oka’s plan to expand its golf course led to a blockaded highway and the 76-day standoff now known as the Oka Crisis. Elections in Kanesatake are rarely popular. In the 2011 band council election, under 30 per cent of 2,100 band members deemed eligible to vote actually cast a ballot. (Radio-Canada) Elections in Kanesatake are rarely popular. In the 2011 band council election, under 30 per cent of 2,100 band members deemed eligible to vote actually cast a ballot. (Radio-Canada) “In 1991, they changed the voting system,” said political scientist Pierre Trudel of the University of Quebec in Montreal’s (UQAM). “At that time they were supposed to clearly define the roles of the chiefs and of the grand chief and name an elders’ council. But that was never done.” Conflicts have multiplied in the decades since then — coming to a head in January 2004 when dissident community members took over the band-supported police station and set fire to the home of former grand chief James Gabriel. Elections in Kanesatake are rarely popular. In the 2011 band council election, under 30 per cent of 2,100 band members deemed eligible to vote actually cast a ballot. According to candidate Gagnier, this speaks to “voters’ lack of interest and the large proportion of traditionalists.” Traditionalists reject any form of election that falls under the Indian Act and call for a return to the matrilineal system of government that existed before Canada was settled by Europeans. “Our ancestral methods allowed the tribes’ mothers to choose the leaders from among the children they saw grow up and become adults,” said John Cree, a man considered by many Mohawk traditionalists as their spiritual leader. “I don’t vote because I don’t recognize this voting method, which divides more than it brings people together,” he continued. Even so, Cree said he hopes the incoming chiefs will be able to restore harmony to the community.

Boosts Earnings Outlook Amid Financial Services Sector Strength, Announces End of Car Production at UK Jaguar Plant and Formula One Racing Exit\\" Article: DETROIT - Ford Motor Co., one of the world's leading automakers, raised its earnings outlook on Friday, attributing the positive revision to an impressive performance in its financial services sector. This announcement came alongside news that the company will cease car production at a Jaguar plant in Britain and withdraw from Formula One racing. The revised earnings outlook highlights the substantial role the financial services sector plays in Ford's overall profitability. This sector encompasses the financing options provided to consumers for purchasing or leasing Ford vehicles and the financial tools offered to dealerships. The company's ability to generate higher than expected revenues and profits from its financial services arm signifies a strong market presence and efficient management of its financial products. However, the decision to end production at the Jaguar plant in Britain came as a surprise to many. Ford acquired the luxury car manufacturer in 1989 and has been producing vehicles at the plant ever since. While the reasoning behind this move is unclear, it could be linked to multiple factors, including the potential for reducing overhead costs, reallocating resources, or even refocusing on other segments of Ford's automotive portfolio. The loss of production at the Jaguar plant will undoubtedly impact local employment and the regional economy, raising questions about Ford's long-term commitment to maintaining its presence in the British market. In addition to ceasing production at the Jaguar plant, Ford Motor Co. announced its withdrawal from Formula One racing, a domain in which it has participated since 1967. Formula One has served as a competitive arena for top automakers, allowing them to showcase their technological expertise and driving prowess. It remains to be seen how this exit might affect Ford's brand image and future developments in automotive technology. These strategic moves demonstrate that Ford Motor Co. is navigating challenges in the automotive industry while seeking ways to maintain and enhance its profitability. The company's emphasis on its financial services sector demonstrates an ability to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer preferences. On the flip side, the end of car production at the Jaguar plant and the withdrawal from Formula One racing underscore Ford's willingness to make difficult decisions that have a long-lasting impact on its brand and presence in certain markets and industries. Overall, Ford Motor Co.'s revised earnings outlook signals the company's resilience amidst a rapidly changing automotive landscape. How the company will continue to adapt its strategies and maintain growth in the future, especially in light of decisions to retreat from certain ventures, remains to be seen. Nonetheless, the automaker's ability to find strength in its financial services sector offers a glimpse into the role that innovative financial tools and increased consumer access to credit could play in shaping the future of the automotive industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Friday Night Lights Movie plot: Bissinger followed the team for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State semi-finals against Carter High School from Dallas, who eventually went on to win the championship game but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury.

Hydrostatic gauges (such as the mercury column manometer) consist of a vertical column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures. The column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube. The simplest design is a closed-end U-shaped tube, one side of which is connected to the region of interest. Any fluid can be used, but mercury is preferred for its high density and low vapour pressure. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from 1 torr (100 Pa) to above atmospheric. An important variation is the McLeod gauge which isolates a known volume of vacuum and compresses it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column. The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10−6 torr (0.1 mPa), which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology. Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures, but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-controlled properties. These indirect measurements must be calibrated via a direct measurement, most commonly a McLeod gauge.

Would \\"With a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the face amount is all that is paid out.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"A Variable Universal Life (VUL) insurance policy is a type of permanent life insurance that combines the features of universal life insurance with the flexibility of investing in a variety of sub-accounts, much like mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Before analyzing whether the statement given is a reasonable answer, let's dive deeper into how VUL policies work. VUL policies have three primary components: 1. Premium Payments: Policyholders are required to pay premiums, which are often flexible, allowing the policyholder to decide the amount and frequency of premiums up to certain limits. These premiums fund both the cost of insurance, administrative fees, and any additional investments within the policy. 2. Death Benefit: This is the guaranteed payout to the policy's beneficiaries upon the death of the insured. With VUL policies, the policyholder can choose between two types of death benefits – a fixed face amount (also known as 'Level') or an increasing face amount ('Variable'), which includes the original face amount plus any additional cash value accumulated in the policy. 3. Cash Value: The investments made with the policy's surplus premiums (i.e., the portion not used for insurance costs or fees) are placed in the cash value component. Policyholders can allocate these investments among various sub-accounts with different risk and return profiles. The cash value can grow or decrease over time, depending on the performance of the sub-accounts' investments. If needed, policyholders can borrow or withdraw funds from the cash value without triggering a taxable event, as long as the policy remains active. Now, let's analyze the statement given: \\"With a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the face amount is all that is paid out.\\" The statement refers mainly to a whole life policy, not a VUL policy. While both policies provide a death benefit and build cash value, their structure and flexibility are different. A whole life policy provides a guaranteed death benefit, a guaranteed cash value growth, and fixed premiums for the life of the policy. In contrast, a VUL policy offers a flexible premium structure, the possibility of choosing between different types of death benefits, and the option to invest in multiple sub-accounts. In conclusion, the given statement would be a reasonable answer provided the question was about whole life insurance policies. However, in the context of a VUL policy, it doesn't exactly address the working mechanism or unique features of VUL. Instead, a more accurate answer to the question of how VULs work should focus on the flexibility of premium payments, the different types of death benefits, and the investment aspect involved in the cash value component."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - get larger - evaporation - self destruction - shrinkage A:","completion":"Cells in a hypertonic solution will experience shrinkage as water leaves the cell via osmosis. Before delving into the details, it's essential to understand that in biological systems, the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane is affected by solute concentrations through a process called osmosis. In conditions of isotonicity, solute concentrations are equal on both sides of the membrane, so there's no net movement of water. However, a cell in a hypertonic solution is in a different situation. If a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, the solute concentration outside the cell is greater than inside the cell. This difference in concentration sets up a concentration gradient that causes water to move out of the cell and into the surrounding hypertonic solution. This movement is due to osmosis, where water moves from areas of lower solute concentration (inside the cell) to areas of higher solute concentration (outside the cell) to achieve a balance. As water continues to leave the cell, the cell starts to lose its volume, causing a decrease in cell size—a process termed crenation in animal cells. This shrinkage may lead to significant changes in the cell's internal structure and functioning. For example, in red blood cells, shrinkage can lead to a disruption in the ability to transport oxygen efficiently. Further severe instances may even lead to cell death. This harmful effect is the reason why maintaining the right balance of fluids and electrolytes within our body systems is crucial for overall homeostasis. It should be noted that the reverse process occurs when a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution. Here, the solute concentration is greater inside the cell than outside, and water tends to flow into the cell, causing it to swell or even burst in a process called lysis. In conclusion, when cells are placed in a hypertonic solution, they do not get larger, there is no evaporation involved, and it doesn't necessarily result in self-destruction (although it might in extreme situations). The primary response is shrinkage due to the outflow of water from the cells via the process of osmosis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Children are known to be very keen observers and once they are interested in something, it is very likely to stay with them for life. They tend to look at life through the eyes of the person they are close to or want to be like. If their role model is optimistic, there are more chances of them optimistic. The role model becomes their standard of measurement. Because they follow the actions of their role models so closely, children adopt the personality and attitude of their role models. Children learn to like or dislike certain things by _ the personality and attitude of the people they admire. One reason why children keep changing their answers to \\"what would you like to be when you grow up\\" is that they are influenced by individuals in a certain field. Children view the social relationships (family or public) mainly in the light of the importance these relationships hold in the life of their role models. Their expression of their feelings is many times a reflection of their role model's outlook. According to a study, around 56% of teenagers identified with the role models. Out of these, those having personal or direct contact with their role models had higher self-esteem and were better at academics compared to those who didn't. As such, children who have positive role models, have more self-confidence and are more optimistic about their future. They learn to handle themselves well in social settings and positively interact with those around them. Of course, children who have their parents as positive role models have a well-rounded outlook towards life. They find it easier to deal with the highs and lows of life because they have seen their parents do it before. They find a sense of stability and security knowing that they will overcome failures just like their parents before them. Besides, it becomes easier for parents to discipline and guide children.

Please briefly summarize this news article: A Swarm of Startups Are Filling the Uber Void in Austin Nature abhors a vacuum—and so does business. Just three weeks ago, Uber and Lyft ceased operations in Austin, Texas, following a public referendum that imposed what the transportation network companies considered onerous regulations. And now, in what is arguably America’s second-largest hub of tech startup culture, a half-dozen new or previously lesser-known competitors are angling for a taste of the leftovers. “They left a factory overnight with the machines running and the workers standing by,” Joe Liemandt told Austin Business Observer of the sudden opportunity. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Leimandt is part of a team of local tech leaders working to build RideAustin, a nonprofit ride-hailing service that will channel some revenue to charity. RideAustin is still gearing up, and hopes to launch in June. Other alternatives are moving in fast. Boston-based Fasten will launch Austin service on June 1st, backed by 9.1 million in capital. Fare, produced by Phoenix-based Ride Fare, is already operating in Austin, and says it has processed 700 drivers through the first stage of Austin’s required background check. Dallas-based Get Me is already operating in Austin, along with zTrip and Wingz. There’s also Arcade City, which skirts the new regulations (at least, for now) by allowing drivers to negotiate their own rates, and is planning an app based on the Ethereum blockchain. For more on the Austin ride-hailing saga, watch our video: The Austin government is actively helping these new entrants, including by hosting a job fair and running a hotline to connect former Uber and Lyft drivers with new operators. Though losing one city won’t seriously slow down either Uber or Lyft, the rush of alternatives suggests some shortsightedness in their decision to play chicken with city regulators. While a ride-sharing service isn’t necessarily the easiest thing in the world to build, it also clearly doesn’t have the kind of technological moat that makes it irreproducible. The fact that this is Austin, a major hub of the tech business, has further implications. A foothold in the city could give companies a serious platform for going national, particularly with the huge visibility provided by the annual South by Southwest festival. Of course, the next SXSW is still nine months away, and it’s entirely possible Uber and Lyft will cave in and return to Austin by then. Summary:","completion":"A few weeks ago, Uber and Lyft stopped working in Austin, Texas because they didn't like some new rules the city made. Now, many other companies are trying to do the same type of business that Uber and Lyft did in Austin.
