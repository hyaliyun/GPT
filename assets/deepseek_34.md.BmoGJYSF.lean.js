Because -13 plus 13 is Zero and you get it out of your way. So now, your equation looks like this: -5 + 13 = -4*s. But when you add -5 and 13 together, you get 8. So it's like we have: 8 = -4*s. Next step is to get 's' by itself. To do that, we're going to divide both sides of our equation by -4 because -4 divided by -4 is 1, and we only want 1 's' not -4 's'. So, when you divide 8 by -4, you will get -2 and that's the value of 's'. So, 's' is equal to -2! So, the answer is... s = -2!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Who is the plaintiff in Hill v. McDonough?\\" is in \\"Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\\".

In 60 years, the Queen has never put a foot wrong in public. And for the last 24 of them, it turns out she's had a secret weapon -- the nice Ella Slack. The former BBC manager has, unknown to anyone except a handful of key advisers, spent the last quarter of a century acting as the Queen's official stand-in at rehearsals for royal events. The 69-year-old has never accepted a penny for her royal service, considering it \\"a pleasure and an honour\\" to ensure that everything runs smoothly for the Queen. \\"How many people in the world have had a chance to sit in a royal landau or walk onto the dais at Windsor Castle even before the Queen has done so?\\" she said.

She began her remarkable role in 1988, when she was working as manager of the BBC's sports and events department. A producer asked her if she could stand in for the Queen to check camera angles at a rehearsal -- and her second career was born. Since then, from the State Opening of Parliament to the 50th anniversary of Victory day, wherever the Queen is on duty Miss Slack is likely to have been there first.

The film proper begins during the Balkan Wars of 1912. While his troops are burying their dead, General Pherides (Karloff) and American reporter Oliver Davis (Marc Cramer) visit the Isle of the Dead to pay their respects to the General's long-dead wife. They discover the crypt despoiled; hearing a woman singing on the supposedly uninhabited island, they set out to find her. They also find retired Swiss archeologist Dr. Aubrecht (Jason Robards, Sr.), his Greek housekeeper Madame Kyra (Helen Thimig), British diplomat Mr. St. Aubyn (Alan Napier) and his pale and sickly wife (Katherine Emery), her youthful Greek companion Thea (Ellen Drew), and an English tinsmith. While Aubrecht apologizes for his part 15 years ago in inspiring local peasants to rob graves for valuable Greek artifacts, Kyra whispers to the General that a vorvolaka, in the guise of the red and rosy Thea, is in their midst. The General laughs at such superstition and accepts Aubrecht's invitation to spend the night as his guest. The next morning, the tinsmith is dead. Dr. Drossos (Ernst Deutsch) is summoned; he determines the cause to be septicemic plague and quarantines the island. The Doctor explains how plague is passed and how it may be eradicated in one day if the hot, dry sirocco winds arrive. The archeologist says that Mme. Kyra's explanationÂ â that God sends the plague to punish them for harboring a vorvolakaÂ â makes just as much sense. When Mr. St. Aubyn dies, the General demands that his body be buried immediately, to the horror of the cataleptic Mrs. St. Aubyn, who fears premature burial. Next to die is Dr. Drossos, proving that the advice of modern science does not guarantee victory over the disease. Suspicion returns to Thea, and Kyra harasses her with taunts and threats. The General vows that he will kill Thea if evidence appears that she is vorvolaka. Fearing for Thea's life, Oliver plans to escape with her, but the general...

Please write a short summary for the following article: The anti-fracking activist barred from 312.5 sq miles of Pennsylvania Vera Scroggins, an outspoken opponent of fracking, is legally barred from the new county hospital. Also off-limits, unless Scroggins wants to risk fines and arrest, are the Chinese restaurant where she takes her grandchildren, the supermarkets and drug stores where she shops, the animal shelter where she adopted her Yorkshire terrier, bowling alley, recycling centre, golf club, and lake shore. In total, 312.5 sq miles are no-go areas for Scroggins under a sweeping court order granted by a local judge that bars her from any properties owned or leased by one of the biggest drillers in the Pennsylvania natural gas rush, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation. \\"They might as well have put an ankle bracelet on me with a GPS on it and be able to track me wherever I go,\\" Scroggins said. \\"I feel like I am some kind of a prisoner, that my rights have been curtailed, have been restricted.\\" The ban represents one of the most extreme measures taken by the oil and gas industry to date against protesters like Scroggins, who has operated peacefully and within the law including taking Yoko Ono to frack sites in her bid to elevate public concerns about fracking. It was always going to be an unequal fight when Scroggins, now 63, made it her self-appointed mission five years ago to stop fracking in this, the richest part of the Marcellus Shale. Just how unequal became clear on 21 October when the case of Cabot v Scroggins came before a local judge, Kenneth Seamans, in the Montrose court house. Cabot turned up with four lawyers and nine witnesses, employees of the company and the firm it hired to provide security. Scroggins represented herself. She told the court she had been unable to find a lawyer as the hearing had been called on 72 hours' notice. By the time the hearing was over, the judge had granted Cabot a temporary injunction barring Scroggins from all property owned or leased by the company. \\"It is hereby ordered that Ms Scroggins is restrained, enjoined and prohibited from entering upon property owned and/or leased by Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation including but not limited to well sites, well pads and access roads,\\" the injunction reads. The effect of that ban is far broader than the dry legal language would suggest. In court filings, Cabot said it holds leases on 200,000 acres of land, equivalent to 312.5 sq miles. That amounts to nearly 40% of the largely rural county in north-eastern Pennsylvania where Scroggins lives and where Cabot does most of its drilling. The temporary injunction granted on 21 October does not require Cabot to identify or map the lands where it holds drilling leases, putting Scroggins in the bizarre position of having to figure out for herself which areas were off-limits. Cabot later offered to limit the scope of its exclusion order in court filings seeking to make the injunction permanent. The next hearing on that injunction is scheduled for 24 March. Scroggins, who now has a lawyer, is fighting to overturn the injunction. Until then, each trip Scroggins makes outside her home requires a calculation about whether her route will take her on lands or roads leased to Cabot, or a visit to the court house to pore over property records. \\"We need a map. We need to know where I can and can not go,\\" she said. \\"Can I stop here, or can I not stop here? Is it OK to be here if I go to a business or if I go to a home? I have had to ask and check out every person I go to: 'are you leased to Cabot'?\\" Many of those businesses are, it turns out. Susquehanna County is one of the most active areas in Pennsylvania's natural gas rush. Eight of the top 10 most productive gas wells are in the county, according to an industry newsletter. All eight belong to Cabot. Environmental groups say the court – and Cabot - went too far. \\"It seems to be an extraordinarily heavy handed reaction by industry and one which was extremely out of proportion to what she has been doing,\\" said Kate Sinding, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defence Council. Campaigners claim other over-reactions by industry and police against fracking opponents – such as the arrest last December of two protesters in Oklahoma for \\"terrorism hoax\\", after they unfurled a banner and dropped glitter on the floor of an office tower owned by Devon Energy. But Scroggins' lawyer, George Kinchy, says this was the first time to his knowledge that a company has used the full weight of the law against a single activist. He also said Cabot was lucky Scroggins was not represented by a lawyer at the hearing. The company was not pressed to demonstrate the gas leases gave it the right to make such absolute decisions about access. \\"They have no proof that they had the right to exclude her. They didn't present evidence of leases that gave them the right to treat the property as their own,\\" he said. Cabot refused several requests to respond, beyond a brief email statement from spokesman, George Stark. \\"Cabot has a policy of not commenting specifically on litigation to which it is a party,\\" the statement reads. \\"That being said, Cabot supports an individual's right to free speech and regrets having to seek relief from the court in order to prevent Ms Scroggins from repeatedly trespassing on company property, where she could potentially jeopardise the safety of herself and others.\\" However, the company arranged for Tom Shepstone, a consultant who blogs at Natural Gas Now, to speak on its behalf. Shepstone said the injunction was overdue. \\"I'm proud of Cabot and what they've done because they're saying we're not going to take this any longer,\\" he said. Cabot in court filings does not accuse Scroggins of violence or of causing harm to property, and she has never been arrested or charged with trespass. She has not chained herself to machinery, or staged sit-ins. But Shepstone argued Scroggins had upset too many people to be tolerated. \\"I believe she is a public menace because what she does is she essentially trespasses not so much on property – though she does do that – but she trespasses on the soul of the community,\\" he said. \\"She does not allow the people of this community any peace.\\" In the five years since fracking came to north-eastern Pennsylvania, Scroggins has been relentless in trying to exposing the risks associated with the industry. Scroggins and her then husband moved to this very rural area of north-eastern Pennsylvania from Long Island, New York more than 20 years ago, when their children were small. After various careers, Scroggins, now a grandmother, considers herself a full-time activist. She has visited frack sites – posting up to 500 videos on YouTube. She has called in health and environmental regulators at perceived violations, and she has organised bus tours of frack sites for anyone who is interested – from Yoko Ono and Susan Sarandon to visiting Canadian elected officials. None of that activity by Scroggins or other activists was illegal, or presented a public danger, according to Jason Legg, the district attorney for Susquehana County. \\"I don't recall any major protests or people trespassing on any property,\\" he said. Even by Cabot's own admission, in court testimony last October, Scroggins seems to have been more nuisance than danger. Her biggest and most repeated offence, according to court testimony, appears to have been parking her car on access roads – and at times even on the narrow public county roads – at angles that required the big water tankers to swerve around her. Scroggins, who does not appear adverse to confrontation, was also insistent on talking to personnel on site. But in every instance cited by Cabot witnesses, she left the area within 5 or 10 minutes – sometimes after they threatened to call police. By 2011 those repeat visits to gas sites made Scroggins public enemy number one, so far as Cabot was concerned. Cabot's security contractor, Northeast Diversified Services told the court it had posted photographs of Scroggins in their guards' campers, and had been following the activist since 2011. \\"Yes, we follow you, yes, from site to site,\\" the company's vice-president, Thomas Tolan, told the court. Scroggins wasn't winning friends in the community either. There are landowners in Susquehana County who have made money off leasing their land to Cabot and other gas companies for fracking. \\"The consensus is basically that it has been a lifeline to an area that was struggling,\\" Legg said. In a small town like Montrose, population 1,600, Scroggins' forceful brand of activism appears to have been too much for some – though she has a hard core of supporters. In a recent visit to the court house to check on Cabot leases, she was scolded by a court official just for striking up a conversation with the person beside her at the counter. A few minutes later, Thomas Meagher, the county solicitor, said Scroggins brought her legal problems down on herself by failing to following the \\"unwritten rules\\" of civilised discourse. Scroggins rejects the idea that \\"nice\\" has anything to do with it. \\"I am doing this as nicely as I feel is warranted. I have other concerned citizen friends who play passive and they don't get anything done more than I do. They are just in the background,\\" she said. \\"They are playing passive and nobody even hears about them. Those who want to play that womanly role, they can play it. I don't have to.\\" As for Cabot and her critics in the community, \\"They can just get used to it,\\" Scroggins said. Summary:","completion":"A lady named Vera Scroggins doesn't like fracking, which is a way to get gas from the ground. A big company called Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation does fracking in the place where Vera lives, in Pennsylvania. She has been trying to stop them from fracking for five years. She even took a famous person, Yoko Ono, to see the fracking sites. The company doesn't like Vera because she speaks against them, so they talked to a judge. The judge said that Vera can't go to any place that the company owns or leases. Because the company owns or leases a lot of places (312.5 square miles!), Vera can't go to many places anymore, like the hospital, supermarket, and even her favorite Chinese restaurant.

In the 2005 remake of King Kong, who played the writer Jack Driscoll?","completion":"In the 2005 remake of King Kong, the character of Jack Driscoll, a playwright and screenwriter, was portrayed by the talented American actor Adrien Brody. This version of the movie, directed by Peter Jackson, features an impressive ensemble cast that includes Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow, Jack Black as Carl Denham, Thomas Kretschmann as Captain Englehorn, and others. Adrien Brody is known for his intense and transformative performances that often require him to delve deeply into the emotional and psychological complexities of his characters. Brody won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Władysław Szpilman in Roman Polanski's 2002 film, The Pianist. In Jackson's King Kong, the character of Jack Driscoll encounters Skull Island alongside an ambitious filmmaker (Carl Denham) and an aspiring actress (Ann Darrow), who are on a dangerous quest to film the legendary King Kong. Driscoll finds himself drawn to Ann and comes to her rescue when she is captured by the monstrous ape. Throughout the film, Brody's character evolves from a cynical, self-centered writer to a devoted and courageous hero who is willing to risk his life to save others. The 2005 version of King Kong is an epic retelling of the classic 1933 film and brings additional depth, character development, and awe-inspiring visual effects to the timeless tale. Peter Jackson's reimagining of the story was well-received by both audiences and critics alike, and Brody's portrayal of Jack Driscoll contributed to the film's success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Then, we backtrack from the right bottom of the matrix and collect the elements which are common in both lists. Here are the steps of the process: 1. Initialize a matrix LCS with (len(A) + 1) rows and (len(B) + 1) columns. Fill the matrix with zeros. The reason we add 1 to the length of A and B is because we need an extra row and column for the case where we take no elements from A and B respectively. 2. Starting from the second row and second column (i.e., index 1,1), we update each cell LCS[i][j] based on this rule: if A[i-1] == B [j-1] then LCS[i][j] = LCS[i-1][j-1] + 1, else LCS[i][j] = max (LCS[i-1][j], LCS[i][j-1]). This rule basically means if the elements A[i-1] and B[j-1] are the same, then the length of the common subsequence considering till i-th element of A and j-th element of B would be one more than the length of the common subsequence till (i-1)th element of A and (j-1)th element of B. Otherwise, the length would be the maximum between considering (i-1)th element of A or considering (j-1)th element of B. 3. Once the matrix is filled, the cell LCS[len(A)][len(B)] will contain the length of LCS but we need to extract the actual sequence. Start from LCS[len(A)][len(B)] and trace back the elements: if A[i] == B[j], that means the element is a part of the LCS and we add it to the sequence. Then move diagonally to LCS[i-1][j-1]. If A[i] != B[j], compare LCS[i][j-1] and LCS[i-1][j], move towards the direction of the larger value.

Highly political, they fused anarchist, anti-fascist and anti-Nazi views with punk vocals and the newly emerging techno sound called digital hardcore, which is a term band member Alec Empire used as the name of his record label. - Alec Empire (born Alexander Wilke-Steinhof on 2 May 1972 in Charlottenburg, West Berlin) is a German musician who is best known as a founding member of the band Atari Teenage Riot. Also a prolific and distinguished solo artist, producer and DJ, he has released well over a hundred albums, EPs and singles and remixed over seventy tracks for various artists including Björk. He was also the driving force behind the creation of the digital hardcore subgenre and the record labels Digital Hardcore Recordings and Eat Your Heart Out. - The Future of War is the follow - up album to Delete Yourself by Atari Teenage Riot . Faster and harder than their previous effort , the album sees ATR 's only female member at the time Hanin Elias providing vocals for a larger share of the songs . In May 2002 , The Future of War was placed on the Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien index in Germany , meaning that it may not be advertised or sold to minors . According to band member Alec Empire , Future of War was notable for its \`\` left - rooted critique of the ' modern ' high - tech - war , as we had seen it all some years previously during the Gulf War .

Solve -9*b + 153 = 16*b - 97 for b.","completion":"To solve the equation -9*b + 153 = 16*b - 97 for the variable b, follow these steps: 1. Get all the terms with b on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. To do this, let's add 9*b to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -9*b on the left side and add 97 to both sides to eliminate the -97 on the right side. Here's how it looks: -9*b + 153 + 9*b = 16*b - 97 + 9*b 153 = 16*b - 97 + 9*b 2. Combine the terms with b on the right side of the equation. Since both terms on the right side have b, we can combine them: 153 = (16*b + 9*b) - 97 153 = 25*b - 97 3. Isolate the b by moving the constant term to the other side. To get b by itself on the right side, we need to add 97 to both sides of the equation: 153 + 97 = 25*b 250 = 25*b 4. Solve for b by dividing both sides by the coefficient of b. The coefficient of b is 25. To solve for b, divide both sides of the equation by 25: 250 / 25 = 25*b / 25 10 = b So the solution for the equation is b = 10."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. I am facing a new situation today: Two friends liked studying about the Earth's atmosphere. Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect.

When examining the grammatical aspects of the two sentences, the key difference lies in the use of the articles \\"a\\" and \\"the\\". In English, \\"a\\" is an indefinite article, which is used to refer to a non-specific or nonsingular item. In contrast, \\"the\\" is a definite article that is used to refer to a specific or singular item. 1. It is a part of Panama City -- Lynn Haven -- Panama City Beach. This sentence is using the indefinite article \\"a\\" before the phrase \\"part of Panama City -- Lynn Haven -- Panama City Beach.\\" By using \\"a,\\" the speaker implies that there are multiple parts to this area and that they are referring to just one of those parts. It also implies that the part being referred to is not unique, and there could be other parts that share similar characteristics. 2. It is part of the Panama City -- Lynn Haven -- Panama City Beach. In this sentence, \\"the\\" precedes \\"Panama City -- Lynn Haven -- Panama City Beach,\\" which implies that the speaker is referring to a specific area encompassing Panama City, Lynn Haven, and Panama City Beach. By using \\"the,\\" the speaker is stating that the subject being discussed is a part of, or belongs to, this particular region. Analyzing the contextual meaning of the sentences, both imply that there is a relationship between the subject (referred to as \\"it\\") and the area comprising Panama City, Lynn Haven, and Panama City Beach. In summary, although the two sentences have slightly different grammatical structures, their overall meaning is quite similar. Both sentences convey the idea that the subject is related to or part of the geographical area encompassing Panama City, Lynn Haven, and Panama City Beach. However, the first sentence with \\"a part of\\" can suggest a slightly more ambiguous relationship compared to the second sentence using \\"part of the,\\" which conveys a more definite connection.

Please answer the following question: WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What, exactly, is different between Mahayana and other sects of Buddhism? Context: There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools. From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.

Instructions: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Input: All eukaryotes have three nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, namely, Pol I, II, and III. Interestingly, plants have catalytic subunits for a fourth nuclear polymerase, Pol IV. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that Pol IV does not functionally overlap with Pol I, II, or III and is nonessential for viability. However, disruption of the Pol IV catalytic subunit genes NRPD1 or NRPD2 inhibits heterochromatin association into chromocenters, coincident with losses in cytosine methylation at pericentromeric 5S gene clusters and AtSN1 retroelements. Loss of CG, CNG, and CNN methylation in Pol IV mutants implicates a partnership between Pol IV and the methyltransferase responsible for RNA-directed de novo methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, 5S gene and AtSN1 siRNAs are essentially eliminated in Pol IV mutants.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: Any microscope will do, but a compound microscope is the best kind for observing microscopic, transparent specimens, such as dust mites. You can buy a compound microscope online or from a retailer that sells them to schools, hospitals, and research organizations. You can also acquire a cheap microscope with a 10x magnification lens from a toy store, hobby store, or thrift store. You need to use at least 10x magnification when viewing dust mites under a microscope. Using a clear piece of tape, pick up clumps of dust from surfaces such as shelves or the floor. Put the tape on the slide under the lens of the microscope with the power set to at least 10x magnification. Dust mites are 0.3 millimetres (0.012 in) in size, so they can’t be seen with the naked eye. Use a lint-free, microfiber cloth to handle the slide to avoid getting fingerprints on the glass. Carry the slide between your thumb and forefinger by its sides rather than by the top and bottom. The stage is located at the front of the microscope under the objective lenses. It’s a flat, square platform with metal clips on it for holding slides. Gently lift the clips and close them over each end of the slide to hold it in place. Don’t force the slides under the clips, as they are fragile and can be easily broken. A power switch on the bottom controls the light. Use the dimmer switch by pushing it forward and backward to adjust the lighting. Adjust the light intensity to low with the dimmer switch at the bottom right of the microscope. When you turn the microscope on, increase the light intensity to a level that isn’t too bright or too low. A ring-like object called the diaphragm lets you control the amount of light that reaches the specimen. You can rotate this with your hand to adjust the amount of light under the specimen. It’s located under the stage. You can rotate it by simply turning it with your fingers. This is the level at which dust mites can be seen. If the dust mites are still out of focus, increase the power objective until you see them clearly. They have long hairs along the edges of their bodies and short hairs all over their bodies. They don’t have eyes or antennae. Under a microscope, you’ll see dust mites crawling all over one another. Dust mites’ mouths resemble heads.","completion":"To observe dust mites under a microscope, use a compound microscope with at least 10x magnification.

[POLL]\\" Introduction: The world has always been defined by its constantly changing landscape. Time and time again, decisions are made on a global scale impacting the lives of millions. Controversial moves always spark a divide amongst public opinion, with some supporting the decision while others vehemently disagree. In the current era, where digital advancements have made communication and polling much easier, these controversial issues can now be discussed and debated widely. It is imperative that we take a step back and reflect on whether a particular decision was indeed a smart move. In this article, we explore some of the most debated decisions in recent history and present the results from our exclusive poll. Climate Change and the Paris Agreement: Climate change has been a hot topic, and with good reason. The Paris Agreement, which aims to unite the world in combating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, was a major turning point in environmental discussions. While the majority of nations united in support of the Paris Agreement, the United States notably withdrew from it in 2020 under the Trump administration. This decision sparked a heated debate on whether or not it was a smart move for the United States. Our exclusive poll found that 72% of respondents felt that withdrawing from the Paris Agreement was a bad decision - primarily due to the scientific consensus on the adverse effects of climate change. Conversely, 28% agreed with the withdrawal, citing economic and sovereignty concerns. Britain's Brexit Decision: Brexit, the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, has been an ongoing discussion for almost half a decade. This controversial move has created divisions not just in Europe, but across the world as well. While some argue that Brexit enables the UK to regain control over its borders and economic policies, others believe it jeopardizes access to the single market and exposes the UK to uncertainties in global trade. Our poll results revealed that 58% of respondents considered Brexit to be a smart move, while 42% disagreed. Reasons for support included preserving national identity and asserting autonomy, whereas those opposed cited economic risks and a potential weakening of British influence over European affairs. COVID-19 Pandemic Management: Organizations and governments worldwide have implemented various strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. From strict lockdowns to more relaxed approaches, there are stark contrasts in how countries have handled the crisis. With the virus still prevalent, it remains debatable whether certain tactics were smarter than others. In our poll, it was found that 59% of respondents thought that strict lockdowns were a smart move in the initial stage of the pandemic, praising the strategy for slowing the spread of the virus and buying time for healthcare infrastructure to prepare. However, 41% disagreed and argued the detrimental impact on the economy and mental health eclipsed the benefits of lockdowns. Conclusion: In an increasingly connected world, people's opinions on significant global decisions are now more diverse than ever. Our exclusive poll helps to shed light on public opinion regarding some of the most impactful events in recent history. While there may never be a unanimous agreement on whether a certain decision was smart or not, these results provide valuable insights into the ongoing debates around these major issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - nuclei and neutrons - photons and protons - electrons and neutrons - electrons and protons A: Answer:","completion":"All atoms have equal numbers of electrons and protons. Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter and are composed of three main types of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. These particles are organized in a particular structure, with protons and neutrons residing in the nucleus (the central part of the atom) and electrons orbiting around the nucleus in what is referred to as electron shells or energy levels. Protons carry a positive electric charge, whereas electrons carry a negative electric charge. Neutrons, on the other hand, have no electric charge (they are neutral). The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is called its atomic number, which is unique for each element and serves to distinguish one element from another. In a neutral atom (i.e., an atom that has no overall electric charge), the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. This is because the negative charge of the electrons exactly balances the positive charge of the protons, resulting in a net charge of zero. For instance, carbon atoms have an atomic number of 6, which means that they have 6 protons in their nucleus. In a neutral carbon atom, there are also 6 electrons orbiting the nucleus. The number of neutrons in an atom can vary without changing the identity of the element. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. For example, the element carbon has isotopes with different numbers of neutrons (carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14), but all carbon isotopes have 6 protons and 6 electrons, which maintain their identity as carbon atoms. In summary, all atoms have an equal number of electrons and protons, ensuring that they remain electrically neutral and maintain their unique elemental identity. Neutrons, although important for atomic stability, do not play a direct role in the overall balance of charge within an atom."},{"prompt":"Q:- Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves What might be the last step of the process?

As the World Health Organization (WHO) warned of the potential increase of dengue fever and other climate-sensitive illnesses, Japan saw an almost-seven decade streak of being dengue fever-free end. In the past week, at least 55 people have become ill with dengue fever, confirming fears that the fever, last seen in 1945, is back. The cases have one thing in common -- those affected all appear to have visited Yoyogi Park, one of Tokyo's largest outdoor spaces, and all have complained of mosquito bites. Following fumigation last week, the health ministry and Tokyo metropolitan government trapped and analyzed about 100 mosquitoes from the park and, found strains of the virus, prompting authorities to close large parts of the park as of Thursday afternoon. This week, two models, Saaya, 20, and Eri Aoki, 25, who were filming for \\"King's Brunch,\\" a variety show, in the park, were struck down with the virus, the Nikkan Sports newspaper reported. The dengue outbreak in Japan has seen victims from the age of 10 to those in their 70's. While most people recover within a week, the disease can create discomfort and and can, in rare cases, cause death. The disease, which is mainly transmitted by a type of mosquito (Aedes aegypti), is found in tropical and subtropical climates worldwide. Symptoms include fever, severe headache, rashes and pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain. Harrowing experience. By all accounts, contracting dengue fever is a harrowing experience. Chris Dwyer, formerly of CNN and now a Hong Kong-based communications consultant, contracted dengue while on vacation in Malaysia in July. Back in Hong Kong after a few days, Dwyer found himself unusually lethargic in the afternoon. The following day he had a fever and a temperature, which got progressively worse. \\"By the onset of that evening I had appalling pain in my joints, really achy, weak limbs and just a sense that I wasn't well at all,\\" he said. \\"This was unlike anything else, it was so debilitating.\\" Eventually, he was admitted into hospital and eventually recovered. where he was put on a drip while doctors monitored his liver and white blood cell count. \\"As far as I understand it I was lucky... there are other symptoms that I've heard are pretty gruesome,\\" he said. Worldwide problem. While dengue fever is not transmitted human to human, the Japanese health ministry said that domestic mosquitoes could have picked it up from people infected abroad. Almost half the world's population lives in high-risk countries, the WHO says. Last year, Singapore suffered a sweeping epidemic, which saw four die of the disease and over 12,000 become infected. Takeshi Kurosu, an assistant professor at Osaka University's Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, said that the Tokyo outbreak was most likely imported into the country by an infected individual, who then transmitted it to domestic mosquitoes. \\"Probably one person who was infected outside Japan went to (Yoyogi) park,\\" he said. \\"It's possible that there was an infected mosquito (transported to Japan) in a bag, but the patient numbers indicate that it was likely an infected person.\\" He says that it is likely that there have been previous, small and undiagnosed outbreaks in Japan before, but this one was flagged by a doctor who had experience spotting the symptoms of the virus. To date there have been no fatalities in the Japanese outbreak, and Kurosu is confident that the virus can be contained. \\"It will (most likely) be controlled. It will be autumn soon and this type of mosquito can't survive the cold weather.\\" Climate-linked spread. The disease is on the rise, and over half of the world's population live in dengue endemic areas. The Japanese outbreak comes as a WHO conference examining the links between health and climate change warned of the risks of infectious diseases like malaria and dengue which are strongly influenced by climate. Higher humidity and temperatures mean mosquitoes can survive longer, increasing the likelihood for transmitting diseases and being able to travel to a wider geographic range. \\"Vulnerable populations, the poor, the disadvantaged and children are among those suffering the greatest burden of climate-related impacts and consequent diseases, such as malaria, diarrhea and malnutrition, which already kill millions every year,\\" said Dr. Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General, Family, Women's and Children's Health in a press release. \\"Without effective action to mitigate and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change on health, society will face one of its most serious health challenges.\\" Kurosu agrees that climate change is a factor, giving rise to longer periods that infected mosquitoes can survive. Adverse conditions, such as drought, however, can also impede the spread of the disease. Drought in parts of India this summer has denied the mosquitoes the water that their larvae need to develop, leading to \\"extremely low\\" numbers of dengue cases this year, the Times of India reported. Urban centers affected worst. Kurosu says, the primary cause of the spread of dengue fever is linked to population movement and the rapid urbanization of developing countries, the majority of which are in the tropical zone most often affected by dengue fever. There is no cure for, and no vaccination against, dengue fever, The disease can develop into a \\"potentially lethal complication\\" called severe dengue, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever. The WHO estimates that there are over 50-100 million cases of dengue worldwide each year, although a new study says the true number may be four times as high as that appraisal.

If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%.

Is the premise \\"Two girls sitting on a chair being sketched.\\" true if \\"Someone is sketching a picture of two girls.\\"?","completion":"The premise \\"Two girls sitting on a chair being sketched.\\" can be considered as true if \\"Someone is sketching a picture of two girls,\\" depending on the context and the actual subject of the sketch. To fully analyze the situation, we must consider several factors. First, let's review the statements and their meanings: 1. \\"Two girls sitting on a chair being sketched.\\" - This statement focuses on the subject of the sketch, describing the scene as two girls sitting on a chair and someone sketching them. 2. \\"Someone is sketching a picture of two girls.\\" - This statement provides information that someone is actively sketching, and the subject of the sketch is two girls. Now, let's elaborate on different possible scenarios to determine whether the premise is true in each case: Scenario A: If the sketch artist is indeed drawing a picture of two girls sitting on a chair, then the premise is absolutely true. The scene described in the first statement aligns with the information provided in the second statement. Scenario B: If the sketch artist is drawing two girls, but they are not sitting on a chair, the premise is only partially true. The second statement holds true in this case as it mentions someone sketching two girls. However, the first statement is not accurate since the girls are not sitting on a chair, altering the scene. Scenario C: If the sketch artist is drawing two girls sitting on a chair, but the finished sketch does not show them in that scene (e.g., it was an initial pose that was later changed), the premise could be seen as true, but not in the final outcome. In these circumstances, the premise is true from the standpoint of intent, but not in the final execution. In conclusion, the premise \\"Two girls sitting on a chair being sketched\\" can be considered true if \\"Someone is sketching a picture of two girls\\" under certain scenarios. The truth of the premise can be confirmed when the sketch artist draws two girls sitting on a chair as the final subject. If the girls are not sitting on a chair in the sketch, the premise is only partially true, and if the intent changes during the process and the final sketch does not show them sitting on a chair, the premise holds true only during the initial stage. To avoid ambiguity, a clearer statement could be framed as, \\"Someone is sketching a picture of two girls who are sitting on a chair.\\" This statement unifies the information and affirms the accuracy of the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Euro 2012 Soccer Live Blog: England vs. Italy This game surprised me at the start with its pace. Now, though, we're back to a classic Italian display. The midfield is gluing the ball to its feet and searching with passes that end with wasted shots. An Italian miscommunication sends England on the break. Oh, but it ends with a lousy cross that's easily intercepted. Ooh! Abate puts a cross in toward the back post. Cassano headed back in front of goal and Balotelli tried to shoot, but Terry cleared it for a corner. That was the most tactical setup of the half. But like all efforts before, it ended with a whole lotta nothing. One of the problems England is having is that Italy has figured out how to slow down their counterattacks. In the first 10 minutes, England's passing and pace were overwhelming the Italians. Now Italy is pressuring the passes and shifting that gearbox from fifth to first. Speaking of that defense, it just put a perfect tackle on Rooney, which incensed the Englishman. We should start a betting pool for which striker (Balotelli or Rooney) flies off the handle first. Ooh, and while I'm typing, Cassano hits a good shot. Italy might be one of the only soccer nations where fans consider their defenders to be superstars on par with strikers. They're like the Pittsburgh Steelers of international soccer. You know there haven't been many whistles thus far. And that's impressive, given it's Italy on the pitch. This game has only had five fouls. I'll call that one a record. After dozing off, we've had two shots on opposing ends to spark this one back to life. First Balotelli hit a shot on the volley that was a good effort, just right at Hart. And then Rooney teed one up for Welbeck, who wasted the pass with a wide left shot. Still, it was action! One theory could be that England is letting the Italians pressure them to open the Italian backside for a counterattack. But that's probably over-thinking this one. I think we're witnessing Italian passing superiority. Italy is taking control in the midfield courtesy of the maestro Pirlo. England had that early wave of attacks, but they've gone cold for the last 10 minutes. Let's use history as our guide for predicting the rest of this game. Italy has won 10 times in the Euro quarterfinals. England, on the other hand, usually loses if they even make it this far. Oh, man, Balotelli somehow stayed onside for a long through ball. It was him, Terry and Hart. Balotelli couldn't get his shot off in time, and Terry went all kamikaze in front of it. The ball bounced off Terry and out of danger. Big waste by the Italians. Best line from the commentators thus far: \\"That referee's assistant is awfully eager.\\" It was in reference to a tugging foul against Balotelli. Now I wish our American commentators weren't so afraid of giving the refs a little ribbing when they goose a call. Balzaretti wins a corner from pretty much nothing, but it's easily covered. I believe we're dangerously close to entering the doldrums, when Italy grinds a game to a crawl. I could be wrong, though. Italy is regaining some control in the midfield, but England's defense is covering passes well. England also has eight guys around the box when Italy is advancing, which makes shooting within 30 yards a non-starter. Cassano takes the free kick and botches it big time. England goal kick. Hey, Balotelli is still in the game! We haven't seen him since the opening minutes. He wins a free kick on the right touch line after a foul by Lescott. One of the better shots ESPN is using during this tournament is the slow-motion replay of goalies yelling at their defense. I think you can actually see the moment Buffon almost had a mini stroke after yelling about a cross that Rooney headed over the goal. I wish there were a way to bet on the pace of the game. I think if anyone thought this one would start at lightning speed, he would have been betting on 99-to-1 odds. And he'd be cashing a ticket right now. It's still electric, and England is controlling the midfield. Rooney sneaks down the back line and tries to connect with Welbeck at the near post. It's a corner, but Banucci heads it clear. I think Italy is a bit surprised by the cohesion of the British attack. England is playing an aggressive game, but each time they go forward, they cough it up and Italy is looking sharp on the counterattack. Buffon's wingspan is equal to a pterodactyl. He threw up a left arm and easily got a hand on Johnson's shot, which a more human goalkeeper would have totally missed. So much for a timid game. These teams are playing on fire (a la NBA Jam c. 1993). Now it's Glen Johnson's turn! A Milner cross landed at Johnson's feet just a couple of yards (or meters) from the goal. He hit it, but the giant Buffon got a mitt on it. Great chance and a great save. De Rossi hits the post! The volley had Hart beaten, and it was swerving toward the upper corner. It just swerved a little too much and tapped the woodwork. Great start for Italy. Good movement from the Italians. De Rossi tried a through ball for Balotelli, who let it go, but Cassano was there fro a cross. Nothing of it. Still, Italy has been in control for the last 180 seconds. Balotelli decides to give it a go on a volley from 35 yards out. It's easy for Hart and almost humorously ambitious. Game on. Italy gets it underway. Now for 90 minutes of holding soccer. Yeehaw. Wow, six Italians enter this game carrying yellow cards. If they advance, they could have a very weakened team against Germany. Not that it matters much right now. I do love the Italian anthem. It's very operatic, especially compared to England's odd variation of \\"My Country tis of Thee.\\" Almost national anthem time. If you combined all the thoughts of the sports experts, just about every English player has been problematic. Each expert seems to single out one or two, but there's never any overlap. My votes for shaky play go to Johnson and Milner. The pregame punditry seems to think Rooney will drop back as a fifth midfielder should the Italians cause possession issues. So it looks like Italy will be playing 4-3-1-2. That's actually quite a standard formation. I'm disappointed. England is going for ye olde 4-4-2. I have no idea what Italy's formation will look like today. Probably something like 2-7-1. They've played some interesting formations in the tournament thus far. So instead of guessing at tactics, I'll just give you the roster. Buffon is the goalie (and the only player on the pitch who was there when these two countries last played in a tournament 10 years ago). His defense includes Balzaretti, Abate, Barzagli and Bonucci. Marchisio, De Rossi, Montolivo and Pirlo are the Italian midfield. And, oh look, Balotelli gets the start along with Cassano. Roy Hodgson did not make a change for the starting lineup. In fact, a criticism of his managing style is that he rarely makes a change, even when things aren't working. But this roster is. Hart is in goal with the usual back four of Johnson, Cole, Terry and Lescott. The midfield is anchored by the captain Gerrard. He's joined by Young, Milner and Parker. Wayne Rooney is up front with Welbeck in support. Standard fare, really. The reward for winning Group D was avoiding Spain. The kicker? That team, England, now has to play Italy. The press is seemingly always saying Italy is too old and too far gone to win tournaments. And yet they almost always make it this far, if not all the way to the title. (See: World Cup 2006.) England entered the tournament like they almost always do: hyped by the hometown press to win it but with cracks in the framework showing. What does all that gobbledegook mean? Both England and Italy will likely play a pensive, holding game today. They're both fearful of leaving the defense exposed. So, like most of Italy's matches, this one has all the makings of a 1-0 win or even a victory through penalty kicks. Which team pulls out that win is a tough one to predict. England has looked much more tactical and organized under Roy Hodgson. Instead of a collection of egos and pretty boys, the English have formulated attacks and held on in defense. But we don't want to fall prey to the British tabloid habit of overhyping. England also looked shaky and uncertain against Ukraine. Wayne Rooney's winner in that game was more of a sigh of relief than an exclamation point. Rooney's return meant England had a reliable attacking option, but he wasn't an offensive force at first. Rooney could be the lynchpin for an English victory against Italy, but he has a tendency to exit major tournament games with injuries or red cards. Speaking of tempers, Mario Balotelli might well be the deciding factor in this game. He's known equally for his brilliance in goalscoring and his boneheadedness in earning red cards. The cliche of saying \\"which Mario will show up\\" couldn't be truer. If he's out for goal-scoring blood, it'll be trouble for England. If he's out for regular old blood, then Italy could be playing down a man. Italy has already managed a tie against Spain, which is a victory in itself. They've shown they are comfortable changing tactics depending on the opponent. And they should feel confident that their defensive midfielders and back line can handle what England brings. England avoided Spain, but whoever wins today gets the equally unenviable task of facing Germany. We'll find out who that is this afternoon.

To do that, we need to get \\"a\\" by itself on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 14.

Given the following context: Hex Enduction Hour was the first Fall album to make the UK Albums Chart, where it spent three weeks, peaking at no. 71. By mid-1983 it had sold 20,000 copies, reflecting a surge in the band's popularity, and five years into their career brought them to the attention of record labels. Critics were highly enthusiastic; according to Simon Ford, they could \\"have hardly been more supportive\\". Reviewing the album in the NME, Richard Cook described the band as tighter and more disciplined than in earlier recordings, \\"their master piece to date\\", while still maintaining their impact. He praised the band's use of recording-studio techniques and atmospherics without resorting to glamorisation. Melody Maker's Colin Irwin said it was \\"incredibly exciting and utterly compelling\\". A dissenter was Neil McCormick of Irish fortnightly Hot Press, who dismissed the album as secondhand melodramatic punk and wondered if the album was \\"meant to be minimalist or primitive then it fatally ignores the true primitivism of the strong melody and accessible lyrics found in folk music.\\"Later, Record Collector described the album as a \\"taut, twitchy and ominous masterclass in DIY post-punk\\", and singled out Smith's lyrics for praise. The Quietus, in 2009, wrote of the album as \\"arguably ... The Fall's mightiest hour\\", while Stylus Magazine wrote that \\"Hex demonstrates the culmination of 'early' Fall: a monolithic beast of ragged grooves piloted through the embittering miasma of English society by the verbose acidity/Joycean all-inclusiveness of Mark E.

Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music initially became popular in Chicago clubs in 1984, pioneered by figures such as Frankie Knuckles, Phuture, Kym Mazelle, and Mr. Fingers, and was associated with African-American and gay subcultures. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, Baltimore, and Newark all of which developed their own regional scenes.

Israel's Prison Service released footage on Sunday, May 7, 2017, that it says shows Barghouti,... (Associated Press) JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's Prison Service released footage on Sunday that it says shows the leader of a mass Palestinian hunger strike breaking his fast, a claim dismissed by the Palestinians as an attempt to undermine the open-ended strike, now in its 21st day. Assaf Librati, a spokesman for the prison service, said strike organizer and Palestinian uprising leader Marwan Barghouti ate a candy bar on May 5 and cookies on April 27. He said surveillance was increased and Barghouti was caught on film eating. Footage aired by Israeli media shows a prisoner sitting down fully clothed on a toilet unwrapping something and putting it in his mouth. Other footage shows a prisoner eating something near a sink. Qadoura Fares, who heads an advocacy group for Palestinian prisoners, cast doubt on the footage, saying Barghouti is being held in solitary confinement and has no access to food. \\"This is a fabrication,\\" Fares said of the footage released Sunday. \\"This is psychological warfare that we expected Israel to wage against the strike.\\" He said that \\"the prisoners will not buy this account from the Israeli side, and they will continue their strike.\\" Barghouti, a leader of the second Palestinian uprising, is serving five life terms after being convicted by an Israeli court of directing two shooting attacks and a bombing that killed five people. Barghouti, who disputed the court's jurisdiction and did not mount a defense, has been in prison since 2002. Polls suggest that the 58-year-old Barghouti is the most popular choice among Palestinians to succeed 82-year-old Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Palestinians have held large rallies in support of the hunger strike since it began. After decades of conflict, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been imprisoned at one time or another for acts ranging from stone-throwing to carrying out attacks that wounded or killed Israelis. Palestinians say the mass hunger strike is an attempt to improve conditions inside the jails and gain more family visits. Israeli officials have dismissed the strike as a bid by Barghouti to burnish his credentials in an internal Palestinian power struggle. \\"This hunger strike was never about the conditions of the convicted terrorists, which meet international standards,\\" Israeli Minister of Public Security Gilad Erdan said. \\"Barghouti is a murderer and hypocrite who urged his fellow prisoners to strike and suffer while he ate behind their back.\\" Fares said earlier Sunday that some of the hundreds of Palestinians participating in the hunger strike began taking vitamin supplements on day 15. He said guards had punished the strikers by seizing all personal items and leaving prisoners \\"with nothing except their beds.\\" He says the information comes from lawyers who recently visited the strikers. Israel holds about 6,500 Palestinians on charges related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel says 890 prisoners are participating in the hunger strike. ||||| Israel Prison Service released footage of Marwan Barghouti, one of the leaders of the hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, eating in his cell. >> Get all updates on Israel and the Palestinians: Download our free App, and Subscribe >> skip - Israel releases footage of leader of Palestinian hunger strike eating in his prison cell The prison service says Barghouti, who serves multiple life sentences for his role in the killing of Israelis during the second intifada, has twice been filmed eating since the strike began. The first time, on April 27, the footage shows him eating cookies. He removed the cookies from a hiding place in his bathroom, looked around to see that nobody was watching and then ate them. He then tried to conceal the evidence by hiding the wrapping and washing his hands and face. The second time, on May 5, he employed the same technique. This time, he was filmed eating a candy bar. At the end, he was also seen eating salt. The Israel Prison Service didn’t say how Barghouti obtained the food, but sources in the organization confirmed that they set him up in an attempt to see whether Barghouti was really sticking to the hunger strike.

Close Barghouti’s lawyer, attorney Elias Sabbagh, said in response to the video that, “This was expected as part of the psychological and media war the Israel Prison Service is conducting against the prisoners. We can’t address the content of the clip so long as they don’t let us meet with Marwan. Let us visit him and then we will check the claims with him.\\" The main demands of the hunger-striking Palestinian prisoners. ABBAS MOMANI/AFP The footage was allegedly filmed in the Kishon Prison, to which Barghouti was transferred after the strike began. “As we’ve said all along, the terrorists’ hunger strike isn’t about their prison conditions, but only about Barghouti’s desire to bolster his status in preparation for the day after Abu Mazen,” said Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, referring to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas by his nickname. “Barghouti is cynically exploiting the terrorists for a hunger strike for which they are paying and will pay a heavy price, while he himself can’t restrain his own appetites.” Barghouti was sentenced in 2004 to five life sentences after being convicted of murder. ||||| JERUSALEM — As Palestinian prisoners ended the third week of a mass hunger strike, Israel released videos that it said showed the strike leader, Marwan Barghouti, sneaking snacks in his cell. Palestinian leaders dismissed the videos, released on Sunday, as fakes aimed at deflating the strike of over 1,000 prisoners, which has stirred protests and clashes with security forces in Palestinian areas. The prisoners are demanding better conditions in Israeli jails. Prison officials said the videos showed Mr. Barghouti, the strike’s organizer, eating cookies on April 27 and then a candy bar on Friday. He is being held in solitary confinement at the Kishon prison. Israel’s public security minister, Gilad Erdan, said the strike was not about prison conditions, which he said exceeded international standards, but about Mr. Barghouti’s political goals. Though serving life sentences for five murders during the Second Intifada of the early 2000s, Mr. Barghouti, 57, is popular among Palestinians and is seen as a possible successor to the unpopular Palestinian Authority leader, Mahmoud Abbas, 82. |||||Summary:","completion":"Israel's Prison Service released footage on Sunday, May 7, showing Marwan Barghouti, the leader of a mass Palestinian hunger strike, eating. The strike, which involves around 1,000 prisoners, has been running for 21 days in protest of poor conditions in Israeli jails. Palestinians dismissed the video as fake and an attempt to discredit the strike movement. Israeli Minister of Public Security Gilad Erdan dismissed the strike as a political gesture, stating that the prison conditions in question comply with international standards.

The band is well known for politically charged lyrics and activism, focusing on anti-war activism, anti-imperialism, class struggle, human rights, and various sociopolitical sentiments. The line-up includes singer/guitarist Justin Sane and drummer Pat Thetic, who founded the band; later members are guitarist Chris Head, and singer/bassist Chris Barker (#2) who replaced Jamie \\"Cock\\" Towns, who had replaced original bassist Andy Flag in 1997 following his departure one year prior. Anti-Flag is known also for their advocacy of progressive political action groups such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International. In 2000, Anti-Flag was invited to participate in Vans Warped Tour. During this time, the members of Anti-Flag met NOFX's Fat Mike, owner of the Fat Wreck Chords record label. This meeting spawned a friendship that would lead to Anti-Flag's release of two albums on the label. In 2001, Anti-Flag teamed with punk music producer Mass Giorgini to record the album Underground Network, released on Fat Wreck Chords. The release of the album is arguably the band's breakout from the hardcore underground to a more mainstream spotlight. The album continued to address the issues of fascism (specifically neo-Nazis infiltrating the \\"hardcore scene\\") and the United States' foreign policy. The album was the first to contain the now-commonplace booklet filled with essays from historians and political commentators, most notably Professor Howard Zinn. In February 2002, Anti-Flag released the album Mobilize on A-F Records. The album featured eight new studio tracks as well as eight live tracks of songs from other albums. In the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States, Anti-Flag spoke out against the push for war with the album's title track \\"911 for peace\\". During this time, many music stores pulled Anti-Flag's records from shelves, as their music was labelled as \\"anti-American.\\" In 2003, Anti-Flag released the album The Terror State on Fat Wreck Chords. The album primarily focused on criticizing the Bush Administration's handling of the War on Terrorism. Again, the album contained a booklet full of essays from the band as well as other political commentators. The album contains a song whose lyrics were originally written by Woody Guthrie entitled \\"Post-War Breakout.\\" The track's music was arranged by the members of Anti-Flag, as Guthrie had never committed the arrangements to paper. On October 8, 2004, U.S. Representative Jim McDermott gave a speech in the House of Representatives, praising Anti-Flag for their work in encouraging young people to register and vote.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did they do anything else notable on that record label?","completion":"Yes, they did something notable on that record label.

The Rubia plant was used to make the most common dye; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans. For the wealthy, the dye used was Kermes, made from a tiny scale insect which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree. For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal; also known as Kermes vermilio or \\"Blood of Saint John\\", which was made from a related insect, the Margodes polonicus. It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes.

Article: President branded a misogynist and macho-fascist after saying mutilating women fighters would make them “useless” President Rodrigo Duterte has been branded a misogynist and “macho-fascist” after he ordered soldiers to shoot female communist rebels in the vagina. In a speech to over 200 former communist soldiers in Malacañang last week, the Philippines president gave a directive of what to do with female guerrilla fighters. Thousands dead: the Philippine president, the death squad allegations and a brutal drugs war Read more “‘There’s a new order coming from the mayor, ‘We will not kill you. We will just shoot you in the vagina,’ ” said Duterte. He went on to say that without their vaginas, women would be “useless”. Duterte mentioned the Visayan word “bisong”, meaning vagina, repeatedly throughout the speech, although it was later censored from an official Palace transcript, replaced simply with a dash. However, the remarks were recorded as having drawn laughter from the audience. The crude orders drew anger from human rights organisations and women’s groups in the region. “It is just the latest in a series of misogynist, derogatory and demeaning statements he has made about women,” said Carlos H Conde, the Philippines researcher for Human Rights Watch. “It encourages state forces to commit sexual violence during armed conflict, which is a violation of international humanitarian law.” Congresswoman Emmi de Jesus, speaking on behalf of the Gabriela Women’s Party, denounced President Rodrigo Duterte as a “macho-fascist,” and said his “anti-women” remark “takes state terrorism against women and the people to a whole new level”. She described the president as the “most dangerous macho-fascist in the government right now,” adding: “He has further presented himself as the epitome of misogyny and fascism rolled in one.” Duterte has a chequered history of making menacing and misogynistic remarks towards women. During his election campaign in 2016, speaking about the 1989 prison riot in which an Australian missionary was killed, and inmates had lined up to rape her, Duterte joked he wished he had the opportunity to rape her himself. “Was I mad because of the rape? Yes, that’s one. But, she was so beautiful, the mayor should have been first. What a waste,” he said. In May last year, he also told soldiers in Mindanao – apparently as a joke – that while martial law was imposed, he would protect them from prosecution if they raped three women. Last week it was announced that the International Criminal Court were looking into complaints that Duterte had committed crimes against humanity in his brutal and bloody war against drugs, which has seen a deat toll of over 4000. But the President said he did not mind being indicted and imprisoned by the International Criminal Court as long as it allows conjugal visits by more than one woman. His spokesperson Harry Roque subsequently dismissed the allegations that Duterte was sexist and misogynist. “You know, sometimes, these feminists are really a bit OA (overacting),” said Roque. “I mean, that’s funny. Come on. Just laugh.” ||||| MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine strongman who has earned a reputation for dirty tactics and language, was criticized on Monday for having boasted that he had ordered soldiers to shoot female communist guerrillas in the genitals. “Tell the soldiers, ‘There’s a new order coming from the mayor,’ ” the president said in a speech, recalling a directive he said he had given when he was mayor of Davao City. “ ‘We will not kill you. We will just shoot you in the vagina.’ ” Mr. Duterte made the remarks in a speech to former rebels last week, but the comments went largely unreported because he was speaking in his native Visayan language. He expressed exasperation that some women preferred joining the New People’s Army, a communist rebel force that has been waging an insurgency since 1969, to raising children. Since Mr. Duterte’s remarks began circulating more widely, the criticism of his choice of words has been fierce. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Okay sweetie, you know how some people in charge can say mean things sometimes? This is a story about a man named President Rodrigo Duterte, who is the leader of a country called the Philippines. He said some really mean things about women, especially women who are fighting against him. He told his soldiers to hurt these women very badly, and made jokes about it. That made a lot of people very angry, because it's not nice to say such things or to hurt people this way. Some people are saying he is not respecting women, which is very wrong, and they are calling him bad names because of it. Even before this, he used to say hurtful things about women. This made many people worried and they are trying to stop him from saying or doing more mean things."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer this question: where does the word bric a brac come from??","completion":"The term \\"bric-a-brac\\" is a phrase used to describe small, ornamental objects or decorative items of little value, often collected and displayed in people's homes. The origin of the word \\"bric-a-brac\\" can be traced back to the French language and its evolution over time, with multiple factors contributing to its formation and adoption in the English vocabulary. Originally, the components \\"bric\\" and \\"brac\\" did not have any specific meanings in French. The phrase \\"bric-a-brac\\" is an example of reduplication, a linguistic term referring to the repetition of words or syllables to create a new word or phrase. Reduplication is common in the French language and can be found in other expressions as well, such as \\"crème de la crème\\" and \\"pas de deux.\\" This form of word construction not only adds emphasis and poetic qualities to the language but also serves a communicative purpose. It is suggested that \\"bric-a-brac\\" is derived from the French term \\"à bric et à brac,\\" which translates to \\"at random\\" or \\"any old way.\\" This term may have been used to describe the haphazard assortment of objects one might find in a miscellaneous collection. The term \\"à brac\\" is also thought to have evolved from the Old French word \\"abraker,\\" which means \\"to break\\" or \\"to destroy.\\" This connection might represent the notion that bric-a-brac items are generally considered to be of lower value. The evolution of \\"bric-a-brac\\" also involves the gradual change of meaning and usage in the English language. In the late 19th century, the term \\"bric-a-brac\\" was adopted into English from French and initially referred to a mixture of miscellaneous objects, particularly those that were possibly broken or of little worth. However, over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the ornamental and decorative aspects of these items, as opposed to their lack of value. By the early 20th century, bric-a-brac became more closely associated with collections of antique and vintage objects, which were often displayed to showcase the tastes and interests of the collector. The popularity of bric-a-brac in English-speaking countries is also evident in its frequent mention in the literature of the time, such as works by Charles Dickens and Oscar Wilde. In conclusion, the word \\"bric-a-brac\\" has its roots in the French language, through the combination of \\"bric\\" and \\"brac,\\" a reduplication expressing the random or haphazard nature of these decorative items. Over time, the term has evolved to focus on the ornamental aspects of these objects, becoming synonymous with collecting and displaying vintage and antique items of little monetary value but high sentimental or aesthetic appeal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. Mike has to learn more about the periodic table for his chemistry exam. To make things easier for him he chose two elements from the table, element A and element B. Element A has higher electronegativity and element B has lower eletronegativity. David found it easier to learn about elements by comparing their properties. Which element would have increased effect of electron shielding, element A or element B? The answer is:","completion":"Element B would have an increased effect of electron shielding. Since element B has lower electronegativity, it is likely to be found further down a column or towards the left in a row of the periodic table. As you go down a column, the number of energy levels filled with electrons increases, leading to more electron shielding. This increased electron shielding causes a decrease in the effective nuclear charge experienced by the valence electrons, resulting in lower electronegativity for element B compared to element A."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

The statement mentions that Jan went to the store to buy some milk specifically for her cereal to eat in the mornings. This gives us a clear purpose for her action. So, we need to find the reason that aligns with this purpose. 2. Analyzing the available choices: A. energetic: This choice doesn't justify the reason for going to the store to buy milk for her cereal. Being energetic does not necessarily explain her need for milk. B. want milk: This choice indicates that Jan wanted milk, which could be a partial reason. But it doesn't specifically address the need for milk for her cereal. C. run out of milk: This choice explains that Jan went to the store because she had run out of milk.

Rowhani addresses Iran's commitment to freezing its uranium enrichment activities while it is engaged in talks with European nations. Uranium enrichment is a key process in the development of nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. By halting the enrichment activities, Iran signals its willingness to cooperate and negotiate with European countries regarding its nuclear program, addressing international concerns about potential nuclear weapons development. Hassan Rowhani, as the SNSC secretary, speaks on behalf of Iran's national security interests and decisions. His statement implies that Iran's commitment to freezing uranium enrichment is contingent on the progress and status of its negotiations with the European countries. This suggests that if the talks were to falter or reach a dead end, Iran might reconsider its commitment and possibly resume its enrichment activities.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is likely true as well. To analyze this argument, let's break it down into its constituent parts. Premise: \\"If we're ever going to get hold of her at all, we must do it before the 159 29th; otherwise, her life won't be worth an hour's purchase afterwards.\\" The premise is essentially composed of two related statements: 1. The time frame: To successfully \\"get hold\\" of her, action must be taken before the specified date, the 159 29th. 2. The implication: If the action is not taken by this deadline, her life will be in grave danger and she may not survive for more than an hour (\\"worth an hour's purchase\\"). In other words, a failure to act by the due date will have dire consequences for her life. Now let us consider the hypothesis: \\"She will die if we don't find her before the 159 29th.\\" The hypothesis is the prediction or reasonable inference that if the necessary action is not taken by the designated date (the 159 29th), her life will be at serious risk, and she is likely to die. When we compare the premise with the hypothesis, we can see that they share the same underlying assumption - that her life is in imminent danger if action is not taken by the designated date. The premise states that her life \\"won't be worth an hour's purchase,\\" which is an idiomatic way of expressing the imminent danger and likelihood of death in a short time. The hypothesis makes the same assumption, but more directly states that she will die if she is not found before the 159 29th. Thus, if we accept the premise as true, we can reasonably conclude that the hypothesis is true as well, given that both statements are based on the shared assumption that her life is in imminent danger if action is not taken by the specified deadline. It is important to note that while we can justifiably draw this conclusion, it does not necessarily guarantee that the hypothesis will be 100% accurate in reality. This is because the premise may be based on assumptions or information that may not be entirely correct or may change. In any case, the argument does present a coherent and sound connection between the premise and the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Let's Go to Prison\\", after breaking into Nelson's BMW, John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) performs a few actions that aggravate Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). Firstly, he steals the change from the car, leaving Nelson without any petty cash that he might have kept in his vehicle for minor expenses like parking fees, tolls, or quick snacks. The second thing that John does is spit in Nelson's coffee. This is more of a spiteful act than a material loss, meant to irritate and provoke Nelson. Given that coffee is often a necessary part of many people's morning routines, John's action not only contaminates Nelson's beverage but also disrupts his start to the day. The third, and perhaps the most impactful, action that John takes after breaking into the BMW is using up all the medicine in Nelson's inhaler. As the plot reveals, Nelson suffers from a condition that requires him to use an inhaler. John consuming all the medicine leaves Nelson suddenly without his necessary medication, potentially endangering his health. In the subsequent scene, this action by John results in a chaotic event. Nelson, finding his inhaler empty just when he needs it, is forced to stop at a pharmacy in a panicked state, where he causes a ruckus while trying to find a replacement inhaler. This results in him being mistaken for a robber, leading to his arrest and eventual conviction for robbery. Thus, John cunningly utilizes the distress caused by the empty inhaler as a catalyst in his long-planned revenge plot against the Biederman family, manipulating events to ensure Nelson ends up in prison where John can torment him further. This shows John’s deceptive nature and his willingness to go to extreme lengths for his revenge plot. All these events substantially change Nelson's life course and play major roles in the development of the movie plot. Therefore, understanding these actions can help you evaluate the film proposal more effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Lethal United States drones are launched from a top secret base in Saudi Arabia, it has emerged. The CIA uses the base to target Al Qaeda operatives in neighbouring Yemen, according to the New York Times. It was from this base that the American-born operative Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in 2011. It has also emerged that up to 54 countries may have helped the CIA to hold terrorism suspects in secret prisons, or turn them over to foreign governments, a human rights organisation has claimed. The drone that killed American-born operative Anwar al-Awlaki in 2011 was launched from a secret base in Saudi Arabia, it has emerged. The revelation comes amid a growing outcry against the Obama administration's use of deadly drones and their use to watch American citizens. It is the first time the location of the secret drone base has been revealed. It's whereabouts had remained secret at the request of high-ranking officials, although it was known that one had been built. Congress is now trying to limit the power the US has to kill suspected terrorists, including American citizens, with drones. The drone programme is expected to be the major talking point when the Senate Intelligence Committee interviews John Brennan, the White Houses's choice for CIA chief on Thursday. Yesterday the government defended its lethal drone programme by citing the laws that were introduced following the September 11 attacks. Many in Congress now believe the scope of the laws may be too broad. Democratic Senator Chris Coons said in a recent: 'It has to be in the agenda of this Congress to reconsider the scope of action of drones and use of deadly force by the United States around the world because the original authorisation of use of force, I think, is being strained to its limits,' Congressman Steny Hoyer, the number two Democrat in the House of Representatives, said yesterday, that 'it deserves a serious look at how we make the decisions in government to take out, kill, eliminate, whatever word you want to use, not just American citizens but other citizens as well.' Hoyer added: 'We ought to carefully review our policies as a country.' Democratic Chairman Robert Menendez and. the panel's top Republican, Senator Bob Corker, both have both quietly. expressed concerns about the deadly operation and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is likely to hold hearings on US drone policy, an aide said on Tuesday. The U.S. government can legally order the killing of American citizens if they have senior-level ties to al-Qaida. The memo outlines for the first time the. Obama administration's decision to kill al-Qaida terror suspects. without any evidence that specific and imminent plots are being planned. against the United States. Earlier this week, a group of 11 Democratic and Republican senators urged President Barack Obama to release a classified Justice Department legal opinion justifying when US counter-terror missions, including drone strikes, can be used to kill American citizens abroad. Without those documents, it's impossible for Congress and the public to decide 'whether this authority has been properly defined, and whether the president's power to deliberately kill Americans is subject to appropriate limitations and safeguards,' the senators wrote. 'The threat posed by al-Qaida and its associated forces demands a broader concept of imminence in judging when a person continually planning terror attacks presents an imminent threat,' concluded the document. US citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico, was killed by a drone in Yemen in 2011. It was launched from a secret base in Saudi Arabia. The memo was immediately decried by civil liberties groups as 'flawed' and 'profoundly disturbing' - especially in light of 2011 US drone strikes in Yemen that killed three American citizens: Anwar al-Awlaki, his 16-year-old-son and Samir Khan. Al-Awlaki was linked to the planning and execution of several attacks targeting US and Western interests, including the attempt to down a Detroit-bound airliner in 2009 and the plot to bomb cargo planes in 2010. His son was killed in a separate strike on a suspected al-Qaida den. Khan was an al-Qaida propagandist. White House spokesman Jay Carney called the strikes 'legal, ethical and wise' and said they are covered by a law that Congress approved allowing the use of military force against al-Qaida. He added: 'It is a matter of fact. that al-Qaida is in a state of war against us and that senior leaders,. operational leaders of al-Qaida are continually plotting to attack the. United States, plotting to kill American citizens as they did most. horrifically on September 11th of 2001.' Three. days after September 11, Congress approved a law authorising the. military to use 'all necessary and appropriate force' against al-Qaida. and other groups believed to be helping or harbouring the global terror. network, including the use of drone strikes. Because militants have since splintered into a number of affiliates and sympathisers the current laws could allow military force against thousands of people across the Middle East and North Africa who have limited or no ability to strike the US. Both the CIA and the US military are authorised to remotely pilot unmanned, missile-carrying drones against terror suspects. It's unknown exactly how many strikes have been carried out, but experts say that drone attacks in Pakistan are conducted by the CIA, while those in Yemen and Somalia, for example, are by military forces. The drones have strained diplomacy between the US and the nations where the strikes are carried out, as civilians have been killed alongside the targeted terrorists, even though most nations have given Washington at least tacit agreement to carry out the attacks. The use of drones has caused tensions in some countries where civilians have died. A Middle Eastern diplomat said that in Yemen, for example, an increase of US drone strikes last month have killed dozens of people and upset the local public, leading some leaders in Sanaa to reconsider how often they should be used. The Pentagon is also considering basing. surveillance drones in Niger to monitor on burgeoning extremist violence. in North Africa, but it's not clear if they will be armed, it has emerged. The campaign against the use of drones to spy on US citizens has also been growing in momentum. On Monday, Charlottesville, in. Virginia, became the first city in the United States to pass a. resolution against the use of drones for surveillance against American. citizens. It calls on Congress and the General. Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia to bring in laws 'prohibiting. information obtained from the domestic use of drones from being. introduced into a Federal or State court.' The resolution also 'pledges to abstain from similar uses with city-owned, leased or borrowed drones.' Dede Smith, a council member who voted in favour of the bill, told US News that drones are 'pretty clearly a threat to our constitutional right to privacy.' She added: 'If we don't get out ahead. of it to establish some guidelines for how drones are used, they will be. used in a very invasive way and we'll be left to try and pick up the. pieces.' The campaign has been helped by a. Justice Department memo that has recently surfaced, which show drones. can strike against a wider range of threats than previously believed.

A tube is filled with an inert gas, which will conduct electricity when radiation enters it. When a charged particle comes into the tube, it changes the electrical potential between the anode and the cathode. This change in potential in the tube produces a change in voltage in the electrical circuit and registers as a count. Geiger counters are fairly inexpensive and reliable, so they are useful in a wide range of applications. More complicated types of counters are also available, but are generally used in sophisticated experiments. Q: What counter provides a sensitive means of detecting radioactivity? Choices: - calorie - bouncy - gravity - geiger A: A:","completion":"The counter that provides a sensitive means of detecting radioactivity according to the provided paragraph is the Geiger counter. A Geiger counter is a device that is used for detecting and measuring ionizing radiation. It is named after the two German physicists, Hans Geiger and Walter Müller, who collaborated on its development in 1928. This device works by having a tube filled with an inert gas that conducts electricity when radiation enters it. When a charged particle, which is a type of ionizing radiation, comes into the tube, it changes the electrical potential between the anode and the cathode. An anode is the electrode through which conventional current flows into a polarized electrical device, and a cathode is the electrode from which conventional current flows out of a polarized electrical device. Essentially, these are the points through which electricity enters and exits the device, respectively. The change in electrical potential between the anode and the cathode produces a change in voltage in the electrical circuit. This change is registered as a count on the counter part of the device, hence the term \\"counter.\\" Each count represents a certain amount of detected ionizing radiation, which allows the user to gauge the level of radioactivity in a particular place or object. Geiger counters have the advantage of being fairly inexpensive and reliable, and as a result, they are widely used in different fields. For example, they are used in nuclear power plants to monitor radioactivity, in medical facilities to measure patients' exposure to radiation, in geological surveys to detect radioactive minerals, and even in personal dosimeters for workers who might be exposed to radiation. While there are more complex types of counters also available, they are generally used in more sophisticated experiments due to their increased precision and specific detection capabilities. Geiger counters remain the most accessible and straightforward tools for general use in detecting radioactivity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Do the above sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Yes, the above sentences essentially convey the same meaning. Both sentences describe a situation where a female individual is crying and feels scared. However, there are subtle differences in the structure and details of the sentences, which we can analyze below. 1. \\"She was crying and scared,\\" said Isa Yasin, the owner of the store. In this sentence, the speaker (Isa Yasin) is identified as the owner of the store and makes a statement about a female who is both crying and scared. The description of the female is concise, as it simply presents her emotional state as \\"crying and scared\\" without going into further detail about her emotions. 2. \\"She was crying, and she was really scared,\\" said Yasin. In this second sentence, the speaker is identified as Yasin (most likely the same person as in the first sentence but with a less detailed introduction). The sentence is structured differently, and it provides more emphasis on the intensity of the female's emotions. By using \\"and she was really scared\\" instead of just \\"and scared,\\" Yasin underscores the depth of the female's fear. Additionally, the use of \\"really scared\\" suggests that her fear was more intense and perhaps more significant than what would be implied by simply saying \\"scared.\\" In conclusion, while both sentences express the same core idea – a female who is crying and feeling scared – the slight variations in structure and wording create subtle differences in tone and emphasis. The first sentence is more concise and direct, while the second sentence places greater emphasis on the intensity of the female's emotions.

Located approximately 100 km west of Toronto, Kitchener is the seat of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. It was the Town of Berlin from 1854 until 1912 and the City of Berlin from 1912 until 1916. The city had a population of 219,153 in the 2011 Census and a population of 239,900 at year end 2015 as estimated by the Region of Waterloo. The metropolitan area, which includes the neighbouring cities of Waterloo and Cambridge, has 507,096 people, making it the tenth largest Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) in Canada and the fourth largest CMA in Ontario. The city is adjacent to the smaller cities of Cambridge to the south, and Waterloo to the north. Kitchener and Waterloo are often referred to jointly as \\"Kitchener-Waterloo\\" (K-W), although they have separate municipal governments. Including Cambridge, the three cities are known as \\"the Tri-Cities\\"., Edward George \\"Stanky\\" Stankiewicz (born November 30, 1929 in Kitchener, Ontario) is a retired professional ice hockey player. He played 6 NHL games with the Detroit Red Wings. He is the brother of Myron Stankiewicz, a pro hockey left winger who also played in the NHL., The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season., The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner. Originally commissioned in 1892 as the \\"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\\", the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston, thenGovernor General of Canada, who awarded it to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC, and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, it was established as the \\"de facto\\" championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the \\"de jure\\" NHL championship prize in 1947., Myron \`\` Mike '' Stankiewicz ( born December 4 , 1935 ) is a retired professional ice hockey player . He played 35 NHL games with the St. Louis Blues and Philadelphia Flyers . Despite his brief NHL career , Stankiewicz was a top goal scorer in the AHL , breaking the 20 - goal mark six times in seven seasons with Hershey . Myron is the brother of Ed Stankiewicz , a pro hockey left winger who played 6 games in the NHL ., In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time., The Philadelphia Flyers are a professional ice hockey team based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They are members of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). Part of the 1967 NHL Expansion, the Flyers were the first expansion team in the post-Original Six era to win the Stanley Cup, victorious in 197374 and again in 197475., A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey., Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east., Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, . Philadelphia is the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valleya region located in the Northeastern United States at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers with 7.2 million people residing in the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States., An expansion team is a brand new team in a sports league, usually from a city that has not hosted a team in that league before, formed with the intention of satisfying the demand for a local team from a population in a new area. Sporting leagues also hope that the expansion of their competition will grow the popularity of the sport generally. The term is most commonly used in reference to the North American major professional sports leagues but is applied to sports leagues in other countries with a closed franchise system of league membership. The term comes from the expansion of the sport into new areas. That sometimes results in the payment of an expansion fee to the league by the new team and an expansion draft to populate the new roster., The Detroit Red Wings are a professional ice hockey team based in Detroit, Michigan.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question: Like with owning a kitten, what is a common danger when participating in the sport of fencing? Here are possible answers to this question: - small cuts - puncture wound - competition - injury - panting I believe the correct choice is \\"small cuts\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"Actually, the correct choice is a \\"puncture wound\\" and here's why: Fencing is a sport that involves the use of a sword-like weapon, either a foil, epee, or sabre. The main goal of the sport is to score points by hitting or touching your opponent with the weapon's tip or edge, depending on the weapon in use. While the weapons used in fencing are not as sharp as real swords, they are still capable of causing injury if the participants do not follow proper safety protocols. One of the most common dangers associated with fencing is the risk of suffering a puncture wound. A puncture wound can occur if the weapon penetrates the protective clothing, such as the fencing jacket and plastron, which are designed to minimize the risk of injury. This type of injury often occurs during bouts, when fencers are attempting to score points against their opponents. To minimize the risk of puncture wounds, fencers must wear appropriate safety gear, including a mask, gloves, and protective clothing, and follow the rules and regulations of the sport. Small cuts, competition, injury, and panting are also possibilities during a fencing bout; however, they don't represent the most common danger in the sport. While small cuts could happen, they are less likely due to the protective gear worn by fencers. Injury could happen, but puncture wounds are a more specific type of injury. Competition is inherent in the sport but doesn't pose a direct physical danger, while panting is a normal response to exertion and not a significant danger when compared to puncture wounds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Sequels are never as good as the original Review: Portrait in Sepia is a sequel to Daughter in Fortune. The first book had wonderful characters and a good variety of characters. This book has mainly two characters, one of them from the first book. I found this book almost boring and depressing. It wasn't nearly as rich and colorful as the first. Nothing happy really happens. Isabel Allende is a good writer and I will read other book by her but I was disappointed in this one. Answer:","completion":"Based on the customer's review, I would say that the customer was dissatisfied with the product. The reviewer mentions several points that indicate their dissatisfaction, such as finding the book \\"almost boring and depressing\\" and being disappointed with it. The title of the review, \\"Sequels are never as good as the original,\\" already conveys a somewhat negative perception of the book in comparison to its prequel. This sentiment is reinforced by several comments made by the reviewer. They describe the first book, Daughter in Fortune, as having \\"wonderful characters\\" and a \\"good variety of characters,\\" while the sequel, Portrait in Sepia, has mainly two characters, which seems to fall short of the original's standard. Furthermore, the reviewer states that Portrait in Sepia was \\"not nearly as rich and colorful as the first\\" and that \\"nothing happy really happens.\\" These observations imply a dissatisfied tone, as the reader was likely hoping for a continuation of story elements that they enjoyed in the first book but failed to find them in the sequel. Despite their dissatisfaction with the book, the reviewer acknowledges that Isabel Allende is a good writer, and they will continue to read other books by her. This statement suggests that while they did not enjoy Portrait in Sepia, their overall opinion of the author remains positive. In conclusion, based on the various negative observations and comparisons to the first book, it is evident that the reviewer is dissatisfied with the product. They were disappointed with the sequel's limitation of characters and its lack of \\"rich and colorful\\" content compared to its predecessor."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. On a day made remarkable by many things, not least the sheer scale of the turnout, the courage of one man was always going to shine through. Staring death in the face but refusing to flinch, Fernando Ricksen deserved every full-throated cheer and moist-eyed tribute delivered at Ibrox yesterday. Crippled by the motor-neurone disease that will eventually claim his life, Ricksen was just able to take the ceremonial kick-off in an exhibition match between a Rangers Select and Fernando's All Stars, stumbling and tumbling to the turf moments after making contact with the ball. An emotional Fernando Ricksen was carried around the stadium at the end of a tribute match at Ibrox. Ricksen (centre) was greeted by supporters after arriving at Ibrox for the game. If that was a heartbreaking sight for all who turned out to thank the Dutchman for his contribution to the club, it is worth noting what happened after he fell down. He got back up. With the help of his former team-mates, he rose again to take the applause of 41,349 paying punters. Why were so many moved to venture forth on a dreich winter's day for a bounce game involving old boys in varying states of (dis)repair? It was an appreciation not just of what Ricksen did in his playing days, but of how he is facing down this horrifying illness. 'Even the fact that MND patients don't have more than three years to live doesn't get me down,' he said in an interview conducted for the commemorative programme. 'Scared? No, because what's going to happen is inevitable. OK, maybe I have only a couple of years left. That doesn't scare me, it's just that I would love to live a lot longer. I want to see my daughter growing up. That's what I'll fight for. 'One person should be the first to defeat this terrible disease. Well, let me be that person then! I will show the world what fighting spirit means. 'But if death comes, well, it comes. What can you do about it? I've always been like that. Never been afraid of flying either, unlike most of my Russian team-mates (from his time with Dick Advocaat at Zenit St Petersburg). 'I always told them: 'If we go down, we go down'. Which was quite likely with those Russian aircraft, by the way! Ricksen (left) watches on from the dugout during the match at Ibrox. Ricksen (centre) is carried by Ronald de Boer (left) and Thomas Buffel (right. 'I don't want to feel too much sympathy. I am not pitiful. Please don't treat me that way. It will be tough but I'll keep my head up. 'It was a shock (when I got the diagnosis). Especially after I had Googled what the illness exactly means. All of a sudden, you know you may be dead within a year. 'I still hope the doctors have made a mistake. That, one day, they will say it isn't MND. As long as I don't have the really heavy symptoms of MND, it's a straw I keep grasping at. 'I know it sounds strange but being chased by the Grim Reaper doesn't affect your life that much. Not when your motto is: 'Don't look back'. 'We avoid pessimism and depression by not talking and thinking too much about the disease. That's one of the reasons why we don't shoot an enormous amount of footage of our life as it is today. 'For my daughter, Isabella, that would put too much emphasis on the illness.' Ibrox was packed full of supporters offering tributes to former player Ricksen. The money raised from yesterday's match will be split four ways, with Ricksen and young Isabella each receiving a share, and the remainder going to MND Scotland and the Rangers Charity Foundation. Among those to have contributed include old foes Celtic — with a £10,000 donation — a fact that didn't greatly surprise the man himself, as he revealed: 'It isn't true that all Celtic supporters have always hated me. 'When I was playing for Zenit, lots of Scottish tourists wanted to have their picture taken with me on the Red Square — even Celtic fans. That was very rewarding. So I must have done something good.' Ricksen had been back to Ibrox in a playing role since his departure for Rangers, turning out for Zenit in a friendly. But yesterday was different. In a very familiar way. The crazy traffic, the huge queues that saw kick-off delayed by half an hour, it was like a throwback to more successful times in Govan. Former Rangers winger Neil McCann noted: 'It's great to see such a big crowd at Ibrox again. I gave Fernando a hug and said: 'This feels like the old times'.' Fans held banners, scarfs and signs and chanted Ricksen's name during the tribute. The former Old Firm warrior was accompanied by Isabella as he made his way between a guard of honour formed by both teams before kick-off, the atmosphere creeping closer to spine-tingling levels as he slowly marched out. With his ability to speak severely damaged by the disease, the look of joy on Ricksen's face said as much as words ever could. The game itself was, of course, an afterthought, a 7-4 romp for the All Stars. Gordon Durie, Peter Lovenkrands, Thomas Buffel and Nacho Novo scored for the home team, while James Beattie was among the many visitors to find the net — the first time this particular former Rangers player had ever scored at Ibrox. There was only one choice for Man of the Match, though, Ricksen lauded again as his name was announced, then receiving a further standing ovation as he came back on the pitch for a lap of honour. He was carried aloft on the shoulders his team-mates, borne ever higher by the goodwill of all in attendance. Ricksen (centre) lifts the Scottish Premier League trophy as a player for the club in 2005. And the last word went to the man himself, in a way, too, when his close friend Roy Knez read out a statement on his behalf declaring: 'Fellow Blue Noses, thank you for your support today. The numbers who turned out make me feel so happy. It gives me a fighting spirit. 'When I played here, I gave everything for the world's most successful club. Now the club and the fans have given me so much more back. I need it now. 'I've never been so proud to be a Rangers man. Thank you. I love you. Rangers forever.'

Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to cook squid Know that whole squid are cheaper and tastier than pre-cut calamari. There are a lot of parts to a squid that are thrown out when a squid is pre-prepared. It may seem gross at first, but prepping a whole squid requires nothing but a sharp knife and a willingness to get your hands dirty. (1). Pinch between the eyes and body and pull the head out of the mantle. This is probably the grossest part of the whole process, and you get it done first. (2). Squid, however, is usually prepared very neatly so that it dries before eating. It won't dry out very quickly though and may take longer to cook, often years. (3). Overcuts squid tend to be cheaper, but you may find this necessary to fish dishes that are more expensive or have a shallow bottom. Squid can harbor slug, bacteria, the molds on top, and other group animals. (4). The squid cooks through grease, almost as much as raw squid. Every squid, including midfielders, cooks individually, but squid must have a firm structure before cooking, and require more structure before cook.","completion":"1. Pinch between the eyes and body and pull the head out of the mantle. This is probably the grossest part of the whole process, and you get it done first. The correct answer is (1) because it is the next logical step in the process of preparing a whole squid for cooking. It provides clear instructions for separating the head from the body, which is an essential part of preparing a squid. (2) is incorrect because it discusses drying squid before eating, which is not relevant to the initial preparation process. It also mentions a long, unreasonable cooking time of years, which is unrealistic. (3) is incorrect as it contains irrelevant and confusing information about overcut squid and fish dishes, as well as mentioning the presence of slug, bacteria, molds, and other group animals, which are not related to the process of cooking squid. (4) is incorrect because it presents unclear and nonsensical information about cooking squid with grease, comparing it to raw squid, and mentioning midfielders, which are not related to squid preparation or cooking.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What was reissued by EMI in the 1970s?, using the article: Elgar's recordings were released on 78-rpm discs by both HMV and RCA Victor. After World War II, the 1932 recording of the Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on LP, but the other recordings were out of the catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death. The recordings were reissued on CD in the 1990s.In November 1931, Elgar was filmed by Pathé for a newsreel depicting a recording session of Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 at the opening of EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. It is believed to be the only surviving sound film of Elgar, who makes a brief remark before conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, asking the musicians to \\"play this tune as though you've never heard it before.\\" A memorial plaque to Elgar at Abbey Road was unveiled on 24 June 1993.A late piece of Elgar's, the Nursery Suite, was an early example of a studio premiere: its first performance was in the Abbey Road studios. For this work, dedicated to the wife and daughters of the Duke of York, Elgar once again drew on his youthful sketch-books. In his final years, Elgar experienced a musical revival. The BBC organised a festival of his works to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932. He flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin. While in France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at Grez-sur-Loing. He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli, who championed his music when it was out of fashion. He began work on an opera, The Spanish Lady, and accepted a commission from the BBC to compose a Third Symphony. His final illness, however, prevented their completion. He fretted about the unfinished works. He asked Reed to ensure that nobody would \\"tinker\\" with the sketches and attempt a completion of the symphony,..., what would be the answer ?

Summarize: Over the past 12 months, Show Racism the Red Card Wales said they have seen a big rise in schools contacting them for help in dealing with racism issues. They want ministers to take a lead in ensuring policies are in place to stamp out the problem. Education Cabinet Secretary Kirsty Williams said a \\"zero tolerance approach\\" should be adopted by schools. The charity has attributed the rise to reporting of Islamic radicalisation, the migrant crisis and the Brexit vote. In June, BBC Wales reported that Welsh public figures had said they had been subjected to racist abuse following the EU referendum result. Show Racism the Red Card Wales campaign manager Sunil Patel said: \\"It is deeply worrying that racist hate complaints have increased dramatically. \\"Even before the EU referendum result, racism had been on the increase across Wales, and the consistent negative reporting of migrants has fuelled the resentment. \\"We been noticing anti-immigration views expressed by pupils in schools from as young as eight-years-old. \\"We are extremely concerned and call for urgent action to support and protect young people in Wales.\\" The anecdotal trend is backed up by the findings of a survey of 435 teachers carried out by the charity. It highlighted that one in four teachers questioned in Wales have come across a racist incident at their school in the past year. Stuart Williams, from the NUT teaching union and chairman of Show Racism the Red Card's Wales Advisory Committee, said: \\"Tackling racism is the responsibility of everyone in our communities, both within the school gates and outside.\\" Education Secretary Ms Williams said: \\"I will not tolerate racism and bullying in the Welsh education system, and I expect schools and education services to also make it clear that it is entirely unacceptable and to adopt a zero tolerance approach. \\"Schools are supported by our Respecting Others anti-bullying guidance which includes specific guidance relating to incidents linked to race, culture and religion. \\"We have also approved further work with Show Racism the Red Card to offer teachers an opportunity to attend professional learning events during the autumn term. \\"These will help equip and empower our teachers with the confidence to tackle racism and discrimination in our classrooms.\\" The Welsh Government said its new curriculum development - A curriculum for Wales - a curriculum for life - aims to provide teaching and learning which \\"encourages and supports young people to be ambitious capable learners, as well as ethical, informed citizens\\".","completion":"Show Racism the Red Card Wales reports a significant rise in schools contacting them for assistance in handling racism issues over the past 12 months.

My gripe is that he was supposed to have the most amazing voice ever. He's the key person that is supposed to out sing every one in the story. But he's the one that sucks. I mean, I know I can sing so I dont open my mouth. Why oh why did they cast this guy. I read a review about there being 11 other people that have played the phantom. Hell, why didnt they just take those voices or something. I mean, he REALLY doesnt do the role justice.

Title: Persona Movie plot: Persona begins with images of camera equipment and projectors lighting up and projecting dozens of brief cinematic glimpses, including a crucifixion, an erect penis, a tarantula spider, clips from a comedic silent-film reel first seen in Bergman's Prison (depicting a man trapped in a room, being chased by Death and Satan), and the slaughter of a lamb. The last, and longest, glimpse features a boy who wakes up in a hospital next to several corpses, reading Michail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time (\\"Vår Tids Hjälte\\" in the film), and caressing a blurry image of Elisabet and/or Alma's faces.A young nurse, Alma (portrayed by Bibi Andersson), is summoned by the head doctor and charged with the care of stage actress Elisabet Vogler (portrayed by Liv Ullmann), who has, despite the lack of any diagnosed impairment, become mute. The hospital administrator (portrayed by Margaretha Krook) offers her own seaside cottage as a place for Alma to nurse Elisabet back to health. Though Elisabet is nearly catatonic when the film begins, she does react with extreme panic upon seeing a Vietnamese Buddhist monk's self-immolation on television, and laughs mockingly at Alma's radio soap opera.

At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Ivory Coast or Côte d'Ivoire , officially named the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, is a country located in West Africa. Ivory Coast's political capital is Yamoussoukro, and its economic capital and largest city is the port city of Abidjan. Its bordering countries are Guinea and Liberia in the west, Burkina Faso and Mali in the north, and Ghana in the east. The Gulf of Guinea (Atlantic Ocean) is located south of Ivory Coast. - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America. - The Bight of Benin or Bay of Benin is a bight in the Gulf of Guinea area on the western African coast. - Tegbessou (alternatively Tegbesu) or Bossa Ahadee was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1740 until 1774. Tegbessou was not the oldest son of King Agaja (1718-1740), but was selected after Agaja's death to be the king after winning a succession struggle with a brother. - The West Indies or Caribbean Basin is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean, that includes the island nations and surrounding waters of three major archipelagoes: the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. The term is synonymous with the term \\"Caribbean Basin\\". The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent. - Benin (or -; ), officially the Republic of Benin and formerly Dahomey, is a country in West Africa. It is bordered by Togo to the west, Nigeria to the east, and Burkina Faso and Niger to the north. A majority of the population live on its small southern coastline on the Bight of Benin, part of the Gulf of Guinea in the northernmost tropical portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The capital of Benin is Porto-Novo, but the seat of government is in Cotonou, the country's largest city and economic capital. Benin covers an area of 114,763 square kilometers and its population in 2015 was estimated to be approximately 10.88 million. Benin is a tropical, sub-Saharan nation, highly dependent on agriculture, with substantial employment and income arising from subsistence farming. - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. - The Cape of Good Hope (, ) is a rocky headland on the Atlantic coast of the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. - Dutch trading posts and plantations in the Americas precede the much wider known colonization activities of the Dutch in Asia. While the first Dutch fort in Asia was built in 1600 (in present-day Indonesia), the first forts and settlements on the Essequibo River in Guyana date from the 1590s. Actual colonization, with Dutch settling in the new lands, was not as common as with other European nations. Many of the Dutch settlements were lost or abandoned by the end of the 17th century, but the Netherlands managed to retain possession of Suriname until it gained independence in 1975, as well as the Netherlands Antilles, of which the islands remain within the Kingdom of the Netherlands today. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - The Fon people, also called Fon nu, Agadja or Dahomey, are a major West African ethnic and linguistic group. They are the largest ethnic group in Benin found particularly in its south region; they are also found in southwest Nigeria and Togo. Their total population is estimated to be about 3,500,000 people, and they speak the Fon language, a member of the Niger-Congo language group. - Jacob Elet was a Dutch Chief factor for the Dutch West India Company on the Slave Coast of West Africa during the 18th century who is especially known for having visited in 1733 Agaja , the king of Dahomey , and for having kept a diary chronicling the trip . - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - The Americas, also collectively called America, encompass the totality of the continents of North America and South America. Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the \\"New World\\". - Pepper Coast was the name given by European traders to a coastal area of western Africa, between Cape Mesurado and Cape Palmas. It encloses the present republic of Liberia. It got its name from the melegueta pepper. The pepper is also known as the \\"grain of paradise\\", which gave rise to an alternative name, the Grain Coast. The importance of the spice is shown by the designation of the area from the Saint John River (at present-day Buchanan) to Harper in Liberia as the \\"Grain Coast\\" in honor of the availability of grains of paradise. In some cases (as shown on the map) this term covers a wider area incorporating Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast. - The Oyo Empire was a Yoruba empire of what is today Western and North central Nigeria, and Eastern Benin. Established in the 15th century, the Oyo Empire grew to become one of the largest West African states. It rose through the outstanding organizational skills of the Yoruba, wealth gained from trade and its powerful cavalry. The Oyo Empire was the most politically important state in the region from the mid-17th to the late 18th century, holding sway not only over most of the other kingdoms in Yorubaland, but also over nearby African states, notably the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey in the modern Republic of Benin to the west. - The Slave Coast is a historical name formerly used for parts of coastal West Africa along the Bight of Benin. The name is derived from the fact that it was a major source of African slaves during the Atlantic slave trade from the early 16th century to the 19th century. Other nearby coastal regions historically known by their prime colonial export are the Gold Coast, the Ivory Coast, and the Pepper Coast (or Grain Coast). - Dutch West India Company (or ) was a chartered company (known as the \\"WIC\\") of Dutch merchants. Among its founding fathers was Willem Usselincx (15671647). On June 3, 1621, it was granted a for a trade monopoly in the West Indies (meaning the Caribbean) by the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands and given jurisdiction over the Atlantic slave trade, Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America. The area where the company could operate consisted of West Africa (between the Tropic of Cancer and the Cape of Good Hope) and the Americas, which included the Pacific Ocean and the eastern part of New Guinea. The intended purpose of the charter was to eliminate competition, particularly Spanish or Portuguese, between the various trading posts established by the merchants. The company became instrumental in the Dutch colonization of the Americas. - Dahomey was an African kingdom (located in the area of the present-day country of Benin) that existed from about 1600 until 1894, when the last king, Behanzin, was defeated by the French, and the country was annexed into the French colonial empire. Dahomey developed on the Abomey Plateau amongst the Fon people in the early 17th century and became a regional power in the 18th century by conquering key cities on the Atlantic coast. - The Tropic of Cancer, also referred to as the Northern Tropic is north of the Equator. It is the most northerly circle of latitude on the Earth at which the Sun can be directly overhead. This occurs on the June solstice, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum extent. - Willem Usselincx (15671647) was a Flemish slave owner, slave trader, merchant, investor and diplomat who was instrumental in drawing both Dutch and Swedish attention to the importance of the New World. Usselincx was one of the founding fathers of the Dutch West India Company (Dutch: \\"Geoctroyeerde Westindische Compagnie\\"). - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - The French colonial empire constituted the overseas colonies, protectorates and mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the \\"first colonial empire\\", that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost, and the \\"second colonial empire\\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. The second empire came to an end after the loss of bitter wars in Vietnam (1955) and Algeria (1962), and peaceful decolonization elsewhere after 1960. - Agaja (also spelled Agadja and also known as Trudo Agaja or Trudo Audati) was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, who ruled from 1718 until 1740. He came to the throne after his brother King Akaba. During his reign, Dahomey expanded significantly and took control of key trade routes for the Atlantic slave trade by conquering Allada (1724) and Whydah (1727). Wars with the powerful Oyo Empire to the east of Dahomey resulted in Agaja accepting tributary status to that empire and providing yearly gifts. After this, Agaja attempted to control the new territory of the kingdom of Dahomey through militarily suppressing revolts and creating administrative and ceremonial systems. Agaja died in 1740 after another war with the Oyo Empire and his son Tegbessou became the new king. Agaja is credited with creating many of the key government structures of Dahomey, including the \\"Yovogan\\" and the \\"Mehu\\". - Allada is a town, arrondissement, and commune, located in the Atlantique Department of Benin.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. Now, I have a new situation: Two groups of scientists examined two fires. Group A put a large log on it, and group B made a fire with small twigs. They wanted to see which fire would last longer. Answer this question please: Which group had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Group B, which used small twigs to make their fire, provoked a more intense reaction. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the large log (used by Group A), allowing for a faster and more intense combustion. The greater surface area enables more of the wood to come into contact with oxygen, which then accelerates the reaction and produces a faster, more intense burn."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The given context discusses different parts of the Amazon and the various practices being conducted in those areas, such as deforestation through slashing and burning, as well as efforts to protect the Acre's forest. The Amazon is a vast tropical rainforest spanning across nine countries, primarily in South America, including Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. Covering approximately 6.7 million square kilometers, it represents over half of the Earth's remaining rainforests. This incredibly diverse ecosystem is home to millions of species of plants, animals, and insects, many of which are not found anywhere else in the world. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of the Earth's atmosphere, water cycle, and climate by acting as a sponge to absorb carbon dioxide and store it in plant and soil matter.

But thanks to conservation efforts, great whites are making a comeback in the U.S. Two recent studies show that the population of these sharks is rising along the east and west coast. Why is the growing population of a killer fish something to celebrate? \\"When you fish too many of them, you start to lose balance in the environment,\\" says shark researcher Tobey Curtis. As the biggest killer, sharks help keep the populations of fish, seals, and other creatures they eat from growing too large. In spite of their importance, great white sharks had long been hunted for their meat and their fins . Then, in 1997, the U.S. government passed a law that didn't allow the hunting of great whites. Afterwards, the numbers of these sharks in the U.S. waters started to increase. The law wasn't the only thing that has helped great whites. Conservationists have also played a part in the sharks' comeback. The research group OCEARCH is using a method called tagging to help change people's attitudes about great white. They let the public follow each shark as it travels the world's oceans. OCEARCH also gives each tagged shark a name to help people form a closer connection with the big fish. The group's most well-known shark is named Katharine. She was tagged last year near Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Since then, thousands of people have tracked Katharine's movements on Twitter and the OCEARCH website. This helps people see sharks in a new way. Chris Fischer, the founder of OCEARCH believes learning to appreciate great whites will encourage people to do more to protect them. Question: The main purpose of the passage is to _ . - introduce an experiment result - make an advertisement for OCEARCH - remind us that big killers are dying out - inform us that great whites are making a comeback Answer:","completion":"inform us that great whites are making a comeback"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A recommendation to visit the seller, which implies the seller is worth visiting. In the hypothesis, the components are: 1. The existence of a good boot seller. 2.

Movie title: Burn After Reading Movie plot: Faced with a demotion at work due to a drinking problem, Osbourne Cox angrily quits his job as a CIA analyst and resolves to write a memoir about his life and career. When his pediatrician wife Katie finds out, she sees it as a justifiable opportunity to file for divorce and continue her adulterous affair unimpeded. Taking her lawyer's advice, she copies financial records and several other files from her husband's computer onto a CD. These files contain a rambling, meaningless diatribe by Cox on purported CIA activities. When the CD gets left on the locker room floor of Hardbodies, a local gym, by a careless law firm employee, it falls into the hands of dim-witted personal trainer Chad Feldheimer and his co-worker Linda Litzke, who mistakenly believe the numerical data in the Coxes' bank records, and especially, Cox's diatribes, to be highly sensitive government information. After getting the data traced back to Osbourne, who thinks his memoirs have been stolen, Chad and Linda plan to give the disc back to him for a reward, with Linda planning to use the money to pay for plastic surgery. When a phone call and subsequent meeting with Osbourne provoke a furious reaction and go horribly wrong, Chad and Linda turn over the disc to the Russian embassy, offering more information in return for monetary compensation. With no other data to give them, Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Coxes' home to get more files from their computer. Meanwhile, Osbourne's increasingly erratic behavior, aggravated in part by his encounters with Chad and Linda, prompt Katie to move ahead with the divorce proceedings. She changes the locks on their house, forcing Osbourne to move onto the sailboat they have docked on the Chesapeake Bay. With her husband out of the picture, Katie invites her lover, Harry Pfarrer, to move in. A womanizing, multi-adulterous deputy U.S. Marshal, Harry is coincidentally also secretly seeing Linda. Harry finds Chad, whom Linda sent to find more files on Osbourne, hiding in a wardrobe in the Coxes' home,...

I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? Who is the hairdresser? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A.

No. \\"Be smart\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What does Sasha need to do before this?\\" because it does not accurately address the specific actions or preparations that Sasha undertook to achieve a good grade on their chemistry test.

The question expects a response detailing Sasha's study strategies or any other steps they took before the test to reach the desired outcome. Being smart is an intrinsic quality that a person may possess, but it does not guarantee success on an exam, especially if the person does not invest time and effort into studying and preparing. Moreover, intelligence alone does not equate to success on a test, as other factors, such as work ethic, motivation, perseverance, and effective learning strategies, can contribute to achieving good grades. Instead, a more appropriate and valid answer to the question would be \\"Sasha needs to dedicate time to studying, reviewing course materials, practicing problems, and properly understanding the concepts covered in the chemistry test before taking it.\\" This response highlights the specific actions and preparations that Sasha undertook to secure an A on their chemistry test, rather than simply attributing their success to being smart."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: A woman from north Wales is petitioning the UK government to allow her Syrian mother to join her amid fears she is too frail to survive in the war-torn country any longer. Article:","completion":"Title: North Wales Woman Fights for Frail Syrian Mother's Entry to the UK Amid Ongoing War Introduction: A woman hailing from north Wales is actively petitioning the UK government to grant her elderly Syrian mother permission to join her in the United Kingdom. The woman's fears stem from her mother's frail condition, believing it increasingly difficult for her to survive in the war-ravaged country. Body: Growing Concerns for Family Members in Syria As the conflict in Syria continues to wreak havoc on the lives of its civilians, many individuals residing abroad are left deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of their family members still living in the war-torn country. One such individual is a woman from north Wales, who is desperate to reunite with her elderly and frail mother currently trapped in Syria. A Heartfelt Petition to the UK Government The concerned daughter has launched a petition, urging the UK government to allow her mother to join her amid the chaos engulfing Syria. According to the woman, her mother's health has sharply deteriorated due to the ongoing conflict, and her increasingly frail condition makes it difficult for her to cope with the daily hardships of living in a war zone. The Importance of Family Reunification Family reunification forms an integral part of international human rights, ensuring that refugees and asylum seekers have access to their basic human right to family life. The woman from north Wales, by petitioning the UK government, underscores the importance of providing vulnerable individuals like her mother with an opportunity to reunite with their loved ones, away from the perils of conflict. Government Response and Possible Outcomes While the UK government has been criticized for its handling of refugee and asylum cases in the past, there is a chance that this heartfelt petition could draw attention to the plight of the woman's mother and other casualties of the Syrian conflict. A successful outcome could result in the frail Syrian woman being granted permission to join her daughter in the United Kingdom, allowing them to rebuild their lives in a safe environment. Conclusion: The ongoing conflict in Syria is an unrelenting reality for many families who are still struggling to survive in a war zone. The petition launched by the north Wales woman highlights the need for governments to adopt compassionate policies towards refugees and asylum seekers, focusing on family reunification and the safety of vulnerable individuals. Ultimately, recognizing and addressing these needs could offer a lifeline not just to the woman's frail mother, but also to countless others in a similar predicament."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks. He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.

Textual criticism: When comparing different documents, or \\"witnesses\\", of a single, original text, the observed differences are called variant readings, or simply variants or readings. It is not always apparent which single variant represents the author's original work. The process of textual criticism seeks to explain how each variant may have entered the text, either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship), as scribes or supervisors transmitted the original author's text by copying it. The textual critic's task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be un-original, hence establishing a \\"critical text\\", or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition.

Translate \\"Joel Ward\\" to Finnish?","completion":"Translating names, especially personal names, is not a common practice because a name is a unique identifier for an individual. Name translations are typically done for common words or names with a specific meaning. \\"Joel Ward\\" is a combination of a first name (Joel) and a last name (Ward), and both are English words. Despite there not being a direct translation of the name into Finnish, we can still attempt to give you information about the background of each name and see if there is any equivalent or adaptation in Finnish. Joel: The name Joel is derived from the Hebrew name יוֹאֵל (Yo'el), which means \\"Yahweh is God\\". In Finnish, there isn't really a direct translation for this name, so it would still be \\"Joel\\" in Finnish. The pronunciation might differ slightly due to Finnish phonetics. In Finnish, it could be pronounced as \\"Yo-el\\". Ward: If we look at the meaning of the last name Ward, it originates from an Old English word \\"weard,\\" which means \\"guard\\" or \\"watchman\\". In this case, we can find a Finnish word with a similar meaning - \\"vartija\\" which means \\"guard\\" or \\"warden\\". However, this does not imply that one should simply replace the last name \\"Ward\\" with \\"Vartija\\", as Finnish surnames have different cultural and historical origins. So, translating \\"Joel Ward\\" to Finnish cannot be done directly since names are unique identifiers and generally aren't translated. However, by exploring the meanings of the names, we can see the relation to certain Finnish words, but that does not make them an accurate representation or translation of the name in the Finnish language.

The law of criminal procedure in the United States consists of a massive overlay of federal constitutional case law interwoven with the federal and state statutes that actually provide the foundation for the creation and operation of law enforcement agencies and prison systems as well as the proceedings in criminal trials. Due to the perennial inability of legislatures in the U.S. to enact statutes that would actually force law enforcement officers to respect the constitutional rights of criminal suspects and convicts, the federal judiciary gradually developed the exclusionary rule as a method to enforce such rights. In turn, the exclusionary rule spawned a family of judge-made remedies for the abuse of law enforcement powers, of which the most famous is the Miranda warning. The writ of habeas corpus is often used by suspects and convicts to challenge their detention, while the Civil Rights Act of 1871 and Bivens actions are used by suspects to recover tort damages for police brutality. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What might a suspect use to challenge their detention?","completion":"A suspect might use the writ of habeas corpus to challenge their detention. The writ of habeas corpus is a constitutional protection against unlawful imprisonment, and it serves to bring a detainee before the court to determine if the person's detention is lawful.

Summarize this article: In order to make an international call, you must first dial the exit code for your country. This code, also known as a dial-out code or international access code, lets the carrier know that you will be calling another country. In the United States, Canada, and parts of the Caribbean, for instance, the exit code is 011, while in Mexico, the code is 00. If you don’t know your country’s exit code, you can search for it online, or you can see a list here: https://www.howtocallabroad.com/codes.html. After you dial the exit code for your country, you must then dial the prefix for the country you’re calling. Saudi Arabia's country code is 966. For example, if you’re in the U.S. and you want to call Saudi Arabia, you would dial 011 966. Once you’ve dialed the country code, you have to enter the city code, which may also be called an area code or a zone code. If the person gave you a 9-digit phone number, the city code is the first 2 numbers, so you don’t need to do anything special to find it. Otherwise, you’ll need to know the city you’re calling in order to find the city code.

In 2001, it had a population of 7,798 which had increased to 8,806 a decade later. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Isle of Wight is a county and the largest and second-most populous island in England. It is located in the English Channel, about 4 miles (6 km) off the coast of Hampshire, separated by the Solent. The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times, and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland and chines. - Warwickshire ( i / wrk / or / wrkr / ) is a landlocked non-metropolitan county in the West Midlands region of England . The county town is Warwick , although the largest town is Nuneaton . The county is famous for being the birthplace of William Shakespeare , George Eliot , & Aleister Crowley .

The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\"). - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - Old French (', ', \\"\\"; Modern French ) was the Gallo-Romance dialect continuum spoken from the 9th century to the 14th century. In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region. - Royal Leamington Spa, commonly known as Leamington Spa or Leamington, is a spa town in Warwickshire, England. Following the popularisation of the medicinal qualities of its water in the eighteenth century, in the nineteenth century the town experienced one of the most rapid expansions in England. It is named after the River Leam which flows through the town. - Nuneaton is a town in Warwickshire, England. The population in 2011 was 81,877, making it the largest town in Warwickshire. - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England. - Count (male) or countess (female) is a title in European countries for a noble of varying status, but historically deemed to convey an approximate rank intermediate between the highest and lowest titles of nobility. The word \\"count\\" came into English from the French \\"comte\\", itself from Latin \\"comes\\"in its accusative \\"comitem\\"meaning companion, and later companion of the emperor, delegate of the emperor. The adjective form of the word is \\"\\". The British and Irish equivalent is an earl (whose wife is a \\"countess\\", for lack of an English term). Alternative names for the \\"count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as \\"Graf\\" in Germany and \\"Hakushaku\\" during the Japanese Imperial era. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Coventry is a city and metropolitan borough in the West Midlands, England. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The world is the planet Earth and all life upon it, including human civilization. In a philosophical context, the world is the whole of the physical Universe, or an ontological world. In a theological context, the \\"world\\" is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred. The \\"end of the world\\" refers to scenarios of the final end of human history, often in religious contexts. - William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised) 23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet, and the \\"Bard of Avon\\". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.

No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected.

Premise: \\"Until the advent of Christianity, Samothrakiawas a very important island indeed.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The advent of Christianity meant religious power shifted away from Samothrakia.\\"?","completion":"To address the task, let's break it down step by step. Step 1: Understand the premise The premise given is that \\"Until the advent of Christianity, Samothraki was a very important island indeed.\\" This means that before Christianity came into the picture, Samothraki had some significance, which could be religious, cultural, political, or a combination of these factors. Step 2: Examine the hypothesis The hypothesis is \\"The advent of Christianity meant religious power shifted away from Samothrakia.\\" To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to examine the relationship between both statements. Step 3: Find the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis The premise talks about the importance of Samothraki before Christianity, and the hypothesis discusses a shift in religious power after the advent of Christianity. The key connection between these two statements is the impact of Christianity on Samothraki's importance, specifically in terms of religious power. Step 4: Analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis The premise states that Samothraki was important before Christianity came along, while the hypothesis proposes that with the advent of Christianity, religious power shifted away from Samothraki. If it's true that Samothraki's importance was tied to religious power, and the advent of Christianity led to a shift away from Samothraki, then there's a reasonable connection between the premise and hypothesis. Step 5: Conclusion Based on the analysis, if the premise is true, it suggests that there may be a connection to the hypothesis, which implies that the advent of Christianity might have resulted in religious power shifting away from Samothraki. However, the premise alone does not definitively prove this hypothesis. Further evidence would be necessary to establish this causal relationship."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

As part of his college thesis, 18-year-old Jason Moss (Jesse Moss) decides to write to serial killers and attempt to gain their trust through impersonating a typical victim or admirer. He reasoned that gaining their trust, possibly learning more about their stated crimes or unsolved murders, was a way to distinguish himself as a job candidate.He sends a carefully crafted letter to John Wayne Gacy (William Forsythe) in prison, portraying himself as a vulnerable boy. The film unfolds as Gacy, suspicious at first, puts Moss through intense emotional tests via letters and collect calls, and an eventual face-to-face visit in prison.The story opens with Moss's fascination in Gacy's case as Gacy, having spent 14 years on death row, awaits the court's decision regarding his final appeal.

These elements are depicted through highly elaborate animated sequences , which have been described as \`\` Baroque and complicated and hard to take in at a single viewing '' . - Violence is defined by the World Health Organization as \\"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\\", although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of \\"the use of power\\" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word. This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes. Violence in many forms is preventable. There... - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.

Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

And I was wondering What will happen to Remy? A:","completion":"Remy's decision to buy a new jacket and subsequently store it in their closet without ever wearing it can lead to a variety of outcomes and consequences. Although it may be impossible to predict the precise trajectory of Remy's life based on this single action alone, we can explore some potential scenarios and factors that may influence their situation. 1. Sense of satisfaction: Initially, Remy may have experienced gratification and happiness from purchasing the new jacket. This could be due to a personal preference for the style, the excitement of acquiring a new possession, or even retail therapy. However, the fact that Remy has chosen not to wear the jacket suggests that this satisfaction may be short-lived. 2. Emotional attachment: One possible explanation for Remy's reluctance to wear the jacket is the formation of an emotional attachment to the item. In this case, Remy might be hesitant to risk damaging or dirtying the jacket, leading them to preserve it in their closet. This attachment could result in mixed feelings - both pride in owning such a coveted item and frustration at not being able to enjoy it fully. 3. Financial consequences: Depending on the cost of the jacket, Remy may experience financial consequences of their purchase. If the jacket was relatively expensive, they might feel guilty or regretful about spending money on an item that they are not using. Alternatively, if the jacket was more affordable, the financial impact may be negligible. 4. Social impact: If Remy's friends and family are aware of the new jacket, they may inquire as to why it has not been worn yet. Depending on Remy's reasons for not wearing the jacket, they may experience embarrassment, annoyance, or even pressure to wear it. Additionally, if Remy tends to make impulsive purchases frequently, this behavior could negatively impact their relationships with others or lead to a reputation for being financially irresponsible. 5. Personal growth and reflection: Reflecting on this experience, Remy may decide to be more mindful of their decisions regarding future purchases. They may analyze the factors that led them to buy the jacket in the first place and strive to develop a better understanding of their needs and desires. This could result in more thoughtful decision-making and less impulsive behavior. 6. Reaching a decision: Ultimately, there are several possible paths Remy may choose to take with regard to the jacket. They may decide to confront any emotional attachment and begin wearing it, sell or donate the jacket to someone who will appreciate it, or perhaps even continue to store it in their closet as a reminder of their past behavior. Whichever path they choose, it is essential for Remy to find a resolution that aligns with their values, needs, and personal growth. In conclusion, the outcomes of Remy's action to purchase a jacket and not wear it are influenced by multiple factors, including personal feelings, financial implications, social repercussions, and opportunities for personal growth. While it is impossible to predict the precise impact this event may have on Remy's life, it is essential for them to recognize and learn from their experiences and strive for self-improvement and thoughtful decision-making."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The novel was written by French author Jules Verne and published in 1870. This story is one of the earliest examples of science fiction literature and is often credited with sparking people's interest in underwater exploration and adventure. Captain Nemo is a mysterious and multi-faceted character who serves as both an anti-hero and a sympathetic figure. He is a brilliant engineer and skilled leader who shuns contact with the world above the waves, choosing instead to dedicate his life to exploring the uncharted depths of the ocean. His real name remains unknown throughout the novel, and \\"Nemo\\" translates to \\"nobody\\" in Latin, emphasizing the aura of mystery surrounding his identity. Nemo appears to have a noble and tragic past. It is hinted that he was once a European aristocrat stripped of his title and forced to flee from persecution for political reasons. This led him to build the Nautilus and take himself and his crew into permanent exile beneath the sea. As a result, Captain Nemo harbors a deep resentment towards the societies and governments he believes have wronged him, occasionally embarking on acts of maritime sabotage and revenge. Under Captain Nemo's command, the Nautilus embarks on a groundbreaking voyage that takes the crew to locations such as the Sargasso Sea, the lost city of Atlantis, and the South Pole. As the novel unfolds, Captain Nemo and his crew, along with the protagonist Professor Pierre Aronnax, navigate through a variety of encounters, including enigmatic marine creatures, the fight against a giant squid, and dangerous undersea currents. Throughout the novel, Captain Nemo exhibits a combination of fearlessness, vulnerability, and complexity that makes his character truly captivating.

Raoul de Bragelonne finds his childhood sweetheart, Louise de La Valliere, is maid of honour to the Princess. Fearing a tarnishing of Louise's reputation by affairs at court, Raoul seeks to marry her. His father, Athos, the Comte de la Fere, disapproves, but eventually, out of love for his son, reluctantly agrees. The king, however, refuses to sanction the marriage because Louise is of inferior social status, and so marriage is delayed. Meanwhile, the struggle for power begins between Fouquet and Colbert. Louis attempts to impoverish Fouquet by asking for money to pay for a grand fete at Fontainebleau. Meanwhile, Aramis meets the governor of the Bastille M. de Baisemeaux, and learns of a secret prisoner who bears a striking resemblance to Louis XIV. Aramis uses this secret to persuade the dying general of the Jesuits to name him his successor. After Buckingham leaves France, the Comte de Guiche grows besotted with Henrietta, as soon does Louis XIV. To avoid her new husband being jealous Henrietta suggests that the king choose a young lady at court to act as a smokescreen for their flirtation. They select Louise de la Valliere for this part, but during the fete, the king overhears Louise confess her attraction for him to friends, and promptly forgets his affection for Henrietta. That same night Henrietta hears de Guiche confess his love for her to Raoul. The two pursue their own love affair. Aware of Louise's attachment, the king sends Raoul to England indefinitely as a diplomatic envoy. Rumours of the king's love affair cause friction with de Wardes, who has inherited from his father a hatred of d'Artagnan and all those associated with him. De Guiche is forced to fight a duel with him and is defeated and seriously wounded. The incident is the last straw for Madame Henrietta who resolves to dismiss Louise from her service as Maid of Honour. The king dissuades Henrietta, but she prevents the king from seeing Louise. The king circumvents Henrietta, and so she contacts her brother King Charles II, imploring him to eject Raoul from England. On his return to France, Raoul is heartbroken to discover Louise in the arms of the king. Athos finds out everything and spits his contempt at Louis XIV. The young King orders Athos's imprisonment, but D'Artagnan convinces him to release him.

Question: - Water is poured into the well of the machine - A filter is placed in the basket - Ground coffee is measured into the filter - Turning on the machine starts the water heating - The hot water rises up - The water drops into the ground coffee - The hot water passes through the grounds - The coffee drips into the pot from the basket. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process in brewing coffee using a drip coffee machine involves pouring water into the well of the machine. This step is crucial as it provides the necessary liquid base for the brewing process to take place. The water used should ideally be clean and free of impurities to ensure a great-tasting cup of coffee. To perform this step, follow these detailed instructions: 1. Start by choosing the desired amount of water based on the number of cups of coffee you want to make. It's essential to use the right amount of water to achieve the best coffee-to-water ratio and obtain your desired coffee strength. Typically, one cup of coffee requires about 8 ounces (240 milliliters) of water, but this can vary depending on personal preferences and the specific drip coffee machine being used. 2. Ensure that the water you're using is of good quality, as it can significantly affect the taste of the coffee. It's recommended to use filtered or bottled water, as tap water may contain chemicals that alter the taste. If using tap water, consider running it through a water filter to remove any potential contaminants. 3. Locate the well of the coffee machine, which is usually a compartment or reservoir at the back or side of the machine. The well is designed to hold the water needed for brewing and is connected to the heating element that will later heat the water. 4. Slowly pour the water into the well, being careful not to spill or overflow it. Some coffee machines have a marked water level indicator, which can help guide you in adding the correct amount of water. If this is not available, you may need to use a measuring cup to ensure accuracy. 5. Once the water is poured into the well, ensure that the well is securely closed or sealed, if applicable. This ensures that the water does not evaporate or spill when the machine is turned on. By completing this first step, you have successfully set the stage for the subsequent steps in the brewing process. This includes placing the filter, adding the coffee grounds, and ultimately allowing the heated water to pass through the grounds and extract the essential oils and flavors, resulting in a delicious cup of coffee at the end."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Two bird islands experienced different levels of rainfall. West island experienced a lengthy drought that lasted several years. Many birds were affected by this drought. East island had several normal years as far as rainfall was concerned. Which island had more big-beaked birds survive and reproduce? Hint: A period of very low rainfall occurred while the Grants were on the islands. The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased. This was clearly evolution by natural selection. The answer is:","completion":"East Island had more big-beaked birds survive and reproduce. The explanation for the answer lies in the concept of natural selection. In the given situation, West Island experienced a lengthy drought resulting in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could only eat smaller seeds, while birds with bigger beaks had an advantage, being able to eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many small-beaked birds on West Island died in the drought. On the other hand, East Island had normal years of rainfall, ensuring a consistent and diverse supply of seeds. This meant the big-beaked birds on East Island were not only able to survive but also reproduce, as natural selection favored their traits. In this case, the big-beaked birds had a higher chance of survival and reproduction on East Island, contributing to an increase in the average beak size among the finch population. This is an example of evolution by natural selection, where favorable traits are passed on to future generations, leading to a gradual change in the species' characteristics over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: The speaker wants all information possible so that they may be prepared. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Choose your answer from: (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","completion":"To answer this question, we need to analyze the connection between the two sentences mentioned. Sentence 1 is suggesting that the listener should not hesitate to share even the contrasting visions for next week. This implies that the speaker is open to receiving contrasting information and wants to be fully informed, which aligns with the sentiment of Sentence 2, where it is stated that the speaker wants all possible information to be prepared. Hence, we can infer that if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 is also likely to be true. The step-by-step justification for my conclusion is as follows: 1. The first sentence asserts a request or advice for sharing all forms of visions, even if they oppose previous ones. 2. This, in principle, shows an openness to acquiring as much information as possible. 3. The second sentence expresses this same principle more directly: the speaker yearns for as much information as possible to prepare. 4.

Here's a question: While getting drunk the body can only process so much at a time, go too fast and your belly might just make you what? Here are possible answers to this question: - getting arrested - throw up - staggering - fall down - explode I believe the correct choice is \\"throw up\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"throw up\\", and the reason for this is primarily due to the body's natural response to excessive alcohol consumption. When a person consumes alcohol, it is absorbed by the stomach and small intestine before entering the bloodstream. The liver then metabolizes the alcohol and removes it from the body. However, the liver can only process a certain amount of alcohol per hour, usually around one standard drink. When a person drinks alcohol too quickly, it overwhelms the liver's ability to metabolize the alcohol effectively. This causes the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to rise, leading to intoxication. The more alcohol is consumed in a short period, the higher the BAC and the greater the degree of intoxication. As the BAC increases, the person may experience symptoms such as slurred speech, loss of coordination, and impaired judgment, which can result in the other possible outcomes mentioned in the prompt – getting arrested, staggering, and falling down. However, the body has a physiological response specifically designed to protect itself from potentially fatal levels of alcohol poisoning, and this response is vomiting or \\"throwing up.\\" Vomiting serves as a protective mechanism for the body when faced with excessive alcohol consumption. The body recognizes that it is unable to process the alcohol at the rate it's being consumed, and in order to prevent further intoxication, the body induces vomiting to expel the alcohol from the stomach before it can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This prevents the BAC from reaching dangerously high levels, which could lead to alcohol poisoning, coma, or even death. Aside from vomiting, other factors contributing to the body's adverse reaction to too much alcohol include irritation to the stomach lining and the release of certain chemicals and hormones that stimulate feelings of nausea and dizziness. As a result, the body attempts to rid itself of both the alcohol and the associated toxins, ultimately causing the person to \\"throw up.\\" In conclusion, the rationale behind choosing \\"throw up\\" as the correct answer is rooted in the body's natural response to excessive alcohol consumption beyond its processing abilities. By inducing vomiting, the body is able to prevent further intoxication and reduce the risk of alcohol poisoning, which sets \\"throw up\\" apart from the other possible outcomes that can arise from drinking too fast."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These fossils showed that this entire area was once at the bottom of a sea. It can only mean that Mt. Everest was uplifted. In fact, the entire Himalaya mountain range was raised. It was forced up from the collision of two continents. Fossils of plants are found in Antarctica. Now, Antarctica is almost completely covered with ice. Plants do not grow in Antarctica. According to fossils, they once did. This means that Antarctica was once much warmer than it is now. These fossils tell us about Antarcticas past climate.

Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher... Answer:","completion":"Camille"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"What happened right after the Achean War?\\" Context: \\"Scholars and historians are divided as to what event signals the end of the Hellenistic era. The Hellenistic period may be seen to end either with the final conquest of the Greek heartlands by Rome in 146 BC following the Achean War, with the final defeat of the Ptolemaic Kingdom at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, or even the move by Roman emperor Constantine the Great of the capital of the Roman Empire to Constantinople in 330 AD. \\"Hellenistic\\" is distinguished from \\"Hellenic\\" in that the first encompasses the entire sphere of direct ancient Greek influence, while the latter refers to Greece itself.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"After the Achean War, which took place from 146 BC to 146 BC, several significant events and repercussions occurred that reshaped the ancient world and set the stage for Rome's dominance in the Mediterranean region. The Greek heartlands (excluding the Hellenistic kingdoms in the East) were now under Roman control, marking the end of an era and the beginning of a new political landscape. 1. The fall of the Achaean League: The Achaean War led to the fall of the Achaean League, which was a confederation in ancient Greece, consisting primarily of city-states in the northern and central parts of the Peloponnese. The League aimed to maintain autonomy from the Hellenistic kingdoms and preserve Greek culture, but after its defeat in the Achean War, it was disbanded, and its territories were divided among Rome's provincial administrators. 2. The destruction of Corinth: Roman forces, under the command of Lucius Mummius Achaicus, dealt a significant blow to Greek pride by destroying the ancient city-state of Corinth in 146 BC, after they captured and plundered it. Many of its inhabitants were either killed or enslaved, and Corinth's art and treasures were shipped off to Rome. This act symbolized the subjugation of the Greek states under Roman authority. 3. Roman hegemony over Greece: With the fall of the Achaean League and the destruction of Corinth, Rome solidified its control over the Greek city-states, incorporating the territories into the newly created Roman province of Achaea. Greek states, while allowed a degree of local autonomy, were now required to submit to the authority of Roman provincial governors and contribute resources and manpower to the Roman Empire. 4. The decline of Hellenistic influences: In the wake of the Achean War, the Hellenistic era saw its influence decline, although certain facets of Greek culture, art, and philosophy persisted in the eastern Mediterranean. Many Greeks who were not under direct Roman control moved east, where they could continue to live within Hellenistic society. This eastward shift set the stage for a future confrontation between the Roman Empire and the Hellenistic kingdoms, primarily Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid Empire. 5. The rise of Rome as the dominant world power: With its conquest over the Greek heartlands and the continued decline of Hellenistic powers in the east, Rome now sat as the dominant world power, with its control stretching as far as modern-day Spain to Egypt and Central Europe. The Roman Republic's government structure, military prowess, and influence continued to grow, eventually giving way to the Roman Empire under Augustus. 6. Enhanced exposure to Greek culture for Rome: The Achean War put Rome in a position to be heavily influenced by Greek culture. Many Greek texts were translated into Latin, and Roman upper classes began to adopt and emulate Greek art, philosophy, science, and architecture, integrating their Hellenized elements into Roman society. In conclusion, the immediate aftermath of the Achean War led to the fall of the Achaean League, the destruction of Corinth, Roman hegemony over Greece, the decline of Hellenistic influence, a shift in Greek culture to the east, and the rise of Rome as the predominant world power. Furthermore, the direct exposure to Greek culture fueled Rome's fascination with Greek intellectual approach and artistic expression, which eventually integrated into the fabric of Roman society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cardiff competed in top flight but could only manage a fourth-place finish in 1990-91, and exited the Cup at the quarter-final stage. The season did involve some highlights however, such as beating league runners-up and Cup champions Llanelli 43-0 at the Arms Park and beating league champions Neath 18-4 away in the last game of the season. 1991-92 was possibly the club's worst-ever season, beset with disagreements between coach Alan Phillips and manager John Scott. Cardiff crashed out of the Cup before the quarter-final stage and lost at home to Maesteg and Newbridge in the league. Their final league finish was ninth, which would have led to their relegation but the WRU decided mid-season to switch to a 12-team Premiership, therefore saving Cardiff and Maesteg from relegation. Both Scott and Phillips resigned following the season. Australian Alex Evans took over at Cardiff as coach for the 1992-93 season, bringing in former Arms Park legend Terry Holmes and famous ex-Pontypool front-row member Charlie Faulkner as assistants, and helped a turnaround in the club's fortunes, winning their first seven matches of the season and 20 of their first 22 to top the league in the new year. This run came to an end on 23 January; they were knocked out of the Schweppes Cup by St Peter's, who were fourth from bottom of Division Four. The Blue and Blacks only lost four league games all season though, but were unlucky to be competing against Llanelli in the league, who won the double and were considered the best club team in the UK after beating Australia 13-9. In 1993-94 they slid back to fourth in the league but won the SWALEC Cup (renamed from Schweppes Cup for sponsorship reasons) by beating Llanelli, who'd won the tournament for the last three years running. The score in the final was 15-8, with tries from Mike Rayer and club captain centre Mike Hall and kicks from fly-half Adrian Davies. In 1994-95 Cardiff won the final league title of the amateur era in Wales, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Cup before going down 16-9 to Swansea.

Sam stays in Clydie's barn while repairing her late husband's Triumph motorcycle. Meanwhile Hale has one of his men, Mr. Dunston (Ted Levine), try to force Clydie into selling her land.

The Smiths were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1982. The band consisted of vocalist Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr, bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce. Critics have called them one of the most important bands to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s. NME named the Smiths the \\"most influential artist ever\\" in a 2002 poll. In early 1987 the single \\"Shoplifters of the World Unite\\" was released and reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. It was followed by a second compilation, The World Won't Listen. The title was Morrissey's comment on his frustration with the band's lack of mainstream recognition, although the album reached number two in the charts. This was followed by the single \\"Sheila Take a Bow\\", the band's second (and last during the band's lifetime) UK top-10 hit. Another compilation, Louder Than Bombs, was intended for the overseas market and covered much the same material as The World Won't Listen, with the addition of \\"Sheila Take a Bow\\" and material from Hatful of Hollow which was yet to be released in the US. Despite their continued success, tensions emerged within the band to threaten their split. Johnny Marr was exhausted and took a break from the band in June 1987, which he felt was negatively perceived by his bandmates. In July, Marr left the group because he erroneously thought an NME article entitled \\"Smiths to Split\\" was planted by Morrissey. That article, written by Danny Kelly, alleged that Morrissey disliked Marr working with other musicians, and that Marr and Morrissey's personal relationship had reached breaking point. Marr contacted NME to explain that he had not left the band due to personal tensions but because he wanted wider musical scope. Former Easterhouse guitarist Ivor Perry was brought in to replace Marr, and the band recorded some material with him which was never completed, including an early version of \\"Bengali in Platforms\\", originally intended as the B-side of \\"Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before\\". Perry was uncomfortable with the situation, stating \\"it was like they wanted another Johnny Marr\\", and the sessions ended with (according to Perry) \\"Morrissey running out of the studio\\". By the time the group's fourth album Strangeways, Here We Come was released in September, the band had split. The breakdown in the relationship has been primarily attributed to Morrissey's irritation by Marr's work with other artists and Marr growing frustrated by Morrissey's musical inflexibility. Marr particularly hated Morrissey's obsession with covering 1960s pop artists such as Twinkle and Cilla Black. Marr recalled in 1992, \\"That was the last straw, really. I didn't form a group to perform Cilla Black songs.\\" In a 1989 interview, Morrissey cited the lack of a managerial figure and business problems as reasons for the band's split. Strangeways, Here We Come peaked at number two in the UK and was their most successful album in the US, reaching number 55 on the Billboard 200. It received a lukewarm reception from critics, but both Morrissey and Marr name it as their favourite Smiths album. A couple of further singles from Strangeways were released with live, session and demo tracks as B-sides. The following year the live recording Rank, recorded in 1986 with Craig Gannon on rhythm guitar, repeated the UK chart success of previous albums. what other aspects of their story did you find interesting?","completion":"The Smiths were a popular band from England that started in 1982. They had four main members: Morrissey, Johnny Marr, Andy Rourke, and Mike Joyce. People really liked their music, and they were an important band during the 1980s. In 1987, they had a song called \\"Shoplifters of the World Unite\\" that did pretty well. They also made other albums, but some problems started happening within the band. Johnny Marr, the guitarist, took a break and later left the band because of misunderstandings with other members. They tried to replace him with another guitarist, but it didn't work out well. Eventually, the band broke up because Morrissey and Marr had different ideas about what kind of music they wanted to make. They made one last album called \\"Strangeways, Here We Come\\" which did well, but the band was already over by the time it came out. So, the interesting parts of their story are how popular they were, the problems they faced as a band, and the reasons for their breakup."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let me analyze the context of the word \\"side\\" in both sentences. In the first sentence, \\"He is on the purchasing side of the business,\\" the word \\"side\\" refers to a specific aspect or division within a larger entity (in this case, the business). Here, it means a part of the business that is focused on purchasing. In the second sentence, \\"Look on the bright side,\\" the word \\"side\\" refers to a positive or optimistic perspective or aspect of a situation.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The \\"continental shelf\\" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater. Here the coastal nation has the exclusive right to harvest minerals and also living resources \\"attached\\" to the seabed. answer the following question: What zone gives the coastal nation exclusive rights to harvest minerals?

As the icy breeze blew gently outside, Jane looked Jeff deep into his eyes, feeling the weight of their past behind every syllable they exchanged. The fireplace emitted a warm glow, providing comfort for the two old friends who now found themselves at a crossroads. Jeff remembered the day they had become friends, years ago in elementary school. It was a hot summer day and they were both at the local fair, playing games and enjoying cotton candy together. From that moment on, they were inseparable as the best of friends, finding solace and adventures in one another. They shared a bond that transcended time, and none could fathom the thought of it ending. Jane could not deny the truth in Jeff's words. For years, there had been an unspoken connection between them, a potent force that was impossible to ignore. She recalled the countless moments they had shared – from the late-night conversations that stretched for hours, to the picnics in the park, the butterflies she had always felt in her stomach whenever Jeff was near, and the trust that grew stronger with each passing day. And yet, she couldn't shake the feeling that the change in their friendship's dynamics was irreversible. As the conversation unfolded, the intensity of the emotions continued to build. \\"You know I’ve always had a thing for you, too,\\" Jane whispered, a trembling vulnerability evident in her voice. \\"But I never wanted to risk our friendship. I knew we had something special, something that most people could only dream of. And while a relationship could have been fulfilling beyond belief, is it really worth losing everything we've built together?\\" Jeff sighed, the burden of the truth weighing heavily on his shoulders. He had always been honest with his feelings, even if it had taken him years to muster up the courage to admit them to Jane. It was a gamble, yes, but one that he believed fate had destined for them. As their eyes continued to lock, the two friends confronted their deepest fears and uncertainties. \\"If we hadn't kissed under that mistletoe, we might have been able to keep our feelings at bay,\\" Jane admitted, tearfully. \\"But the spark between us is undeniable, Jeff. Sooner or later, it would have ignited, like an ember catching fire to turn into a full-fledged inferno.\\" He nodded in agreement, knowing that they had reached a crucial point in their journey. \\"It was inevitable,” Jeff said, reaching out and placing his hand on hers gently. “And maybe... just maybe it's time for us to explore that connection deeper. Our friendship is strong, Jane. Strong enough, I believe, to withstand the challenges that may come our way. We owe it to ourselves to see where this passion can lead us.\\" The silence in the room was palpable, as if each word had reverberated within the walls, echoing the gravity of these life-altering realizations. They both knew that this path, once taken, could change the course of their lives forever. \\"We have to be honest with ourselves first,\\" Jane whispered, bravely meeting his gaze. \\"Can we really let go of the past and open our hearts to the possibilities that lie ahead, even if it means risking everything we know and cherish?\\" After a moment, Jeff gave an answer that spoke to his earnest conviction and faith in their bond. \\"We have to try, Jane. Isn't the happiness and fulfillment we could potentially find together worth that risk?\\" With that, they held hands and stepped forward, knowing that the journey ahead might be fraught with uncertainty but guided by the unshakeable truth that their love had been building for years - a love that had finally blossomed with the help of a simple sprig of mistletoe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Not a heavy, cleansing rain that leaves the streets steaming and the neatly sculptured yards lush and fragrant. This is a gray drizzling rain. A rain that makes him think of places like England and Scotland as they appear in those disturbing late night films on cable, the ones in black and white that weren't particularly memorable when they were made and are even less so now. Still, it rains and the air is cool. All he has to shelter him is a think nylon jacket. The jacket is soaked. It feels both chilly and coarse against his skin. His hair hangs in flat and sodden wings, falling into his eyes. It's long in the back, almost to his shoulders, and he thinks that the cars that pass him on the street, the occupants of those cars, might look at him and see only that he is wet and not that he is dirty as well. Can they tell that his hair has been unwashed for days? That his clothes are the same ones he's worn for more than a week? It doesn't matter. He's invisible to them as soon as they pass, taking any assumptions they might make with them. They might just mistake him for one of those hoity-toity college kids, one of those clean limbed and beaming have's who has happened to find himself caught out without his umbrella. He makes a desultory attempt to straighten his shoulders, to lift his eyes from the buckled sidewalk. To look like he might have a purpose or a destination. It doesn't help. He has become the day. He has internalized the environment. He did that years ago, in fact. That's all I can do. Not his words, of course, but he understands them. He is intimately acquainted with his limitations. Question: The narrator is probably thinking about England for? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"The narrator is probably thinking about England (and Scotland) because the gray drizzling rain that surrounds him is reminiscent of the stereotypical weather in those locations. The comparison to these specific places serves to reinforce the overall gloomy, damp, and depressing atmosphere that permeates his environment. Moreover, the mention of England and Scotland in this context might also be influenced by the narrator's association of the weather with the black and white late-night films he had seen on cable, which were set in those countries. The connection between the rain and the countries, here, not only emphasizes the lingering gloominess but also provides a visual and emotional setting, making the reader feel more immersed in the character's experience. Furthermore, the narrator's thoughts about England and Scotland might signify his desire to escape from his current situation, which is filled with discomfort, despair, and feelings of invisibility. It is possible that the foreign lands mentioned serve as a symbol of a distant reality that he yearns for but cannot reach, due to his current limitations and circumstances.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The actress felt bad about being rejected because she had originally helped to create and develop the character in the play, having the role written specifically for her. She had previously performed the role successfully in both Scotland and New York, and it held a significant personal connection for her. The dismissal and disbelief from the new casting director was hurtful, as her genuine experience and role-origination were questioned, effectively erasing her previous contributions and making her feel as if she were lying, which was not the case. Additionally, despite the fact she was okay with not being called back, there might have still been a sense of disappointment, as she had expressed her interest in wanting to do the show with this new group of people."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The island's proximity to the river and the ocean suggests that the area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet the indigenous people, mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise artisan fishing, just to supply their own daily needs. Pirogues cut from the trunks of kapok trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from Mali, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.The collection of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still takes place in Casamance, which is one of three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are an important component of the family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers. Answer:","completion":"The four ways the oysters are cooked by the Jola people are: 1. Boiled: Oysters are boiled and consumed with a spicy sauce. 2. Grilled: Oysters are grilled on a wood fire, typically served with a spicy sauce. 3. Sun-dried: Oysters destined for sale or preservation are dried under the sun. 4.

Premise: \\"But it doesn't exactly count as a trophy from the barricades.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The Navy beat the Army at the football playoffs this year, but it is not as significant as the efforts and victories on the field of battle in Iraq and Afghanistan. \\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"But it doesn't exactly count as a trophy from the barricades\\" is true, this statement highlights the idea that a certain achievement, likely in a non-combat situation, is not directly comparable to the accomplishments attained in the context of war or military conflict. The premise emphasizes the distinction between the two types of achievements and acknowledges the significance of feats from the battlefield. To determine the extent to which this premise is relevant to the hypothesis \\"The Navy beat the Army at the football playoffs this year, but it is not as significant as the efforts and victories on the field of battle in Iraq and Afghanistan,\\" it is essential to analyze the connection between these two statements. Comparing the hypothesis to the premise, we observe the following features: 1. Both statements recognize an achievement: In the premise, it's implied that a victory has occurred, but it falls short of being considered as valuable as a battlefield achievement. In the hypothesis, the Navy's victory over the Army in a football game is presented, but it is compared to and contrasted with the accomplishments in actual war zones. 2. Both statements emphasize a difference in the accomplishment's significance: The premise highlights that the accomplishment being discussed isn't exactly comparable to a trophy from the barricades, referring to the medals, honors, and recognition bestowed on military personnel for their participation in wars or combat. Similarly, the hypothesis identifies that, while the Navy's triumph in the football playoffs might be noteworthy, it doesn't hold the same gravitas as the victories on the field of battle in Iraq and Afghanistan. Taking into account these similarities, if the premise holds true, we can surmise that it supports and echoes the sentiment behind the hypothesis. Both statements emphasize the distinction between achievements in non-combat scenarios compared to those in war-related situations. They also acknowledge the greater significance of efforts and victories on the battlefield. Consequently, the premise's assertion that a particular achievement doesn't exactly count as a trophy from the barricades solidifies the contrast presented in the hypothesis. Thus, the premise indeed substantiates the hypothesis, implying that, while the Navy's football playoff victory may be a source of pride and celebration, it cannot be considered comparable to the gravity and importance of the accomplishments in the field of battle in Iraq and Afghanistan. The hard-fought victories and experiences that military personnel face during war constitute a different realm of achievements, deserving of recognition and respect beyond the sphere of sports and leisure activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Dear Annie: I am a computer programmer and, for several years now, I've spent a lot of time and energy training and helping other members of my team. I read program codes for them, check their e-mails before they send them to the boss (because they ask me to), edit their programs, and share my ideas before mentioning them to our boss. I really enjoy going the extra mile to finish projects on time and help people develop their skills. The problem is, I don't think my boss even knows that I'm doing any of this, because recently I've realized that my colleagues are taking credit for my ideas when they speak with him. I don't want to stop being helpful, but how can I do it without being overshadowed?Nice, but Unnoticed Dear N.U: This is a great question. Reams of research have shown that a major obstacle to productivity and performance in teams is \\"information hoarding\\"and a big reason why people hoard information is because they fear ending up in precisely your predicament. \\"People who are team players and like helping others can get burned, if the boss isn't aware of their helpfulness,\\" says Kathy Sanborn, a career coach (see www.lifeandcareercoaching.com) and author of The Seasons of Your Career (McGraw-Hill Professional, 12.95). But there are ways to go that extra mile without feeling like a chump. Sanborn thinks you should call a private meeting with your boss and tell him what you've been doing, maybe even suggesting that a new title, such as \\"trainer\\" or \\"staff developer,\\" be added to your current one. Even if that idea doesn't fly, at least your boss will be apprised of what you're contributing. Don't be surprised if he wonders why you didn't speak up sooner. Beyond that, Sanborn says, you need to \\"be a bit more circumspect about giving your ideas away to your teammates. You may be slowing your own opportunities for advancement by hiding your light under a bushel. Continue helping those around you, but only when asked.\\" Helping someone figure out code is one thing, but presenting people with valuable new ideas that may never be credited to you is something else entirely. If you're not careful, Sanborn notes, \\"you may be left behind at the bottom of the career ladder while these others scamper past you on the way to success.\\" And that would be a real shame. Most companies need more nice people, not more sneaky ingrates, at the top. Dear Annie: I enjoyed your comments last week about finding a summer internship (and by the way, you're right: The best way is to know someone. I got a great internship last summer working for a friend of my dad's golf partner.) But my question is a bit different: Now that I'm a senior, what are my prospects for getting a \\"real\\" job when I graduate? Are campus recruiters serious about hiring new grads, or are they just taking down names and resumes for future reference?Employee-in-Waiting Dear E.W.: All indications are that recruiters are indeed serious. The National Association of Colleges and Employers expects college hiring to increase 13% this time aroundup to 20% in some parts of the country. That's partly because hiring in general is slowly coming out of the doldrums, and partly because so many baby boomers will be retiring in the next few years that companies are starting to get nervous about having enough people. Business, accounting, and economics majors are in the catbird seat, but even liberal arts grads have a good shot. Wayne Wallace, director of the University of Florida's career resource center, says he's seeing a surge in interest from \\"employers who say, 'If you're a college grad and want to learn our business, we'll take you from that point on.'\\" In other words, you don't even need to be able to read a balance sheetat least not yet. Dear Annie: Can you settle an argument? I'm in charge of planning this year's holiday party at my office, and I'd like to arrange with a local taxicab company to reserve enough cars for that evening, so that anyone who would like a ride home can get one. A colleague disagrees. He thinks that if we announce we're doing this, it will just encourage people to drink too much. Your thoughts, please?Designating Drivers Dear D.D.: Hmm. Does your colleague really think that a few people aren't going to drink too much anyway, whether you provide a safe way home or not? I'm with you. Be on the safe side. Hire the cabs. All it would take is one DWI arrest or, God forbid, one serious accident to make everyoneespecially youwish you had. Apparently your teammates are unskilled. Its your boss's job to get them trained. Btw, you seem talented and smart in your job. Why are u being such a wuss, trying to please everyone. Also the boss does not need to know abt your \\"staff training' abilities if thats not what you are being paid for. Seems to me that you want credit for 'helping' your teammates.

What is the title of this article: Depending on which component of sexual orientation is being assessed and referenced, different conclusions can be drawn about the prevalence rate of homosexuality which has real world consequences. Knowing how much of the population is made up of homosexual individuals influences how this population may be seen or treated by the public and government bodies. For example, if homosexual individuals constitute only 1% of the general population they are politically easier to ignore or than if they are known to be a constituency that surpasses most ethnic and ad minority groups. If the number is relatively minor then it is difficult to argue for community based same sex programs and services, mass media inclusion of gay role models, or Gay/Straight Alliances in schools. For this reason, in the 1970s Bruce Voeller, the chair of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force perpetuated a common myth that the prevalence of homosexuality is 10% for the whole population by averaging a 13% number for men and a 7% number for women.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: You should have no more than three options for shots any time you get up to the box to take a penalty kick in soccer. Don't make it more difficult on yourself than it needs to be. Practice taking three differently placed penalty kicks, and call that your repertoire of shots. Perfect each one of them, so you know you'll be able to score in any of the three places when the time comes and you make that decision. Wherever your most comfortable, highest-probability shots are, practice them and don't worry about any other choices. Most goalies will dive left or right at random, making it very difficult to anticipate where the goalie will be when you shoot. Since it happens so quickly, you're playing a game of chance, always. If the goalie is familiar with your style of play, however, it's good to have a few go-to options in your bag at all times. Again, more shots are missed than saved, so it's mostly up to you. Most saves happen in the bottom right corner of the goal. Some goalies guess that right-footed kickers will try to outsmart them by going to the non-natural corner. It's best to go easy and uncomplicated the process. Shoot to the corner that feels best. Anyone can blast a ball into the back of the net a couple times, but what about when you've been going hard on the field for half an hour, fighting for balls, taking corner kicks. Your legs will be tired, you'll be sweaty and exhausted and all of a sudden all the eyes will be on you. Your legs might feel like lead, but you've got to come through with a brilliant goal that'll put your team ahead. Train the right way. Take penalty kicks when you're tired and learn to slow down and calm yourself, focusing on the mechanics and the motions to help yourself score. For some players, a two-step approach will be plenty to get the power they're looking for. Others might need a different amount of steps, or may want to play around with psyching out the goalkeeper with different approaches and fancy footwork. That's fine. Practice approaching your kicks from different steps back and see what feels the most comfortable for you. Some players like to take a few more steps back to force a stutter-step, a few little quick strides before driving into the ball. This helps to throw the timing of the goalie off, and can force the keeper to jump early, meaning that you might be able to shoot into an open net. Again, easy to blast balls into an open net. Practice with a keeper who's trash talking. Practice while your little brother makes fun of you from behind, telling you that you're going to miss. Practice when there's loud music playing, bugs howling, and it's raining out. Practice in the worst conditions and you'll be prepared for anything. Time to get zen on the PK game. If you want to really take your penalty kick shooting to the next level, practice them with your eyes closed. Literally. The distance from the penalty spot to the goal and the dimensions of the goal will be identical every time you want to take a penalty kick. This means that your approach, your mechanics, and your shot-placement should be automatic. You should be able to do this with your eyes closed. Why not try it?","completion":"To improve penalty kicks in soccer, focus on perfecting three different shots and practice them regularly. Goalies often dive randomly, so having multiple go-to options is beneficial. Train under various conditions, like when tired or with distractions, to build resilience. Adjust your approach based on what feels comfortable and experiment with different steps or stutter techniques to throw off the goalie. To take your skills to the next level, practice with your eyes closed since the distance and dimensions of the goal remain the same in every penalty kick scenario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu. Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Yang You.

Taurica became the Province of Chersonesos, which also included Bosporos and the southern coast of Crimea. This enlargement of Byzantine Taurica resulted in the elevation of the ranks of its governors. In the second half of the 6th century, the military and civil authorities in the region were entrusted to the military deputy, \\"doux Chersonos\\". Furthermore, the city of Chersonnesos was used by the Romans as a place of banishment: St. Clement of Rome was exiled there and first preached the Gospel. Another exile was Justinian II, who is said to have destroyed the city in revenge. Most of Roman Crimea fell under Khazar overlordship in the late 7th century. In the mid-8th century the rebellious Crimean Goths were put down by the Khazars and their city, Doros , was occupied. A Khazar tudun was resident at Chersonesos already in 690, despite the fact that this town was nominally subject to the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine emperors controlled the southern shores of the Crimea peninsula until the 13th century. Control then passed to the Empire of Trebizond, one of the successor states to the Byzantine Empire after the sack of Constantinople in 1204. Another offshoot, the Principality of Theodoro, endured until 1475, when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire.

They were close friends, and despite their differences in well-being, they always tried to live similarly. It was fascinating to see the distinction in their lifestyles - how Jason appeared to be a staunch follower of nature's persistent wisdom, while Lawrence had to constantly work harder to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It seemed as though Jason was blessed with an innate predisposition towards well-being, and he rarely felt the need to monitor his dietary habits closely or set specific time aside to partake in exercise. He would drink water and eat vegetables of course, but he did so without thinking and rarely experienced a true distaste for them. On the other hand, Lawrence genuinely hated having to drink water and eat vegetables; however, he recognized the importance of doing so for his health and continuously worked to establish it as part of his routine. Jason's genetic advantage manifested more than through mere physical attributes. His mind felt clear and focused, enabling him to prioritize tasks at hand and concentrate on long-term goals. Despite enduring the usual ups and downs that life threw his way, Jason's immunity seemed rather robust, and he rarely succumbed to common diseases like colds and flus. Lawrence, however, was not as fortunate. He battled with fluctuating energy levels, mood swings, and bouts of irritability, often leaving him feeling drained and weary. He was also more prone to catching colds and other communicable diseases, which hampered his performance at work and dampened his social life. All these factors significantly impacted his overall well-being. However, Lawrence was a resilient and diligent individual. Realizing the need to put in more effort, he began researching different approaches to maintain a healthy lifestyle. He started incorporating more water and vegetables into his meals, even though he disliked them. Lawrence attempted several strategies - blending them into smoothies, finding creative ways like adding various herbs and spices to enhance the flavor of his food, and even using diverse cooking techniques to make vegetables more palatable. Furthermore, Lawrence enrolled in the gym, hit the jogging paths in his community, and attended yoga classes regularly. He experimented with a variety of physical activities, hoping to find the ones that would provide him with the optimal benefits and suit his personal preferences. He never gave up his quest to craft a lifestyle that worked best for him. As time went on, Lawrence began to notice improvements. His energy levels stabilized, and his immune system strengthened. The consistent application of these newfound habits considerably reduced his prior irritability, leading him to feel more focused and at peace with himself. Ultimately, Lawrence realized the significance of discipline, determination, and resilience in the journey towards creating a healthier and more fulfilling life, something that his good friend Jason seemed to possess naturally. In conclusion, while Jason was naturally healthy, effortlessly maintaining his well-being, Lawrence had to consciously put forth constant effort to live a healthy lifestyle. By embracing his personal challenges and continually adapting his habits to achieve good health, Lawrence became an inspirational story of transformation and growth, teaching others that with persistence and unwavering dedication, it is possible to overcome even the most unpalatable obstacles life sets before us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ben enjoyed the visit and planned to return. Which state had more people inhaling organic chemicals from the wildfire smoke? Hint: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer. Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream... Answer:","completion":"Washington state had more people inhaling organic chemicals from the wildfire smoke than Oregon. Given that Washington state experienced many wildfires year-round while Oregon almost had no wildfires, it is logical to deduce that the state with more wildfires would have a higher number of people exposed to and inhaling the organic chemicals present in wildfire smoke. In this case, Washington state is more affected by such exposure than Oregon. The inhalation of particulate matter from wildfire smoke can have various adverse effects on human health, especially on the respiratory system. As the smoke's composition varies, containing carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides, and other compounds, the primary health concern arises from the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide. The various sizes of particulate matter (coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM) influence the body differently, depending on the depth they can reach into the respiratory system. Coarse particles can cause pulmonary inflammation leading to eye and sinus irritation, sore throat, and coughing, while smaller particulates can trigger issues deep within the lungs and bloodstream. Furthermore, individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma, may experience exacerbated symptoms as a result of exposure to these particulates. Relaying the evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke to the public is crucial to limit exposure and promote positive health outcomes. This information can influence policy-making and encourage strategies that minimize the risks associated with exposure to organic chemicals from wildfire smoke. In conclusion, Washington state, which witnessed more wildfires, had a higher number of individuals inhaling organic chemicals from wildfire smoke compared to Oregon. It is essential to raise public awareness of the adverse health impacts of wildfire smoke and implement measures to reduce exposure and protect vulnerable populations."},{"prompt":"Given those answer options, answer the question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: who is leaving criminal minds Suggested answer: The game would require players to examine crime scenes for clues to help solve murder mysteries.

Fact 2: Fish are the first known true chordates. A:","completion":"Part #1: Identifying the overlapping concept between the two facts. Usage: The overlapping concept in this case is \\"chordates.\\" Both facts mention chordates, with Fact 1 describing a characteristic of chordates (having a backbone) and Fact 2 mentioning fish as the first true chordates. This overlapping concept helps us form a chain. Part #2: Borrowing the subject from one fact. Usage: The subject from Fact 1 is \\"vertebrates.\\" Vertebrates are described as a sub-group within chordates that have a backbone. This subject can be used in the concluding fact. Part #3: Borrowing a conclusion from the other fact. Usage: The conclusion from Fact 2 is that \\"fish are the first known true chordates.\\" This conclusion can be combined with the subject of Fact 1 to create the chain effect needed for the concluding fact. Part #4: Forming the concluding fact by combining the subject from one fact with the conclusion from the other fact. Usage: The concluding fact, using the subject from Fact 1 and the conclusion from Fact 2, is: \\"Vertebrates, including fish, are the first known true chordates with a backbone.\\" This fact forms a chain by connecting the idea of vertebrates having a backbone from Fact 1 with the idea that fish are the first true chordates from Fact 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. Now, I have a new situation: Two teams studied two types of animals: team A studied predators, while team B studied grazers. They learned a lot from this experience. Answer this question please: Which team learned less about wolves? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Team B learned less about wolves. This is because Team B studied grazers, which are animals that feed on plants, such as deer or rabbits. Wolves are predators that hunt and eat other animals, and therefore, they would be the focus of Team A's study. So, Team A would have learned more about wolves than Team B, who were studying grazers instead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Plot title: Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter Movie plot: In 1818, Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) lives in Indiana with his parents, Nancy (Robin McLeavy) and Thomas (Joseph Mawle), who works at a plantation owned by Jack Barts (Marton Csokas). There, Lincoln befriends a young African American boy, William Johnson (Anthony Mackie), and intervenes when he sees Johnson being beaten by a slaver. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She falls ill the following day, and dies shortly afterwards. Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy. Nine years later, Lincoln decides to get revenge against Barts. He attacks Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a vampire, overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper). Sturgess explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. During his training, Sturgess tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam (Rufus Sewell), a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans with his sister, Vadoma (Erin Wasson). Sturgess also tells Lincoln of the vampires' weakness, silver, and presents him with a silver pocket watch. In Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), and meets Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Though Sturgess warned him not to form any close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary. Lincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts. Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturgess is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturgess, who reveals that, several years ago, he was attacked and bitten by Adam. Because Sturgess' soul was impure, he became a vampire, and that prevented him from harming Adam or any other vampire (since \\"Only the living can kill the dead\\"). Sturgess has since been training vampire hunters, hoping to destroy Adam. Disappointed, Lincoln decides to abandon his mission. However, Adam learns of his... My question: Who plays Joshua?

A paraphrase is a restatement of a text or passage that retains the original meaning while using different words or structure. While some details may be changed, paraphrases should retain the core meaning of the passage at hand. Upon closer examination, we can identify several differences between these two sentences: 1. In the first sentence, it says \\"the film,\\" while in the second sentence, it says \\"the movie.\\" Although this is a minor difference and is essentially just a synonym swap, it does not change the fact that both sentences are conveying the same message – that the story begins when Seelabathi and her mother arrive somewhere. 2. The first sentence specifies that Seelabathi and her mother are arriving \\"from Bengal to Kerala,\\" while the second sentence reverses this, stating the characters are arriving \\"to Bengal from Kerala.\\" This change in locations represents a more significant departure from the original sentence, as it alters our understanding of where the story takes place. Considering these differences, especially the discrepancy in locations, the two sentences are not paraphrases. The second sentence presents a different scenario – in this case, where Seelabathi and her mother arrive – which affects the interpretation of the story. In order for these to be considered paraphrases, the second sentence should refer to the same to-and-from locations as specified in the original. For example, a better paraphrase might be: \\"The movie commences when Seelabathi (Kavya Madhavan) and her mother Sumangala (Urmila Unni) arrive in Kerala from Bengal.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Add fluff to blankets.","completion":"Accomplishing the goal of adding fluff to blankets can enhance their warmth, comfort, and overall coziness. To do this effectively, follow the steps given below: 1. Gather materials: Before you begin, gather all necessary materials. Here's what you'll need: - Blankets that need fluff - Fluffy filler material: This can be polyester fiberfill, down, or a soft and cozy fabric like fleece, faux fur or any other material you prefer to add to your blanket. - Sewing machine or needle and thread - Fabric scissors - Measuring tape or ruler - Fabric marker or chalk - Pins 2. Prepare your blankets: Clean your blankets thoroughly before beginning the process. Make sure they are completely dry and ironed if needed. Fluffing a clean blanket ensures that the fluff stays fresher for longer. 3. Assess blanket condition: Inspect your blanket for any holes or weak spots where the fluff might escape. Mend any of these areas before proceeding. 4. Select and prepare the filler material: Choose your filler material based on your personal preference for comfort and warmth. Cut the fabric or filler into small pieces or strips. You may also opt to purchase pre-cut, bagged filler at a craft store. 5. Create filler pockets: Decide where you want to add the fluff on the blanket. A grid or a quilt-like pattern can work well for even distribution of fluff. Measure and mark the position of the pockets using a fabric marker or chalk. 6. Cut the fabric for the pockets: Use the measurements you took in the previous step to cut out the fabric pieces of the desired shape and size. Remember to add an extra seam allowance on each side. 7. Pin, sew, and stuff the pockets: Pin the fabric pieces to the blanket in their designated areas. Sew the pieces onto the blanket, leaving one side open to insert filler. Make sure to double stitch the seams to ensure they are strong and durable. After sewing, stuff the pockets with your chosen filler material. 8. Secure pockets: Once all pockets are filled with the fluff, securely close the openings by sewing them closed. 9. Finishing touches: Inspect the blanket for any loose threads or seams that might need reinforcement. Trim any excess fabric or threads and make any necessary final adjustments. 10. Launder and enjoy: It is essential to clean the blanket before use, especially if the filler material has created a mess during the process. Follow the care label instructions on your blanket for safe cleaning. Once the laundering is complete, you can now enjoy the added fluffiness and comfort of your newly enhanced blanket. By following these detailed steps, you can successfully add fluff to your blankets and significantly improve their coziness. Happy crafting!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost. The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. A Canadian show, This Hour Has Seven Days, aired from 1964 to 1966 on CBC. Although partially inspired by That Was The Week That Was, the Canadian show mixed satirical aspects with more serious journalism. It proved controversial and was cancelled after two series amid allegations of political interference. This Hour Has 22 Minutes, created by Newfoundland comic Mary Walsh, has been running since 1992 although the two are not related. An Australian show, The Mavis Bramston Show, aired from 1964 to 1968 on the Seven Network. It grew out of the recent local theatrical tradition of topical satirical revue--most notably the popular revues staged at Sydney's Phillip Street Theatre in the 1950s and 1960s--but it was also strongly influenced by the British satire boom and especially TW3 and Not Only... But Also. The New Zealand show A Week Of It ran from 1977 to 1979, hosted by Ken Ellis, and featuring comedians David McPhail, Peter Rowley and Chris McVeigh and comedian/musicians Jon Gadsby and Annie Whittle. The series lampooned news and politics and featured songs, usually by McPhail and Gadsby, who continued with their own show, McPhail and Gadsby in similar vein. A Dutch version, Zo is het toevallig ook nog 's een keer, aired from November 1963 to 1966. It became controversial after the fourth edition, which included a parody of the Lord's Prayer (\\"Give us this day our daily television\\"). Angry viewers directed their protests especially against the most popular cast member: Mies Bouwman. After receiving several threats to her life she decided to quit the show. The show was praised as well: in 1966 it received the Gouden Televizier-ring, a prestigious audience award--though it turned out afterward that the election was rigged. An Indian version titled The Week That Wasn't was launched and hosted by Cyrus Broacha. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did anyone else appear on the New Zealand version of the show other than the host ?","completion":"Yes, the New Zealand show A Week Of It had other people appearing besides the host.

Grab a soft washcloth or a soft sponge and put a few drops of mild dish soap on it. Soak the cloth or sponge with hot water and wipe the bowl down thoroughly inside and outside.","completion":"Make sure to pay extra attention to any cracks or grain patterns where food particles may be hiding, as these areas can harbor bacteria; a gentle scrubbing motion in a circular direction will help dislodge any stubborn residue. Once the bowl has been thoroughly cleaned, rinse it well under warm running water, ensuring that all traces of soap are removed to avoid taste contamination. To maintain the beauty and longevity of your wooden bowl, consider using only a small amount of soap to prevent over-drying or damaging the wood's natural oils. After rinsing, gently shake off excess water and carefully blot the bowl dry with a clean soft towel or microfiber cloth, avoiding direct contact with sunlight during the drying process. To enhance the wood's luster and preserve its finish, it's essential to apply a quality food-safe wood conditioner or mineral oil occasionally. Allow the bowl to air dry completely before storing it away in a cool, dry area to prevent warping, splitting, or any musty odors. In addition to proper cleaning and maintenance, it's essential to avoid soaking wooden bowls in water for an extended period or using them to serve acidic, oily, or overly hot foods, as these factors can lead to discoloration and a general decline in the bowl's quality.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Look for specific factors that had the largest negative impact on your customers' experiences and identify ways to remedy those first. Also look for small changes that could make a big difference. For example, if customers indicate that they feel your staff is cold and distant, you could implement training to ensure your staff treats customers in a warm and friendly way, greeting them with a smile and encouraging them to ask for assistance. Customer-facing employees need the right tools so they can ensure that all of your customers are delighted with their shopping experience, even if something goes wrong. Encourage employees to offer discounts or other services that keep customers coming back. For example, suppose you own a restaurant. If an employee spills wine on a customer's shirt, you could offer to pick up the dry-cleaning, or give the customer a gift card to a neighboring shop to purchase a replacement shirt. You may also want to create a budget that allows employees to acknowledge and give discounts or free gifts to repeat customers. You can rely on the observations of customer-facing employees or create a loyalty card. A simple punch card can be an effective way to measure customer loyalty and provide an incentive for customers to return. Your employees who deal with customers the most also have the greatest responsibility when it comes to customer satisfaction. It's not how they handle smooth transactions that matters – it's how they handle negative issues and problems customers have. The worst thing customer-facing employees can do is dismiss a customer's problem. Teach them to treat all customer problems seriously, no matter how minor they may seem. Have your employees listen respectfully to the customer, empathize with them, then find a solution. Word of mouth has become crucial, and nowhere is this phenomenon stronger than on social media. Look for regular customers who are active on social media and have a reasonably strong following. Give them discounts and rewards for promoting your products or services on social media. If you have new products coming out, you might also give your influencers the opportunity to try those products before anyone else and write reviews online. You could either send samples or have a private shopping event open only to influencers. A bad review or negative tweet can harm your business significantly – particularly if the person complaining has a large following on social media. However, the way you respond to that comment can earn you new customers. Be alert to mentions of your company on social media and review them regularly. Do what you can to resolve the problem for the customer immediately. Respond to positive comments as well. A simple \\"thank you\\" lets others know that you are a responsive company that cares what your customers think. There are numerous apps and social media services that will monitor mentions of your company for you. Some are free, while others require a subscription. You might also consider hiring a social media manager to handle your company's social media. Risk-averse customers may be reluctant to try a new product or service, particularly if it involves stepping outside their comfort zone or paying more than they're accustomed to. Warranties and guarantees make the purchase less of a risk and enable them to feel more confident about buying from you. You can also go beyond the manufacturer's warranty. For example, if the manufacturer offers a year warranty, you might extend it to 3 years. Or if the manufacturer's warranty only covers the replacement of parts, you might throw in free labor. With electronics, people often worry that as soon as they buy something, a new version will hit the market. You could alleviate this concern by offering to upgrade customers' products for free if a new model comes out within 6 months of their purchase.","completion":"Improve customers' experiences by fixing negative factors first, making small changes that have a big impact, listening respectfully to customer problems, responding to their social media mentions, providing incentives and warranties for loyal and risk-averse customers, and ensuring employees are trained to be friendly and helpful."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You should sum up the values at every position of every inner list and put it as an element of your answer, that is, you should sum the first members of each inner list together and put it as the first element of the list, then sum the second members of each inner list together and put it as the second element of your list, etc. The output should be a list of numbers with the same length as the longest inner list. Input: [[-2, 84, 56, -52, -32], [-71, 81], [59, -17, 92]] Output:","completion":"To solve this task, follow these steps: 1. Identify the longest list length among the given inner lists. 2. Create an empty list called 'result' to store the final sum of values. 3. Loop through each position (i) from 0 to the longest list length - 1. 4. For each position (i), sum up the values at that position for all inner lists if the position exists in the inner list. 5. Append the sum to the 'result' list. 6. Return the 'result' list. Now, let's solve the task using the given input: Input: [[-2, 84, 56, -52, -32], [-71, 81], [59, -17, 92]] Step 1: The lengths of the inner lists are 5, 2, and 3. The longest list length is 5. Step 2: Create an empty list called 'result'. Step 3-5: Loop through each position (i) from 0 to 4, and sum up the values using the following method: i = 0: -2 + (-71) + 59 = -14 i = 1: 84 + 81 + (-17) = 148 i = 2: 56 + 0 + 92 = 148 (Since there is no value at position 'i' = 2 in the second list, we consider it as 0) i = 3: (-52) + 0 + 0 = -52 (Considering values as 0 for the missing positions in the second and third lists) i = 4: (-32) + 0 + 0 = -32 (Considering values as 0 for the missing positions in the second and third lists) Append these values to the 'result' list: result = [-14, 148, 148, -52, -32] Step 6: Return the 'result' list. Output: [-14, 148, 148, -52, -32]"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Wash your clothes and tools immediately after contact with poison ivy. Wash your skin immediately if it comes into contact with poison ivy. Calm the rash","completion":"Title: Getting Rid of Poison Ivy Plants Safely Hi kids! Today, we will learn about a plant called poison ivy and how to safely get rid of it. Poison ivy is a tricky plant that can sometimes cause an itchy, red rash on your skin if you touch it. But don't worry! We will show you how to avoid it and how to deal with it in case you have an encounter with this plant. 1. Putting Poison Ivy Plants in Garbage Bags If you find poison ivy plants in your garden, you need to remove them. Ask a grown-up to help you with this task. Remember to wear gloves so that your hands don't touch the plant. Carefully pick up the poison ivy plant and place it in a garbage bag. Seal the bag, and make sure to throw it away into the garbage can when you're done. 2. Keep Your Face Safe When you're working with poison ivy, it's essential to keep your face safe. The rash can be very uncomfortable if it gets on your face. So, try your best not to touch your face while being near the poison ivy plant. If you accidentally touch your face, the grown-up helping you should grab some soap and water to clean the area right away. 3. Cleaning Your Clothes and Tools Once you've gotten rid of the poison ivy plants, it's important to clean everything that has touched the plant during the process. Make sure you carefully wash your clothes, gloves, and any tools you used to handle the poison ivy. This will help prevent the rash from spreading. 4. Wash Your Skin If You Touch Poison Ivy If your skin accidentally comes into contact with poison ivy, don't panic! Go to the sink immediately and wash your skin with soap and cold water. This will help remove the oil from the plant that can cause the rash. Remember, the faster you wash it off, the better! 5. Calming the Rash If you get a rash from the poison ivy, don't worry – there are ways to help you feel better. First, try to avoid scratching the rash, even though it may be very itchy. Scratching can make the rash worse and can lead to an infection. You can use over-the-counter creams or lotions, like calamine lotion, to help soothe your skin and calm the itchiness. Make sure you ask a grown-up for help on finding the right treatment for your rash. In summary, poison ivy can be a naughty plant that causes an itchy rash when you touch it. But by staying careful, you can safely get rid of it. Remember to wear gloves, avoid touching your face, wash everything that touched the plant, and take care of your skin in case it comes into contact with poison ivy. That way, you can have a happy and rash-free time playing outside!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

In 1830, the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria across the centre of England to visit the Malvern Hills, stopping at towns and great country houses along the way. Similar journeys to other parts of England and Wales were taken in 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835. To the King's annoyance, Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops. William compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heiress presumptive. Victoria disliked the trips; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill, and there was little time for her to rest. She objected on the grounds of the King's disapproval, but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy, and forced Victoria to continue the tours. At Ramsgate in October 1835, Victoria contracted a severe fever, which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence. While Victoria was ill, Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary. As a teenager, Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff. Once queen, she banned him from her presence, but he remained in her mother's household.

Movie plot title: Porky's Movie plot: A group of Florida high school students plan on losing their virginity. They go to Porky's, a nightclub out in the Everglades, believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. Porky takes their money but humiliates the kids by dumping them in the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky's brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey's older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky's car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky's in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree. The film ends with the group getting their revenge and Pee Wee finally losing his virginity. In a subplot, the boys also peep on female students in their locker room shower. After (apparently) several unsuccessful attempts, Tommy, Billy and Pee Wee finally see several girls showering, but Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a particularly fat girl (who has been blocking his view) to move so he can see. While a few girls run out, most stay, finding the situation funny. To test their attitude, Tommy sticks his tongue out through his peephole, but gets it smeared with soap. Infuriated, he drops his pants and sticks his penis through the opening just before female coach Beulah Balbricker (who has a running feud with Tommy) walks...

Removing the bone is a common process in the preparation of fish for consumption, to provide a more enjoyable and safer eating experience for the customer. The other options are not applicable in this case, as they involve creatures or objects that are either not typically prepared by a fishmonger or are ethically questionable or gruesome. An octopus does not have bones to be removed, while skeleton, human body, and dog's mouth are certainly not suitable food items that a monger would be serving.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - friend's house - bicycle - space shuttle - kitchen - disneyland Answer:","completion":"The most suitable option for the given question is the space shuttle. Food on a space shuttle is normally freeze-dried or dehydrated to ensure that it remains safe, lightweight, and easy to transport during space missions. In the unique environment of space, proper preservation of food is crucial due to the challenges faced by astronauts in terms of food storage, preparation, and consumption. Freeze-drying and dehydration are two common preservation methods used for space food as they offer several advantages for space travel: 1. Weight and volume reduction: Space is limited on a shuttle, and every kilogram of mass requires additional fuel to launch. Freeze-drying and dehydration processes significantly reduce the weight and volume of food items—it can reduce the volume by around 50% and decrease the weight by approximately 80-90%. 2. Preservation: Both processes help in preserving food for an extended period. Freeze-drying typically involves freezing the food and then removing most of its water content through sublimation, while dehydration eliminates the water content by heating the food at a low temperature for a longer period. In both cases, the removal of water prevents the growth of microorganisms that cause spoilage—allowing food to last for months or even years without refrigeration. 3. Nutrition: Dehydration and freeze-drying are among the best methods to preserve the nutritional content of food. While slight losses of certain nutrients (such as vitamin C) may occur during these processes, they still maintain a high nutritional value for astronauts, providing essential vitamins, minerals, proteins, and calories required for their health and for performing various tasks in space. 4. Easy preparation: Space food must be easy to prepare in the microgravity environment. Dehydrated or freeze-dried foods can be rehydrated by adding hot water, which restores their original shape, texture, and flavor, making them more palatable for astronauts. 5. Waste minimization: In space, the disposal of waste is difficult and costly in terms of resources used. Dehydrated and freeze-dried foods create minimal waste, as the packaging materials can be efficiently compacted once they are emptied. In conclusion, due to the specific demands and constraints faced during space travel, food on space shuttles is typically freeze-dried or dehydrated to maintain its nutritional value while minimizing weight, volume, and waste production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The source of the character is the 1565 tale \\"Un Capitano Moro\\" by Cinthio; Cassio is unnamed in Cinthio but referred to as \\"the squadron leader\\". In the play, Cassio is a young and handsome lieutenant under Othello's command who becomes one of Iago's several victims in a plot to ruin Othello. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Othello has more authority than Cassio.","completion":"Yes, the next sentence follows, given the preceding text. According to the information provided, Cassio is a lieutenant under Othello's command in William Shakespeare's play \\"Othello.\\" This establishes a clear hierarchy within the play's narrative, with Othello being the superior officer and Cassio as one of his subordinates. This power dynamic creates a context for understanding the motivations and actions of the other characters, particularly Iago, who seeks to bring about Othello's downfall. With Othello having more authority than Cassio, it also makes sense for Iago to perceive Cassio as a potential pawn in his plan to ruin Othello. Additionally, this hierarchy between Othello and Cassio also gives more depth to the relationships between all the characters involved. As lieutenant, Cassio is expected to follow Othello's orders and remain loyal to him. It is this loyalty that makes Cassio's eventual betrayal, orchestrated by Iago, all the more devastating for Othello. Furthermore, the fact that Cassio is under Othello's command means that he is not only subject to Othello's leadership, but also to his decisions about promotions and military operations. This element of the relationship between Othello and Cassio becomes a significant plot point in the play, as Iago manipulates Othello into believing that Cassio is having an affair with his wife, Desdemona, ultimately leading to tragic consequences for all involved. The hierarchical relationship between Othello and Cassio, and the fact that Othello has more authority than Cassio, is an essential aspect of the play \\"Othello\\" and lays the groundwork for many of the ensuing conflicts, betrayals, and tragic consequences that unfold throughout the play."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Very nice Live it\\" Answer:","completion":"★★★★"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Phagocytosis is the process by which large particles, such as cells, are taken in by a cell. For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil removes the invader through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the neutrophil (Figure 3.26). A variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis. This literally means “cell drinking” and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this process takes in solutes that the cell needs from the extracellular fluid (Figure 3.26). A targeted variation of endocytosis employs binding proteins in the plasma membrane that are specific for certain substances (Figure 3.26). The particles bind to the proteins and the plasma membrane invaginates, bringing the substance and the proteins into the cell. If passage across the membrane of the target of receptor-mediated endocytosis is ineffective, it will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. Some human diseases are caused by a failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as “bad” cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptormediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear the chemical from their blood.

Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, The UK government built a massive 60-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of Britain. The quarantine was deemed a success; however, the extreme method employed by the government destroyed diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. This led to massive unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil, causing the UK to collapse into a dystopia. In 2035, 27 years after the quarantine, during a raid, police discover several people infected with Reaper Virus.

Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses Major Eden Sinclair to lead the team. Sinclair's team crosses the wall and goes to Glasgow, Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals.

UPDATED:. 11:04 EST, 9 October 2012. The local news anchor who spoke out after a viewer criticised her for being overweight has now leapt to the defence of her attacker. Jennifer Livingston sprang to national fame after she denounced Kenneth Krause for saying that her weight meant she was not a 'suitable example' for her younger viewers. He apologised for the attack last week after Ms Livingston received a flood of supporting her brave stand against the bullying behaviour. But she now seems to have accepted his apology - and even said, 'I hope people leave him alone.' Scroll down for video. Weighty issue: Reporter Jennifer. Livingston responded to a viewer email that chided her over her weight. The anchor for WKBT in Wisconsin told TMZ she had 'no hard feelings' towards Mr Krause despite his unprovoked attack on her. 'I hope people kinda leave him behind and leave him alone,' she continued. Ms Livingston said she was pleased to have started a national debate about bullying, adding: 'I just think it's a discussion that needs to happen across the country.' Mr Krause on Friday told ABC News of his regret at criticising the anchor's weight, saying: 'I'm in no position to bully her.' He continued: 'She's a big media personality - I'm just a working stiff. If Jennifer's offended then I truly apologise to Jennifer, that's the last thing I wanted to do.' No offence: Kenneth Krause apologised for the attack which provoked a nationwide response. In his initial email to Ms Livingston, first published by her husband and fellow anchor Mike Thompson, the security guard wrote: 'Surely you don't consider yourself a suitable example for this community's young people, girls in particular.' An ABC reporter asked Mr Krause: 'She says she has a thyroid problem - did you consider any of that before writing the email?' 'Of course, I was obese as a child - I've been fighting with that all my life,' he said. 'Boy I can sure empathise with that.' Speaking about Mr Krause and his letter on the Today show,. Ms Livingston said she was more insulted by being called a. bad role model to young girls than by being called fat. 'The person called me obese and I can deal with that and being called fat,. but it was calling me a bad role model that really rubbed me the wrong way,' she said. Weight control: Mr Krause claims he was obese as a child and has had a life-time fight with his weight. 'Not. only for our community but in particular for young girls, I am a mother. of three young girls and I felt that was an unfair judgement of someone. who didn't know me. 'I have a pretty thick skin, I'm a tough gal and can handle this type of thing, but what I was. thinking instead was that I'm having conversations with my 10-year-old daughter right now about bullying. 'I'm trying to inspire her and teach her that if she sees bullying - the importance of taking a stand. 'But. what kind of message am I teaching her if my husband and I are talking. about this mean email I've received and I'm not taking a stand for. myself?' The letter that Mr Krause wrote to Ms Livingston states that he was 'surprised indeed to witness that your physical condition hasn't improved for many years. 'Surely you. don't consider yourself a suitable example for this community's young. people, girls in particular.' Aftermath: Jennifer Livingston spoke to the. Today show about the comments saying she is trying to inspire her. daughter to take a stand against bullying. Husband's support: Anchor Mike Thompson, pictured left and with his wife Ms Livingston on the right, said he found the email infuriating when he first published it on his own Facebook page. After the issue became national news, Mr Krause was asked to explain why he made his comments. Though he refused to go on air, he released a statement saying: 'Given this country's present epidemic. of obesity and the many truly horrible diseases related thereto, and. considering Jennifer Livingston's fortuitous position in the community, I. hope she'll finally take advantage of a rare and golden opportunity to. influence the health and psychological well-being of Coulee region. children by transforming herself for all of her viewers to see over the. next year. 'And to that end I would be absolutely pleased to offer her any. advice or support she would be willing to accept.' His harsh words drew much criticism and caused a major debate across the U.S. Ms Livingston said on the Today show that though Mr Krause made a valid point about the dangers of obesity, she blasted his approach for being 'totally inappropriate'. 'I have never gone in public saying I am the shining example of what your health should be', she said. 'I've never said girls should aspire to have a body like mine, I've never told anyone to eat the way I do or exercise as much as I do. 'If someone wants to talk to me about the story I've covered then I am all about that. My job is to go out and report the news. But when you attack someone on a personal level it's not fair at all, I don't care if I'm in the public eye or not.' Admission: The anchor said, 'The truth is, I am overweight. You can call me fat' Hi Jennifer,. It's unusual that I see your morning show, but I did so for a very short. time today. I was surprised indeed to witness that your physical condition hasn't improved for many years. Surely you. don't consider yourself a suitable example for this community's young. people, girls in particular. Obesity is one of the worst choices a. person can make and one of the most dangerous habits to maintain. I. leave you this note hoping that you'll reconsider your responsibility as. a local public personality to present and promote a healthy lifestyle. In a special four-minute broadcast that aired before the news Ms Livingston spoke directly to her critic. She said she tried to laugh off the comment as she was so used to criticism from being in the public eye, but was encouraged by hundreds of supporters to speak out. She acknowledged: 'The truth is, I am overweight. You can call me fat - and yes, even obese on a doctor's chart. 'But to the person who wrote me that. letter, do you think I don't know that? That your cruel words are. pointing out something that I don't see? 'You don't know me. You are not a. friend of mine. You are not a part of my family, and you have admitted. you don't watch this show. 'You know nothing about me but what you see on. the outside, and I am much more than a number on a scale.' And perhaps to address the writer's comment that she was not a good role model for young people, she used the opportunity to focus on bullying, pointing out that October is anti-bullying month. Ms Livingston said: 'That man’s words mean. nothing to me, but really angers me about this is is there are children. who don’t know better - who get emails as critical as the one I. received, or in many cases even worse, each and every day. 'The internet has become a weapon and is passed down from people like that man to those who don't know any better. 'If. you are at home and you are talking about the fat news lady, guess. what? Your children are probably going to go to school and call someone. fat.' Standing up: Ms Livingston refused to give in to those who criticised her over her appearance. Viral: After Mr Thompson revealed the letter, messages of support for the couple started to flood in. She then thanked the hundreds of messages of support and courage she received from those in the community and further, saying it was 'overwhelming' and 'inspiring'. She finished the broadcast with a strong and powerful message: 'To all of the children out there who feel lost, who are struggling with your weight, with the color of your skin, your sexual preference, your disability, even the acne on your face, listen to me right now. 'Do not let your self-worth be defined by bullies. Learn from my experience - that the cruel words of one are nothing compared to the shouts of many.'

Families saving less for college, investing poorly Families who aren't saving still expect that, come tuition time, their savings and income will cover 29 percent of the bill, according to the study. (Savers expect to cover 41 percent.) That may prove a tough goal for procrastinators to hit. \\"[Even] if you start saving as soon as the child is born, you only have 17 or 18 years,\\" said Joe Clemens, a certified financial planner and founding partner of Wisdom Wealth Strategies in Denver.

A late start is the biggest financial regret for moms of teenagers, with nearly 44 percent of the 604 moms in a recent NerdWallet.com survey saying they wished they had known to start saving for college immediately. That sentiment is shared by college graduates. A new AICPA survey found that two-thirds of the 1,010 adults had some regret about the way that they paid for their college education, in large part because they ended up depending so much on student loans.

The average annual cost to attend a four-year private college was 42,419 during the 2014-15 academic year, and a public four-year college, 18,943, according to The College Board's latest report.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A breach of contract occurs when one party fails to uphold his side of the contract without an adequate legal excuse. A breach of contract can be indicated by a failure to perform or by words or actions that indicate future nonperformance. If you are involved in a contract that involves materials (such as the sale of an item), you should be entitled to a full recovery of materials if the other party does not fulfill his end of the contract. For example, if you sell a boat to your neighbor and give him an owner-financed payment plan but he stops making payments, you are entitled to a full recovery of the boat, regardless of the amount your neighbor has paid towards the full amount. If you are the non-breach party in a contract, you can seek to mitigate (lessen) the damages caused by the other party’s breach of contract by seeking replacement goods or services (known as “cover.”) If the cover costs you the same or less money than your original contract, you may not be entitled to damages. However, if your cover costs you more, you can ask the contract-breaching party to pay the damages (the difference between the original cost and the cover.) Finding cover as soon as possible to the breach of contract can help you show the court that you’ve done your best to avoid consequential damages, or further expenses due to your own failure to act. For example, you may have a contract with a wedding photographer. If your photographer backs out of the contract the week before your wedding, you may need to scramble and find a new photographer at the last minute. If the last-minute photographer costs the same as your original photographer, there are no damages. If the last-minute photographer charges you an additional 500 for the lack of notice, you can ask that the original photographer pay the 500 fee. If you cannot uphold your end of a contract, you can refuse to fulfill the obligations that are laid out in the contract. Refusing to perform your contractual obligations will constitute a breach of contract and may expose you to a breach of contract lawsuit. Before choosing this option, you should consult with an attorney to ensure that you completely understand all consequences of deciding to breach a contract. If the other party has breached a contract, you can file a lawsuit for damages incurred due to the breach. Be sure that you have a copy of the contract, can specifically identify how and when the breach occurred, and document any financial or other damages that you accumulated as a result of the breach. You can hire a lawyer to file the lawsuit for you, or you can do it yourself at your local courthouse. File the lawsuit as soon as possible after the breach. States have varying statutes of limitations for how long after a breach a lawsuit can be filed, but waiting too long can prevent you from being able to take legal action against the breaching party. After a contract has been breached, the parties involved may want to consider using Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as a tool to settle a contract dispute. With ADR, anyone involved in the contract often share the cost of hiring a neutral mediator. This person will assist all of you to work out a mutually agreeable outcome. The ADR process includes an evaluation by a neutral third-party who isn’t a lawyer. It also includes a negotiation and mediation. Arbitration is another form of ADR. It allows you to take care of the problem without going to court. Arbitration is a good idea in complex cases or when damages are difficult to calculate. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the concept of breach of contract, the various ways it can occur, and the possible legal remedies and consequences involved.

Obtain a balloon pump or an air compressor. This step ensures that the process is made significantly easier than blowing the balloons using mouth. Blowing balloons up with mouth can be a tiring and time-consuming process, especially when a lot of balloons need to be inflated. Hence a balloon pump or air compressor is a better option. 2. Purchase high-quality balloons. This step ensures that the balloons don't burst easily during or after inflation. High-quality balloons also last longer which is preferable when preparing for a party in advance. 3. Utilize a buddy system if possible. Dividing the load can make the process even easier and faster. Party preparation is quite intensive, sharing tasks can help reduce individual workload. 4. Consider self-sealing balloons. These types of balloons come with a built-in sealing mechanism which saves the time and effort to tie each balloon individually after inflation. 5. Implement balloon inflation safety. This prevents any accidental popping leading to noise disruption, a fright and safety hazards from popped balloon fragments. The above step-by-step process is justified as it incorporates tools to facilitate the inflation process, ensuring quality to prevent mishaps, team work to distribute load, advanced technology to ease the process and ensuring safety while carrying out the task.

They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Next time you have trouble ordering just one red wine at the bar, blame your glass. A new study published in the journal BMC Public Health finds that people drink substantially more wine when it’s served in a big glass. Researchers from the University of Cambridge in England studied the wine sales at a local pub, The Pint Shop, for about five months last year. Every two weeks, the bar owners switched out the glasses between the restaurant’s standard size (300 ml), larger glasses (370 ml) and smaller ones (250 ml). Offering exactly the same amount of wine, but in a bigger glass, seemed to have a large effect on sales. When standard vessels were swapped for larger ones, vino sales went up 14.4% in the bar area and 8.2% in the restaurant portion of The Pint Shop. Sign up for and more view example This isn’t the first study to show that containers play tricks on our brain. A 2015 Cochrane review found that larger tableware increases how much people consume. But it is the first to look at alcohol—and the researchers have some interesting guesses into why a large glass leads to more rounds. One possibility: people may think they got stiffed on a pour. “There’s some evidence to suggest that people consume more rapidly when they perceive that there’s less,” says Professor Theresa Marteau, director of the Behaviour and Health Research Unit at the University of Cambridge and the study’s senior author. The illusion of a small pour could lead people to drink faster. Another theory is that people consume food and drink in units of one. “They think, ‘Oh, I’ll just one glass of wine, one slice of cake, one cup of coffee,'” Marteau says. When a wine portion looks meager, it may register as not a “full glass”—the perfect justification for another round. Or maybe people just really love big glasses. “People say the nose or the bouquet of the wine is greater in a large glass,” Marteau says. To find out for sure, the team is following up with more wine drinking experiments, in which they’re videotaping people drinking wine out of various glasses to compare drinking speed and satisfaction. Like so many other questions, the answer to this one lies at the bottom of a wine glass. ||||| Selling wine in larger wine glasses may encourage people to drink more, even when the amount of wine remains the same, suggests new research from the University of Cambridge. In a study published today in the journal BMC Public Health, researchers found that increasing the size of wine glasses led to an almost 10% increase in wine sales. Alcohol consumption is one of the leading risk factors for disease and has been linked to conditions such as type 2 diabetes, cancer and liver disease. The factors that influence consumption are not clear; a recent Cochrane review published by the Behaviour and Health Research Unit (BHRU) at the University of Cambridge found that larger portion sizes and tableware increased consumption of food and non-alcoholic drinks, but found no evidence relating to consumption of alcohol. To examine whether the size of glass in which alcohol is served affects consumption, the team at the BHRU, together with Professor Marcus Munafo from the University of Bristol, carried out a study in The Pint Shop in Cambridge from mid-March to early July 2015. The establishment has separate bar and restaurant areas, both selling food and drink. Wine (in 125ml or 175ml servings) could be purchased by the glass, which was usually a standard 300ml size. Over the course of a 16-week period, the owners of the establishment changed the size of the wine glasses at fortnightly intervals, alternating between the standard (300ml) size, and larger (370ml) and smaller (250 ml) glasses. The researchers found that the volume of wine purchased daily was 9.4% higher when sold in larger glasses compared to standard-sized glasses. This effect was mainly driven by sales in the bar area, which saw an increase in sales of 14.4%, compared to an 8.2% increase in sales in the restaurant. The findings were inconclusive as to whether sales were different with smaller compared to standard-sized glasses. \\"We found that increasing the size of wine glasses, even without increasing the amount of wine, leads people to drink more,\\" says Dr Rachel Pechey from the BHRU at Cambridge. \\"It's not obvious why this should be the case, but one reason may be that larger glasses change our perceptions of the amount of wine, leading us to drink faster and order more. But it's interesting that we didn't see the opposite effect when we switched to smaller wine glasses.\\" Professor Theresa Marteau, Director of the Unit, adds: \\"This suggests that avoiding the use of larger wine glasses could reduce the amount that people drink. We need more research to confirm this effect, but if it is the case, then we will need to think how this might be implemented. For example, could it be an alcohol licensing requirements that all wine glasses have to be below a certain size?\\" # The research was funded by the Department of Health. Reference: Pechey, R et al. Does wine glass size influence sales for on-site consumption? A multiple treatment reversal design. BMC Public Health; 7 June 2016; DOI: 10.1186/s12889-016-3068-z ||||| The findings have prompted suggestions that maximum glass sizes could in the future become a condition of alcohol licences. A recent review published by the unit found that larger tableware increased consumption of food and non-alcoholic drinks, but did not make any findings relating to the consumption of alcohol. Dr Rachel Pechey, lead author of the new study, which was funded by the Department of Health, said: “We round that increasing the size of wine glasses, even without increasing the amount of wine, leads people to drink more.” “It’s not obvious why this should be the case, but one reason may be that larger glasses change our perceptions of the amount of wine, leading us to drink faster and order more. “But it’s interesting that we didn’t see the opposite effect when we switched to smaller wine glasses.” Alcohol consumption is currently ranked fifth among the 20 leading risk factors for the global burden of disease. In particular it is associated with conditions such as type 2 diabetes, cancer and liver disease. Price and marketing are already well-known factors affecting the volume of alcohol consumed. Wine in the UK can be purchased by the glass, usually with a set portion of 125ml or 250ml, or by the bottle, with a standard volume of 750ml. It is already suspected that consumption patterns may alter depending on whether wine is bought and consumed by the bottle or by the glass. Professor Theresa Marteau, director of the Behaviour and Health Research Unit at Cambridge, said: “This [research] suggests that avoiding the use of larger wine glasses could reduce the amount that people drink. “We need more research to confirm this effect, but if this is the case then we will need to think how this might be implemented. “For example, could it be an alcohol licensing requirement that all wine glasses have to be below a certain size?” In January Government experts turned on its head conventional wisdom on the health benefits of wine by saying it is bad for people’s health. Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer, urged women to ask themselves “Do I want the glass of wine or do I want to raise my own risk of breast cancer,” every time they reach for a glass. |||||Summary:","completion":"A study from the University of Cambridge has found that people tend to drink more wine when it is served in larger glasses, even if the amount of wine remains the same.

See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: Discrimination-based advocacy is incorporated in advocate orientation and training sessions. Sentence 2: This is a subject that has had increasing relevance as time has gone on. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Pick your answer from: --yes; --it is not possible to tell; --no;","completion":"If the first sentence is true, stating that discrimination-based advocacy is incorporated in advocate orientation and training sessions, then it implies that there is a focus on addressing discrimination within this context. The second sentence comments on the subject having increasing relevance as time has gone on. The connection between the two sentences is the presence of discrimination-based advocacy as a subject or topic. Based on the first sentence, we can assume that at least some individuals or organizations believe that understanding and addressing discrimination in advocacy is important enough to be included in training. However, the second sentence discusses the subject's increasing relevance over time. The truth of the first sentence does not necessarily guarantee that the second sentence is also true. The first statement tells us about the current situation (i.e., discrimination-based advocacy being incorporated in advocate training), while the second statement makes a claim about the trend over time. Therefore, considering the given information, the appropriate answer would be: -- it is not possible to tell; This is because, although we know that discrimination-based advocacy is part of advocate orientation and training sessions, we do not have enough information to determine if this subject has had increasing relevance as time has gone on. To accurately answer that question, we would need historical data or insights into how the importance of discrimination-based advocacy has evolved over time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Martin Scorsese's Shine a Light, featuring the Rolling Stones onstage with their talented friends, rattled my old bones to nirvana and beyond as I searched for superlatives adequate to describe the rapturous vibes let loose by the performers. 2. [Scorsese] comes at the Stones from every imaginable angle. He voodoos the footage into a fluid whole. 3. A celebration of the Stones and star Mick Jagger, Scorsese's Shine a Light is an exuberant concert film that captures vividly the charisma and energy of the vet band but shouldn't be considered a docu as there's little footage or interviews--by design. 4. At the end of a very long night, Light is simply another in a long line of Rolling Stones concert films. 5.

It shows the energy and charisma of the band, and fans of the Rolling Stones really enjoy it. However, some people wish the movie had been made when the director and the band were younger. The movie also reminds us that even though the Rolling Stones are getting older, they still have a special talent for performing music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Donald Trump Bets Increase Just Like Brexit: Bookmakers Donald Trump’s odds to win the U.S. presidential election may not match that of bookmaker’s favorite Hillary Clinton, but a late surge of bets have been placed on the Republican candidate ahead of the final presidential debate on Wednesday. British-based bookmakers William Hill have launched their list of bets for the final debate, with Clinton placed at 1-3 to win the final televised showdown and Trump at 9-4. Overall, Clinton remains the hot favorite to win the presidency, whereas Trump now has a 20% chance of winning compared with 15% before the weekend. However, the Trump campaign doesn’t seem to have dissuaded bettors looking for a last-minute gamble, as William Hill’s latest figures show that 65% of bets on the market have been placed on Trump with the remaining 35% placed on Clinton. As to why punters might be backing Trump at this stage, Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe said, “It may be because the race has reached a level now where people thought it might be worth taking a chance, or just as with the E.U. referendum, people just don’t believe the opinion polls.” Bookmakers have responded by cutting the odds on Trump to win in a betting pattern reminiscent of the run-up to the E.U. referendum in Britain earlier this year. “It was the case that consistently throughout the E.U. referendum campaign, some two-thirds of the money gambled was for Remain, but in terms of individual bets, it was around two-thirds for Leave,” said Sharpe. “In straight bookmaking terms we have to be big Trump supporters as he currently represents a six-figure loss in our overall market.” In terms of stakes, Hall’s figures said 71% of the total money bet on the U.S. election has been placed on a Clinton win, including a record-breaking bet of over 610,000 placed on the Democratic candidate earlier this month. Summary:","completion":"British bookmakers William Hill have launched their list of bets for the final US presidential debate on 19 October, with Hillary Clinton listed at 1-3 to win and Donald Trump 9-4.

OPT: i. not enough information; ii. 8 days; iii. 12 days; iv. Four days; Q: The filming was kind of a long process, but maybe it didn’t need to be? Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked.

Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\". \\"Single Ladies\\" was choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography. The two music videos premiered on MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé, and the platinum edition of I Am...

I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow.

Options: - believe in god - work in teams - kiss each other - receive gifts - argue The answer is \\"work in teams\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"work in teams\\" because group projects are designed to encourage collaboration, communication, and teamwork among individuals who make up the group. Working in teams fosters a cooperative environment where each team member can bring their unique skills, knowledge, and perspectives to the table, resulting in an effective and efficient approach to tackling the assigned tasks. There are several reasons why people choose to work in teams for group projects: 1. Division of labor: When a group project involves a number of tasks, working in teams allows for the division of labor, making it easier to manage and complete the project. By assigning specific tasks to different team members based on their strengths, skills, and knowledge of the topic, the workload is distributed evenly, preventing any one person from becoming overwhelmed. 2. Increased creativity and problem-solving: When people from diverse backgrounds and experiences come together to work on a project, they can contribute in distinct ways to the problem-solving process. This collaborative environment enables group members to bounce ideas off one another, considering a variety of solutions and approaches, ultimately leading to more creative and effective solutions. 3. Improved communication skills: Communication is a vital component of any successful group project. By working in teams, individuals can practice and develop their ability to effectively communicate their thoughts, ideas, and progress updates. This not only increases efficiency within the team but also helps team members develop essential communication skills for future professional or academic pursuits. 4. Accountability: In a team setting, each member of the group is accountable for their respective roles and tasks. When group members depend on one another for the successful completion of a project, it promotes a sense of responsibility, motivating everyone to contribute their best effort and meet deadlines. 5. Emotional support: Collaborating in a team allows group members to provide emotional support to each other during the challenging aspects of the project. Working together on a common goal creates a sense of camaraderie, which can be essential for maintaining motivation, boosting morale, and overcoming obstacles encountered throughout the project. In conclusion, working in teams on group projects provides a range of benefits, such as promoting collaboration, division of labor, increased creativity, improved communication, accountability, and emotional support. These factors not only contribute to a higher-quality end-result, but also help individuals develop essential teamwork skills that will be invaluable in academic and professional environments."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"Joe Emrick\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Answer:","completion":"Dayendranath Burrenchobay was born on 24th March 1919 and passed away on 29th March 1999. His birthplace was Plaine Magnien, a village located in the Grand Port District of Mauritius. His accomplishments, as suggested by the biography, notably involve him serving as the Governor-General of Mauritius, an office he held between 1978 and 1983. Two noteworthy aspects about his appointment are firstly, he was appointed directly by the Queen, signifying the level of trust and regard that his service commanded at the highest levels of authority, and secondly, he was the first Mauritian to hold such a high-ranking position, making him a historic figure in the annals of the country's political and governance history. His term as Governor-General witnessed service under two different governments. One under the leadership of Seewoosagur Ramgoolam and the other under Sir Anerood Jugnauth. This suggests that Sir Dayendranath was a figure who managed to function effectively across different political landscapes, seamlessly transitioning his operation and governance strategies to resonate and work with different leadership styles and ideologies. His service was also marked by a recognition of his work and dedication as inferred by the multiple honorifics added to his name. The honorifics KBE, CMG, CVO, and GCSK are international awards granted for exceptional service, each from different governing bodies. The KBE is the Knight Commander of the British Empire, granted by the British monarchy, the CMG refers to the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, also granted by the British Monarchy. The CVO refers to the Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, granted by the British Monarchy as well.

The left-back is viewed as a priority signing by boss Jose Mourinho but the Blues have so far been frustrated in their attempts to sign Luis. Target: Filipe Luis impressed for Atletico last season and is keen to make the move to Chelsea. Almost: Luis, not picked in Brazil's World Cup squad, is closing in on a switch to Stamford Bridge. The 28-year-old has a release clause, understood to be in the region of £20million, that Chelsea have been reluctant to trigger. But Stamford Bridge chiefs are back in talks with their Spanish counterparts with a view to concluding the protracted transfer in the coming days. Strengthening at left-back is a major concern for Mourinho going into the new season. Long-term left-back Ashley Cole has left the club for Roma after his contract expired.

He detonates the TNT, and an unprecedented earthquake devastates the area. A few hours later government seismologist Dr. Amy Lane arrives at the quake's epicenter. She realizes that the quake has opened a deep fault running through the center of North America, ending at the San Andreas Fault. Any further instability will cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis, devastating Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities all around the Pacific Ocean, leading to the deaths of millions. Dr. Lane and Boomer chase just behind the expanding crack in the Earth's crust, developing a plan to stop the next quake. They decide to use a satellite orbiting above the continent which can trigger earthquakes. They fire it off when they reach the Grand Canyon, thinking that when the new fault hits the canyon it will be forced to turn south into the Gulf of Mexico. When the fault crosses with the canyon, the plan goes wrong. Instead of heading south it travels north, towards the Yellowstone Caldera. They realize that if the fault crosses with the caldera it would erupt, expelling 2,000,000 tons of ash into the atmosphere, killing millions immediately and causing a Volcanic winter.

The framerate is super choppy, to the point that its not even fun. Also, the controls require that you use all the DS buttons, plus the screen. So you have to adjust things with the stylus, while you move with the D-pad and also press the right-hand buttons! I dont know how the developers could release this game that is barely a beta version. If you are into 3D shooters, check out Goldeneye. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"This review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction and frustration with the game, focusing on its choppy framerate and difficult controls as primary reasons for their discontent. Additionally, they refer to the product as something that would barely qualify as a beta version, which further emphasizes the level of disappointment they have with the game. The issues mentioned in the review, such as the choppy framerate, negatively impact the overall gaming experience, making it less enjoyable for the player. Framerate issues are crucial in video games, as they can produce lag and impact the overall fluidity of gameplay. In this case, the reviewer feels that the game is not even fun, which is a strong indicator that the product has failed to meet their expectations. Furthermore, the control scheme is described as overly complicated and unintuitive. The requirement to use all DS buttons in conjunction with the touchscreen presents a steep learning curve for the player. The ergonomics of having to use various buttons while manipulating the stylus can be problematic, causing frustration and making it difficult for players to fully immerse themselves in the game. In the conclusion of the review, the person suggests an alternative game, Goldeneye, for those interested in 3D shooters. This indicates that they do not recommend the game they are reviewing, but rather, they advocate for a different product that they believe is better suited for the target audience. This final piece of advice further solidifies the unflattering portrayal of the product in the review. In summary, the review presents the product in an unflattering light due to the various shortcomings, including the choppy framerate, difficult controls, and overall subpar gaming experience. The reviewer's recommendation of an alternative game underscores their dissatisfaction and cements the negative evaluation of the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Over a hundred years ago people in London were surprised to see a very unusual boat come sailing up the Thames River.The boat was eighty feet long flat-bottomed,with big wooden eyes on both sides in the front and was colorfully painted at the back. People came to know that it was a sailing boat from Fuzhou in distant China.The boat had sailed round the Cape of Good Hope up the western coast of Africa,and finally to England.It had covered fifteen thousand miles--more than half of the distance round the world. Although it was unexpected,the Chinese were warmly welcomed.The boat carried goods such as silk and tea as well as a number of gifts from the Emperor of China for the Queen of England. People had always mistakenly thought of the Chinese as a people not used to sea.However,from centuries of trading and sailing in dangerous seas,the Chinese had learned how to build good boats and sailed them well.The coming of this sailing boat to London proved once again that the Chinese could sail to distant countries in the world. .The writer wants to prove that a long time ago the Chinese _ . A) carried silk,tea and other goods to England B) could reach many parts of the world by sea C) could sail along the Thames River D) surprised Londoners with an unusual boat The answer is:","completion":"B) could reach many parts of the world by sea. The passage mainly aims to prove that the Chinese, contrary to popular belief at that time, were skilled sailors who could reach many parts of the world by sea.

The fact that this boat had managed to sail around the Cape of Good Hope, along the western coast of Africa, and finally to England, covering a distance of 15,000 miles, attests to the Chinese's impressive seafaring skills and ability to reach distant shores. Although the boat did carry silk, tea, and other goods to England (A), as well as surprise Londoners with its unusual appearance (D), these aspects do not represent the writer's primary intent. The text emphasizes that the Chinese were capable of sailing not just along the Thames River (C), but also to various countries around the world.

Answer the following question: I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused.

(CNN) -- Call it the ultimate in military logistics. As land routes from Pakistan into Afghanistan are cut, sabotaged or otherwise interrupted, the U.S. military has developed alternative railroad routes that make the Orient Express look like a branch line. They are called -- rather prosaically -- the Northern Distribution Network, or NDN. The main route begins at the port of Riga in Latvia, from where freight trains roll across Russia, and continues along the edge of the Caspian Sea. It crosses the deserts of Kazakhstan and into Uzbekistan. About 10 days after beginning their odyssey, the containers cross into Afghanistan, carrying everything from computers and socks to toilet paper and bottled water. As one Uzbek official puts it: \\"","completion":"The Northern Distribution Network is a lifeline for the supplies needed by the international forces in Afghanistan.\\" The development of the NDN arose out of necessity, with traditional supply routes becoming increasingly dangerous and unreliable due to attacks from insurgent groups and strained diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Pakistan. The completion of this extensive railroad network involved cooperation between multiple countries, including Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, each granting logistical and transit assistance to ensure goods can be transported safely to their final destination. These alternative routes have successfully circumvented the supply chain issues faced by U.S. troops in Afghanistan, reducing the military's reliance on the volatile land routes through Pakistan. Furthermore, the NDN's existence has also facilitated stronger regional cooperation and engagement among the participating countries. While the NDN has been a notable accomplishment, it does come at a higher cost financially compared to the land routes. However, military officials argue that this increased expense is worth the guarantee of uninterrupted supplies for the U.S. forces in Afghanistan, contributing to their success in the region. In order to maintain the efficiency of the NDN, communication and collaboration between countries must remain strong. The security of the railroad systems needs ongoing monitoring, with all parties working together to ensure a reliable and constantly functioning supply chain for the forces in Afghanistan. In conclusion, the Northern Distribution Network has proven to be a viable and essential alternative for delivering critical supplies to U.S. troops stationed in Afghanistan. The cooperation and logistical efforts by numerous countries have transformed this transport route into a lifeline, securing the needs of international forces and promoting regional collaboration."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that wherever possible I use organic bodycare products, and that I simply adore the organic brand Botanicals. A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

Sometimes a \\"thrombolytic\\" (clot-busting) drug can be considered to treat a large pulmonary embolism. However, in cases of severe shock, surgery or a catheter removal is usually the fastest and most effective way to remove the PE and thus relieve the obstruction. If a tension pneumothorax is responsible for the onset of obstructive shock, insert a needle in the affected area for decompression. This procedure is called a \\"needle decompression.\\" Following insertion of the needle, treatment of the pneumothorax, and stabilization of shock symptoms, you will get a chest tube for ongoing management to prevent any recurrence of the tension pneumothorax. This procedure also involves using a needle. However, in this case, the needle is used to remove fluid from the pericardial sac. Removal of the fluid (normally blood) from the pericardial sac in turn relieves the pressure on the heart, and removes the obstruction that was the underlying cause of shock. Of course, it is key to determine what caused the cardiac tamponade in order to have complete and lasting resolution of shock. The needle pericardiocentesis can be done repeatedly, if necessary, to alleviate pressure on the heart until the underlying cause is resolved. In other cases, a surgical procedure known as a pericardial window is done to relieve the accumulation of the fluid. If constrictive pericarditis (or a related condition) is responsible for obstructive shock, it is key to determine what is causing compression and tightening of the heart sac (called the \\"pericardium\\"). If this is unable to be resolved and treated promptly, the heart sac (pericardium) may need to be cut open surgically to relieve pressure on the heart, and to resolve the symptoms of obstructive shock. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) can be used to help open the aortic valve. This, in turn, will allow blood to exit the heart and to more effectively supply the body's vital organs. The IABP intervention has been shown to relieve symptoms of obstructive shock when aortic stenosis is diagnosed as the underlying etiology (cause). The aortic valve should be evaluated, and replaced if it meets the criteria. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article would be: Obstructive shock is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment.

The Scot was broken in the first game of the match and also at 5-5 on his way to losing the first set. Murray was 6-2 behind in the second set tie-break before valiantly recovering to win it 11-9 and force a decider. He broke a tiring Robredo three times in the third as he won his first title since winning Wimbledon last year. Murray said: \\"I got lucky, basically, at the end of the second set. I fought hard, tried my best and thankfully managed to turn it round.\\" The victory moves Murray up to 10th in the rankings in the race to reach the ATP World Tour Finals in London during November, with the top eight qualifying. The 27-year-old is now 105 points behind Tomas Berdych, who is currently eighth, and is next scheduled to play at tournaments in Beijing, Shanghai and Paris. Murray had beaten Robredo in the third round at SW19 last year and, in their first meeting since then, again emerged victorious - albeit following a closely-fought contest. The Scot opened the match with two double faults on his way to losing the first game and, despite recovering the break, again gave up his serve at 5-5. A powerful forehand return to Murray's feet was put long by the Scot as Robredo went 6-5 up before holding his nerve to close out the first set. Murray came back from 0-40 at 3-2 to break Robredo in the second set, only to be broken straight back in the next game. The Spaniard saved two set points at 5-4 down before the second set went to a tense tie-break. Murray appeared beaten when facing four match points in a row, only to save them all as well as another at 7-6, as he fought back to win 11-9 courtesy of some powerful forehands. That proved to be the breaking point for Robredo as he succumbed to the sapping heat and a determined opponent, with Murray raced through the third set. Meanwhile, Murray's older brother Jamie and doubles partner John Peers were beaten 3-6 7-6 (7-5) 10-5 in the Malaysian Open doubles final in Kuala Lumpur by Marcin Matkowski and Leander Paes. In the singles final, US Open runner-up Kei Nishikori of Japan beat Frenchman Julien Benneteau 7-6 (7-4) 6-4.

Question 2: How do I make 100,000 in one year? pick from the following. (i) no. (ii) yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer these questions, I will first analyze each question individually considering different perspectives, and then compare and contrast them to determine whether their answers would be the same or not. Question 1: Am I considered very blessed making 160,000 a year? Step 1: Define the term \\"very blessed.\\" \\"Very blessed\\" could be interpreted to mean that someone is fortunate or has a significant advantage over others, possibly financially or in terms of overall wellbeing. Step 2: Compare 160,000 a year to average incomes. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income in 2019 was about 68,700. Comparing the given 160,000 to this figure, one could argue that individuals earning this amount are indeed \\"very blessed\\" due to their income being more than twice the median value. Step 3: Account for other factors. Income is not the sole determinant of whether someone is blessed or not. Factors such as health, relationships, and overall satisfaction should also be considered. It is possible for someone to have a high income but not be very blessed due to other unfortunate circumstances or challenges. Conclusion for Question 1: Based on this analysis, the answer for Question 1 would be (ii) yes, with a caveat. An individual making 160,000 a year can be considered \\"very blessed\\" in terms of financial advantage compared to the average person. However, a comprehensive evaluation of their overall wellbeing is needed in order to conclude whether they are truly \\"very blessed\\" or not. Question 2: How do I make 100,000 in one year? This question is a request for advice on how to achieve a specific financial goal rather than a simple yes or no question. Therefore, a response of either (i) no or (ii) yes would not be appropriate for this question. Conclusion: After analyzing each question, it can be concluded that the answer to these two questions would not be the same. The first question can be answered with (ii) yes, considering the financial aspect, while the second question cannot be answered with either option as it requires a more detailed response with actionable steps to achieve the desired financial goal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If it was n't for the cut and the expressions on their faces , she would n't have been able to tell them apart . She stood back up . Why are the two individuals hard to tell apart ?","completion":"The two individuals are hard to tell apart primarily due to their striking physical resemblance to each other. Several factors contribute to their similarity, making it challenging for the observer to distinguish one from the other. Firstly, they share the same distinctive facial features: both individuals have a spattering of freckles and a puff of pale hair on their heads. Freckles are small, concentrated spots of pigmentation on the skin, and the presence of these spots in both individuals adds to their resemblance. Furthermore, the pale hair color and similar hair volume (a puff of hair) indicate that their hair types are alike, reinforcing the perception that they are nearly indistinguishable from each other. Secondly, it is mentioned that if it were not for the cut (likely referring to a haircut) and the expressions on their faces, the observer would be unable to tell them apart. This implies that these are the only two noticeable differences between them that can aid in differentiating one from the other. Since facial expressions are temporary and can change from moment to moment, they do not offer a reliable way of telling the two individuals apart, at least not consistently. The haircut difference, however, suggests that there is some variation in their hair length or style, allowing for a more dependable distinction between them. Additionally, the observer's difficulty in telling these individuals apart might be heightened due to factors unrelated to their physical appearances. For example, the context of their meeting or the surrounding environment may affect the observer's ability to focus on and examine subtle differences between them. This could include factors such as poor lighting, crowded spaces, or the presence of other distractions, making it harder for the observer to accurately distinguish the two individuals solely based on their appearances. In sum, the two individuals are hard to tell apart due to their strong physical resemblances in facial features, including a spattering of freckles and a puff of pale hair. The only clear differences between them are their haircuts and facial expressions. However, the latter is not a reliable marker for distinction, leaving the observer with limited means to differentiate one from the other consistently.

A: Options: --mutant; --embryonic; --carcinogenic; --transgenic; The answer is:","completion":"Transgenic crops. Transgenic crops, also known as genetically modified organisms (GMOs), are plants whose genetic material has been purposefully altered through biotechnology to include advantageous genes from other organisms. These genes code for specific traits that can provide a variety of benefits for both humans and the plants themselves. The process of creating transgenic crops usually involves isolating the desired gene from a donor organism and then inserting it into the crop plant's DNA using various techniques. Once the foreign gene is successfully incorporated, the modified plant inherits the new trait and can pass it on to its offspring through traditional breeding methods. The primary aim of developing transgenic crops is to enhance their economic value and address challenges in agricultural production, such as reducing the use of harmful pesticides, increasing crop yields, and improving nutritional content. Some of the common traits introduced into transgenic crops include insect resistance, herbicide tolerance, and resistance to viral diseases. Insect-resistant transgenic crops usually contain genes from a soil bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). These genes produce toxins that are lethal to certain insect pests but harmless to humans and most other organisms. By planting Bt crops, farmers can significantly reduce their use of chemical insecticides, thus benefiting consumers and the environment. Herbicide-tolerant transgenic crops, on the other hand, allow farmers to apply specific herbicides that kill weeds without harming the crop plants. This trait dramatically simplifies weed control and provides farmers with a useful tool to enhance agricultural productivity. Another relevant example is Golden Rice, a transgenic variety with elevated levels of beta-carotene, which is a precursor to vitamin A. This crop has been developed to address vitamin A deficiency, a widespread issue in many developing countries that can lead to blindness and weakened immune systems, particularly among children. Although transgenic crops have been met with substantial adoption and success in some regions, their use remains a subject of debate and controversy in some communities. Concerns about potential environmental and health impacts are raised by various groups. However, extensive studies and regulatory frameworks have thus far shown that these crops are safe for consumption and can contribute positively to sustainable and efficient agriculture. In summary, the term for crops that are genetically modified with new genes that code for traits useful to humans is \\"transgenic.\\" These crops have the potential to bring about significant benefits in agricultural production, reduce our reliance on harmful chemicals, and improve human health by enhancing the nutritional content of food crops."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Must read! Review: If you've read, \\"Generation to Generation\\" by Edwin Friedman or are familiar with \\"family systems theory\\" you'll understand of the value of \\"Creating a healthier Church\\". Richardson playfully compares two Churches \\"Valley view\\" and \\"Third Church\\" to juxtapose healthy Churches and dysfunctional Churches. The main ideas in the book: How well do the people in a system handle two types of anxiety (Acute/Chronic), the problems of triangulation, and for the minister to be able to mess with the congregation yet have a sense of individuality or healthy separation from the group. As a Minster of just over 13 years, I recommend the book highly.

In Czech, this proverb can be translated as: \\"Čas je nejlepší lékař.\\" In this Czech translation, \\"Čas\\" means \\"time\\", \\"je\\" is the present tense of the verb \\"to be\\", \\"nejlepší\\" means \\"the best\\" and \\"lékař\\" stands for \\"physician\\" or \\"doctor\\". The proverb highlights the importance of giving ourselves time to process and heal from any emotional or physical pain we experience in life. It encourages us to trust the natural process of healing and recovery, as well as accepting that sometimes we just need a bit of patience to get better.

In this step, the body's immune system recognizes the bacteria and toxins as foreign substances and activates its defense mechanisms to eliminate them. This involves producing white blood cells (such as neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes), which play a crucial role in fighting off the infection. Additionally, the immune system produces specialized proteins called antibodies that can neutralize toxins and target bacteria for destruction. In some cases, the immune response may not be sufficient to clear the infection, and medical intervention may be required, such as antibiotic treatment, to help the body fight the bacterial infection effectively. Once the bacteria and toxins are eliminated, the body can start to repair the damage caused by the infection and return to a healthy state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

John Varvatos: stars, stripes and So-Cal John Varvatos closed New York Fashion Week: Men's with a patriotic zing - stars on the front row (Christian Slater, Tyson Beckford, Mick Rock and Chad Smith of Red Hot Chilli Peppers fame) and stripes on the catwalk. The Detroit born designer, who launched his label in 2000, is well known for his inimitable rock 'n' roll aesthetic, drawing inspiration from music greats from Bob Dylan (AW15) to Kiss (AW14). The latter even put in an impromptu appearance at that show and performed at the aftershow party. However, Varvatos also boasts impeccable tailoring credentials; he was formerly head of menswear design at Calvin Klein (he oversaw the launch) and at Polo Ralph Lauren where he created the brand's Black Label line. For SS16, he honed in on the Southern California music scene of the early Seventies dubbed So-Cal, when the area saw an influx of Brits from Keith Richards and Jimmy Page to Fleetwood Mac. \\"There was something about the early Seventies,\\" observed the designer backstage after the show. \\"People were chic, they were bohemian, they had an elegance to them and whether it was in London of California they wanted to dress up. There weren't into just jeans and leather jackets.\\" Richards and the gang, he said, brought over their British sensibility and mixed it with the Californian feeling. And that's exactly what happened here. The stripe proliferated, realised in a dizzying number of iterations from emblematic dandy to City trader. It even insinuated itself into the fabric of the runway which came covered in grey and white striped material. There were three piece suits and two pieces in silks and linens - both traditionally styled or more subversively with waistcoat and pant combos - single breasted, double breasted with one and three button silhouettes plus military style band jackets and a full-on duster coat. Strong lines were tempered with pops of burnt red, olive and navy and there was also a great abstracted animal print jacquard. Aforementioned leather and denim still got a look in with sumptuous hand-stained lambskin jackets and one in a tailored denim reimagined as an indigo dyed tuxedo. The collection was imbued with a louche and rangy elegance - as Varvatos put it, \\"a sprinkle of magic dust\\" - that rendered it at once contemporary and timeless. Playing it out? 'High' by up-and-coming Californian muso, Andrew Watt. Music to our ears. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a fashion show by a designer named John Varvatos.

The hypothesis presented, \\"People are sitting in the car,\\" introduces a distinct and unrelated scenario, involving individuals who are seated inside a car. Given the information provided in the premise, it is impossible to determine the veracity of the hypothesis. The premise solely focuses on the appearance and location of two people near water, but it does not provide any information about whether these individuals are also sitting in a car or have any association with a car. In essence, the premise does not offer any details that either support or contradict the hypothesis. It is essential to recognize that the impossibility of establishing the truth or falsity of the hypothesis from the premise does not imply that the hypothesis itself is inherently false. The hypothesis could potentially be true in a separate scenario or under different circumstances, but the connection between the two situations given by the premise and the hypothesis is not apparent or substantiated. In conclusion, based on the premise provided, we cannot ascertain whether the given hypothesis is true or false.

Movie title: Stalag 17 Context: Captured Americans coping with life in a German POW camp in World War II are puzzled by the simplicity with which the Germans are able to stave off escape attempts, shooting those who try. Sefton (William Holden) is a POW who has profitably wagered with his fellow American prisoners that these escapes would fail.The POWs fear there may be an informer in their midst, but who is it? As it becomes clearer and clearer to his fellow inmates that Sefton has considerable contact with his German captors, his fellow POWs mistakenly conclude that he is the informer and they turn on him, including physically beating him and helping themselves to some of his belongings.Sefton understands in full that to clear his name, he must determine the identity of the real informer, and he is, eventually, able to work out that Price (Peter Graves), whose English is impeccable, is a German informant masquerading as an American POW. Written messages, Sefton discovers, are being smuggled by Price to the Germans through a hollow chess piece on the chessboard in the barracks, wth phony air raid drills staged to enable the Germans to retrieve these messages undetected.Now realizing that Price has figured prominently in the death of the Americans that have attempted escape, Sefton plots revenge, and, after exposing Price's true identity to his fellow POWs, he maneuvers to force Price to make an unauthorized exit from the barracks. To the guards manning the tower, Price's exit looks like an American escape attempt, and they shoot him, much to the dismay of Stalag Commandant Von Scherbach (Otto Preminger).The diversion created by the shooting incident gives Sefton a chance to escape, and he takes with him a brave lieutenant (Don Taylor) who has recently been captured.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Valentine will have a sequel. Select from: [I] Yes; [II] It's impossible to say; [III] No;","completion":"[II] It's impossible to say Valentine is a 2001 American slasher film directed by Jamie Blanks, starring Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, and Katherine Heigl. The film is loosely based on the novel of the same name by Tom Savage and follows a group of women in San Francisco who are stalked by a man they tormented during their childhood. As a twenty-year-old film with no direct sequel or indications of a follow-up in all these years, it is impossible to definitively say whether or not Valentine will have a sequel. Several factors could have contributed to a lack of a sequel, such as its box office performance, critical reception, and other projects from involved parties. When it comes to box office performance, Valentine grossed 36.7 million against a budget of 10 million, making the film commercially successful. However, critical reception for Valentine was mostly negative, with Rotten Tomatoes giving the film a low 11% approval rating from critics. This negative reception could deter potential investors or studios from backing a sequel. Moreover, the careers of the main cast members and the director, Jamie Blanks, have continued in various fields within the entertainment industry. Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, and Katherine Heigl, for example, have since been involved in numerous television series and films. It is possible that the involved parties have pursued other projects, thus reducing the probability of a sequel for Valentine. Another point to consider is that the slasher film genre is not as popular today as it was in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The current horror landscape is more focused on psychological thrillers, supernatural stories, and new takes on classic horror franchises. This could also contribute to the lack of a sequel for Valentine. Given these factors, it is impossible to say with certainty whether Valentine will have a sequel in the future. However, as is often the case in the film industry, if there is a strong demand from fans or a sudden resurgence in interest in the original film, a sequel could certainly be a possibility."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He lost his leg in an accident and needs a wheelchair to help him move around. One day, Scottie was taken to a place called jail because he was drinking in a place where he wasn't supposed to. When he was in jail, some people took his wheelchair to keep it safe in a special place called a storage facility. But this time, when Scottie was allowed to leave jail, they forgot to give his wheelchair back to him, and that made things very difficult for him. Scottie had to drag himself on the ground to get out of jail because he didn't have his wheelchair to help him move. His girlfriend said that it was unfair and not nice to Scottie, because his hands got very hurt and swollen from moving on the ground without his wheelchair.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The present tense is used for anything that's currently happening. To conjugate an -er verb in the present tense, remove the -er ending from the infinitive and add -o, -es, -e, -emos, -éis, or -en, depending on the subject pronoun. Yo como: I eat. Tú comes: You [informal] eat. Él/ella/usted come: He/she eats; you [formal] eat. Nosotros comemos: We eat. Vosotros coméis: You all [informal] eat. Ellos/ellas/ustedes comen: They/you all [formal] eat. If you want to talk about something that happened completely in the past, remove the -er ending from the infinitive of your verb and add the appropriate ending. Depending on your subject pronoun, your ending will be -í, -iste, -ió, -imos, -isteis, or -ieron. Yo comí: I ate. Tú comiste: You [informal] ate. Él/ella/usted comió: He/she/you [formal] ate. Nosotros comimos: We ate. Vosotros comisteis: You [informal] ate. Ellos/ellas/ustedes comieron: They/you [formal] ate. If an action occurred in the past but continues into the present, the imperfect tense is more accurate than the preterite tense. This tense is also appropriate if you \\"were doing\\" something, but were interrupted. To conjugate -er verbs in this tense, replace the -er ending with -ía, ías, ía, -íamos, íais, or -ían. Yo comía: I was eating. Tú comías: You [informal] were eating. Él/ella/usted comía: He/she was eating; you [formal] were eating. Nosotros comíamos: We were eating. Vosotros comíais: You all [informal] were eating. Ellos/ellas/ustedes comían: They/you all [formal] were eating. If you want to talk about a hypothetical situation, or something that will only occur if something else takes place first, use the conditional tense. To conjugate -er verbs, you'll use the same endings that you used for the imperfect tense. However, you'll attach them to the end of the infinitive, rather than removing the -er ending. Yo comería: I would eat [if]. Tú comerías: You [informal] would eat [if]. Él/ella/usted comería: He/she/you [formal] would eat [if]. Nosotros comeríamos: We would eat [if]. Vosotros comeríais: You all [informal] would eat [if]. Ellos/ellas/ustedes comerían: They/you all [formal] would eat [if]. Like the conditional tense, verbs are conjugated in simple future tense by adding an ending directly onto the end of the infinitive. Depending on the subject pronoun, you'll add -é, -ás, -á, -emos, -éis, or -án. Yo comeré: I will eat. Tú comerás: You [informal] will eat. Él/ella/usted comerá: He/she/you [formal] will eat. Nosotros comerermos: We will eat. Vosotros comeréis: You all [informal] will eat. Ellos/ellas/ustedes comerán: They/you all [formal] will eat.","completion":"Present tense tells us what is happening now. For \\"-er\\" verbs, we remove \\"-er\\" and add different endings depending on who is doing the action. Like, \\"I eat\\" is \\"Yo como\\" and \\"We eat\\" is \\"Nosotros comemos\\". Past tense tells us what happened before. We again remove \\"-er\\" and add different endings, like \\"I ate\\" is \\"Yo comí\\" and \\"We ate\\" is \\"Nosotros comimos\\". Imperfect tense is for past actions that were ongoing or interrupted, like \\"I was eating\\" which is \\"Yo comía\\" and \\"We were eating\\" is \\"Nosotros comíamos\\". Conditional tense is for things that might happen if something else happens first.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: \\"Ludwigsburg,\\" meaning \\"Louis's castle,\\" was named after its builder, Eberhard Louis, Duke of Württemberg, in 1705. It had been previously known as the Erlachhof, a traditional hunting estate and lodge of the Dukes of Württemberg that was destroyed in 1692, during the Nine Years' War. Eberhard Louis commissioned a replacement lodge that was built from 1697 to 1701. Construction was interrupted by the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession, fought against France and Bavaria. Württemberg resisted entry into the war until late 1702. Two years later, Eberhard Louis participated in the Battle of Blenheim in August 1704 that was followed by the exile of the Bavarian Elector. The duke used the battle to press claims to Bavarian lands, but he illegally occupied those lands and was further weakened by a French invasion of Württemberg in 1707. As a result of this attack, the ducal residence in the capital, Stuttgart, was burned and the royal family fled to Switzerland. With the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the occupied Bavarian territory and status of the exiled Elector were restored.Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace began in May 1704 with the laying of the Alter Hauptbau's cornerstone by Eberhard Louis. The year before, he sent Philipp Joseph Jenisch to study architecture abroad. Eberhard Louis made Jenisch director of construction upon his return the next year, but he only managed to finish the Alter Hauptbau's (Old main building) first floor and some of the southern garden before 1707. The duke spent the winter of 1705–06 at Nymphenburg Palace, residence of the Elector of Bavaria, and was impressed by what he saw there and in architectural publications. Unable to compete with Bavaria militarily or politically, and defiant following the loss of the Stuttgart residence, Eberhard Louis decided to follow the example of Bavaria, Baden-Durlach, and the Rhineland Palatinate. He elected to build a new palace and town inspired by Versailles, which would be the center of his domestic society and diplomacy. Located 10... Guess a valid title for it!

Aber wenn die Mitgliedstaaten einmal anfangen, sich aus den Finanzinstitutionen zurückzuziehen, um ihren privaten Status wieder herzustellen, besteht eine Gefahr, dass sie eine Aussteuer zurücklassen, eine Art Hochzeitsgeschenk. Translate to English English:","completion":"But when the member states begin to withdraw from financial institutions in order to reestablish their private status, there is a danger that they leave behind a kind of dowry, a sort of wedding gift. English: If the member states decide to withdraw from financial institutions to restore their private status, there is a risk that they may leave behind a type of dowry or wedding gift. This dowry might have unforeseen consequences as it affects the financial landscape of the involved parties. In this context, the dowry refers to the potential economic and political consequences that may arise from member states retracting their involvement in financial institutions. By withdrawing, these states can encounter several challenges, including: 1. Economic imbalance: With the withdrawal of funds or investment, it may create an economic imbalance, impacting both the withdrawing member states and the remaining entities within the financial institution. The withdrawing countries may experience a loss of influence and potential long-term economic growth, while the remaining countries have to cope with the resulting shortages and disruptions in cash flow. 2. Systemic risk: As countries withdraw from financial institutions, it may cause a chain reaction, leading to instability in the world financial system. This can have adverse effects on global economic growth and international cooperation. 3. Loss of confidence: When member states begin withdrawing from financial institutions, it could potentially erode investor confidence and create an environment of uncertainty. This may result in a decline in both private and public investments and negatively impact economic growth. 4. Political implications: The decision to withdraw from financial institutions may also have political implications, as it may signal a lack of commitment to international cooperation and a shift towards nationalism. This can hinder diplomatic relations between countries and negatively affect ongoing negotiations or agreements. 5. Legal challenges: The process of withdrawing from financial institutions may be fraught with legal challenges. Countries may face lawsuits or claims for compensation or damages, which can be both financially and politically costly. To mitigate these risks and ensure a smooth transition, it is essential for the withdrawing states and the financial institutions to engage in open dialogue and cooperation. It may require the institution of transitional measures, renegotiation of agreements, and reassessment of the financial relationships between the involved parties. Overall, while the withdrawal of member states from financial institutions to restore their private status could lead to the short-term accomplishment of certain political or economic goals, it must be approached with caution. It is necessary to understand and address the potential long-term consequences of this decision to ensure stability, growth, and prosperity for all parties involved."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Just after Softbank confirmed plans to acquire UK semiconductor company ARM Holdings for 24.3 billion in cash earlier today, people began to wonder if it was the result of the pound falling in the wake of the Brexit referendum vote. Not so, said Softbank’s CEO and founder Masayoshi Son. In a press conference soon after the news broke, Masayoshi said that he only began acquisition discussions with ARM two weeks ago, yet the price was reached not with consideration for Brexit or the decline in the sterling currency, but Softbank’s interest in investing in IoT. “Brexit did not affect my decision,” he said. “Many people many are worried about Brexit and concerned about he complex situation of the country, but good or bad… I did not make the investment because of Brexit.” “It’s true that I only met the ARM chairman [Stuart Chambers] only two weeks ago. That was the day I said I was interested in acquiring ARM. That was the first time,” he said earlier, adding that he had met with former and current CEOs multiple times talking about joint ventures or a business alliance. Masayoshi Son said that although the price of the pound declined by about 16% in the past two weeks, ARM’s share price went up by about the same amount, meaning they cancelled each other out. And there were other financial factors in play as well: in recent weeks, Softbank sold a chunk of its Alibaba stake and its stake in Supercell, and today it announced a large loan for some 9 billion (¥1 trillion). “This is not opportunistic about the currency,” he joked. “I have wanted to do this but was waiting for the cash to come in.” Masayoshi Son has redoubled his hold on Softbank after a surprise announcement in June that the person tipped to take over from him, Nikesh Arora, would step down. You can see this latest acquisition somewhat as his call for how he envisions running things going forward. Talking about the acquisition today, he made a firm declaration of how he’d like Softbank to be a part of what he sees as the next generation of technology, the Internet of Things. ARM has made its name as the chip designer that launched a million smartphones — its designs are used by Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Mediatek and many more, accounting for 95% of all phones in use today. But a few years ago, it started to invest in IoT technology with the expectation that this will be the next big growth area as processors are put into cars, home appliances, machines in factories, and a lot of smaller and more mundane objects in our world to connect them. Masayoshi Son is on the same page, it seems. “I’m not investing in a distressed asset,” he said today near the start of a very long monologue about why Softbank was buying ARM Holdings. “I’m investing in a paradigm shift…. that’s my passion, and that’s my view.” He went on to describe how Softbank was there for the “beginning of the PC internet,” which he invested in via Yahoo when it only had 16 employees; and then how that shifted into mobile — an area where Softbank is still trying to make good on an earlier big bet, a stake in Sprint that it’s now trying to increase. IoT is the natural progression of that, he said. As for how the deal might affect partnerships that ARM has with manufacturers and hardware makers, Masayoshi Son seemed confident that this will not be disrupted by the acquisition. “We could not talk to more than six people so I have not spoken with any partners yet,” he said. “However [Apple’s] Tim Cook, [Samsung’s] Jay Lee, [Qualcomm’s] Paul Jacobs and all those guys who are big ARM customers are great friends of mine and have been for many years,” he said. “I think that Softbank has no conflict of interest with them. Softbank does not manufacture or buy any chips. We have no conflict with any of ARM’s customers. So I expect no resistance or hesitation going forward.” With the deal now in the hands of regulators who will need to approve it before it can be closed, he also said that Softbank has made some investment commitments for the future. Specifically, he said it’s entered into a legally binding decision to double employees over the next five years. “We will submit this to the UK takeover panel, so they will have enforcement rights for us to fulfill this commitment.” He says that he’ll be making his way to ARM’s HQ to start meeting with staff to reassure them of their commitments, and to make sure they stay on as part of the acquisition. “For many it has been a big surprise so I have to reiterate my commitment, passion and drive. I would just hope that they would continue to put their life and passion into the company,” he said. But while he was very clear that this deal was not a firesale, he did acknowledge that this is probably not the case for every potential sale and investment in the UK at the moment. “There are many very valuable companies in the UK, so if people have reduced their price for these companies because of the situation, this could be a good opportunity for investment into the UK,” he said. “Our investment may show confidence to them. They can take a smaller scale investment but we’ll bring more confidence. “I’m one of the few people who is betting with cash. Talking is easy, to say the UK will still be a great country, but I’m proving that with big-sized cash! The multiple is almost 60x of last year’s net income. That means this company has to sustain its growth and success for many years to come. I cannot hit and run. I have to believe in the future of the UK, the power of engineers here and so on. This is my big bet.” He also ruled out making any more deals in the UK this year, for now at least: “I would hope so but we don’t have any other plans this year.” ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ARM founder: 'Sad day for technology in Britain' The founder of ARM Holdings has told the BBC he believes its imminent sale to Japanese technology giant Softbank is \\"a sad day for technology in Britain\\". Hermann Hauser said he was \\"very sad\\" at news of the £24bn (32bn) takeover which was announced on Monday morning. The Cambridge-based firm designs microchips used in most smartphones, including Apple's and Samsung's. ARM, which was founded in 1990, employs more than 3,000 people. Mr Hauser called ARM Holdings his proudest achievement. 'Real strength' The man who helped spin ARM Holdings out from Acorn Computers in 1990 also said the technology firm had sold 15 billion microchips in 2015, which was more than US rival Intel had sold in its history. Mr Hauser said ARM gave the UK \\"real strength\\". He said it was a \\"British company that determined the next generation microprocessor architecture, that is going to be used in all the next generation phones and - more importantly - in the next generation of the internet of things\\".

Shares in the UK technology firm ended the day 41.3% higher at £16.80 in London after rising as high as £17.42p a share, adding almost £7bn to ARM's market value. Mr Hauser said the result of the Softbank deal meant the \\"determination of what comes next for technology will not be decided in Britain any more, but in Japan\\". Japanese entrepreneur ARM said it would keep its headquarters in Cambridge and that it would at least double the number of its staff over the next five years. Softbank is one of the world's biggest technology companies and is run by its founder, Japanese entrepreneur Masayoshi Son. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Softbank chief executive Masayoshi Son says the ARM purchase is a long-term investment It has previously acquired Vodafone's Japanese operations and the US telecoms company Sprint. The 20bn deal was the biggest foreign acquisition by a Japanese firm at the time. Softbank intends to preserve the UK tech firm's organisation, including its existing senior management structure and partnership-based business model, ARM said. Mr Son, chairman and chief executive of Softbank, said: \\"This is one of the most important acquisitions we have ever made, and I expect ARM to be a key pillar of SoftBank's growth strategy.\\" Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent Image copyright Getty Images It's hard to exaggerate just how important ARM is to the UK tech sector - and the shock many are feeling this morning at the news that it is about to lose its independence. Its brilliance was to realise that if chips were about to come with everything, you didn't have to make them: designing them was the key. Five years ago, Cambridge was home to at least three world-beating UK-owned technology firms: ARM, Autonomy and Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR). Then Autonomy was swallowed up by HP in an ill-fated deal; last year the chipmaker Qualcomm bought CSR; and now ARM - the biggest and best - is about to have a Japanese owner. In Softbank, ARM may well have found a good parent. The Japanese firm bought France's Aldebaran robotics business and has gone on to give it a global profile. But there will still be sadness in Cambridge, and beyond, that Britain's best hope of building a global technology giant now appears to have gone. 'Attractive destination' Prime Minister Theresa May said the Softbank deal showed the UK economy could be successful after the country voted to leave the European Union. A spokeswoman said Mrs May believed the deal was in the country's national interest - a gauge that she will use to assess any future foreign takeovers. \\"This is good news for British workers, it's good news for the British economy, it shows that, as the prime minister has been saying, we can make a success of leaving the EU,\\" the spokeswoman added. Dan Ridsdale, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said: \\"An increase in inbound merger and acquisition activity was one of the obvious consequences of Brexit and weakened sterling, but few expected it to manifest itself so quickly or at so large a scale.\\" ||||| Japanese tech conglomerate and Sprint owner Softbank today proposed to buy ARM for 32 billion, a 50 percent premium on what ARM would otherwise be worth (according to Recode) and a terrible, terrible idea. It's bad for ARM. It's bad for phone makers and wireless carriers. It's even bad for Sprint. ARM holds a benign monopoly on the instruction set used by almost all smartphone processors, and increasingly on the chips used by the \\"Internet of Things,\\" the chips which will go into everything from smart roads to medical equipment. Because nearly everyone agrees to use ARM's instruction set, which is like a language, OS and software developers don't have to sweat out an entire level of compatibility that they would otherwise have to worry about. Intel, AMD, and others agreeing to use Intel's x86 instruction set helped jumpstart the home PC revolution. ARM did the same for mobile tech. Apple and Qualcomm take ARM's instructions and build their own processor families. But Samsung, Mediatek, and many lower-cost chip designers, especially in the Internet of Things realm, buy ARM's second product: entire chip blueprints. ARM's perfect neutrality, never preferring one customer over another, means these vicious competitors can all trust they can get a fair deal from ARM. If they doubted that for a moment, the system would break. Softbank isn't neutral. Quite the contrary. It owns two major wireless carriers, in the US and Japan. Even the perception that Sprint engineers might get early looks at ARM chipset designs, or that ARM's designers would have a special financial interest in advancing Sprint's and Softbank's TD-LTE network technology over others, will create suspicion in the industry. This is one of those \\"appearance of impropriety\\" things; it won't take actual evidence of synergy for AT&T to start looking for other vendors for its very IoT-focused business strategy, just the possibility that synergy may be happening in secret. Even more than synergy, though, Sprint could really use that 32 billion, and the focus Softbank will give to ARM. Sprint is doing better than it was doing before Softbank invested, but it has sunk to fourth place in the surprisingly competitive US wireless market, largely because T-Mobile has been such a juggernaut. Sprint needs all the help it can get, and a parent company spending its time and money on ARM won't give it that help. Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son isn't an idiot, so what's really going on here? I suspect he's shopping for a buyer for Sprint. The US wireless market is growing slowly, but there's huge potential growth in the future connected world for ARM. Remember that Son's previous game plan was to merge Sprint with T-Mobile, putting T-Mobile CEO John Legere in charge and possibly spinning it all off for a profit? The US government put the kibosh on that, as the whole point of the merger was to reduce competition. Sprint hasn't been a stellar performer in Softbank's portfolio—and ARM has a lot more potential for the future. The question there is, who wants a slightly damaged US wireless carrier? Recode says Apple and Intel are other potential bidders. If ARM isn't going to stay independent, Intel is by far the best choice of that trio. Apple buying ARM would be like a nuke dropped on the rest of the mobile industry, as Apple has never been shy about leveraging its purchases for maximum competitive advantage. Apple would automatically get the newest ARM designs in advance of everyone else, ultimately driving Samsung and others towards Intel, MIPS, or more exotic competitors. This hurts consumers because a huge amount of effort would then have to go into making multiple versions of operating systems and apps for different processor designs; getting Android to be completely compatible with Intel x86 took years, and even now, popular games like Pokemon Go don't run on Intel designs. Intel buying ARM, on the other hand, would be the end of a process I've long hoped was inevitable. Long ago, Intel made the best ARM-compatible early smartphone chips, then decided to sell off the business to Marvell so the company could bash its head against a wall for 10 years trying to get smartphone firms to convert to its competing x86 architecture. This year, mobile x86 lost Asus, its last major client. Intel has been talking a lot about the Internet of Things, but it's playing from a position of weakness there, too. So Intel isn't a strong competitor in the mobile architecture world; it knows chip building like nobody's business; it has a strong position in servers, where ARM has been trying to grow; and it's used to being neutral in a competitive PC industry. If ARM has to sell to one of these players, let's hope Intel finds the cash. ||||| FILE - In this Nov. 4, 2014, file photo, SoftBank founder and Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son speaks during a news conference in Tokyo.

Japanese technology company SoftBank Group Corp. is buying... (Associated Press) TOKYO (AP) — Japanese technology company SoftBank Group Corp. is buying Britain's ARM Holdings for 24.3 billion pounds (32 billion), in a deal the British government hailed as a vote of confidence in the country following last month's vote to leave the European Union. The recommended cash deal underlines the desire of SoftBank, which also owns struggling U.S. telecommunications company Sprint, to expand in the so-called \\"Internet of Things\\" — how home devices from smart-thermostats to security cameras and domestic appliances can connect online and work in sync. ARM is renowned as an innovator in the \\"Internet of Things\\" — its technology is used in the vast majority of smartphones, for example. \\"ARM will be an excellent strategic fit within the SoftBank group as we invest to capture the very significant opportunities provided by the 'Internet of Things',\\" said Masayoshi Son, Chairman and CEO of SoftBank. ARM centers its business on intellectual property, especially in mobile computing, rather than chip manufacturing, for which it relies on partners. Its technology is used in 95 percent of smartphones and 80 percent of digital cameras, according to the company. Augmented-reality headsets, biometric sensors, self-driving cars, commercial drones and smart watches all use ARM technology. Hermann Hauser, who helped found the company in 1990, expressed his disappointment at the deal, bemoaning that the company's future would be determined in Japan. \\"ARM has been the proudest achievement in my life, so it's a very sad day for me personally and for technology in Britain,\\" Hauser, who is now a partner at Amadeus Capital, told ITV News. SoftBank has sought to assuage concerns about the impact on jobs in Britain, promising to \\"at least double\\" the number of employees employed by ARM in the U.K. over the next five years. Cambridge-based ARM employs a little more than 4,000 people worldwide. Around 1,600 are in Britain. Philip Hammond, Britain's new Treasury chief, said the deal shows that Britain has \\"lost none of its allure to international investors\\" after the June 23 vote to leave the EU. \\"Britain is open for business — and open to foreign investment,\\" Hammond said. Britain's new prime minister, Theresa May, also welcomed SoftBank's takeover despite vowing to defend British firms from foreign takeovers. May's official spokeswoman said the swoop \\"was a clear vote of confidence in Britain\\" and showed that the country could make a success of leaving the EU. She said May gave her support to the deal after a conversation with SoftBank's chief executive Masayoshi Son on Sunday, where she learned of the firm's employment intentions and its commitment to maintain ARM's headquarters in Cambridge. A week ago, May pledged to devise a \\"proper industrial strategy\\" to defend British companies from being snapped up by foreign businesses, including firms in Britain's pharmaceutical sector. Last month's vote for so-called Brexit has raised fears that the British economy will suffer. A raft of evidence already shows consumer and business sentiment has taken a hit since the vote, prompting some economists to warn that the country is heading for recession. \\"The transaction represents the first major acquisition following the referendum and whilst the purchase doesn't constitute a resounding vote of confidence in the post-EU U.K., it does illustrate that the after-effects of the Brexit have not deterred all parties from continuing with business as usual,\\" said David Cheetham, market analyst at XTB. One major impact of the referendum result has been a big fall in the value of the British pound but SoftBank's Son said his company wasn't buying ARM on the cheap, given that its share price had actually risen since the vote, offsetting any impact from the currency's fall. The deal, which SoftBank hopes to complete by the end of September, has a few steps pending. ARM shareholders, who have been advised by the board to accept the offer, and the English courts still need to give their backing. \\"The board believes that by accessing all the resources that SoftBank has to offer, ARM will be able to further accelerate the use of ARM-based technology wherever computing happens,\\" ARM Chairman Stuart Chambers said. Investors think it's likely to go through. ARM's share price was up 41.8 percent at 16.86 pounds in late London trading, just below the offer price of 17 pounds a share. SoftBank said its offer represents a 43 percent premium to ARM's closing share price on Friday. ___ Pylas contributed from London.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Is not necessarily worth two of anything, anywhere else. But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all. So with dead, smelly fish in mind, I persuaded my friend Shan to pick one up when he was down at the Saturday Farmer's Market. He returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid. Shad has even more bones than other fish and you'll never see it featured on any cooking show (except maybe Iron Chef, where the disgusting and unusual seems to be standard). It took me all day to thaw out the fish in the lounge sink?#8364;?an activity which elicited howls of complaint from the guys trying to watch TV. Who returned from the Farmer's Market with a four-pound fish? - Scut - The narrator - Shan - not enough information Answer:","completion":"According to the provided passage, the character who returned from the Farmer's Market with a four-pound fish was Shan. The narrator of the story encourages his friend, Shan, to buy a fish when he goes to the Saturday Farmer's Market. Shan complies with this request and comes back with a four-pound shad fish; a variety known for its substantial number of bones and thus unlikely to be seen in a traditional cooking show. The narrator doesn't seem to have an enjoyment for seafood; however, his dislike offers the ability to use the fish as a tool for revenge against another character named Scut. This intention is made clear when he takes the time to thaw the fish in the lounge sink, despite the disturbance it causes to others around him. The character, Scut, is identified as the target of this revenge plot but doesn't have any involvement in the retrieval of the fish. The narrator himself has a role in the plan, but it is to orchestrate the event rather than to be the one acquiring the resources, hence, he had Shan return from the market with the fish. The text does not give information sufficient to identify any other character linked to the purchase of the fish.

The town's teenagers quickly accept her, to the chagrin of their parents, who consider her a bad influence. Bowling alley owner Patty is interested in Bob, and at her late-night gory film festival she was presenting at Bob's theater she succeeds in humiliating Elvira. Elvira struggles to sell the house, so she can depart for Las Vegas. Meanwhile, she is unaware that her harsh but seemingly-harmless uncle Vincent is actually a warlock who is obsessed with obtaining Morgana's spellbook; he plans to kill Elvira and conquer the world, and has been fuelling the townspeople's hostility. Elvira tries to impress Bob with a home-cooked dinner, but mistakenly uses the spellbook as a cookbook and summons a creature that attacks them. Elvira learns that the book was her mother Divana's spellbook, and that Morgana hid her to protect her from Vincent. When Elvira tries to unleash the creature against the Morality Club at their picnic, she prepares the brew incorrectly and it instead has an aphrodisiac effect; the adults remove each other's clothing indiscriminately and are arrested for indecent exposure. When Patty confronts Elvira, the resulting fistfight ends up humiliating Patty by revealing that her bra is stuffed.

Write a title for this article: It is the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, and I thought the following two pieces might be of interest to this blog’s readers. The first is a column by Charles C.W. Cooke in the National Review (yes, that National Review), “The GOP’s Conspicuous Absence from Selma.” The entire thing is worth reading, but here is the conclusion: If we are to regard the founding generation as being worthy of contemporary political lionization — and we most assuredly should — then we must consider those who marched at Selma to be so, too. If we are to put George Washington upon our plinths, and to eulogize him on our currency, we must agree to elevate Martin Luther King Jr. to the same dizzy heights. They are less famous, perhaps, but by virtue of their brave march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, John Lewis and Hosea Williams immortalized themselves into quintessential American heroes in the mold of Sam Adams and George Mason. To miss an opportunity to solemnize their daring is to blunder, disgracefully. If all men really are created equal, the anniversary of Selma must be treated as a date every bit as important to American history as is the end of the Siege of Yorktown. As it would be unthinkable for the leadership of the Republican party to ignore July Fourth, it should be unthinkable for its luminaries not to celebrate the anniversary of the March to Montgomery either. Where have you gone, Speaker Boehner, a movement turns its lonely eyes to you. The second is an op-ed by Ronald Krotoszynski in the L.A. Times (via Tyler Cowen) which discusses the federal district court order that paved the way for the march to Montgomery: The ruling opened the way for hundreds to march down U.S. 80, culminating with a 25,000-person protest in front of the Alabama State Capitol. Speaking there, King famously asked, “How long?” and answered “Not long. Because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice.” Selma still represents the pinnacle of the use of peaceful protests to secure civil rights and reform the government. Today, it would be impossible to obtain a federal court order permitting a five-day protest march on a 52-mile stretch of a major U.S. highway. Under contemporary legal doctrine, the Selma protests would have ended March 8, 1965.

The answer is:","completion":"1). a tape measure. To measure the length of an elephant's trunk, you would need a tape measure. A meter stick, as mentioned in the fact, is used to measure length, but an elephant's trunk is a curved, flexible, and elongated structure, so using a straight meter stick would not be practical for obtaining an accurate measurement. A tape measure, on the other hand, is a flexible and retractable measuring tool, which makes it much more suitable for measuring the length of an elephant's trunk. By gently extending the tape measure along the curve of the trunk from its base (near the elephant's forehead) to its tip (where the finger-like projections are), you can obtain an accurate measurement of the trunk's length. None of the other possible answers are appropriate tools for measuring length: 2). A tusk: An elephant's tusk is an elongated canine tooth that protrudes from its mouth. Tusks can grow quite large and are often used for digging or as weapons during fights between elephants. However, they are not measuring tools and cannot be used to measure the length of an elephant's trunk. 3). A scale: A scale is a device used to measure weight, not length. While it can provide information about an elephant's overall size and mass, a scale cannot measure the length of an elephant's trunk. 4). A pool: A pool is a body of water, often designed for swimming or recreation. It is not a measuring tool and would not be useful for determining the length of an elephant's trunk. In conclusion, a tape measure is the best and most appropriate tool for the task of measuring the length of an elephant's trunk due to its flexibility and accuracy in measuring curved surfaces."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Well, Louis Braille's work changed the world. Born in a small town near Paris in 1809, shortly after his third birthday Louis blinded himself in one eye while playing with a sharp pointed tool in his father's workshop. He soon lost the sight in his other eye when the infection spread. He wanted to go to school, but in his small town there was no school for him. At that time, blind people did not get any school education. Braille went to Paris to study, but there were few books for the blind. Louis knew that books were the key to learning. He struggled with ideas for three years. Finally, at fifteen, he invented an alphabet made with raised dots . Blind people could \\"read\\" by feeling the patterns of the dots. Being able to read Braille allows blind children to learn together with the sighted at school, and go on to get jobs. It allows people who lose their eyesight to continue to read, learn and get information.

At the end of each month, you often ask yourself, \\"Where has all my money gone\\"? To help you better run your salary, here come some money-saving tips. First, you need to set goals to encourage yourself to save money. For example, you plan to have a good dress in one year, to have a car in two years' time or to buy a house in five years. Second, form money-saving habits and stay away from the ones that waste money. Learn to keep a diary of how much you spend and what it's for. Think twice before using money on expensive skin care products . The best way to keep your skin in good condition is enough sleep. Third, pay attention to your daily things. Leave no more than one light on when you leave home. Buy vegetables from a market where vegetables are less expensive and fresher, not a supermarket. When going to a supermarket, take a notebook with you. Write down what you want to buy. Fourth, save your social life. Take the dishes that haven't been eaten up away for next day when you have dinner in a restaurant. When it's your turn to offer a meal, invite your friends to your home, and cook the dinner yourself.

In Sentence 1: - Subjects: \\"those who had merely stood by\\" and \\"those who had worshipped\\" - Actions: \\"waited a few seconds more\\" and \\"no more rose\\" In Sentence 2: - Subject: \\"everyone who was worshiping\\" - Action: \\"rose up\\" Step 2: Analyze the meaning of both sentences. Sentence 1 suggests that all people in the group of those who were just standing by and those who were worshiping waited for some time, but no additional people stood up after a few seconds. Sentence 2 states that all those who were worshiping rose up. Step 3: Compare the two sentences and determine if Sentence 2 can be true given Sentence 1. If those who were worshiping waited a few seconds more and did not stand up again in Sentence 1, it does not provide us with any information about whether they initially stood up or not. They could have stood up earlier, then waited, and just not stood up again. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence can still be true, as it makes a separate statement about everyone who was worshiping initially rising up.

OPT: (1). yes (2). it is not possible to tell (3). no","completion":"(2). it is not possible to tell In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's analyze both sentences and consider the context required to determine the validity of the second sentence. Sentence 1: 'I...did he?' This sentence appears to be an incomplete statement or question, where the speaker seems uncertain or surprised about an action or event that was performed by \\"he.\\" The use of ellipsis suggests that there might be an implied question or some missing information that the speaker is unsure about. However, the sentence itself does not provide enough information to evaluate the truth value of the statement. Sentence 2: It was obvious that he had. This sentence claims that it is clear and evident that \\"he\\" had performed the action or event mentioned in the first sentence. Nevertheless, this statement also does not provide specific information about what the action or event actually is. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of this statement by itself. Now, let's consider the possible relationship between the two sentences. If sentence 1, 'I...did he?' implies that the speaker is questioning whether \\"he\\" completed an action or event, and if this question is true, this does not necessarily mean that the second sentence is true. The truth of the question itself does not confirm that the speaker is correct in asking the question since the speaker might be uncertain or unaware of the situation. In this case, the truth of the second sentence would depend on the actual fact of the action or event carried out by \\"he.\\" Thus, based on the information given, it is not possible to decide whether the second sentence is true or not. Option (2) is the correct answer because we cannot determine the truth of the second sentence solely based on the information provided and the truth of the first sentence.

Detailed answer: The premise and hypothesis seem to be making some claims about the value of TV, but the wording and structure of the statement are unclear, making it difficult to determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise appears to be expressing frustration at oneself for watching TV, understanding that there is no redeeming value for TV. However, the premise is not presented in a coherent manner, making it difficult for us to draw a clear conclusion about the intention of the statement. The hypothesis claims that TV is not valuable because it sucks at your mind, and you don't learn anything. This argument is making a negative statement about TV, suggesting that watching it has no benefits and can be detrimental to one's intellect or personal development. Because the premise is unclear, it is not possible to confidently determine whether it entails the hypothesis. If we were to attempt to reformulate the premise in a clearer manner, we could say: \\"Despite feeling mad at myself for watching TV, I acknowledge that it has no redeeming value.\\" This revised premise could suggest a closer connection to the hypothesis, as both discuss the lack of value associated with watching TV.

Abdul's father, Harry Abdul, was born into the Syrian Jewish community in Aleppo, Syria, was raised in Brazil, and subsequently immigrated to the United States. Her mother, the concert pianist Lorraine M. Rykiss, grew up in one of the two Jewish families in Minnedosa, Manitoba, and has Ashkenazi Jewish ancestors from Ukraine. She has a sister named Wendy. Abdul was discovered by The Jacksons, after a few of the band members had watched her while attending a Los Angeles Lakers game. She was signed to do the choreography for the video to their single \\"Torture\\". \\"My only problem was how to tell the Jacksons how to dance,\\" Abdul later recalled. \\"Imagine me telling them what routines to do. I was young, I was scared. I'm not quite sure how I got through that.\\" The success of the choreography in the video led to Abdul's career of choreographer in music videos. It was also due to the success of the video that Abdul was chosen to be the choreographer for the Jacksons' Victory tour. Abdul choreographed videos for several singers throughout the 1980s, including many videos for Janet Jackson during her Control era. In 1995, Abdul released a dance workout video entitled Paula Abdul's Get Up and Dance! (re-released on DVD in 2003), a fast-paced, hip-hop style workout. In 1998, she released a second video called Cardio Dance (re-released on DVD in 2000). In December 2005, Abdul launched a cheerleading/fitness/dance DVD series called Cardio Cheer, which is marketed to children and teenage girls involved with cheerleading and dance. In film, Abdul choreographed sequences for the giant keyboard scene involving Tom Hanks's character in Big. Other credits include appearances in Coming to America, Action Jackson, Jerry Maguire, The Running Man, American Beauty, Can't Buy Me Love, and Oliver Stone's The Doors.

Martin is on the point of proposing to a girl and doesn't want to ask for her hand in marriage while making a lowly accountant's salary. After Barnier refuses to give him the raise, Martin tells him that he's stolen more than sixty million francs from him by falsifying the firm's accounting records. When Barnier threatens to report this to the police, Martin points out that as a consequence of the fraud Barnier has now submitted false income statements to the tax office, a serious crime. Barnier has no choice but to give in to blackmail and he agrees to give Martin the raise and name him vice-president of the firm. Martin then reveals that the young woman whom he intends to marry is Barnier's daughter. In order to recover his sixty million francs, Barnier asks Martin to give back the stolen monies so that he can give them to his daughter as a wedding present. Barnier learns that Martin converted the sum into jewelry and the jewels are in a bank. He tells Martin to get the jewelry, but Martin refuses without a signed document from Barnier stating that he will give the jewelry to his daughter as a wedding present. Barnier agrees and Martin leaves for the bank. While Martin is gone, Barnier talks to his daughter Colette. Without mentioning Martin, he tells her that he's opposed to her marriage which causes her to break down and cry.

Information: - Leonard Michael Maltin (born December 18, 1950) is an American film critic and historian, as well as an author of several mainstream books on cinema, focusing on nostalgic, celebratory narratives. He is known as a \\"go-to\\" critic for the major studios, for writing the shortest review in the U.S. and for creating the Walt Disney Treasures series. - Humphrey the Bear is a cartoon character created by the Walt Disney studio in 1950. He first appeared in the Goofy cartoon \\"Hold That Pose\\", in which Goofy tried to take his picture. After that he appeared in four classic Donald Duck cartoons: \\"Grin and Bear It\\", \\"Bearly Asleep\\", \\"Rugged Bear\\", and \\"Beezy Bear\\". Disney gave him his own series in 1955, but only two films resulted (\\"Hooked Bear\\" and \\"In the Bag\\") before Disney discontinued making theatrical short subjects. When the shorts division closed, Humphrey was the last of only seven Disney characters who had been given a series of their own, starring in cartoons who opened with their own logo (the six others were Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto, Chip 'n' Dale (counting as one), and Figaro). The Humphrey cartoons have been aptly described by Leonard Maltin as \\"belly-laugh\\" shorts, and they feature a broader, wilder style of comedy than the usually cute or coy Disney gags. - Mickey Mouse is a funny animal cartoon character and the official mascot of The Walt Disney Company. He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey has become one of the world's most recognizable characters. - Featurette is a term used in the American film industry to designate a film usually of three reels in length, or about 2440 minutes in running time, thus longer than a two-reel short subject but shorter than a feature film. Hence, it is a \\"small feature\\" (the ending \\"-ette\\" is a common diminutive suffix derived from French). The term was commonly used from before the start of the sound era into the 1960s, when films of such length as the Hal Roach's Streamlinersand several French films of that lengthceased being made, or were made as experimental or art films and subsumed under the more general rubric of short. Its use outside the USA is unknown, although it was as commonly applied to foreign imports as to domestic productions within that country. - Hooked Bear is a 1956 short film in the Humphrey the Bear series . The short can be found on disc 2 of Disney Rarities : Celebrated Shorts : 1920s -- 1960s and also in a handful of cheap public domain VHS tapes . - Goofy is a funny-animal cartoon character created in 1932 at Walt Disney Productions. Goofy is a tall, anthropomorphic dog with a Southern drawl, and typically wears a turtle neck and vest, with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled fedora. Goofy is a close friend of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and is one of Disney's most recognizable characters. He is normally characterized as extremely clumsy and dimwitted, yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as intuitive, and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way. - A short film is any film not long enough to be considered a feature film. Although no consensus exists as to where that boundary is drawn, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences defines a short film as \\"an original motion picture that has a running time of 40 minutes or less, including all credits\\". The term featurette originally applied to a film longer than a short subject, but shorter than a standard feature film. - Chip and Dale (also rendered as Chip 'n' Dale or Chip an' Dale) are two chipmunk cartoon characters created in 1943, at Walt Disney Productions. Their names are a pun based on the name of the famous 18th-century cabinet maker Thomas Chippendale. This was suggested by Bill \\"Tex\\" Henson, a story artist at the studio. - Donald Duck is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is most famous for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002. He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre. - In the Bag is a 1956 Walt Disney's animated theatrical short directed by Jack Hannah and featuring park ranger J. Audubon Woodlore and his comedic foil Humphrey the Bear. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'hooked bear' with the relationship of 'director'.

In Christian theology, Jesus is sometimes referred to as \\"the Lamb of God,\\" a title that emphasizes his sacrificial role in the redemption of humanity from sin. The phrase \\"blood of the Lamb\\" alludes to the cleansing and saving power of Jesus' sacrifice, as the shedding of his blood provided a means for the forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God.

Seen in its wider social context, Greek Revival architecture sounded a new note of sobriety and restraint in public buildings in Britain around 1800 as an assertion of nationalism attendant on the Act of Union, the Napoleonic Wars, and the clamour for political reform. It was to be William Wilkins's winning design for the public competition for Downing College, Cambridge that announced the Greek style was to be the dominant idiom in architecture. Wilkins and Robert Smirke went on to build some of the most important buildings of the era, including the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden (1808–09), the General Post Office (1824–29) and the British Museum (1823–48), Wilkins University College London (1826–30) and the National Gallery (1832–38). In Scotland, Thomas Hamilton (1784–1858), in collaboration with the artists Andrew Wilson (1780–1848) and Hugh William Williams (1773–1829) created monuments and buildings of international significance; the Burns Monument at Alloway (1818) and the (Royal) High School in Edinburgh (1823–29).

Washington (CNN) -- Two weeks ago, the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill on a 68-32 vote, with 14 Republicans joining the Democratic majority to send the measure drafted by a bipartisan \\"Gang of Eight\\" to the GOP-controlled House. President Barack Obama pushed for the House to quickly take up the measure that would provide a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants living illegally in the country while bolstering security along the Mexican border. The proposal also includes stronger worker eligibility verification standards and overall border entry-exit controls. However, House Republicans made clear Wednesday they opposed the comprehensive approach of the Senate and intended to consider the issue in a series of bills that will take months to reach final votes. For a lot of OPTIONS: - Barack Obama, though, the issue involves trust, not money. - CNN, though, the issue involves trust, not money. - Democratic, though, the issue involves trust, not money. - GOP, though, the issue involves trust, not money. - Gang of Eight, though, the issue involves trust, not money. - House, though, the issue involves trust, not money. - McCain, though, the issue involves trust, not money. - Mexican, though, the issue involves trust, not money. - Republicans, though, the issue involves trust, not money. - Senate, though, the issue involves trust, not money. - Washington, though, the issue involves trust, not money.","completion":"For many Republicans, though, the issue involves trust, not money. The comprehensive approach put forth by the Senate has met resistance in the GOP-controlled House, primarily due to concerns over whether the proposed reforms will genuinely address national security and immigration enforcement. Some Republicans worry that granting a path to citizenship to the millions of undocumented immigrants already in the country, even with the promise of bolstered border security, could compromise the nation's safety and strain its resources. The House's preference for taking a piecemeal approach in addressing immigration speaks to this underlying issue of trust. By breaking the legislation into smaller, more focused bills, they aim to ensure that each significant aspect of the larger immigration problem gets the attention and debate it deserves. This methodical approach may provide some Republicans with the reassurance they need that legislative proposals are both effective and enforceable. Furthermore, the insistence on a series of smaller bills, rather than a comprehensive package, could help build bipartisan support for specific measures. Reforms that might be contentious within a larger package could face less resistance as individual bills, allowing for more focused negotiation and compromise. The long process of finalizing these bills, while potentially frustrating to supporters of swift immigration reform, reflects the complexities of reconciling divergent political perspectives and national priorities. One of the primary points of contention for Republicans is the proposed path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Skeptics of the Senate's comprehensive approach fear that such a provision would amount to \\"amnesty\\" for people who have broken immigration laws. This perspective stems from a desire to enforce existing laws and prioritize legal immigration pathways. The House Republicans' careful consideration of multiple smaller bills may ultimately lead to a compromise that offers citizenship pathways without rewarding law-breaking. Ultimately, the most logical way to complete the passage would be with the option: \\"For many Republicans, though, the issue involves trust, not money.\\" By emphasizing trust rather than financial considerations, this option highlights the key concerns driving the House Republicans' reluctance to adopt the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill. Their pursuit of a series of smaller, targeted bills reflects this emphasis on trust as they seek solutions that genuinely address national security, immigration enforcement, and the complexities of America's immigration system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael Patrick Welch has crafted a novel full of mirth, pathos, and love. Truly, I haven't had this much fun reading a book in a long while.

Translate to English English:","completion":"Customs clearance, as well as transportation of the satellite and ground equipment to the cosmodrome. Customs clearance is the process of obtaining permission and fulfilling the necessary requirements for the import or export of goods across national borders. In the context of satellite and ground equipment transportation to a cosmodrome, customs clearance ensures that all necessary regulations, duties, and taxes are adhered to while moving these high-value and potentially sensitive items. The transportation of satellites and ground equipment is a complex and meticulously planned process. Several factors must be considered to ensure safe and timely delivery to the cosmodrome. Some of these factors include: 1. Transport mode: Depending on the size, weight, and nature of the satellite and ground equipment, various transport modes can be utilized. These can range from specialized trucks to cargo aircraft and even to customized railcars. 2. Packaging and handling: Satellites and ground equipment are highly sensitive and expensive pieces of technology. Proper packaging and handling procedures must be followed to prevent any damage during transportation. This may include using specialized containers, anti-static materials, and proper padding to absorb shocks or vibration. 3. Regulatory compliance: Compliance with international and national regulations on the export and import of high-tech equipment, hazardous materials, and controlled goods is crucial. This may involve acquiring permits and licenses, coordinating with relevant authorities, and ensuring the proper documentation and labeling of all items. 4. Route planning and security: Mapping out the optimal route for transportation while considering factors like distance, transit time, security risks, and infrastructure availability is important. Ensuring the security of sensitive cargo is also a major concern, possibly requiring police escorts, real-time tracking, and constant communication between all parties involved. 5. Coordination with the cosmodrome: Close coordination with the cosmodrome authorities is essential to ensure smooth integration upon arrival. This may involve scheduling the arrival and unloading of the satellite and ground equipment, as well as coordinating with the onsite team for assembly, testing, and integration. In conclusion, customs clearance and transportation of satellites and ground equipment to a cosmodrome require a well-coordinated effort between multiple parties, strict adherence to regulations, and meticulous planning. The ability to successfully manage these factors is crucial to ensure the safe and timely transport of valuable satellite and ground equipment to the cosmodrome for launch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Federal health officials say 14 people in six states have been sickened by the same strain of E. coli over the past couple of months. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokeswoman Lola Russell, 14 cases of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 0145 infection with the same DNA fingerprint have been identified in six states. \\"Their illness onsets range from April 15 to May 12,\\" she said, adding that the most recent case was reported June 4. \\"Three ill persons have been hospitalized. One death has been reported in Louisiana.\\" Cases have been reported in Alabama (2), California (1), Florida (1), Georgia (5), Louisiana (4) and Tennessee (1), according to the CDC. Louisiana health officials would confirm only that one child died and three adults were sickened in the New Orleans area. CNN affiliate WWL reported that the child was 21-month-old Maelan Elizabeth Graffagnini, who fought the infection for weeks at a local hospital. Feds speed up E. coli investigation procedures. Georgia is reporting five cases, the most in one state. \\"Four of five are female, and their ages range from 18 to 52, with a median of 34. Illness onsets range from (April 15-28); one case was hospitalized overnight for this illness, and no cases have died,\\" said Suleima Salgado, deputy director of communications for the Georgia Department of Public Health. The cases in Georgia have been mild, according to Dr. J. Patrick O'Neal, who heads the Division of Health Protection within the Georgia Department of Public Health. He said Thursday, \\"I don't think there's need for great concern. I think awareness, yes, concern, no. We have outbreaks of various diarrheal diseases quite frequently.\\" Neither of the Alabamans was hospitalized; both have recovered, the state's Department of Public Health said in a news release. According to the CDC, the most common strain is E. coli O157. The strain in this outbreak is 0145. \\"As whole, the non-O157 serogroup is less likely to cause severe illness than E. coli O157,\\" it said. \\"However, some non-O157 (Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli) serogroups can cause the most severe manifestations of STEC illness.\\" Russell said many clinical laboratories do not regularly test for this particular strain of E. coli. However, the O145 strain is one of six additional strains for which the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Services has begun testing for in ground beef. The cause of the outbreak is unknown, and the investigation is ongoing on the federal and local levels. Infectious disease investigators will interview the victims to determine what exposures they have in common. The CDC says it's looking at both food and non-food exposures as a source of the outbreak. However, Louisiana health officials say they suspect that food may be to blame, according to a statement from the state's Department of Health and Hospitals. \\"People usually get sick from STEC 2-8 days (average of 3-4 days) after swallowing the organism,\\" Russell said in a statement. She added that most people infected with the 0145 strain develop diarrhea (usually watery and often bloody) and abdominal cramps. \\"Most illnesses resolve on their own within seven days, but sometimes the symptoms can last longer and can be more severe.\\" So investigators are dependent on people accurately remembering what they ate or came into contact with before they got sick. Food such as meat and poultry but also fruit and vegetables is often the source of E. coli infections. However, unpasteurized or raw milk, water that has not been disinfected, contact with cattle or contact with the feces of infected people are other sources of infections. Young children, pregnant women, the elderly and people who have weakened immune systems (like cancer or HIV patients) are at greater risk for severe illness and death. The best way to avoid getting sick is by washing hands frequently when preparing food as well as avoiding cross-contamination of food preparation areas by washing cutting boards, counters and utensils with hot, soapy water. Properly washing hands after using the bathroom and after coming into contact with animals or being in their environments -- anywhere there may be traces of feces, where the bacteria could be lurking -- also helps. Cooking meats thoroughly to at least 160Â°F or 70ËšC kills the bacteria and prevents infection as well. Using a meat thermometer will most accurately help you determine that the food is thoroughly cooked. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.

News article: Over the years, a 1 million reward and a search in the Tioga Mine Pit failed to yield the stolen slippers, one of several pairs worn by Grand Rapids native Judy Garland in the 1939 movie \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" Only four pairs of the famous ruby slippers are known to be in existence, the News Tribune reported in 2015. Besides the stolen pair, the other three sets reside in the Smithsonian Institution, a Los Angeles museum and a private collection. The ruby slippers were nearly at the end of a 10-week loan to the Judy Garland Museum when they were stolen sometime in the overnight hours of Aug. 27-28 in 2005. In the days following the theft, police said the emergency exit door window had been broken. A glass case containing the ruby slippers was broken and the slippers were removed, according to police. The museum had an alarm system, but the private security firm that operated it didn't receive a signal that any doors or windows were opened. It was discovered in the days afterward that the alarm system hadn't been set to alert the security firm that night. Michael Shaw, the slippers' owner who loaned them to the museum, told the News Tribune in 2005 that the theft was \\"the worst nightmare for me.\\" Kelsch said at the time that he was \\"devastated\\" by the theft. \\"The slippers are a major attraction for our museum. It's our hope that the slippers can be recovered immediately,\\" Kelsch said in 2005. But the theft of the ruby slippers has remained an open police case for 13 years. Divers from the Itasca County Sheriff's Office took a look around the Tioga Mine Pit in 2015, based on the rumor that the slippers were sealed with a weight in Tupperware and tossed into the pit's water. The ruby slippers weren't found during the dive, but a small duffel bag and a partially deteriorated tin can were found and turned over to the Grand Rapids Police Department. A 1 million reward was offered on the 10th anniversary of the theft in 2015 by an anonymous Arizona-based fan, and the Grand Rapids Police Department received more than 40 tips about the stolen slippers. The leads came from as far away as Arizona, the East Coast and the United Kingdom and included tips that the slippers were seen at garage sales, given away in radio station contests and stapled on a restaurant wall. But the deadline to collect the reward came and went without any credible leads or the return of the ruby slippers. The Judy Garland Museum also hired Twin Cities private investigator Rob Feeney, who told the News Tribune in 2015, \\"We're never going to stop looking for these things. I know the public is never going to stop having an interest in it until they're actually recovered.\\" The stolen ruby slippers were featured in July on the Discovery Channel show \\"Expedition Unknown,\\" in which host Josh Gates visited the museum during the winter and conducted his own underwater search for the slippers with quips about northern Minnesota's weather. \\"Grand Rapids may be freezing, but this case is anything but cold,\\" Gates concluded. ||||| The thief left behind bits of broken glass and a single red sequin on the floor. So began a 13-year-old mystery filled with wild tips and offers of lavish rewards in the hunt for two ruby slippers snatched from a museum in Judy Garland’s hometown of Grand Rapids, Minn. Now homecoming heel clicks are ahead: Investigators have found the stolen slippers, bringing closure to an Oz-sized search for the most famous pair of shoes in movie history. There’s no place like home. Authorities were announcing Tuesday afternoon that they’ve recovered the shoes. The slippers filched from the Judy Garland Museum were one of several pair donned by Garland in the 1939 classic “The Wizard of Oz” and one of only four known surviving pairs from the movie production that launched Garland’s meteoric fame. North Dakota U.S. Attorney Chris Myers says though the recovery was made, authorities are still looking for who is responsible for the theft. They are still seeking the public's help moving the investigation forward. The tip that led to the recovery came last summer, and the slippers were found in Minneapolis in August. Before the crushing theft in August 2005, the size 5 ½ slippers were on loan to the museum from Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw. Shaw told the Star Tribune in 2005 that he bought the slippers and other “Wizard of Oz” collectibles at an MGM auction, calling it “the deal of the millennium.” Someone broke into the museum on Aug. 28, snatched the slippers and fled. Nothing else was taken. Museum officials said at the time that an emergency exit had been tampered with. Over the years, the hunt spurred pleas from surviving film performers and an offer of a 1 million reward on the 10th anniversary of the theft. Divers from the Itasca County Sheriff’s Office have even plunged into a watery quarry in their search for the shoes. The slippers’ disappearance dealt a body blow to the small museum in Garland’s hometown, about 200 miles north of the Twin Cities. Garland, born Frances Gumm, lived in Grand Rapids until she was 4 ½, when her family moved to Los Angeles. She died of a barbiturate overdose in 1969. The museum bills itself as offering the world’s largest collection of Garland and “Wizard of Oz” collectibles. Museum officials say many of the thousands of visitors drawn there each year still ask what happened to the sparkling burgundy footwear. “They’re the symbol of the longing for home — a symbol of a sense of place,” John Kelsch, the museum’s executive director, said in a 2016 interview. “Of any artifact from the movie, they touch that emotion in people.” At the time of the theft, the slippers had been insured for a slick 1 million. “France has the ‘Mona Lisa.’ America has ‘The Wizard of Oz,’ ” Kelsch told the Star Tribune. “It’s our national masterpiece, so much a part of the American experience.” ||||| A pair of ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz and stolen from the actress’ namesake museum in Minnesota more than a decade ago has been recovered, the FBI announced today. The iconic sequined shoes, known as the “traveling pair”—one of at least four pairs used in the film that are still in existence—were stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota in 2005 and recovered earlier this summer during a sting operation. But the case is far from over. “From the outset,” said Special Agent Christopher Dudley, who led the investigation from the FBI’s Minneapolis Division, “our top priority was the safe recovery of the slippers.” Although multiple suspects have been identified, Dudley said, “we are still working to ensure that we have identified all parties involved in both the initial theft and the more recent extortion attempt for their return. This is very much an active investigation.” At a press conference in Minneapolis to announce the recovery, the FBI, along with the Grand Rapids Police Department, asked for the public’s assistance. “There are certainly people out there who have additional knowledge regarding both the theft and the individuals responsible for concealing the slippers all these years.” Dudley said. “We are asking that you come forward.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Thirteen years after the theft of a pair of ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 film \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" authorities announced that they have recovered the iconic footwear.

Forcing one friend to either eat cold food, or eat before the rest of us. When the bulk of the food did finally arrive, it turned out that the kitchen had forgotten to prepare two of the entrees. The traumatized seeming waitress apologized and scurried off to try and get the kitchen to prepare the rest of the food. Flash forward twenty minutes later, and she brings *one* more entree to my friend and says \\"OK! Have a nice meal\\" It was at this point that we all realized that she has no idea that I had also still not received my meal. She acted surprised, and then tried to act as if I hadn't actually ordered anything. Then when she reviewed her ticket she came to the realization that she had simply forgotten mine altogether. At this point, everyone else was finished with their food, and I was starving and exceedingly cranky. She went back to the kitchen (Which is exposed to the dining area so everything they are doing at the food window can be seen. Especially when they are dramatically talking about a table that they are unhappy with) and waved her arms about angrily to the female manager in the pink sweater. About ten minute later the waitress finally produced my tepid food, slapped hastily onto a plate. Starving, I didn't bother to point out that they had not included one of my sides, but did ask to speak to the manager. This manager was in no way shape or form prepared to handle an upset customer.

In the first sentence (\\"I mean to go to Baddeck this summer\\"), \\"mean\\" is used as a verb to express an intention or plan. In this context, the speaker is saying that they have the intention or plan to go to Baddeck during the summer. The meaning of \\"mean\\" here is related to having a purpose or intention for a specific action. 2. In the second sentence (\\"I only meant to help you\\"), \\"mean\\" is also used as a verb; however, it conveys a different sense. In this context, the speaker is indicating that their original intention or purpose for their actions was to be helpful. They might be saying this to clarify their actions, assure the person they are speaking to that their intentions were good, or even to apologize if their actions turned out to be unhelpful or had negative consequences. The meaning of \\"mean\\" in this sentence is related to the intended outcome of an action, rather than a specific plan or intention.

Q: Title: CHEAP DISPOSABLE \\"MUSIC\\" Review: 10 year old kids may enjoy this sort of crap, but people who enjoy real music wont. Is this product review negative? Possible answers: (1). Yes (2). No A:","completion":"Based on the wording and tone of the product review, it is evident that the reviewer has a strong negative opinion towards the music in question. Here's a breakdown of the review to support this conclusion: 1. The reviewer uses all caps when referring to the music as \\"CHEAP DISPOSABLE\\": Capitalizing words in this manner is common in online conversations when a writer wants to emphasize their point or showcase their strong emotions. In this instance, the writer is strongly criticizing the music, implying that it lacks quality and has no lasting value. 2. The term \\"10-year-old kids may enjoy this sort of crap\\" further indicates the negative stance of the reviewer. By referring to the music as \\"crap,\\" they are conveying their assumption that it is of low quality or worth. Additionally, the mention of 10-year-old kids potentially enjoying the music is meant to cast doubt on its sophistication and maturity, suggesting that it only appeals to a juvenile or immature audience. 3. The statement \\"but people who enjoy real music won't\\" drives home the reviewer's negative viewpoint. By contrasting \\"real music\\" with the music in question, they imply that the reviewed music does not meet some standard of quality or substance that genuine music should have.

Sentence 1: A book by Nobuyuki Matsuhisa, \\"The Japanese Foie Gras Project\\", was released in 2007 and contains a presentation by Scott Hallsworth. This sentence implies that the book, released in 2007, includes a presentation created or delivered by Scott Hallsworth. A presentation in this context may refer to a specific section, chapter, or segment of the book authored or contributed by Scott Hallsworth. The term \\"presentation\\" commonly denotes an explanation, display, or a demonstration of something. Sentence 2: A book by Nobuyuki Matsuhisa, \\"The Japanese Foie Gras Project\\", was published in 2007, and contains a forward by Scott Hallsworth. This sentence indicates that the book, published in 2007, features a \\"forward\\" (which should be correctly spelled as \\"foreword\\") written by Scott Hallsworth.

Options: - lubricate - mark territory - kiss - procreation - release tension The answer is \\"lubricate\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer \\"lubricate\\" is the most fitting of the options provided because it is most relevant to the context of copulation. Using spit to lubricate during copulation is a widespread practice that aids in reducing friction and ensuring a more enjoyable and comfortable encounter for both partners. Additionally, the act of copulation implies a focus on sexual activity; thus, using spit to lubricate is the most logical choice among the given options. Before elaborating on the choice of \\"lubricate,\\" it is worth considering the other options presented and why they are not as closely related to the context of copulation: 1. Mark territory: Some animals do use bodily fluids to mark their territory, but this is typically not done through engaging in copulation. The act of marking territory has a broader purpose, emphasizing possession and establishing boundaries as opposed to facilitating a sexual encounter. 2. Kiss: Kissing might be a part of the overall sexual experience, or it may signal affection between two individuals. However, in the given context, the term \\"copulate\\" specifically refers to engaging in sexual intercourse rather than merely expressing affection or initiating intimacy. 3. Procreation: Although copulation often leads to procreation, using spit during copulation focuses on the act of reducing friction and promoting pleasure rather than serving as a direct conduit to impregnation. Procreation generally refers to the broader reproductive process, which is not directly linked to the given context when spit is used. 4. Release tension: While copulation often has an implied goal of releasing tension and generating a pleasurable experience, using spit to release tension is not a direct consequence of the copulation act. Sexual activity often leads to tension release for both partners, but using spit to accomplish this is not inherently linked to the concept of tension relief. In conclusion, using spit to lubricate is the most appropriate answer from the list of options provided, as it caters specifically to the act of copulation and is aimed at promoting an enjoyable and satisfying sexual experience. It is a common practice that has been utilized throughout history. Although the other options might be valid in various situations or contexts, using spit to lubricate corresponds better with the context of copulation and ultimately serves the most coherent purpose."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Loop through the outer list. We need to process each inner list, so we will iterate through the outer list using a loop. Step 2: Loop through the inner list. For each inner list, we need to inspect every integer to determine if it is odd. We will do this using another loop. Step 3: Check if the current integer is odd. An integer is odd if it is not divisible by 2. We can check this by using the modulo operator, i.e., if the integer modulo 2 is equal to 1, it is odd. Step 4: Multiply odd numbers. For each odd number, we will multiply it with the previous product of odd numbers. We will store this product in a variable. We should also initialize the variable to 1, so that the multiplication operation does not affect the result. Step 5: Check if there were no odd numbers in the inner list. When the loop for the inner list is finished, we should check if there were any odd numbers found. If the variable is still equal to 1, there were no odd numbers. In such cases, the output for that inner list should be 0. Step 6: Store the product (or 0 if there were no odd numbers) in the output list. We will append the product of odd numbers (or 0) into the output list. Finally, the resulting output list will be returned.

Relationship between concentrations and effects Drowsiness, dissociative, and psychosis-like effects (e.g., hallucinations, delirium) are reported in patients treated with ketamine starting at circulating concentrations of around 50 to 200 ng/mL (210-841 nM), while analgesia begins at levels of approximately 100 to 200 ng/mL (421-841 nM). The typical intravenous antidepressant dosage of ketamine used to treat depression is low and results in maximal plasma concentrations of 70 to 200 ng/mL (294-841 nM). Circulating concentrations of around 2,000 to 3,000 ng/mL (8,413-12,620 nM) are employed during anesthesia, and patients may start to awaken once levels of ketamine have decreased to about 500 to 1,000 ng/mL (2,103-4,207 nM). There is wide variation in the peak concentrations of ketamine that have been reported in association with anesthesia in the literature, with values ranging from 2,211-3,447 ng/mL (9,300-14,500 nM) to as high as 22,370 ng/mL (94,100 nM). Biological activity concentrations of ketamine are lower than total plasma levels due to plasma protein binding, although plasma protein binding is relatively low with ketamine (approximately 12 to 47% protein-bound).

SLOTNIKJUNE 16, 2014 Frances Foster, a children’s book editor who published authors like Roald Dahl, Peter Sís and Philip Pullman, and who had her own imprint, died on June 8 in Manhattan. She was 83. The cause was complications of a stroke she suffered in 2012, her daughter, Kate Foster-Anderson, said. For nearly 60 years, Ms. Foster worked with publishers like Scribner’s and Knopf before joining Farrar, Straus and Giroux, where she founded Frances Foster Books in 1995. Her imprint published a dozen books annually and is still releasing new titles. She edited “Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator” (1972), a sequel to “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” (1964), and several other titles by Mr. Dahl; published “Rainbow Rhino” (1987), the first book both written and illustrated by Mr. Sís; and published Mr. Pullman’s Sally Lockhart quartet, starting with “The Ruby in the Smoke” (1985). “She had a complete understanding of what I was doing in that book, and her only concern was to help me do it as well as it could be done,” Mr. Pullman told Publisher’s Weekly when Ms. Foster retired in 2013. In 1999, one of Ms. Foster’s authors, Louis Sachar, won the Newbery Medal and the National Book Award for young people’s literature for “Holes” and another, Mr. Sís, won a Caldecott Honor for “Tibet Through the Red Box.” Frances Starbuck was born on June 3, 1931, in Oakland, Calif. She received a bachelor’s degree in English literature from Denison University in 1953. In 1956, she married Orrington C. Foster. In addition to her husband and daughter, she is survived by one son, John; two sisters, Margaret Boykin and Susan Stockton; and five grandchildren. Ms. Foster received an award for her mentorship of writers and editors from the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art in 2012. She later told The School Library Journal that one constant endured in children’s publishing. “We still look for unforgettable stories,” she said.

Movie plot title: The Watch Movie plot: In the town of Glenview, Ohio, Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller) is an active participant in the community and senior manager of the local Costco store. His life is disrupted when the store's night security guard is murdered. The local police have no leads, and show no interest in investigating further. Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker and loving father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental-health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent divorcÃ©. The watch members use the group as an excuse to drink and have fun (much to Evan's annoyance). While driving on patrol, they accidentally hit something. They discover a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly-destructive weapon, and deduce that it is of alien origin. Meanwhile, several more townspeople are mysteriously killed. The watch responds to the murders and encounters an alien, which attacks them. Evan (apparently) kills it with a lawn gnome before the group returns with the creature to Bob's house. The creature regains consciousness and escapes, stealing the metallic orb and warning them that the aliens have already infiltrated the town. The watch theorizes that the aliens are stealing their victims' skin and disguising themselves as humans, so anyone in Glenview could be an alien. Bob confides to Evan that he is worried about his daughter Chelsea (Erin Moriarty), and does not trust her boyfriend Jason (Nicholas Braun). Evan admits that he has been avoiding his wife Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt) because he is infertile, and revealing that it may cause her to leave. Evan suspects that one of his neighbors is an alien (due to his strange, stiff way of speaking and because he always seems to be watching him). As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's...

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Rock solid giallo from a master filmmaker of the genre, Sergio Martino. Fashioned from a marvelous screenplay by Ernesto Gestaldi, this shocking mystery often develops fascinating twists until the terrific finale which most might not see coming throughout the film. It's when everything has fallen into place that we can go, \\"Ahh..\\" The film revolves around the death of a husband(..in an airplane explosion)and the million dollars the wife receives from it. There are those with great interest in that money, one in particular being the dead man's mistress. The wife is Lisa(Ida Galli)and the mistress demanding half the money is Lara(Janine Reynaud). She tells Lisa she knows that the death was arranged by her to get the insurance money. Lara says she'll use her \\"lawyer\\", Sharif(Luis Barboo)to get that money. So already, the film produces two possible suspects in the later murder of Lisa, who awaiting someone in Tokyo. George Hilton portrays Peter Lynch. Peter works for a company that investigates those who gain inheritance to see if the pay day was gathered under suspicious means. When, on his watch, Lisa is killed by a man dressed from head to toe in black in her hotel room, he is a possible suspect. He decides to do a little investigating himself, while also assisting Inspector Stavros(Luigi Pistilli)and Interpol agent, Benton(Tom Felleghy)on their quest to find a killer. The killer strikes several times eliminating anyone revolving around the missing million dollars confiscated by the one responsible for the murder of Lisa. Soon, the film follows a journalist, Cléo Dupont(the delicious, luscious Anita Strindberg)as she and Peter meet for a dinner where she could try and sniff out anything that might break a story for her. Soon they fall deeply in love, but it seems like anyone who is near Peter is killed. Soon someone attacks Cléo with an intent to kill which pushes the investigation further into uncharted territory. Why would anyone wish to harm a journalist with no real facts to damage the one killing off people. This giallo is quite clever and exciting to follow. The film never lulls which is quite remarkable since so much happens leaving open the question of the identity of the killer. This film follows the path of gialli with knife slashings because of a certain pattern the killer has taken(the throat and lower torso). The film's conclusion wraps up all the complex loose ends and is quite satisfying. The film has some unique camera angles, but delivers the goods in terms of driving the plot and the execution of the mystery.","completion":"In this detailed review, the sentiment expressed is predominantly positive. The author praises the film as a \\"rock solid giallo\\" and appreciates the screenplay, mystery, twists, and finale. They also describe the film as \\"clever and exciting to follow\\" and commend its unique camera angles and plot execution.

Answer the following question: What is the full name of the person whose first wife aided in the excavation of the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta? Answer the above question based on the context below: Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL. In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle.

Plot title: Case Closed: Strategy Above the Depths Movie plot: The 9th annual Detective Conan movie sets sail on a 100 million yen luxurious cruise. Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogoro shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a \\"gold medal\\" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area. It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the captain who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogoro, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi. He was originally trying to find evidence to prove her innocence because of her strong resemblance to his wife, but the more investigation he does, the more...

The critic consesnsus is: We Don't Live Here Anymore is often overly moody and grim, but it's made watchable by the strong performances for its four principal actors.. What reviews supported this critic consensus?","completion":"'We Don't Live Here Anymore,' directed by John Curran and written by André Dubus III, is indeed characterized by a moody and grim atmosphere, which has garnered mixed reactions from critics. The film explores the complexities of relationships and the impact of infidelity on two married couples. However, it’s the strong performances of the four principal actors – Mark Ruffalo, Laura Dern, Peter Krause, and Naomi Watts – that have kept it afloat and won appreciation from various reviewers. Here are a few reviews that support the given critic consensus: 1. Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, described the film as \\"a relentless analysis of the mathematics of marital infidelity.\\" Despite criticizing its bleak outlook on marriage and love, he appreciated the actors' performances, saying, \\"The actors play their characters with the intensity of open wounds.\\" 2. A.O. Scott, while reviewing the film for The New York Times, expressed concern over its dour theme and gloomy atmosphere. However, he praised the ensemble cast, saying, \\"The hard, harrowing work of the four main actors is the movie's chief attraction.\\" 3. David Rooney from Variety mirrored the consensus that the film is rather gloomy, almost to the point of becoming a weakness. However, he also shared praise for the actors, stating, \\"The film is distinguished by a clutch of compelling, complex performances.\\" 4. Ann Hornaday, in a Washington Post article, acknowledged the film's somber tone, but also lauded the cast for their intense portrayals: \\"These actors, all of whom turn in superb, piercing performances, make We Don't Live Here Anymore worth seeing, even if the price is an evening of emotional rollercoastering.\\" 5. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone shared similar sentiments, emphasizing how the cast's performances elevated the film. He wrote, \\"The movie is too slow and distanced – but the actors, all terrific, provide the human connection that finally drew me in.\\" While the grim narrative and somewhat despondent atmosphere of 'We Don't Live Here Anymore' were not universally applauded by critics, it's evident that the strong performances of the leading cast were widely praised and considered to be the film's saving grace. Their nuanced portrayals of the characters managed to add depth and keep audiences engaged even in the midst of a melancholy storyline."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The locals warn the group that removing the tablet will end its magic. In present-day New York City, Larry Daley remains the night guard of the American Museum of Natural History. He, Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, Jedediah, Octavius, Rexy the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton and Dexter the capuchin monkey help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. A new wax Neanderthal resembling Larry named Laaa is introduced, identifying Larry as his father. Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet is corroding, which later causes the exhibits to act erratically, causing mayhem at the planetarium's reopening. Afterwards, Larry catches his son Nick, who plans on taking a gap year to sort out his life, throwing a house party. Larry reunites with Cecil, now in retirement, who realizes the end of the tablet's magic will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil explains that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power but that they are located in the British Museum. Larry convinces the museum's curator, Dr. McPhee, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, convinced that McPhee knows its secrets.

Article:","completion":"Title: Former Student Claims Inappropriate Relationship with Teacher Led to Emotional Distress and Property Damage A former high school student, using the pseudonym \\"Mark Smith\\" to protect his true identity, has come forward with allegations that his teacher, Rachelle Heenan, took advantage of him during a series of sexual encounters in 2012. The encounters, which took place at school events, in hotels, and in Heenan's personal vehicle, are said to have resulted in significant mental and emotional trauma for Smith, as well as considerable property damage for the school district. Smith first met Heenan in his senior year of high school, when he enrolled in her forensic science class. At the time, he was preparing to join the Marine Corps one day after his graduation. However, the relationship with Heenan severely impacted both his mental health and his goals for the future. In February 2013, Heenan was indicted for engaging in an improper relationship between an educator and a student. Bobbie Edmonds, Smith's attorney, stated that the relationship significantly damaged him mentally, and caused long-lasting emotional distress. As a result of the trauma sustained during the relationship, Smith reportedly exacted over 24,000 in damages to school district property. This case highlights the importance of raising awareness about the potential for improper relationships between educators and students, as well as the damaging effects of these relationships on all parties involved. School districts must work diligently to detect and address any inappropriate conduct, in order to protect the mental and emotional well-being of their students. Not only do such relationships disrupt the educational process for the vulnerable student, they also place the professional careers of educators at risk. Moreover, improper relationships can result in significant financial implications for school districts, due to the costs associated with property damage and the potential for litigation. As this case illustrates, the consequences of improper relationships between students and teachers can be far-reaching, affecting the lives of individuals and the wider school community. It is essential that school districts prioritize the detection, prevention, and appropriate handling of such relationships to protect the well-being of all involved parties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lighting a match in a dark tunnel would most likely serve the purpose of providing a temporary source of light for the person doing so. In such an environment where visibility is severely limited, having a source of light becomes crucial in order to navigate the space, find a way out, or simply assess the surroundings. The small and controlled flame of a matchstick offers just enough light without posing a significant fire hazard in the enclosed space of a tunnel. While starting a fire, making fire, and heat are related to the act of lighting a match, they would not be the primary purpose in this specific context. In a dark tunnel, the primary concern is visibility, and hence, illumination becomes the priority. Additionally, using a match in an enclosed tunnel to start a fire or for heating purposes would not be practical or safe, given the limited space and poor ventilation. As for frustration, while someone might light a match in a dark tunnel out of irritation or as a coping mechanism, it is less likely that this would be the primary intention, especially compared to the need for illumination in such a setting.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Mohammed Hussein redirects here; for the Muslim cleric, see Muhammad Ahmad Hussein. Babrak Karmal (Dari/Pashto: bbrkh khrml, born Sultan Hussein; 6 January 1929 - 1 or 3 December 1996) was an Afghan politician who was installed as president of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union when they invaded in 1979. Karmal was born in Kamari and educated at Kabul University. Context: When he came to power, Karmal promised an end to executions, the establishment of democratic institutions and free elections, the creation of a constitution, and legalization of alternative political parties. Prisoners incarcerated under the two previous governments would be freed in a general amnesty. He promised the creation of a coalition government which would not espouse socialism. At the same time, he told the Afghan people that he had negotiated with the Soviet Union to give economic, military and political assistance. The mistrust most Afghans felt towards the government was a problem for Karmal. Many still remembered he had said he would protect private capital in 1978--a promise later proven to be a lie. Karmal's three most important promises were the general amnesty of prisoners, the promulgation of the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the adoption of a new flag containing the traditional black, red and green (the flag of Taraki and Amin was red). His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, with the exception of the general amnesty of prisoners, were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others greeted the event with disdain, since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA's sixteenth anniversary. Work on the Fundamental Principles had started under Amin: it guaranteed democratic rights such as freedom of speech, the right to security and life, the right to peaceful association, the right to demonstrate and the right that \\"no one would be accused of crime but in accord with the provisions of law\\" and that the accused had the right to a fair trial. The Fundamental Principles envisaged a democratic state led by the PDPA, the only party then permitted by law. The Revolutionary Council, the organ of supreme power, would convene twice every year. The Revolutionary Council in turn elected a Presidium which would take decisions on behalf of the Revolutionary Council when it was not in session. The Presidium consisted mostly of PDPA Politburo members. The state would safeguard three kinds of property: state, cooperative and private property. The Fundamental Principles said that the state had the right to change the Afghan economy from an economy where man was exploited to an economy were man was free. Another clause stated that the state had the right to take \\"families, both parents and children, under its supervision.\\" While it looked democratic at the outset, the Fundamental Principles was based on contradictions. The Fundamental Principles led to the establishment of two important state organs: the Special Revolutionary Court, a specialized court for crimes against national security and territorial integrity, and the Institute for Legal and Scientific Research and Legislative Affairs, the supreme legislative organ of state, This body could amend and draft laws, and introduce regulations and decrees on behalf of the government. The introduction of more Soviet-style institutions led the Afghan people to distrust the communist government even more. Question: Was he granted amnesty from? Answer:","completion":"Babrak Karmal was not specifically granted amnesty by any external ruling authority or government. As the president of Afghanistan installed by the Soviet Union during their invasion in 1979, Karmal held significant political power which enabled him to make decisions such as granting amnesty to others. Upon assuming power, he promised a general amnesty for prisoners who had been incarcerated under the two previous governments. Out of approximately 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were eventually released, with 600 of these being Parchamites. While Karmal made various promises to the Afghan people upon coming to power, it is essential to note that he was not granted amnesty himself. The question of amnesty concerning Karmal would relate more to the manner in which he granted amnesty to a vast number of prisoners rather than him being a recipient of it."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write some highlights for the following article: A task force has been formed to investigate the disappearance of three girls in the same area of Connecticut 40 years ago. Thirteen-year-old Debra Spickler of Mystic disappeared in 1968, while walking to a swimming pool in Vernon. Janice Pockett was 7 when she was last seen riding her bicycle in nearby Tolland in July 1973. And, 13-year-old Lisa White was last seen walking near a Vernon park on November 1, 1974. Now, more than 40 years later with no leads on any of them, police have decided to reopen the cases - insisting they are 'certain' somebody has information that will solve them. Search: Police have reopened the search into the disappearances of 13-year-olds Debra Spickler (left) and Lisa White (right) who went missing within six years of each other in the same area of Connecticut 40 years ago. Missing: This is a reward poster issued the year Janice Pockett, then aged seven, went missing. 'This is huge, because I truly believe that there is somebody out there who knows something,' said Aprille Falletti of Ellington, who was 10 years old when her sister, Lisa White, disappeared. Vernon Police Lt. William Meier said part of the task force's job will be to determine if the girls' disappearances are linked and if the investigation should be expanded to include other missing persons cases from the area. The task force also will try to solve the mystery surrounding skeletal remains that were found in Vernon last year. The discovery sparked renewed interest in the missing girls before tests determined they belonged to a woman in her 40s or 50s. 'We have to care about our people; we especially have to care about little girls who are lost and their families,' said Chief State's Attorney Kevin Kane. 'We owe it to them to do our best and take another crack at these cases.' The state is offering 150,000 in rewards for the arrest and conviction of anyone responsible for the girls' disappearance. 'Extensive investigations have been conducted already, which include thousands of pages of police reports and supporting documents,' Meier said. 'However, with modern advances in technology and police procedures, we are hoping that a fresh look at these cases will produce new leads.' Never stop looking: Pockett's sister, who is now 47, said there have been many leads over the years. The team is made up of investigators from state and local police and the state attorney's office. Former state police Detective Michael Foley, who investigated one of the cases as a member of the Eastern District Crime Squad, has been hired as a consultant. Pockett's sister, 47-year-old Mary Engelbrecht of Manchester, said there have been many leads over the years, including the confession of a carnival worker, Charles Pierce, who was convicted of killing a 13-year-old girl in Massachusetts in 1969. Pierce, who died in prison in 1999, claimed he had killed several children, including Pockett, but was never charged. A 1980 search of an area where he claimed to have dumped Pockett's body turned up nothing. 'A day doesn't go by when I don't think about my sister and it can be overwhelming sometimes,' Engelbrecht said. 'But I do have hope that her case can be solved and we can get some answers.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","completion":"A task force has been assembled to investigate the disappearance of three young girls who went missing in the same area of Connecticut more than 40 years ago.

Q:Went straight from a facility that deals with homeless children (492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York) to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport about 20 miles away. It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home. I don’t even know the names of those I’m relegated to living with.

Therefore, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. Here is a detailed analysis of each question: 1. \\"After completing A level from NIELIT, is it possible to continue M.CA within 2 years?\\" This question pertains to the completion of an \\"A level\\" from the National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT). The term \\"A level\\" refers to a foundational course in computing and computer science. After completing this course, the individual wishes to know whether it is possible to enroll in and complete a Master of Computer Applications (M.CA) program within two years. 2. \\"I'm attempting the CA final with zero knowledge in 2 months. Is it possible to pass?\\" This question is about attempting the final exams for a Chartered Accountant (CA) qualification with no prior knowledge or experience in the subject, aiming to study for only two months before the exams. The individual wants to know if it is feasible to pass the exams under those conditions. From this analysis, it is clear that the first question focuses on the timeline for completing a Master's degree in Computer Applications, whereas the second question concerns the likelihood of passing the CA final (which is related to accounting and finance) with only a limited amount of study time.

By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass.

Part #3: Determine if the Tail hinders the Head Usage: No, because the Tail does not introduce any hindrances that obstruct the natural path to the achievement of believing every word. In this example, becoming stronger does not hinder the Head (PersonX believing every word), as it does not introduce any obstacles or problems that would prevent PersonX from continuing to believe everything they hear, nor does it obstruct any specific goal being achieved."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Today, home-ownership has reached extremely high levels. Modern generations tend to believe there is something wrong with them if they rent. However, is high home-ownership really as rosy as people imagine? Staring at data first, we realize that the most successful, stable, attractive country in the Western world is Switzerland. It has tiny unemployment; wealth; high happiness and mental-health scores. Does it have high home-ownership rates? Absolutely not. In Switzerland, about seven in ten of the population are renters. Yet, with Europe's lowest home-ownership rate, the nation thrives. Now go to the other end of the misery distribution. Spain has approximately the highest home-ownership rate in Europe (at more than 80%). But one-quarter of its population are unemployed. A likely reason is that high levels of home-ownership mess up the labour market. In a sensibly functioning economy it is easy for people to move around to drop into the vibrant job slots thrown up by technological change. With a high degree of owner-occupation, everything slows. Folk get stuck. Renters can go to new jobs. In that way they do the economy a favour. As Friedman said, the rate of unemployment depends on the flexibility of the housing market. Next we come to economic breakdown. Most analysts accept that at heart it was the housing market--obsessive pursuit of homes, the engendered mortgage lending and an unavoidable house-price crash--that sank the Western world. Germany, say, with its more efficient rental market, had a far smoother ride through trouble. As for the monetary system, in the past few decades, in the hope of getting untaxed capital gains way above their true labour earnings, many people threw their spare cash into buying larger houses or building extra bedrooms. TV programmes about how to make easy money, beautiful rising house prices, and most importantly, our falulty tax system encouraged that. When at some point market broke down, everyone suffered. Our countries ought, instead, to design tax systems that... Question: The cases of Switzerland and Spain prove that _ . Options: A: low home-ownership rate at about 30% is most favourable for economy B: home-ownership mainly decides a country's citizens' mental health.

Topic: Both sentences are fundamentally about the same topic - troops from NATO being killed in Afghanistan. 2. Actors: The main actors, NATO troops, are mentioned directly in both sentences. 3. Event: The primary event, that is, the troops being killed, is also shared by both sentences. However, some details vary the level of similarity: 1. Descriptive details: The first sentence mentions that there were 3 troop casualties, while the second sentence does not specify a number. This noticeable discrepancy prevents the sentences from being entirely similar. 2. Additional Information: The second sentence introduces the idea of an 'insider attack', a detail not mentioned in the first sentence. This suggests that the circumstance or context around the event may differ between the two sentences.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. This is mostly a story about the growing relationship between Jeff Webster(Jimmy Stewart) and Ronda Castle(Ruth Roman). She takes an instant liking to Jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to Skagway, and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder. They find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction. Neither trusts a member of the opposite sex, apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them. Gradually, they learn to trust each other, as they journey from Skagway to Dawson. But Ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff Gannon and engages in some shady practices in her Castle saloon in Skagway. She eventually has to decide between Gannon and Jeff. Meanwhile, Rene, a young naive French woman also takes an immediate liking to Jeff, but only gets insulting brush offs in return. Yet, she sticks with him in his travels from Skagway to Dawson and his activities around Dawson. Along with Ronda, she nurses him back to health after Jeff is left for dead by Gannon's gunslingers at his gold claim. Walter Brennan, as Ben, serves as Jeff's long time sidekick. He doesn't have a meaty role, but serves to soften Jeff's hard edges. His demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for Jeff. John McIntire(as Sheriff Gannon) makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film, oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying. Evidently, he sees something of himself in Jeff, repeatedly declaring that he's going to like him. He makes a believable incarnation of the infamous Soapy Smith, who spent his last years in Skagway, as one of the premier con men of his times. Jeff is the quintessential antihero, a loner(except for companion Ben), who doesn't want to stick his neck out for others, even when he knows he is the one right man for the job. In this respect, he closely resemble's Burt Lancaster's character in \\"Vera Cruz\\", for example. Thus, Jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of Dawson, he is convinced to leave Dawson after Gannon's gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone's insufficiently legal gold claims, while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from Dawson. Even Ronda suggests that she and Jeff make a hurried exit from Dawson while they are still alive. Then, Jeff has a sudden change of heart, apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of Ben and himself. He changes from anti-hero to hero in leading the expulsion of Gannon's gang from Dawson. In this respect, he differs from Lancaster's character, who never reforms(But is Jeff truly changed, or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests?) The main problem I see with the plot is the 2 principle women. Clearly, Ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame Jeff. Although she is clearly characterized as a \\"bad\\" girl, Jeff has a checkered recent past himself, having shot at least 5 men in the US or Yukon, and having stolen his cattle back from Gannon. Ironically, soon after Jeff changes from anti-hero to hero, Rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn Jeff of Gannon's impending ambush. She dies as a result and Jeff asks her why she didn't just look out for herself(his supposedly just abandoned creed!). It's clear that Corine Calvert, as Renee, just doesn't make a credible substitute for the dead Ronda, in Jeff's mind. Yet, the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together, even though Jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug. Her image as a good, if naive, young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in Rhonda's saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust, pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later. I'm also very unclear about her relationship with Rube Morris, a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her.(He's not her father). Another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between Jeff and Gannon's gang. If Gannon had any skill at all with a pistol, he should have killed or seriously wounded Jeff under that boardwalk, before Jeff did the same to him. And how did Jeff's badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease? I also wonder what Jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims. They were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow. And why weren't most of Ronda's pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche? You will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and Gannon's gang. The sequences shot in the Canadian Rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action. All-in-all, a very entertaining western, with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end. No doubt, this film takes some great liberties with history and geography, especially, the part taking place in the Canadian Yukon, which was in fact much tamer than the US Skagway.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the album that became the best-selling double-album of the decade? , can you please find it? During 1995 Corgan wrote about 56 songs, following which the band went into the studio with producers Flood and Alan Moulder to work on what Corgan described as \\"The Wall for Generation X\\", and which became Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, a double album of twenty-eight songs, lasting over two hours (the vinyl version of the album contained three records, two extra songs, and an alternate track listing). The songs were intended to hang together conceptually as a symbol of the cycle of life and death. Praised by Time as \\"the group's most ambitious and accomplished work yet\\", Mellon Collie debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in October 1995. Even more successful than Siamese Dream, it was certified ten times platinum in the United States and became the best-selling double album of the decade.

In a report Sunday, the Pew Internet and American Life Project said 47 percent of U.S. adult Internet users have looked for information about themselves through Google or another search engine. That is more than twice the 22 percent of users who did in 2002, but Pew senior research specialist Mary Madden was surprised the growth wasn't higher. \\"Yes it's doubled, but many Internet users have never done this simple act of plugging their name with search engines,\\" she said. Americans under 50 and those with more education and income were more likely to self-Google because their jobs demand a certain online persona. Meanwhile, Pew found that 53 percent of adult Internet users admit looking up information about someone else, not including celebrities. Often, it's to find someone _ have lost touch with. But looking up information about friends, relatives, colleagues and neighbors also was common. Although men and women equally searched for online information about themselves, women were slightly more likely to look up information about someone they are dating. In many cases, the search is done to find someone's contact information. But a third of those who have conducted searches on others have looked for public records, such as bankruptcies and divorce proceedings. A similar number have searched for someone else's photo. Few Internet users say they Google themselves regularly ---- about three-quarters of self-searchers say they have done so only once or twice.

A:","completion":"Sarajevo, the place known as the birthplace of the footballer Ensar Arifović, is situated along the river known as the Miljacka. Source information tells us that Ensar Arifović, notable for his professional football career, was born in Sarajevo, a city eminent in the south-eastern region of Europe. This vibrant city, rich in culture and history, has played a significant role in the upbringing and early life experiences of Arifović, which presumably influenced his later successes in football. Sarajevo, the capital and largest city of Bosnia and Herzegovina, known for its East-meets-West atmosphere, is located in the heart of the Balkans. Specifically, it is nestled in the Sarajevo valley, primarily along the valley's main geographic feature: the Miljacka River. Surrounding this river, the scenic city of Sarajevo spreads out, offering residents and visitors views over the flowing Miljacka, which is often described as rather short and shallow, but very significant for the city. The Miljacka river originates from a spring in the town of Pale, located southeast of Sarajevo, and descends into the city from the surrounding mountains. It flows westward through the city itself into the Bosna River, eventually reaching the Sava and later the Danube, that eventually flows into the Black sea. It is the Miljacka's central path through Sarajevo that gives the city its distinctive, elongated shape. The river, though not large, is of considerable importance to the city, both in practical terms as a water source and in terms of identity and local significance. The Miljacka River also became the site of a number of notable bridges, including the Latin Bridge near which Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated in 1914, an event that precipitated the First World War. Thus, the birthplace of footballer Ensar Arifović, Sarajevo, is situated along the Miljacka River. Over the years, the river has played a vital backdrop to Sarajevo's historical, cultural, and daily life developments, correspondingly contributing to the overall life narratives of the people residing there, including noted personalities like Ensar Arifović."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Traditional timber framing is the method of creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Using axes, adzes, and draw knives, hand-powered auger drill bits (brace and bit), and laborious woodworking, artisans or farmers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Three basic types of timber frames in English-speaking countries are the box frame, cruck frame, and aisled frame. - Halmstad is a port, university, industrial and recreational city at the mouth of Nissan in the province of Halland on the Swedish west coast.

In this context, it refers to the high cost of gasoline. The Romanian equivalent is \\"Împinși la perete\\". 2. \\"de costul tot mai mare al benzinei\\": \\"by the soaring cost of gasoline\\" characterizes the cause of the drivers' predicament. In Romanian, this phrase is translated as \\"de costul tot mai mare al benzinei\\", using \\"tot mai mare\\" to express the increasing nature of gasoline prices. 3. \\"tot mai mulți șoferi\\": \\"more drivers\\" denotes a growing number of people turning to alternative fuel options. The equivalent phrase in Romanian is \\"tot mai mulți șoferi\\", which translates to \\"more and more drivers\\", emphasizing the increasing trend. 4. \\"își transformă mașinile\\": \\"are converting their cars\\" describes the act of altering vehicles in order to facilitate the use of a different fuel type, in this case, autogas. The Romanian version is \\"își transformă mașinile\\", which keeps the same meaning. 5. \\"pe autogaz\\": \\"to autogas\\" is the type of fuel that drivers are converting their cars to use.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who has thirty-seven individual panels attributed to him with confidence? , can you please find it? Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added. The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\" Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs. Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security. \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\" Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports.

Summarize the following: You will need an undergraduate degree from a university to become a pilot post-military service. It is recommended you get a degree in an aviation-related discipline. Aviation-related degrees include Aviation Maintenance Management, Aeronautical Engineering, and Airline and Airport Management. There are 3 ways to become a commissioned officer. You can join the ROTC program at your school, go to the Navy’s Officer Candidate School or the Officer Training School at the Air Force, or graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy or Air Force Academy. Becoming a commissioned officer does not automatically mean you’ll selected for pilot training. You’ll have to complete other requirements as well. You will have to pass a variety of tests to be chosen for flight training. These exams will test your physical stamina and mental agility. They will also test your knowledge of aviation. You’ll have to know things like the history of aviation, how different planes work, and what to do in an emergency situation. If you’re at least 16 and fluent in English, you’re eligible for the certificate. To begin, submit your application online at the IACRA website. Then, arrange to meet with a certified flight instructor so they can confirm your age and fluency. Once you finish this up, you’ll get a certificate in the mail from the FAA Airman Certification branch in about 3 weeks. Student pilot certificates do not expire, so you only need to do this step once. AME stands for Aviation Medical Examiner. These FAA-approved doctors have a deep understanding of the physiological aspects of flying. Once you sign up for an exam, the AME will ask you about your health history and perform tests on your eyesight, coordination, and hearing. If everything checks out, the AME will certify you as fit to fly. You can search for AME’s in your area by going to the FAA’s website. A first-class certificate is required for airline pilots. If you’re under 40, your certificate remains valid for 1 year. If you’re over 40, you have to renew the certificate every 6 months. The final requirement for getting into flight school through military training is to get a letter of recommendation from a current or previous commanding officer. You can also get a reference letter from a former professor. You can get a reference letter from a former supervisor or manager as well. To offset the shortage of commercial pilots, the Department of Transportation has implemented an accelerated program to help veterans become commercial pilots in a matter of months. Once you have a student pilot certificate, a first-class medical certificate, and a reference letter, you can apply to this program. If you are eligible for the GI Bill and are not already a licensed private pilot, you can do this program for free. If you are not eligible for the GI Bill, you’ll have to pay 13,526 out of pocket. There are 4 schools in the U.S. that offer this program: Leading Edge Aviation in Bend, Oregon; CTI Professional Flight Training in Millington, Tennessee; U.S. Aviation Group in Denton, Texas; and CTI Professional Flight Training in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Spots are limited for this program, so go to the Department of Transportation’s Forces to Flyers website to sign up. Some students have completed this program in as few as 4 months. If you have to relocate, you’ll only need to do so for a few months. Over the course of the program, you’ll mix academic coursework with hands-on experiences to earn multiple certificates and ratings. You’ll get your Private Pilot Certificate, Instrument Rating, Commercial Pilot Certificate, Multi-Engine Rating, Certified Flight Instructor Certificate, and CFI-Instrument Certificate. Once you earn your CFI-Instrument Certificate, you can become a flight instructor. During this time, you can log the flight hours necessary to qualify for an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate and become an airline pilot. Summary:","completion":"To become a pilot post-military service, you will need an undergraduate degree in an aviation-related field and become a commissioned officer through ROTC, Officer Candidate School/Officer Training School, or graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy or Air Force Academy. This doesn't guarantee pilot training, as you must pass various physical, mental, and knowledge-based tests. Obtain a student pilot certificate by applying through the IACRA website and confirming your eligibility with a certified flight instructor. An FAA-approved Aviation Medical Examiner (AME) will assess your health and certify you as fit to fly. A first-class medical certificate is necessary for airline pilots with renewal periods based on your age. Obtain a letter of recommendation from a commanding officer, former professor, or supervisor. The Department of Transportation offers an accelerated Forces to Flyers program for eligible veterans, with costs covered by the GI Bill or out-of-pocket expenses. Four U.S. schools provide this program, with limited spots available. The program can be completed in as few as four months and includes a mix of academic coursework and hands-on experiences to earn multiple certifications. Upon completing the program, you can become a flight instructor and work towards qualifying for an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate to become an airline pilot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. The title overstates the content of this movie somewhat, which might lead to some unrealized expectations. Frankly speaking, there's very little \\"panic in the streets\\" to be seen here. In fact, throughout the movie very few people actually know that there's a murderer on the loose who may well be spreading the plague to everyone and anyone he encounters. Having said that, what we do have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts out reasonably high anyway (because, unlike the people \\"in the streets\\", the viewer knows what's going on) and that director Elia Kazan builds very deliberately. As the plague-infected killer is sought, one of the more interesting sidebars I found was the developing relationship between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and Police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas). At the beginning, the two really don't like each other, even though they have to work together. By the end, they've forged a real bond of respect for each other. Kazan did a good job with that. Pretty much all the performances here were excellent. Widmark and Douglas were great, and I was quite taken with a very early look at Jack Palance playing what would become his typical \\"heavy\\" role. I found very little to criticize here. Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes came across as a little bit flat as Reed's wife Nancy, but her role wasn't really central to the story. All in all, an excellent piece of work. 9/10 Choose your answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Duke was born in New York City, the only child of tobacco and hydroelectric power tycoon James Buchanan Duke and his second wife, Nanaline Holt Inman, widow of Dr. William Patterson Inman. At his death in 1925, the elder Duke's will bequeathed the majority of his estate to his wife and daughter, along with 17 million in two separate clauses of the will, to The Duke Endowment he had created in 1924. The total value of the estate was not disclosed, but was estimated variously at 60 million to 100 million (equivalent to 837 million to 1.395 billion in 2018), the majority culled from J.B. Duke's holds in Lucky Strike cigarettes. Duke spent her early childhood at Duke Farms, her father's 2,700-acre (11 km2) estate in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey. Duke married twice, the first time in 1935 to James H. R. Cromwell, the son of Palm Beach society doyenne Eva Stotesbury. Cromwell, a New Deal advocate like his wife, used her fortune to finance his political career. In 1940 he served several months as U.S. Ambassador to Canada and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The couple had a daughter, Arden, who died one day after her birth. They divorced in 1943. On September 1, 1947, while in Paris, Duke became the third wife of Porfirio Rubirosa, a diplomat from the Dominican Republic. She reportedly paid his second wife, actress Danielle Darrieux, 1 million to agree to an uncontested divorce. Because of her great wealth, Duke's marriage to Rubirosa attracted the attention of the U.S. State Department, which cautioned her against using her money to promote political agenda. Further, there was concern that in the event of her death, a foreign government could gain too much leverage. Therefore, Rubirosa had to sign a pre-nuptial agreement; during the marriage, though, she gave Rubirosa several million dollars in gifts, including a stable of polo ponies, sports cars, a converted B-25 bomber, and, in the divorce settlement, a 17th-century house in Paris. One of Doris Duke's best friends was Brazilian socialite and \\"jetsetter\\" Aimee de Heeren. She reportedly had numerous affairs, with, among others, Duke Kahanamoku, Errol Flynn, Alec Cunningham-Reid, General George S. Patton, Joe Castro, and Louis Bromfield. Duke posted a bail of 5,000,000 for her friend, former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos after the latter was arrested for racketeering.

Protestantism In the late 1130s, Arnold of Brescia, an Italian canon regular became one of the first theologians to attempt to reform the Roman Catholic Church.

In the early 1170s, Peter Waldo founded the Waldensians. He advocated an interpretation of the Gospel that led to conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church.

The robot, Emma (Leslie Bibb), takes a jack-o'-lantern to blow out the light but her boyfriend, Henry (Tahmoh Penikett), tells her that it's against tradition to un-decorate before midnight. Emma asserts that she wants all the decorations gone before her mother visits the next morning, saying that the yard looks like a crime scene, and blows out the candle.

Question: \\"Who puts out the texts witnesses study in their meetings?\\" Context: \\"Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls, which are typically functional in character, and do not contain religious symbols. Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose \\"territory\\" they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as \\"meetings\\" as scheduled by congregation elders. The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible. The format of the meetings is established by the religion's headquarters, and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide. Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours, typically gathering mid-week (three meetings) and on the weekend (two meetings). Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for \\"family worship\\". Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs (hymns) and brief prayers. Twice each year, Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a \\"circuit\\" gather for a one-day assembly. Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day \\"regional convention\\", usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums. Their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the \\"Lord's Evening Meal\\", or \\"Memorial of Christ's Death\\" on the date of the Jewish Passover.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The texts that Jehovah's Witnesses study in their meetings are provided by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, the publishing arm and main legal entity of the Jehovah's Witnesses organization. This society is responsible for producing and distributing various publications, including religious literature, magazines, and other study materials used by Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide. The Watch Tower Society was officially founded in 1881 by Charles Taze Russell, who wanted to create a structured environment for the study of the Bible. The organization has grown tremendously since then and now operates in multiple countries, producing literature in hundreds of languages. The literature published by the Society is considered authoritative by Jehovah's Witnesses and is believed to provide necessary guidance and understanding of the Bible. In line with their beliefs, Jehovah's Witnesses rely primarily on Watch Tower Society literature when conducting their meetings. This literature generally includes: 1. The Watchtower: A bi-monthly magazine which serves as the primary source of spiritual guidance and interpretation of biblical teachings for Jehovah's Witnesses. Each issue contains study articles, experiences from fellow Witnesses, and other practical information for members. 2. Awake!: A companion magazine to The Watchtower, focused more on secular issues and topics, encouraging readers to examine matters from a biblical perspective. It generally covers social issues, science, health, and family life. 3. Study publications: Books, brochures, and other publications that are specifically designed for deeper study. These cover a wide range of subjects, such as the Bible's prophecies, creation, and principles for Christian living, and are used in congregation meetings as well as personal study. 4. Meeting workbooks: These are prepared by the Watch Tower Society and outline the weekly meeting schedule, providing specific topics and Bible passages for discussion. Congregation members use these workbooks to prepare for the congregation meetings. 5. Digital resources: The Watch Tower Society also provides additional resources, such as videos, audio files, and electronic publications for use during meetings or personal study through their official website, jw.org. The formats and subjects of the meetings held at Kingdom Halls are standardized across the world, which ensures a consistent experience for Jehovah's Witnesses. The Watch Tower Society is central to the religious education and spiritual development of Jehovah's Witnesses, and their literature plays an essential role in connecting individual members with the organization and its teachings. Through systematic study and diligent application of these materials, Jehovah's Witnesses strive to enhance their understanding of the Bible and strengthen their faith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Like many young people in her village, she had been born into a life in which the bond between humans and animals was profound and spiritual. Her best friend was her horse, During, a magnificent creature of pure soul and unyielding loyalty. Fact1: One sunny day, Nicki and During were enjoying a peaceful ride throughout the nearby woods when they suddenly heard the booming crashes of a gun salute, the likes of which they had never experienced before. During, terrified by the sudden explosion of noise, panicked and bolted through the trees, leaving Nicki clinging to her mane and barely able to maintain her grasp while trying to avoid low-hanging branches and other hazards of the forest. Fact2: Little did Nicki know, the gun salute was in honor of a proposal made to her by the wealthy and influential Cecilia, who sought to marry Nicki in exchange for hers and her family's noble title. The marriage would take place in a grand ceremony that would not only alleviate her family's financial troubles but also elevate them to a position of great standing in their community. Word of the proposal had spread throughout the village, and Nicki's father had been approached by Cecilia's family with the potential arrangement. However, before agreeing to the marriage, he wanted to discuss the matter with his daughter first and ensure she was willing. Fact3: But fate had a different plan. On the day of the proposal, Nicki's father, overcome by intuition that this marriage was not right for his beloved daughter, rushed to the church to prevent it at the last moment. As the village gathered to witness the union of the two families, he stood before the congregation and called out, \\"Cecilia, I cannot allow you to marry my daughter! We are grateful for your offer, but it is not destined to be.\\" Fact4: Unknown to Nicki's father, a dangerous and jealous man named Schani had been lurking in the shadows, having eavesdropped on his secret conversations with his daughter's would-be betrothed. Determined to take matters into his own hands, Schani, a rejected suitor who now saw his opportunity to take revenge, had concealed a gun within the folds of his coat. Bent on a sinister plot to murder Nicki, he made his way to the church with the seething rage and bitterness of unrequited love. As Nicki's father confronted Cecilia, Schani saw his chance and crept closer, his gun trained on his innocent victim. His trembling finger hovered over the trigger, ready to make the deadly shot that would bring his twisted plans to fruition. Fact5: However, in the world of interconnected hearts and souls, miracles could happen as well; as destiny intervened, a beautiful, kindhearted, and intuitive woman named Mitzi approached Schani. Somehow aware of his sinister intentions, she sought to save Nicki from harm. With her angelic presence, she calmly stepped before Schani and implored him, \\"You do not want to do this, Schani.

In October 1933 Einstein returned to the U.S. and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study (in Princeton, New Jersey), noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany. At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quota which lasted until the late 1940s. Einstein was still undecided on his future. He had offers from several European universities, including Oxford where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933, however in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship. Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955. He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being John von Neumann and Kurt Godel) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Godel. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.

Answer:","completion":"Gong Ji-chul, also known as Gong Yoo, is a renowned South Korean actor who has played various roles in numerous films and television series. He starred in a sensitive and eye-opening film called \\"Silenced\\" (도가니), also known as \\"The Crucible,\\" which took place at the Gwangju Inhwa School for the hearing-impaired. Released in September 2011, the film is a South Korean drama directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk and is based on a novel of the same name by author Gong Ji-young. The novel is inspired by true events that took place at the Gwangju Inhwa School for the hearing-impaired between 1999 and 2005. The story unfolds as a young, idealistic teacher named Kang In-ho, portrayed by Gong Yoo, arrives at the Gwangju Inhwa School to teach newly admitted hearing-impaired students. As he familiarizes himself with the school's environment, he discovers that the students face appalling abuses and human rights violations at the hands of some school staff members and administrators. The school's deaf and mute students are exposed to a brutal cycle of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse that often goes unnoticed or ignored by the outside world. Despite the odds, Kang In-ho decides to collaborate with human rights activist Seo Yoo-jin, played by actress Jung Yu-mi, to collect evidence of these atrocities and bring the perpetrators to justice. As they work tirelessly to expose the truth and to fight against the deeply rooted corruption and power imbalance that allows these abuses to continue, Kang In-ho and Seo Yoo-jin face relentless opposition from school administrators, city officials, and even the legal system. Their fight for justice not only highlights the heart-wrenching plight of the oppressed students but also sheds light on a larger issue of systemic injustice and abuse in society. \\"Silenced\\" powerfully delivered a social commentary on the inadequacies of the legal and educational systems in South Korea responsible for protecting vulnerable members of society. The film garnered widespread acclaim for its thought-provoking narrative, accurate representation of the chilling events that transpired at the Gwangju Inhwa School, and the exceptional performances by its cast. The release of \\"Silenced\\" had a profound influence on public opinion, prompting heated debates and leading to legislative changes to better safeguard the rights and welfare of disabled individuals. Gong Yoo's remarkable portrayal of Kang In-ho remains one of the most impactful roles in his career, and the film stands as a testament to the power of cinema in bringing attention to critical social issues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The opinions expressed are his own. Chinese money is pouring into Western sports. The list of recent or potential deals is dizzying, spanning everything from European soccer clubs to sports rights, agents, and the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The push already merits one trophy: for sheer hogwash. The deals seem to have various drivers. Some reflect the forces powering China’s wider merger boom: cheap capital, confidence, and the desire to diversify abroad. Over that is layered the worldwide infatuation with live sports, as must-see content for which viewers will pay up. Then there’s the idea that China is nearing an athletic boom. President Xi Jinping would like the country to host, and one day win, soccer’s World Cup. He also wants the sports business to be worth 5 trillion yuan (759.76 billion) a year by 2025. Put these factors together and you have a recipe for hyperbole. Bold mergers and acquisitions, almost by definition, are often accompanied by empty talk. Athletes and fans are hardly any better. Political visions complete the near-unbeatable trifecta of hot air. Thus, buying a minority stake in Manchester City becomes a “prime opportunity for furthering the contribution of China to the global football family”, the kind of empty phrase reminiscent of former FIFA boss Sepp Blatter. Meanwhile, Dalian Wanda’s purchase of the IronMan triathlon franchise was about securing “core resources and assets in the global sports industry”. For Xue Feng, boss of Everbright Securities, merely investing in sports rights firm MP & Silva was an “unforgettable experience”. To boot, he says sport has been “one of the ‘hottest’ investments recently” – which rarely makes for high returns. He’s also excited about helping MPS globalise, although that is not the strong suit of most Chinese state-backed firms. By comparison, the hitherto obscure businessman who bought England’s ailing Aston Villa soccer club seems refreshingly straight. “If President Xi likes this sport, I don’t think it is a bad thing that people make efforts to boost the game,” Xia Jiantong told the Wall Street Journal. “To be frank, if investments are not for that reason, it seems strange to me.” As Chinese buyers pile into the global sports business, such honesty is welcome – but likely to remain scarce.","completion":"Chinese money is being invested in Western sports, with deals ranging from European soccer clubs to sports rights and the Ultimate Fighting Championship. This is partly due to China's wider merger boom and the global popularity of live sports, but also because China's President Xi Jinping wants the country to host and win soccer's World Cup and for the sports business to be worth around 760 billion a year by 2025."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Alright, let me explain it to you like you're five years old. 1. Applications of differential geometry in engineering: Differential geometry is like a special way to study shapes and curves. It's very useful in engineering because it helps people understand how things bend, twist, and change. Here are some examples: a) Cars and airplanes: Differential geometry helps engineers to design better parts for vehicles by studying their shapes and curves. They can figure out how to make them stronger and lighter. b) Robots: When building robots, engineers need to know how their parts move, so they can control them. Differential geometry helps in understanding the movement and the overall shape of robotic parts. 2. Applications of differential geometry to linguistics: Linguistics is the study of languages. It's like exploring how we communicate and understand each other. Now, differential geometry isn't directly related to linguistics, but it can be used in some ways: a) Language structure: Some people use the ideas from differential geometry to study the structure of languages and the way they change over time. This can help in understanding how we learn languages. b) Text analysis: Some mathematicians look for patterns in texts using the concepts of differential geometry. This can help in studying literature, understanding languages, or even in computer programs that handle texts. Lastly, no, the two questions are not the same. The first question is about using differential geometry in engineering, like building things and creating solutions. The second question is about applying it to the study of languages, which is a completely different field."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The first few months of the cats living together proved to be quite challenging for Brie, her boyfriend, and their respective feline companions. The constant hissing and negative energy in the house was concerning, and they knew they had to find a way to alleviate the tension that existed between the two cats. This animosity wasn't just affecting the cats' lives, but the lives of their human companions as well, creating a stressful environment for all who lived there. Brie and her boyfriend decided to research different ways to help the cats get along.

James Marshall \\"Jimi\\" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 - September 18, 1970) was an American rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as \\"arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music\\". Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. At Horace Mann Elementary School in Seattle during the mid-1950s, Hendrix's habit of carrying a broom with him to emulate a guitar gained the attention of the school's social worker. After more than a year of his clinging to a broom like a security blanket, she wrote a letter requesting school funding intended for underprivileged children, insisting that leaving him without a guitar might result in psychological damage. Her efforts failed, and Al refused to buy him a guitar. In 1957, while helping his father with a side-job, Hendrix found a ukulele amongst the garbage that they were removing from an older woman's home. She told him that he could keep the instrument, which had only one string. Learning by ear, he played single notes, following along to Elvis Presley songs, particularly Presley's cover of Leiber and Stoller's \\"Hound Dog\\". By the age of thirty-three, Hendrix's mother Lucille had developed cirrhosis of the liver, and on February 2, 1958, she died when her spleen ruptured. Al refused to take James and Leon to attend their mother's funeral; he instead gave them shots of whiskey and instructed them that was how men were supposed to deal with loss. In 1958, Hendrix completed his studies at Washington Junior High School and began attending, but did not graduate from, Garfield High School. In mid-1958, at age 15, Hendrix acquired his first acoustic guitar, for 5. He earnestly applied himself, playing the instrument for several hours daily, watching others and getting tips from more experienced guitarists, and listening to blues artists such as Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf, and Robert Johnson. The first tune Hendrix learned how to play was \\"Peter Gunn\\", the theme from the television series of the same name. Around that time, Hendrix jammed with boyhood friend Sammy Drain and his keyboard playing brother. In 1959, while attending a concert by Hank Ballard & the Midnighters in Seattle, Hendrix met the group's guitarist Billy Davis. Davis showed him some guitar licks and later got him a short gig with the Midnighters. The two remained friends until Hendrix's death in 1970. Soon after he acquired the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, he could barely be heard over the sound of the group. After about three months, he realized that he needed an electric guitar in order to continue. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band in the Jaffe Room of Seattle's Temple De Hirsch Sinai, but after he did too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When someone stole his guitar after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he ever play any other instruments","completion":"Yes, Hendrix did play other instruments. The quote from the article states, \\"In 1957, while helping his father with a side-job, Hendrix found a ukulele amongst the garbage that they were removing from an older woman's home.

Plot: The movie begins after the events of the original Final Fantasy VII game and the destruction of Meteor. Rufus Shinra, once the powerful president of the Shinra Electric Power Company, was presumed killed during the chaotic battle against Sapphire Weapon. However, unbeknownst to most of the world, Rufus survived the attack and has been lying low, gathering his resources and plotting his comeback. Rufus' perspective of the story unfolds in flashbacks as he recalls his near-death experience, the destruction of his company, and his resolve to rebuild his power base. He watches from the shadows, as the world struggles to find new sources of energy and rebuild after the devastation caused by the Meteor and the Weapons. As the story progresses, a series of unexplained events occur, including mysterious attacks on Mako Reactor remnants and deaths of key figures linked with various factions. AVALANCHE, the eco-terrorist group once responsible for combating Shinra, suspects that their old enemy may still be alive. Led by Barret Wallace, the group reunites to investigate these incidents. Meanwhile, Rufus forms an alliance with a secret society named \\"The Pioneers,\\" made up of former Shinra employees, political leaders, and others who seek to harness the last remaining sources of Mako energy to gain control over the struggling world. The Pioneers work in the shadows, plotting to eliminate opposition and secure the resources they need for their new empire. AVALANCHE, now working closely with a group of sympathetic ex-Shinra employees, discover a link between the mysterious events and the secret society. This connection leads them to uncover Rufus' survival and his involvement in a far-reaching conspiracy to regain power. The two sides begin playing a dangerous game of cat and mouse, attempting to stay one step ahead of each other to ensure their goals are met. As the final confrontation looms, Rufus reveals his true master plan: not just to rule the world with the Mako energy but also to use ancient technology discovered during his recovery period to resurrect Meteor and threaten global catastrophe once again. This time, however, he aims to control Meteor's destructive path, using it to bend the nations of the world to his will. AVALANCHE joins forces with their former enemy, Cloud Strife, and his friends to put an end to Rufus' plan and prevent another worldwide disaster. A climactic battle unfolds between AVALANCHE and The Pioneers, with the fate of the planet hanging in the balance. In the end, after an epic struggle, Rufus and his Pioneers are defeated, and Meteor is averted once again. Rufus, realizing the error in his ways, chooses to sacrifice himself to ensure Meteor's destruction, bringing an end to his ambitions and ensuring the safety of the world. The members of AVALANCHE part ways, understanding that the planet has been saved for now, but knowing that new threats may arise in the future. Resurrection of Rufus Shinra raises questions about the corrupting influence of power, redemption, and the lengths individuals may go to protect their world, weaving a thrilling narrative set in the beloved universe of Final Fantasy VII."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Instructions: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Input: Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been widely studied as a source of primary adult stem cells for cell therapy because of their multidifferentiation potential; however, the growth arrest (also known as \\"premature senescence\\") often found in hMSCs cultured in vitro has been a major obstacle to the in-depth characterization of these cells. In addition, the inability to maintain constant cell growth hampers the development of additional genetic modifications aimed at achieving desired levels of differentiation to specific tissues; however, the molecular mechanisms that govern this phenomenon remain unclear, with the exception of a few studies demonstrating that induction of p16INK4a is responsible for this senescence-like event. Here, we observed that the premature growth arrest in hMSCs occurs in parallel with the induction of p16INK4a, following abrogation of inhibitory phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. These stress responses were concurrent with increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) from mitochondria and increased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity. The introduction of Wip1 (wild-type p53 inducible phosphatase-1), a well-studied stress modulator, significantly lowered p16INK4a expression and led to p38 MAPK inactivation, although it failed to affect the levels of ROSs. Moreover, the suppression of stress responses by Wip1 apparently extended the life span of hMSCs, compared with control conditions, while maintaining their multilineage differentiation potential. Based on these results, we suggest that senescent growth arrest in hMSCs may result from activation of stress signaling pathways and consequent onset of stress responses, due in part to ROS production during prolonged in vitro culture.

The Greenland Sea is often defined as part of the Arctic Ocean, sometimes as part of the Atlantic Ocean. However, definitions of the Arctic Ocean and its seas tend to be imprecise or arbitrary. In general usage the term \\"Arctic Ocean\\" would exclude the Greenland Sea. In oceanographic studies the Greenland Sea is considered part of the Nordic Seas, along with the Norwegian Sea. The Nordic Seas are the main connection between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and, as such, could be of great significance in a possible shutdown of thermohaline circulation. In oceanography the Arctic Ocean and Nordic Seas are often referred to collectively as the \\"Arctic Mediterranean Sea\\", a marginal sea of the Atlantic. - Geologically, a fjord or fiord is a long, narrow inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial erosion. There are many fjords on the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, Chile, Greenland, Iceland, the Kerguelen Islands, New Zealand, Norway, Novaya Zemlya, Labrador, Nunavut, Newfoundland, Scotland, and Washington state. Norway's coastline is estimated at with fjords, but only when fjords are excluded. - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - The Canadian Arctic Archipelago, also known as the Arctic Archipelago, is a group of islands north of the Canadian mainland. - Liverpool Land is a peninsula in eastern Greenland. Geography. The peninsula is bounded by Scoresby Sund in the south, \\"Carlsberg Fjord\\" in the northwest, \\"Kangerterajiva\\" (Hurry Inlet) in the southwest, the Greenland Sea in the east, and Jameson Land in the west. It was named by William Scoresby, who thought that Hurry Inlet had a confluence with Carlsberg Fjord, separating Liverpool Land from Jameson Land. The fjord-rich peninsula is long from Kap Greville in the north to Uunarteq in the south, up to wide, and measures about in area. It is connected to Jameson Land over a length of . - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - The Danish Realm is a realm comprising Denmark proper, The Faroe Islands and Greenland. - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Global warming and climate change are terms for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming. Although the increase of near-surface atmospheric temperature is the measure of global warming often reported in the popular press, most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has gone into the oceans. The rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and atmosphere. Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented over tens to thousands of years. - The Arctic (or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost-containing tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places. - Inuit (pronounced or ; Inuktitut: , \\"the people\\") are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada and Alaska. Inuit is a plural noun; the singular is Inuk. The oral Inuit languages are classified in the Eskimo-Aleut family. Inuit Sign Language is a critically endangered language isolate spoken in Nunavut. - Uunartoq Qeqertaq , Greenlandic for \`\` The Warming Island '' , is an island , that was only acknowledged as such in September 2005 , by an American explorer Dennis Schmitt , off the east central coast of Greenland , 550 km ( 340 mi ) north of the Arctic Circle . It was attached to the mainland of Liverpool Land by glacial ice even in 2002 , when the ice shelves began retreating rapidly in this area , so that by 2005 it was no longer attached to the mainland . Members of the scientific community believe this newly discovered island is a direct result of global warming . The island has three large peninsulas , and thus resembles the letter W. - Jameson Land is a peninsula in eastern Greenland. Geography. Jameson Land is bounded to the southwest by Scoresby Sound (the world's largest fjord), to the northwest by the Stauning Alps, to the north by Scoresby Land, to the northeast by the Fleming Fjord and the Nathorst Fjord of the Greenland Sea, and to the east by Carlsberg Fjord, the smaller Liverpool Land peninsula branching off, and Hurry Inlet. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas.

If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Today there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700, London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid. About 300 years ago, London was starting to get bigger and more and more people began to live there. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people stayed in their homes as much as possible. In 1750,Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called \\"Bow Street Runners\\" because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 \\"Bow Street Runners\\", but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So in 1829 , the first Metropolitan(or London)Police Force was started with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920 all the police in London were men. Today, London police are quite well paid and for the few police officers who still ride horses, the pay is even better than for the others. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. How many police were in london in 1700? 2. What group did Henry Fielding start to stop thieves? 3.

The engines were made by Ford, under licence. The 17,316 workers employed in Ford's purpose-built factory had produced 34,000 engines by the war's end. The facility was designed in two separate sections to minimise the impact of bomb damage on production. The wood-working factory of F. Hills & Sons built more than 800 Percival Proctor aircraft for the RAF between 1940 and 1945, which were flight tested at the nearby Barton Aerodrome. Other companies produced gun bearings, steel tracks for Churchill tanks, munitions, Bailey bridges, and much else. ICI built and operated the first facility in the UK able to produce penicillin in quantity.As an important industrial area, the park suffered from extensive bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of December 1940. On the night of 23 December 1940, the Metropolitan-Vickers aircraft factory in Mosley Road was badly damaged, with the loss of the first 13 MV-built Avro Manchester bombers in final assembly. The new Ford factory producing aircraft engines was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941. Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended.In the December 1940 air raids, stray bombs aiming for Trafford Park landed on Old Trafford football stadium, the nearby home of Manchester United, but this air raid only resulted in minor damage and matches were soon being played at the stadium again. On 11 March 1941, however, stray bombs aimed at Trafford Park fell onto Old Trafford for a second time, causing serious damage to the stadium. It was comprehensively rebuilt after the war and re-opened in 1949, until which time Manchester United played their home games at Maine Road, the stadium of Manchester City in Moss Side.At the outbreak of war in... answer the following question: What stadium did the team who played at Old Trafford have to locate to after their stadium was damaged by stray bombs?","completion":"After their stadium Old Trafford was damaged by stray bombs, Manchester United had to relocate to Maine Road, the stadium of Manchester City in Moss Side."},{"prompt":"Context: Aubrey was turned into stone by a Gorgon.

Article: When I was about eight years old, I decided that I wanted to be a famous film star when I grew up. Well, I'm not a famous film star, but I do work for a film studio, and I do meet famous actors every day. I'm a Foley artist--I make the sounds that are added to films after they have been filmed. Why does this need to be done? Well, if actors are filming a fight scene, you can't expect them to really hit each other or break each other's bones, so Foley artists have to find suitable sound. If you come into my studio and find me throwing wet towels at the wall and breaking carrots in half, don't worry. I'm just recording a fight scene. When my kids were little, they loved our Christmas films because we always needed to record the sound of children walking on snow. It doesn't often snow in California, so I had to create the sound in the studio. I used to cover part of studio floor with salt crystals and pour thick flour over the top. Then I brought my kids and their friends to the studio so that I could record them walking in the \\"snow\\". After the recording, they never wanted to leave; they stayed and played, they got \\"snow\\" in their shoes, on their clothes, even in their hair! These days studios use computers to create such common sounds as footsteps on snow. Some Foley artists see computers as a threat but I welcome the new technology. A lot of \\"everyday\\" sounds used to take a whole day to create, so there was a lot of pressure to get everything done on time. With computers, there's a lot less stress and I can devote more of my time to creating unusual sound effects. As long as people keep coming up with new ideas for films, studios will need Foley artists to come up with the sounds for them. Question: Most modern studios _ . Options: A: spend a lot money on computers B: use a lot of common sound in films C: use computers for everyday sounds D: give Foley artists a lot of new ideas Answer:","completion":"C: use computers for everyday sounds"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
