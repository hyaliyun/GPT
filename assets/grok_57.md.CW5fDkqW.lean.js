West Side Story is a musical with a book by Arthur Laurents, music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and conception and choreography by Jerome Robbins. It was inspired by William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. The story is set in the Upper West Side neighborhood in New York City in the mid 1950s, an ethnic, blue-collar neighborhood (in the early 1960s, much of the neighborhood was cleared in an urban renewal project for the Lincoln Center, which changed the neighborhood's character). The musical explores the rivalry between the Jets and the Sharks, two teenage street gangs of different ethnic backgrounds. The original Australian production opened in October 1960 at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne, before touring to the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney in February 1961. Subsequent Australian national tours have been staged in 1983, 1994 and 2010. In 1961, a tour of Israel, Africa and the Near East was mounted. In February 1962, the West End (H. M. Tennent) production launched a five-month Scandinavian tour opening in Copenhagen, continuing to Oslo, Gothenburg, Stockholm and Helsinki. Robert Jeffrey took over from David Holliday as Tony and Jill Martin played Maria. In 1977, Amor Sin Barreras was produced in Mexico City by Alfonso Rosas Prigo, & Ruben Boido, Direction by Ruben Boido, presented at the Hidalgo Theater. Gualberto Castro played the part of Tony; Maria Medina was Maria, among other cast members was Macaria. From 1982-1984 a tour of South America, Israel and Europe was mounted with talent from New York. The Director/Choreographers for that production were Jay Norman and Lee Theodore, veterans of the original Broadway cast. The Japanese Takarazuka Revue has performed the show twice. It was produced by the Moon Troupe in 1998 and again in 1999 by the Star Troupe. A Hong Kong production was produced in 2000 with Cantonese lyrics, featuring Hong Kong rock star Paul Wong as Tony. It was staged at the outdoor plaza of Hong Kong Cultural Centre. Canada's Stratford Shakespeare Festival performed West Side Story in 1999, starring Tyley Ross as Tony and Ma-Anne Dionisio as Maria, and again in 2009, The Austrian Bregenz Festival presented West Side Story in a German translation by Marcel Prawy in 2003 and 2004, directed by the Francesca Zambello, followed by a German tour. A French language adaptation, translated by Philippe Gobeille, opened in Montreal, Quebec in March 2008. A Philippine version played in 2008 at the Meralco Theatre. It featured Christian Bautista as Tony, Karylle and Joanna Ampil as Maria. Also in 2008, an adaptation played in Portugal, directed by Filipe La Feria, with the name West Side Story - Amor Sem Barreiras, in the Politeama Theater, in Lisbon, with Ricardo Soler as Tony and Lucia Moniz and Anabela splitting the role of Anita. An international tour (2005-2010), directed and choreographed by Joey McKneely played in Tokyo, Paris, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Singapore, Sao Paulo, France, Taiwan, China, Italy, Rotterdam and Madrid. In 2011, a Lima production was produced by \\"Preludio Asociacion Cultural\\" with Marco Zunino as Tony, Rossana Fernandez-Maldonado as Maria, Jesus Neyra as Bernardo, Tati Alcantara as Anita and Joaquin de Orbegoso as Riff.

Stone was known as a thorn in the side of police and an advocate for the little guy. Stone was a Tuskegee Airman and a founder of National Association of Black Journalists.","completion":"Title: A Thorn in the Side of Authority: Remembering Chuck Stone, the Legendary Philadelphia Journalist We commence with a nostalgic note breathed into life by Elmer Smith, cast in remembrance of an icon: Chuck Stone, a legendary Philadelphia journalist, mourned widely upon his death on April 6th. Smith paints the canvas of Stone's life with a vibrant palette of memories, stories, and impressions that vividly capture the essence of a man whose incessant dedication to truth and justice left an indelible mark on journalism and society. Chuck Stone was more than just a journalist. He was a symbol of relentless audacity, known widely as a thorn in the side of police, persistently challenging their practices and holding them accountable for their actions. While this image of Stone might invoke visions of an antagonist for some, it's essential to perceive his motivations accurately. His was not sabotage but a brave endeavor to unveil truths, bring forth transparency, and ensure justice. \\"Advocate for the little guy\\" - this phrase might sound clichéd in the world of journalism, yet Chuck Stone embodied this role like no one else. It wasn’t merely about fighting for justice; it was equally about amplifying the muted voices in society. For those marginalized and shoved in corners, Stone was their vanguard who gave them a voice, their crusader who stood indomitably against the onslaught of authority, their advocate who ceaselessly championed their rights. Chuck Stone's backstory in itself is an inspiring narrative of defying limitations. He was a Tuskegee Airman, serving fearlessly in World War II. As members of the first African-American military aviators in the U.S. Armed Forces, the Tuskegee Airmen not only battled against enemy forces but epochal prejudice and racism. Stone’s service showcased his resilience in the face of adversity, a trait he would bring into his later life as a journalist. His impact, however, is not confined to his journalistic pursuits alone. As a founder of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), Stone was instrumental in amplifying African American voices in the media landscape, thus striking a significant blow against racial bias and discrimination. The organization sought to promote integrity, inclusivity, and cultural diversity in journalism, providing a platform for journalists of color to emerge and thrive, and urging newsrooms across the country to reflect the multicultural reality of America. Stone's dual legacy as a social activist and a committed journalist is a testament to his multifaceted life. His ceaseless dedication towards unearthing truth, uncompromising ethics, and burning desire to serve the voiceless makes him a paragon of journalistic integrity. His influence extends beyond his lifespan, living on in the ethos of the NABJ and the countless lives he touched through his work. Elmer Smith, along with many others, revere and remember Stone, reflecting on his life and contributions. The quintessential Philadelphia journalist who gave power to the powerless, who perpetually sought justice, and who, above all else, was unafraid to be the thorn if it meant the blooming of truth. As mourning transcends into memory, Chuck Stone's legacy remains etched in the annals of journalism, a beacon shining brightly, guiding future journalists towards the path of courageous truth-telling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money. Art historian Christopher Gray mentions three...

Which Paris landmark has 282 steps, and was planned as a monument to the military success of Napoleon I?","completion":"The Paris landmark you are referring to, with 282 steps and planned as a monument to the military success of Napoleon I, is the Arc de Triomphe. The famous monument is located in France's capital city, Paris, at the western end of the Champs-Élysées, right at the center of the Place Charles de Gaulle, which was formerly known as Place de l'Étoile. Napoleon I, or Napoleon Bonaparte, who was the Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the Hundred Days, commissioned the construction of the Arc de Triomphe to commemorate his victories. He ordered its construction after his triumph at the Battle of Austerlitz in December 1805, wanting a majestic archway to glorify his armies and celebrate French military power. The construction of the Arc de Triomphe began in 1806, under the direction of architect Jean-François-Thérèse Chalgrin, who was inspired by the Roman arches celebrating the victories of the Roman Empire. The construction was a lengthy process that lasted for nearly thirty years due to various interruptions. Chalgrin unfortunately passed away in 1811, and the work on the Arc de Triomphe was taken over by other architects, including Jean-Nicolas Huyot, Louis-Robert Goust, and Guillaume-Abel Blouet. The monument was finally completed and inaugurated in 1836, during the reign of King Louis-Philippe, who dedicated it to the memory of the French Armies of the Revolution and the Empire. The Arc de Triomphe stands at 50 meters (164 feet) in height, 45 meters (148 feet) wide, and 22 meters (72 feet) deep, making it the largest triumphal arch in the world. Within its walls are engraved the names of important French victories, generals, and battles, acknowledging the immense sacrifices and accomplishments of the French military. The monument also houses the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a symbolic grave to represent all the unidentified French soldiers who lost their lives during World War I. An eternal flame burns in their memory, emphasizing the nation's gratitude to its fallen heroes. Visitors to the Arc de Triomphe can climb the 282 steps to reach the observation deck at the top. This journey is not only a way to pay homage to Napoleon I and the French military, but also provides a stunning panoramic view of Paris, with sights such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and the Notre-Dame Cathedral visible in the distance. The landmark serves as an enduring reminder of the military prowess and historical achievements of the French nation as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles.

Question: Process: - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the lungs are functioning correctly happens, how will it affect the lungs will oxygenate less blood. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the lungs are not functioning correctly, it will result in the lungs oxygenating less blood. This proposed change can indeed have direct and indirect effects on the respiration process in the human body. Direct effects: 1. Reduced Oxygen Supply: Since the lungs are not functioning at their optimal capacity, the amount of oxygen supplied to the blood will be reduced. This will lead to inadequate oxygen supply to different organs and body tissues, potentially affecting their normal functioning and impairing overall body health. 2. Inefficient Carbon Dioxide Removal: If the lungs are not functioning correctly, they may be less efficient in removing carbon dioxide from the blood. This may result in an accumulation of carbon dioxide, which can cause respiratory acidosis - a condition that occurs when the blood becomes too acidic due to increased levels of carbon dioxide. 3. Shortness of Breath: The reduced ability of the lungs to oxygenate the blood may result in shortness of breath, or dyspnea. The person may feel difficulty in breathing, as the body is not receiving enough oxygen to maintain normal physiological processes. Indirect effects: 1. Compromised Immune System: Inadequate oxygen supply and inefficient removal of carbon dioxide can compromise the overall immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections and diseases. 2. Reduced Physical Performance: If the lungs are not able to oxygenate the blood properly, the person may experience reduced physical performance, muscle fatigue, and weakness. This can limit the ability to perform daily activities and enjoy a good quality of life. 3. Impact on Mental Health: Reduced oxygen supply to the brain can lead to cognitive impairment, decreased concentration, and mental fatigue. This, along with the physical limitations caused by inadequate lung function, can contribute to anxiety, depression, and a decline in overall mental health. 4. Development of Chronic Conditions: If the perturbation is severe and prolonged, it might result in the development of chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or pulmonary fibrosis, which can further reduce the quality of life and life expectancy. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesized to be affecting the lungs' ability to oxygenate blood can have direct and indirect effects on the overall respiratory process. These effects can significantly impact various aspects of an individual's physical and mental health, reducing the quality of life and potentially leading to the development of chronic health conditions. It is crucial to address any issues related to lung function to maintain optimal health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise Key Elements: - \\"treks can be undertaken alone\\" - \\"experienced walkers\\" - \\"watchful eye of local guides\\" Hypothesis Key Elements: - \\"Local guides\\" - \\"assistance\\" - \\"experienced trekkers\\" Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the key elements in the premise and hypothesis. - The relationship between \\"experienced walkers\\" and \\"experienced trekkers\\" is clear, as they refer to the same group of people. - \\"Watchful eye of local guides\\" implies the presence and involvement of local guides in the trekking experience for those who choose not to undertake the treks alone. - \\"Assistance\\" in the hypothesis suggests that the involvement of local guides would be helpful or beneficial to the experienced trekkers. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that treks can be undertaken alone by experienced walkers or under the watchful eye of local guides. This implies that even though experienced walkers are capable of trekking alone, they still have the option to undertake the treks with local guides, who can oversee the trekking experience. This suggests that there is some value or benefit that local guides can provide to experienced trekkers, which is the essence of the hypothesis.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who was rescued and had put on 13 pounds? ? On 13 June walruses attacked and damaged the kayaks, causing another stop for repairs. On 17 June, as they prepared to leave again, Nansen thought he heard a dog bark and went to investigate. He then heard voices, and a few minutes later encountered a human being. It was Frederick Jackson, who had organised his own expedition to Franz Josef Land after being rejected by Nansen, and had based his headquarters at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. Jackson's own account records that his first reaction to this sudden meeting was to assume the figure to be a shipwrecked sailor, perhaps from the expedition's supply ship Windward which was due to call that summer. As he approached, Jackson saw \\"a tall man, wearing a soft felt hat, loosely made, voluminous clothes and long shaggy hair and beard, all reeking with black grease\\". After a moment's awkward hesitation, Jackson recognised his visitor: \\"You are Nansen, aren't you?\\", and received the reply \\"Yes, I am Nansen.\\"Johansen was rescued, and the pair taken to the base at Cape Flora, where they posed for photographs (in one instance re-enacting the Jackson–Nansen meeting) before taking baths and haircuts. Both men seemed in good health, despite their ordeal; Nansen had put on 21 pounds (9.5 kg) in weight since the start of the expedition, and Johansen 13 pounds (5.9 kg). In honour of his rescuer, Nansen named the island where he had wintered \\"Frederick Jackson Island\\". For the next six weeks Nansen had little to do but await the arrival of Windward, worrying that he might have to spend the winter at Cape Flora, and sometimes regretting that he and Johansen had not pressed on to Spitsbergen. Johansen noted in his journal that Nansen had changed from the overbearing personality of the Fram days, and was now subdued and polite, adamant that he would never undertake such a journey again. On 26 July Windward finally arrived; on 7 August, with Nansen and Johansen aboard, she sailed south and on 13 August reached Vardø. A batch of...

Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt.

They learn that she is an award-winning scientist who has recently moved to town to work on a top-secret project. As they dig further, they uncover her participation in psychokinetic research and remote mind control. Kimmy and Dora confront Sarah, who admits that she was drawn to their extraordinary connection, as it could help her advance her research. Sarah had started experimenting with their mental link, unintentionally causing the conflicting visions. Realizing the potential dangers of Sarah's experiments, the twins demand that she cease using their connection for her research. However, Sarah's ambition gets the best of her, and she secretly continues her experiments.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was persuaded to be a British delegate to a conference in Buenos Aires? , can you please find it? In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

The American teacher looked at himself and didn't see anything funny. So he asked her the question again. The girl just smiled but said nothing. The teacher was angry. He didn't know that the girl smiled to cover her embarrassment because she wasn't able to answer the question. In a dining room in Beijing, an Englishman was careless and dropped a plate. The Chinese who had seen this began to laugh. The Englishman felt uncomfortable and even got angry. \\"They are laughing at me,\\" he thought. In fact the Chinese laughed not at the Englishman or his bad luck--whether he is a foreigner or a Chinese.

Q:Information: - Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150) until the Macedonian conquest in 305 BC, although the actual term \\"Pharaoh\\" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until circa 1200 BCE. - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation. - The Nile ( \\"en-Nl\\", \\"an-Nl\\" \\"P(h)iaro\\"; Ancient Egyptian: \\"'p\\" and \\"Iteru\\"; Biblical Hebrew: , \\"Ha-Ye'or\\") is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world, however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America. The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an \\"international\\" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan. - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism. - Geb was the Egyptian god of the Earth and later a member of the Ennead of Heliopolis. He had a snake around his head and was thus also considered the father of snakes. It was believed in ancient Egypt that Geb's laughter created earthquakes and that he allowed crops to grow. - Osiris (alternatively Ausir, Asiri or Ausar, among other spellings), was an Egyptian god, usually identified as the god of the afterlife, the underworld, and the dead, but more appropriately as the god of transition, resurrection, and regeneration. He was classically depicted as a green-skinned man with a pharaoh's beard, partially mummy-wrapped at the legs, wearing a distinctive crown with two large ostrich feathers at either side, and holding a symbolic crook and flail. Osiris was at times considered the oldest son of the earth god Geb, though other sources state his father is the sun-god Ra, and the sky goddess Nut, as well as being brother and husband of Isis, with Horus being considered his posthumously begotten son. He was also associated with the epithet Khenti-Amentiu, meaning \\"Foremost of the Westerners\\", a reference to his kingship in the land of the dead. As ruler of the dead, Osiris was also sometimes called \\"king of the living\\": ancient Egyptians considered the blessed dead \\"the living ones\\". - Menes (probably pronounced *; ) was a pharaoh of the Early Dynastic Period of ancient Egypt credited by classical tradition with having united Upper and Lower Egypt and as the founder of the First Dynasty. - Tefnut is a goddess of moisture, moist air, dew and rain in Ancient Egyptian religion. She is the sister and consort of the air god Shu and the mother of Geb and Nut. - Egyptian mythology is the collection of myths from ancient Egypt, which describe the actions of the Egyptian gods as a means of understanding the world. The beliefs that these myths express are an important part of ancient Egyptian religion. Myths appear frequently in Egyptian writings and art, particularly in short stories and in religious material such as hymns, ritual texts, funerary texts, and temple decoration. These sources rarely contain a complete account of a myth and often describe only brief fragments. - Upper and Lower Egypt also referred to as The Two Lands is a name used for Ancient Egypt. The concept appears in titles of Egyptian Kings and Queens and appears in scenes in temples and tombs. The concept also refers to an innate sense of duality in the Ancient Egyptian culture. - Isis (original Egyptian pronunciation more likely \\"Aset\\" or \\"Iset\\") is a goddess from the polytheistic pantheon of Egypt. She was first worshiped in ancient Egyptian religion, and later her worship spread throughout the Roman Empire and the greater Greco-Roman world. Isis is still widely worshiped by many pagans today in diverse religious contexts; including a number of distinct pagan religions, the modern Goddess movement, and interfaith organizations such as the Fellowship of Isis. - Nephthys or Nebthet was a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion. A member of the Great Ennead of Heliopolis in Egyptian mythology, she was a daughter of Nut and Geb. Nephthys was typically paired with her sister Isis in funerary rites because of their role as protectors of the mummy and the god Osiris and as the sister-wife of Set. - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - The Ennead (meaning \\"group of nine\\") was a group of nine deities in Egyptian mythology. The Ennead were worshipped at Heliopolis and consisted of the god Atum, his children Shu and Tefnut, their children Geb and Nut and their children Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys. - Lower Egypt (\\"\\") is the northernmost region of Egypt: the fertile Nile Delta, between Upper Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea from El Aiyat, south of modern-day Cairo, and Dahshur. - Narmer was an ancient Egyptian king of the Early Dynastic Period. Probably the successor to the Protodynastic kings Scorpion and/or Ka, some consider him the unifier of Egypt and founder of the First Dynasty, and in turn the first king of a unified Egypt. - Hu ( w ) , in ancient Egypt , was the deification of the first word , the word of creation , that Atum was said to have exclaimed upon ejaculating or , alternatively , his self - castration , in his masturbatory act of creating the Ennead . Hu is mentioned already in the Old Kingdom Pyramid texts ( PT 251 , PT 697 ) as companion of the deceased pharaoh . Together with Sia , he was depicted in the retinue of Thoth , with whom he was also occasionally identified . In the Middle Kingdom , all gods participated in Hu and Sia , and were associated with Ptah who created the universe by uttering the word of creation . Hu was depicted in human shape , as a falcon , or as a man with a ram 's head . In the New Kingdom , both Hu and Sia together with Heke , Irer and Sedjem were members of the fourteen creative powers of Amun - Ra . By the time of Ptolemaic Egypt , Hu had merged with Shu ( air ) . - The history of ancient Egypt spans the period from the early prehistoric settlements of the northern Nile valley to the Roman conquest, in 30 BC. The Pharaonic Period is dated from the 32nd century BC, when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified, until the country fell under Macedonian rule, in 332 BC. - Atum, sometimes rendered as Atem or Tem, is an important deity in Egyptian mythology. - The prehistory of Egypt spans the period from earliest human settlement to the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt in c. 3100 BC, starting with the first Pharaoh Narmer (also known as Menes). This Predynastic era is traditionally equivalent to the Neolithic period, beginning c. 6000 BC and including the Protodynastic period (Naqada III).

Answer the following question: Article: When I was a little kid, a father was like the light in the fridge. Every house had one, but no one really knew what either of them did when the door was shut. My dad left the house every morning and always seemed glad to see every one again at night. He opened the jar of pickles when no one else at home could. He was the only one in the house who wasn't afraid to go into the basement by himself. Whenever it rained, he got into the car and brought it around to the door. When anyone was sick, he went out to get the prescription filled. He set mousetraps. He cut back the roses so the thorns wouldn't hurt you when you came to the front door. He oiled my roller skates, and they went faster. When I got my bike, he ran alongside me for at least a thousand miles until I _ . He signed all my report and cards. He took a lot of pictures, but was never in them. He tightened up Mother's sagging clothesline every week or so. I was afraid of everyone else's father, but not my own. Whenever I played house , the mother doll had a lot to do. I never knew what to do with the daddy doll, so I had him say, \\"I'm going off to work now,\\" and threw him under the bed. When I was nine years old, my father didn't get up one morning and go to work, he went to the hospital and died the next day. There were a lot of people in the house who brought all kinds of good food and cakes. We had never had so much company before. He never did anything; I didn't know his leaving would hurt so much. Question: We can infer(;) from the passage that _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"the writer missed her father very much after his death\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"the writer missed her father very much after his death.\\" From the passage, we can infer that the writer had a very close and special relationship with her father. He was a constant presence in her life, and while she may not have understood everything he did, she knew that he was always there to support and protect her and her family. In addition, the father was a crucial part of the household, performing various tasks and responsibilities that made their lives easier and more enjoyable. When the father suddenly passed away, it was a significant and painful loss for the writer and her family, evidenced by the overwhelming amount of company and support they received from others in the form of food and visitations. The writer's statement, \\"He never did anything; I didn't know his leaving would hurt so much,\\" serves to further emphasize the depth of her feelings and how she was unaware of the full extent of her father's impact on her life until he was gone. The sudden void created by her father's death and the realization of his importance in her life led the writer to miss him very much after his passing. From the passage, it is clear that the writer struggled to come to terms with the loss of her father, conveying a sense of longing and sadness about a man who was always there to care for his family."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are it decreases or it increase ): The older a person is, the greater their chance of developing a cardiovascular disease.

The three-year-old son of a missing teacher told investigators that he hasn't seen her since her live-in boyfriend 'kicked mommy's butt and made her cry', it has emerged. The boy was interviewed by investigators looking for his mother, 31-year-old Bianca Tanner, who vanished on June 7 after moving in with her boyfriend, Angelo Smith, in Charlotte, North Carolina. 'Mommy got a spanking with the belt,' the little boy told police during an interview after she vanished, according to warrants shared with WSOCTV. 'Angelo kicked mommy’s butt and made her cry.' He added: 'Angelo is mean to mommy and hurt mommy in the face,' the warrant states. Missing: Bianca Turner, 31, vanished on June 7 after a row with her boyfriend, he told authorities. Smith reported her missing on June 8 - just days before she was about to start a new job with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools - and said they had got into an argument over a text message. He said that, following the row, she left the apartment drunk and carrying a bag with her. On Thursday, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Rodney Monroe said they were now treating the case as a homicide investigation because some witnesses had not been truthful, WSOCTV reported. In addition, Tanner's ex-husband told police they share a joint bank account and said there has been no activity on the debit card linked to the account. Witness: Her three-year-old son told authorities that the boyfriend hit her with a belt and hurt her face. The search warrant added that police are looking for a belt or paddle, cellphones, clothes worn by Tanner during an assault, evidence of blood, hairs and other bodily fluids, the channel reported. During a search, police did find a Dell laptop, a white Apple iPhone, two notebooks, a black zipper pouch with an empty magazine, a Captain Morgan bottle, two torn photographs from the trash inside and a gold-post earring and the back in the trash, the warrant revealed. Detectives added that Smith had began deleting information from his phone before an interview with police, during which they were going to check the device, the warrant said. Smith also had an outstanding warrant for domestic battery out of Arkansas after his then-girlfriend reported that he 'threw her onto the bed and covered her face, both mouth and nose, with his hand, smothering her', investigators said. Apartment: Tanner moved in with her boyfriend to this Charlotte apartment just 2 weeks before she vanished. Search: Investigators say they are treating it as a homicide case but have not yet named any suspects. But Smith has not been named a suspect in the case. Despite police saying they believed she was killed, friends and family are not giving up - and posted fliers around the town and knocked on doors in the search for information. 'It’s just tearing us apart,' her sister, Cerise Richardson, told reporters, the Charlotte Observer reported. 'Every night, her son is crying for her. He wants his mommy.' Tanner had moved to Charlotte in late May from Greensboro, where she taught second grade at Reedy Fork Elementary School. She was also working on a doctoral degree in education administration.

While organizing some paperwork pertaining to real estate cases, she is puzzled when she notices medical records in one of the files.

Here is an article: Mexico City sits on an inland plateau hemmed in by a ring of volcanic peaks. This pollution-trapping topography makes air quality a constant concern for the 23m people who live here. Last week, the country took a decisive step toward improving air quality by enacting a temporary periodic ban on private and federal vehicles in the city. The rule — which will be in effect from 5 April through 30 June — prohibits driving in the city one day each week and one Saturday each month. Hybrid and electric vehicles are exempt from the ban, as are government service vehicles, public transport options and school buses. The rule — which will be in effect from 5 April through 30 June — prohibits driving in the city one day each week and one Saturday each month. The strategy isn't a new one to Mexico; the city has employed variations of the so-called \\"no circulation\\" tactic for close to 30 years. And Mexico City isn't the first urban centre to dabble in car-free living. Paris, a city with some air-pollution challenges of its own, slowed to pedal-powered speed on 27 September last year for an event that was designed to raise awareness for a citizens collective called Paris Sans Voiture (Paris Without Cars), itself inspired by the popular Car-Free Sundays in Brussels. But Mexico City's ban is more than an awareness-raiser; the ban was enacted with the direct aim of mitigating air pollution. Last month, the city sank into a deep brown haze of smog when pollution levels, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Quality Index scale (see graphic below), passed the 200 mark, prompting officials to issue the metropolitan zone's first air-pollution alert in 11 years. The city ordered some 1.1m of the area's 4.7m cars — and close to half a million of them in the city centre — off the streets and offered free bus and subway rides as a further incentive to leave cars parked. Mexico City's temporary vehicle ban and events like those in Paris and Brussels raise questions about the best ways to improve urban air quality. India, whose urban dwellers breathe some of the world's dirtiest air, has tried a variety of solutions — not the least of which was a decision in 1998 to switch smog-shrouded Delhi's 1,600 city buses and 25,000 auto-rickshaws from diesel to cleaner compressed natural gas. Last year, Delhi officials unveiled a plan that would allow vehicles with licence plates ending in odd and even numbers to operate only on alternate days — this following a decision to ban diesel vehicles older than 10 years. And earlier this year, in an effort to curb congestion (and, by extension, cut pollution) by discouraging car-ownership, the Indian government instituted a 4% sales tax on new-car purchases. Notoriously smoggy Beijing also has experience with modulating roadway congestion to clean the air. The city instituted alternate-day rules in advance of the 2008 Olympic games and before last year's globally publicised Victory Day military parade. Both efforts produced dramatic, if short-lived, results — the Victory Day event's dazzling skies earned the nickname \\"parade blue\\". The day after, the vehicle-use restrictions were lifted and the blue faded back to gray. And then there is London's oft-derided congestion charge, instituted in 2003. The charge (presently £11.50, up from £5 in 2003) has yielded billions of pounds of revenue (a good portion of which has gone toward public-transport and infrastructure improvements), but it has also had a measurable effect on air quality. Within a year of congestion-charge implementation, Transport for London reported that nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and particulate matter levels fell by more than 13%. For now, Mexico City — named by the United Nations as the most polluted city on the planet in 1992 as its AQI number touched 398 — can look forward to the late-June start of the region's rainy season, when daily showers will help scrub the atmosphere of ground-level ozone and airborne particulates.

Suddenly, thousands of unidentified ships appear and open fire. The Earth fleet's (EDF) warships counterattack, but are quickly overwhelmed. Blue Noah is damaged critically. On one of the failing support ships, Captain Yuki Mori Kodai, wife of the protagonist Susumu Kodai, orders her ship to do an emergency warp, but for some reason, she vanishes mysteriously after the warp.

Context: It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour.

Golden algae are found in both freshwater and marine environments, where they form a major part of the plankton community. The brown algae are primarily marine, multicellular organisms that are known colloquially as seaweeds. Giant kelps are a type of brown algae. Some brown algae have evolved specialized tissues that resemble terrestrial plants, with root-like holdfasts, stem-like stipes, and leaf-like blades that are capable of photosynthesis. The stipes of giant kelps are enormous, extending in some cases for 60 meters. A variety of algal life cycles exists, but the most complex is alternation of generations, in which both haploid and diploid stages involve multicellularity. Compare this life cycle to that of humans, for instance. Haploid gametes produced by meiosis (sperm and egg) combine in fertilization to generate a diploid zygote that undergoes many rounds of mitosis to produce a multicellular embryo and then a fetus. However, the individual sperm and egg themselves never become multicellular beings. Terrestrial plants also have evolved alternation of generations. In the brown algae genus Laminaria, haploid spores develop into multicellular gametophytes, which produce haploid gametes that combine to produce diploid organisms that then become multicellular organisms with a different structure from the haploid form (Figure 23.19). Certain other organisms perform alternation of generations in which both the haploid and diploid forms look the same.

This Act may be cited as the \`\`Life Patenting Moratorium Act of 1993''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The rapid advances in biotechnology and biomedical research capabilities are creating a wide range of ethical, legal, economic, environmental, international and social issues, including concerns about the patenting of life forms, eugenics, genetic discrimination, conflicts of interest for biomedical researchers, and genetic privacy considerations in insurance and employment. (2) Prominent members of the scientific community are discussing the possibility of the permanent alteration of the genetic code of human beings (referred to as \`\`germ-line research''), yet Congress has not yet addressed the ethical, legal, economic, environmental, evolutionary, international and social implications of such experimentation. (3) The National Institutes of Health has already proposed patenting over 2,000 human gene sequences, an issue which raises unique and unprecedented ethical, legal, economic and social questions. (4) Prior to the Patent and Trademark Office policy of patenting animals, established on April 7, 1987, no animal had ever been patented under the patent laws of the United States. (5) Over 150 animal patents are presently pending and three more were granted by the Patent and Trademark Office of the Department of Commerce in December of 1992, in spite of the undetermined ethical implications of such patents. (6) Congress may act to significantly restrict or alter the Patent and Trademark Office policy of patenting animals and human genes. (7) The Office of Technology Assessment will complete a comprehensive review of these issues, and the Congress is prepared to schedule hearings and debate on this issue in the spring of 1993. SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON THE ISSUANCE OF PATENTS. (a) In General.--Chapter 10 of part II of title 35, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new section: \`\`Sec. 106. Prohibition on Patentability of Certain Biomedical Inventions or Processes \`\`(a) In General.--No human being, human organ, organ subpart (genetically engineered or otherwise) or genetically engineered animal shall be considered patentable subject matter under this title. \`\`(b) Suspension.--Except as otherwise provided in section, during the 2-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this section, no-- \`\`(1) human tissue, fluid, cell, gene or gene sequence (genetically engineered or otherwise); or \`\`(2) animal or animal organism (genetically engineered or otherwise); shall be considered patentable subject matter under this title. The prohibition under this section may continue after such 2-year period pursuant to section 381(f) of the Public Health Service Act. \`\`(c) Exception.--Subsection (b) shall not apply to patents issued prior to the date of enactment of this section. \`\`(d) Patent Status of Others.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with respect to those individuals who have applied or will apply for a patent to which this section applies, this section shall not be construed to detrimentally affect the rights of such individuals, but rather to maintain such rights until the expiration of the 2-year period described in subsection (b). \`\`(e) Definitions.--As used in this section, the term \`genetically engineered' means the formation of new combinations of genetic material by the insertion of nucleic acid molecules into the host organism's somatic or germ-line cells so as to allow the incorporation of the new genetic material into the genetic material of the host organism.''. (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 10 of part II of title 35, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following: \`\`106. Prohibition on patentability of certain biomedical inventions or processes.''. SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS. It is the sense of the Congress that-- (1) mindful of the dangers inherent in the uncontrolled patenting and proliferation of genetic material, including problems in the areas of patenting of life, eugenics, genetic discrimination, unexpected and reproducible mutations, conflicts of interest for biomedical researchers, and genetic privacy considerations in insurance and employment, but aware of the urgent need of humanity to reap the benefits of responsibly-conducted research and innovation, legislation addressing the implications of genetic research should be thoroughly studied, considered, debated and passed by the Congress as soon as reasonably possible; and (2) the Department of Commerce, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of State should work with the international community to develop international standards relating to the patenting of genetic information and access to such information. Output:","completion":"Part #1: Generate a summary for the given bill text Usage: This bill proposes the \\"Life Patenting Moratorium Act of 1993\\" which restricts the issuance of patents on human organs, genes, and genetically engineered animals due to ethical concerns. The bill emphasizes the importance of studying the implications of genetic research and calls for the development of international standards relating to the patenting of genetic information. This meets the criteria as it summarizes the main focus of the bill and its objectives. Part #2: Understand the key findings and concerns listed in the bill Usage: The bill raises concerns about ethical, legal, economic, and social issues related to biotechnology and biomedical research, including patenting of life forms, genetic discrimination, conflicts of interest, and genetic privacy considerations in insurance and employment. Furthermore, it touches on the possible permanent alteration of the human genetic code and the National Institutes of Health's proposal of patenting over 2,000 human gene sequences. This meets the criteria because it highlights the main concerns and issues that the bill addresses. Part #3: Explain the restriction on the issuance of patents Usage: The bill amends the United States Code by adding a new section that prohibits patenting human beings, human organs, organ subparts, and genetically engineered animals, and suspends patenting of human tissue, fluid, cells, genes, gene sequences, and animals (engineered or otherwise) for a 2-year period. This meets the criteria as it details the restrictions set forth in the bill. Part #4: Discuss the sense of Congress and international standards Usage: According to the bill, the Congress believes that legislation addressing the implications of genetic research should be carefully studied and debated, and that the Department of Commerce, National Institutes of Health, and the Department of State should work with the international community to develop international standards for patenting genetic information and access to such information. This meets the criteria because it emphasizes the importance of collaboration with international organizations and the suggested approach for dealing with genetic research and information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact, Kelli's zest for life was on full display during her Spanish class on the fateful day when she discussed her aspirations of growing up and the milestones she looked forward to experiencing. Amid the outpour of support and messages of mourning, one theme remained prevalent - Kelli's unfailing kindness and her ability to bring happiness and hope to all who knew her. Her profound impact on the small community was evident as those who had the privilege of knowing her recalled her empathetic spirit, her commitment to helping others and her big dreams for her bright future. The loss of Kelli O'Laughlin serves as a sorrowful reminder that tragedy can strike even in the most unexpected places and circumstances. The devastated community of Chicago's affluent suburbs and all those touched by Kelli's life are left to grapple with the understanding that evil can hide in plain sight, a sobering reality that will continue to haunt this once-idyllic neighborhood. As the case against her alleged murderer unfolds, the hope remains that the O'Laughlin family will find some semblance of peace in the pursuit of justice for their beloved daughter. But the world has been left darker by the extinguishing of Kelli's bright and infectious spirit, whose memory will live on through those who carry it forward, as an unwavering and enduring testament to the power of love, kindness, and a life lived with the intention to make a difference."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini remarked to the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album. Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation \\"from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label. All I know is ... we made a record, everybody was happy with it. A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone\\". While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did. Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author \\"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous [sic] information\\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard. Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.Nirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind). Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement. Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic. The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"All Apologies\\" with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993. Furthermore, a remix of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of In Utero; this remix is also available on the band's 2002 best-of compilation, Nirvana, and is the same mix that appeared on the single....

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?","completion":"This review primarily depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer's language indicates dissatisfaction with the second half of the product, specifically their sentiment about it falling together into 80's radio pop, which they describe as \\"terrible.\\" They even go as far as to advise potential buyers to instead purchase one of the earlier albums, further indicating their negative assessment of the product under review. However, it's worth noting that the review does contain some positive sentiments. It highlights a few songs, such as \\"Public Image,\\" \\"Death Disco,\\" \\"Memories,\\" \\"Careering,\\" and \\"Flowers Of Romance,\\" labeling them as \\"fantastic\\" and \\"classics.\\" This indicates that the reviewer did find redeeming qualities in the product. They also acknowledge \\"This Is Not A Love Song\\" as a \\"good song,\\" suggesting they enjoyed certain aspects of the product. Despite those positive notes, the overall tone of the review is negative. It significantly centers on the disappointment in the product's descent into 80's radio pop and culminates with the advice to go for earlier versions of the songwriter's works instead. So, while the reviewer does appreciate parts of the album, their larger criticisms undeniably paint it in an unflattering light. Ultimately, a balanced review would consider the positive aspects as substantial elements of the product under discussion. However, this reviewer seems to place more emphasis on the negative attributes of the product, thereby overshadowing the commendations they initially extended. Reviews of this nature can significantly influence potential buyers and shape the overall public perception of the product in question. It's important, therefore, for readers to understand the bias in such a review and perhaps seek out additional viewpoints to contextualize this assessment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The tournament took place from June 6th to July 5th, 2015, with the final match being played on July 5th at the BC Place stadium, which was one of the six venues used throughout the competition. The final featured the United States and Japan, both of whom had previously won the Women's World Cup in prior years. The United States had claimed victories in 1991 and 1999, while Japan had won the most recent iteration of the event in 2011. This meeting in the final was a rematch of the 2011 Women's World Cup Final, adding an element of intrigue to the encounter. The 2015 Women's World Cup Final was memorable for a breath-taking offensive performance by the United States. They won the match 5-2, with star player Carli Lloyd scoring a hat-trick within the first 16 minutes of the game, including a remarkable goal from the halfway line. Further goals from Lauren Holiday and Tobin Heath solidified the US victory, while Japan's Yuki Ogimi and an own goal by US defender Julie Johnston accounted for the two Japanese goals. This victory marked the third Women's Football World Cup title for the United States.

Question: What is a term that collectively refers to Northumbrian and Mercian? Is \\"In terms of geography the Northumbrian region lay north of the Humber River; the Mercian lay north of the Thames and South of the Humber River; West Saxon lay south and southwest of the Thames; and the smallest, Kentish region lay southeast of the Thames, a small corner of England.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Although the statement provided offers a brief overview of the geographical locations of these regions, it does not directly answer the question. A term that collectively refers to Northumbrian and Mercian is \\"Anglian.\\" The Anglo-Saxon period in the history of England is marked by the arrival of three main groups of Germanic tribes: the Angles, the Saxons, and the Jutes. These tribes started their migration to the British Isles in the 5th century AD and formed several kingdoms across the lands. An important distinction should be made between the term \\"Anglo-Saxon,\\" which typically refers to the broader cultural and ethnic group that inhabited England, and \\"Anglian,\\" which specifically refers to people and areas associated with the Angles. Northumbria and Mercia were two of the most prominent and powerful kingdoms formed during this period, and both were predominantly Angle in origin. Therefore, using the term \\"Anglian\\" as a collective reference for these kingdoms would be more appropriate. Northumbria was formed by the merger of two smaller Anglian kingdoms, Bernicia and Deira, in the 7th century. It encompassed a vast area stretching from the Humber River in the south to the Firth of Forth in modern-day Scotland. Northumbria became a dominant power in the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy and played a vital role in the 8th and 9th centuries. The Northumbrian culture, art, and language greatly influenced the other regions during this period. Mercia, on the other hand, emerged as a powerful kingdom in the mid-7th century, reaching the height of its power under its most famous king, Offa, in the latter half of the 8th century. Like Northumbria, Mercia was also an Anglian kingdom. It was located between the Thames and Humber Rivers and bordered by other kingdoms, such as East Anglia, Wessex, and Wales. Mercia had numerous rivalries and intermittent alliances with these neighbors. In summary, the term \\"Anglian\\" can be used to collectively refer to Northumbrian and Mercian, as they were both Angle in origin and formed part of the overarching Anglo-Saxon culture in early medieval England. The statement provided describes the geographical locations of these kingdoms but does not specifically address the term that can be used for their collective reference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies.

Background: Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass. Paragraph: John is a nuclear scientist who works at the Fermi lab. Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, both of these questions are inquiring about the same information. They are both asking about the importance of data modeling in the context of database development. Data modeling is a critical component of database development, as it helps developers, business analysts, and other stakeholders to create efficient and effective databases. It refers to the theoretical and analytical process of defining the structure, organization, and relationships among data elements in a database to ensure its accuracy, integrity, and usability. There are several reasons why data modeling is important for database development: 1. Provides a clear understanding of data: Data modeling allows developers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the different types of data and their relationships within the system. This understanding helps them design the database efficiently so that it meets the business requirements and accurately represents the real-world scenario under consideration. 2. Consistency and maintainability: A well-structured data model ensures consistency in data definition and usage across the database, making it easier for developers and administrators to maintain and update the database over time. This consistency also helps reduce the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies as the database grows and evolves. 3. Enhanced performance: A well-designed data model can significantly improve the overall performance of a database system by eliminating redundancies, optimizing storage, and reducing the need for complex queries. This increase in performance directly translates to faster processing times for applications that use the database, enhancing the user experience. 4. Facilitates communication between stakeholders: Data models serve as a common language between database developers, business analysts, designers, and users, enabling them to better communicate their requirements and expectations. This shared understanding helps ensure that the final database meets the needs of all stakeholders and reduces the possibility of miscommunication or misunderstanding. 5. Easier integration: When multiple databases or systems need to be integrated, having a well-defined data model makes it simpler to identify common data elements and map them across the different systems. This seamless integration is vital for organizations to achieve improved efficiency and collaboration. 6. Improved data quality and accuracy: Data modeling enforces data validation and integrity constraints, ensuring that the data stored in the database is accurate and complies with predefined rules. This translates to higher data quality and allows users to make informed decisions and drive improvements based on reliable data. 7. Scalability and flexibility: A robust data model allows for easy scalability and adaptation of the database as the needs of the organization change over time. This includes accommodating new data types, relationships, and rules, as well as the ability to integrate with new systems and technologies. 8. Reduced development time and effort: A well-defined data model can simplify the development process by providing a clear blueprint for developers to follow, with fewer iterations and reduced rework. This translates to shorter development time, lower costs, and quicker time-to-market for database-driven applications. In conclusion, data modeling plays an essential role in the entire database development lifecycle by providing a comprehensive understanding of the data, ensuring consistency and maintainability, improving performance, and promoting communication and collaboration between stakeholders. It contributes to an effective, efficient, and high-quality database system that delivers tangible benefits in terms of cost, user experience, and scalability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

September 20 is National Teeth-loving Day in China. Let's pay attention to the health of our teeth. Teeth problems are common around the world. Most children and young adults have tooth decay . A study which come out on China Health Monthly magazine this year showed that 40.74% of a sample of 1,306 Chinese students under age 15 has decayed teeth. Food that is rich in sugar increases the risk of tooth decay. After you eat, bacteria go crazy over the sugar on your teeth. The bacteria turn sugar into acids that eat away at tooth enamel. This causes holes in your teeth. Another common problem is crooked teeth . When your new teeth begin to grow and the old teeth haven't fallen out, there isn't enough space for the new ones. This causes crooked teeth. Don't worry. Here are some ways to keep your teeth healthy. *Brush at least twice a day in the morning and in the evening. *Learn to use dental floss .

A small group of surviving scientists and doctors â located in Atlanta, Georgia, home of the CDC â work on a cure to save what remains of humanity. To complete their work they need information stored on a computer system in New York City. Pearl Prophet volunteers for the dangerous courier mission and is made into a cyborg through surgical augmentation. Pearl, accompanied by bodyguard Marshall Strat, retrieves the data in New York but is pursued by the vicious Fender Tremolo and his gang of pirates. Fender wants the cure so he can have a monopoly on its production. Strat, badly injured while fighting the pirates, tells Pearl to leave him and find a mercenary, known as a \\"slinger\\", who can escort her to safety. She gets cornered but is saved by a slinger named Gibson Rickenbacker. After she explains her situation, they are overrun by Fender's gang, and Gibson is knocked out by falling debris. Fender demands that she accompany him to Atlanta or die. Fender's gang slaughters a family and steals their boat. They head south for Atlanta via the Intracoastal Waterway with the captive Pearl. Gibson, who had been tracking the pirates, arrives at the scene of slaughter later that night. A shadowy figure attacks him, but he disables her.

A:","completion":"If you're flat-footed, it means that you have little to no arch in your feet. Here's a step-by-step explanation: 1. Understand the term 'flat-footed': Being flat-footed refers to a condition in which the arches of a person's feet are not as pronounced as they typically are in other individuals. This condition is also called fallen arches or pes planus. 2. Differentiate between the types of flat feet: Flat feet can be classified into two types - flexible and rigid. Flexible flat feet have some arch when the foot is off the ground and tend to flatten when weight is put on the foot. On the other hand, rigid flat feet have no arches, regardless of whether the foot is off the ground or not. 3. Identify symptoms and causes: Flat feet can be a result of heredity, obesity, injury, aging, or diseases like arthritis. While some people with flat feet may not experience any discomfort or issues, others may have problems like foot pain, knee pain, or lower back pain due to uneven distribution of body weight. 4. Explore treatment options: If you experience discomfort or pain due to flat feet, you may want to consult a podiatrist or orthopedic specialist. They can suggest proper footwear, orthotic inserts, or even exercises to help improve foot function and alleviate pain. In conclusion, being flat-footed means that you have a lower arch in your feet than others, which can cause discomfort or pain in some cases.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that said Solti is tense at rehearsals? ? In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Lizzie Parry. Twin brothers who suffered a rare condition which meant they shared the same placenta and blood supply, were saved when doctors performed laser surgery in the womb. Nathaniel and Joshua Cavalier had a condition known as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, which resulted in an unequal flow of blood from their mother Verena's placenta. The condition - which can be fatal - was diagnosed when their mother went for a 21-week scan at Southend Hospital. The 32-year-old, from Rayleigh in Essex, was rushed to London's King's College Hospital where she underwent pioneering laser surgery the same day. Verena Cavalier's twin boys Nathaniel and Joshua were born in February after doctors performed life-saving laser surgery on the boys while they were still in the womb. A critical operation - with just a 33 per cent chance of both the twins surviving - was carried out in December. Doctors inserted a camera and fibre optic laser down a tiny endoscope into Verena's womb. The laser then sealed off some of the shared blood vessels to ensure the boys received a more equal supply of blood. The operation was a resounding success and the boys were born on February 12 by Caesarian section at Southend Hospital. Nathaniel weighed 3.12lbs and his brother Joshua weighed in at just 3.1lbs. But if the brothers' start in life was not enough, they have also had to fight blood poisoning and meningitis since their birth. This week Mrs Cavalier and her husband Paul, 41, celebrated their sons' four-month 'birthday'. Language teacher Mrs Cavalier, said they feel very lucky their boys survived. She said: 'I was very lucky because the condition can develop very rapidly and I wasn't due another scan for a week, but my consultant said she would do it early as she was going on holiday.' Doctors at King's College Hospital did an ultrasound to confirm the condition. And just an an hour later Professor Kypros Nicolaides performed the surgery. But because events had moved so quickly, Mrs Cavalier only just had time to call her husband to let him know she was being operated on. She said: 'One minute I was at Southend Hospital and the next I was on the train. Joshua (pictured) and his brother Nathaniel, have also fought blood poisoning and meningitis since they were born on February 12. They were diagnosed with the rare condition twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome when their mother had a 21-week scan at Southend Hospital. Doctors at King's College Hospital in London performed the life-saving surgery on Nathaniel (pictured) and his brother Joshua (pictured right with their mother Mrs Cavalier) 'My husband was at work so I had to make the decisions myself. He got there just as they started the surgery. 'It was an awful decision to have to make, but there was no time to lose. The longer we waited, the higher the chance the babies could die or be brain damaged.' The crucial operation was carried out under a local anaesthetic meaning the expectant mother was fully aware of what was happening to her and her babies. She said: 'They had a camera attached to the laser with a monitor nearby. 'I could see what they were doing. I could see a little hand moving about and I prayed the babies wouldn't move and get caught by the laser. 'It took 45 minutes and then I was sent to recover in a quiet room. Another scan showed the babies were both well and I was allowed to go home.' Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome occurs in twins who share a placenta,. when there is an unequal flow of blood between the two babies. Too much blood in one twin will put a strain on his heart and cause him to produce more urine to get rid of the excess fluid. The other twin will not grow as well and may have little or no amniotic fluid around him. The condition can be serious if it is left untreated. It is rectified using a harmless laser beam, which seals off some of. the blood vessels between babies and makes the blood flow more equal. Despite its success, the couple were left on tenterhooks knowing that the odds were against both boys surviving. Mrs Cavalier, a German and Latin teacher, then had to face a 20 per cent chance of a miscarriage during the following six weeks. She said: 'I had two miscarriages before, so I was convinced I would lose them. 'I went back to work because I didn't want to sit at home and panic.' At 29 weeks her waters broke but she did not go into labour for another two weeks, giving the twins 'vital extra time'. She was also given cortisone in that time to help the babies' lungs develop. Both had to overcome a potentially fatal infection of the stomach and blood poisoning but survived. They then went home on March 9 but had to return to Southend Hospital after catching bacterial meningitis. However, the boys came through once again and now weigh in at 8.3lbs and 6.10lbs respectively - the size that many babies are actually born at. Mrs Cavalier, who also has a daughter, two-year-old Magdalena, added: 'We owe Professor Nicolaides so much. Without him, we wouldn't have our boys. We would have lost them. 'We are really grateful to Southend Hospital neonatal unit as well. They were all wonderful there. 'The boys are four months old now. People ask me how old they are and are very surprised when I tell them.' Professor Nicolaides added: 'The boys were delivered by emergency caesarean section and were quite poorly after they were born. 'I am so pleased they are now both healthy and happy and their parents can enjoy watching them grow up.'

Given the below context: By the reign of Henry VII the cathedral was complete, appearing much as it does today (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit was placed in the nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.Elizabeth I gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailor, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall.

Add about 1 tablespoon of lard to the flour.. [D]. Dump some of the mixture over the oats and stir till it blends. Take a sieve and add in some of the milk..","completion":"[C]. Stir the dry ingredients together thoroughly. Add about 1 tablespoon of lard to the flour. After mixing the flour with the baking powder and salt using the traditional Navajo method of hand measuring, the next step is to stir the dry ingredients together thoroughly, ensuring an even distribution of the baking powder and salt within the flour. This is a crucial step for the consistency of the frybread's texture. Next, add approximately 1 tablespoon of lard to the dry ingredient mix. Lard is a key ingredient in traditional Navajo frybread, as it provides a distinct flavor and helps with achieving the frybread's crisp outer layer and soft, fluffy interior. You can substitute lard with shortening or unsalted butter if desired, although using lard is more authentic to the traditional recipe. Using a fork or a pastry cutter, cut the lard into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This helps to distribute the fat evenly throughout the flour mixture and contributes to the flaky texture of the frybread. Now that the lard has been incorporated into the flour, it is time to add liquid to the mixture. Slowly add 1 cup of warm water to the flour mixture. Begin by pouring only a small amount of water and gently stirring the mixture with a spoon or your hands to start forming a dough. Add small amounts of water, gradually allowing the dough to form, and avoid adding too much water at once to prevent the dough from becoming too soft or sticky. Once the dough has come together, transfer it onto a lightly floured surface and knead it gently for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Be careful not to overwork the dough, as excessive kneading can cause the frybread to become tough and chewy. When the dough is ready, cover it with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for 30 minutes. This allows the gluten in the flour to relax, making the dough easier to work with and resulting in a more tender frybread. After the dough has rested, divide it into smaller, portion-sized balls – about 8 to 12, depending on the desired size of each frybread. Roll out each ball of dough into a circle about ¼-inch thick, making a small hole in the center of each circle to help the dough cook evenly and create the iconic shape of Navajo frybread. Finally, heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully slide the dough circles one at a time into the oil and fry for about 2 minutes per side until they are golden brown and puffed up. Remove the frybread from the oil and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Serve the frybread warm with sweet or savory toppings according to your preference. In conclusion, after mixing the flour with the baking powder and salt, you should thoroughly stir the dry ingredients, add lard, mix, and create a dough with the addition of warm water. After resting, the dough is shaped and fried until golden brown, creating a delicious and traditional Navajo frybread."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid. Which test would need higher temperature, case A or case B? A:","completion":"To determine which test would need a higher temperature, we can analyze the properties of both polar and nonpolar compounds as they change state: Step 1: Understand the properties of polar and nonpolar compounds Polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points due to their dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding, which require more energy to break. Nonpolar compounds, on the other hand, have relatively lower melting and boiling points due to weaker dispersion (London) forces. Step 2: Analyze the state changes in cases A and B In case A, a polar compound is changing from a solid to a liquid state, which requires breaking the relatively strong intermolecular forces. In case B, a nonpolar compound is changing from a solid to a liquid state, in which dispersion forces must be overcome. Step 3: Compare the energy requirements for both cases Since polar compounds have relatively stronger intermolecular forces, it requires more energy (higher temperature) to change their state from solid to liquid compared to nonpolar compounds. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, case A (changing the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid) would need a higher temperature compared to case B (changing the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Pyg and the Miners' tracks and the Watkin Path are routes up which mountain?","completion":"The Pyg Track, Miners' Track, and Watkin Path are three popular routes up Snowdon, the highest peak in Wales. Snowdon is located in Snowdonia National Park in North Wales and is an iconic destination for hikers and mountain enthusiasts. It stands at an elevation of 1,085 meters (3,560 feet) above sea level and is the highest point of the British Isles outside the Scottish Highlands. This majestic mountain is a part of the Snowdon Massif, which includes other summits such as Garnedd Ugain, Crib Goch, and Y Lliwedd. 1. Pyg Track: The Pyg Track is perhaps the most well-known and popular route up Snowdon, as it offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape. It starts at the Pen-y-Pass car park, situated 1,188 feet above sea level. The path covers a distance of approximately 7 miles (11 kilometers) both ways and is considered moderately difficult. Hikers can expect to take around 6 hours to complete the round trip. Along the way, you are greeted with spectacular vistas of nearby peaks and lakes, including Llyn Llydaw and Glaslyn. The track offers a mix of steep sections and relatively flat stretches, making it a popular choice for experienced hikers and first-timers alike. 2. Miners' Track: The Miners' Track is another popular route to the summit of Snowdon that offers an easier approach with a more gradual ascent. Named after the copper and slate miners who once used it, this historical path starts at the same location as the Pyg Track – Pen-y-Pass car park. The Miners' Track covers a total distance of approximately 8 miles (12.9 kilometers) both ways, with a typical hike taking around 6 hours. The trail offers stunning views of Llyn Teyrn, Llyn Llydaw, and Glaslyn lakes, as well as ruins from the old mining industry. As hikers approach the summit, they will join the Pyg Track for the final push to the top. 3. Watkin Path: Established in 1892 by Sir Edward Watkin, a railway entrepreneur, the Watkin Path is the toughest but also one of the most scenic routes up Snowdon. The path starts at the lower altitude of 60 meters (197 feet) above sea level near the village of Nant Gwynant and hence has the most ascent out of all the routes. The trail covers a total distance of around 8 miles (12.9 kilometers) both ways and can take approximately 6 to 7 hours to complete the round trip. It passes through ancient woodlands, waterfalls, and old slate mines, offering spectacular views of the Snowdon Massif and the surrounding valleys. The Watkin Path, known for its historical and geological significance, is a rewarding challenge for experienced hikers due to its steep sections and rough terrain. In conclusion, Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales, is ascended through various routes including the Pyg Track, Miners' Track, and Watkin Path. Each of these routes offers its own unique hiking experience and unparalleled views of the majestic landscape of Snowdonia National Park. Whether you choose the classic Pyg Track, the easier Miners' Track, or the challenging Watkin Path, reaching the summit of Snowdon is an unforgettable experience for all types of hikers and adventure seekers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

From the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style. On the other hand, some regions such as England and Spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops. Regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in the Gothic. During which period did regional differences in Romanesque architecture become even more pronounced?","completion":"During the Gothic period, regional differences in Romanesque architecture became even more pronounced. The Gothic style emerged in the 12th century and continued to evolve until the 16th century, primarily in Europe. Although Gothic architecture followed the Romanesque style, it presented different characteristics, innovative techniques, and regional expressions. The Gothic style was marked by pointed arches, ribbed vaults, flying buttresses, and elaborate tracery, allowing for larger windows and more natural light in the structures compared to the Romanesque period. Stained glass windows, intricate sculptures, and ornate decorations gave rise to an aesthetic that was distinct and easily identifiable with the Gothic architectural style. These differences were affected by various factors, such as the availability of local building materials, regional preferences, political and cultural influences, as well as the interactions between craftsmen, architects, and patrons. As the Gothic style spread across Europe, it developed regional variations that distinguish each area's architecture. In France, the Rayonnant and Flamboyant styles made full use of intricate tracery and soaring verticality. English Gothic architecture gave rise to the Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular substyles, reflecting their unique tastes and preferences in ornamentation. In Italy, Gothic architecture was marked by simpler exterior ornamentation and a higher emphasis on the integration of space and light, with some regions blending Gothic features with Romanesque and Byzantine artistic elements. German Gothic architecture also presented its idiosyncrasies, such as the Hallenkirche or \\"hall church\\" layout that featured nave and aisles of equal height. Spanish Gothic, particularly in the area of Catalonia, produced the unique Catalan Gothic style, characterized by narrower naves, shorter transepts, and a profusion of decorative elements. In essence, the regional differences that were already apparent during the Romanesque period became even more marked as the Gothic style evolved and adapted to local cultures, preferences, and traditions across Europe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Which of the following is not a Libyan revolutionary group: Black Boots, the Central Intelligence Agency, or the Free Officers Movement?\\" Context: \\"Idris' government was increasingly unpopular by the latter 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system in order to take advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup. Although claims have been made that they knew of Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance, stating that they were monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary group.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Out of the given options - Black Boots, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Free Officers Movement - the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is not a Libyan revolutionary group. In the context provided, it is clear that the Libyan society during the 1960s was undergoing significant political turmoil and dissatisfaction with the administration of King Idris. The centralization of the federal system and widespread corruption led to the rise of Arab nationalism and popular protests. This environment fostered the emergence of revolutionary groups, which sought to challenge the existing order. The Black Boots and the Free Officers Movement were both Libyan revolutionary groups. The Black Boots, led by Abdul Aziz Shalhi, was one such group seeking to capitalize on the public dissatisfaction and bring about change in the country. Similarly, the Free Officers Movement was another Libyan revolutionary group, spearheaded by Muammar Gaddafi, who would ultimately seize power in a 1969 coup. On the other hand, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is an American intelligence agency whose primary function is to collect and analyze information about foreign governments, corporations, and individuals to aid the U.S. government in decision-making. Although the CIA was aware of the potential for a coup in Libya during the late 1960s, they are not considered a Libyan revolutionary group. The CIA's monitoring of the situation in Libya and its interest in the possible revolutionary groups like the Black Boots and the Free Officers Movement were in line with its intelligence and national security objectives rather than as an active participant in the revolutionary actions themselves. In conclusion, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is not a Libyan revolutionary group, unlike the Black Boots and the Free Officers Movement, which sought to bring about change within Libya during a period of political instability and public discontent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Steven Spielberg told Barbra that this was \\"the best movie I've seen since 'Citizen Kane'\\". That pretty much says it all - and serves as a dire warning! What are the ingredients for a sure-fire cinematic disaster, and one that will haunt you, never letting you forget the tears of both laughter and pain? The ingredients: Barbra Streisand's face, a musical, feminism, Barbra Streisand's voice, Barbra Streisand directing, and an ultra-corny/idiotic premise. Hollywood is full of egomaniacs, this much we know. In fact, nearly everyone  by definition  has to be an egomaniac in Hollywood. Why would anyone want to act? For the \\"art\\"?!? Well, if you're dumb enough to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared interviews And Streisand has the biggest ego of them all! This is quite an achievement. To be surrounded by narcissistic cretins, and yet to manage to top them all  remarkable. The movie, like all her \\"solo\\" endeavors, is an ego trip straight out of hell. Every scene Streisand is in is automatically ruined. Stillborn. But as it that weren't enough, she sings a whole bunch of Streisandy songs  you know, the kind that enabled the Mariah Careys, the Celine Dions, and the Whitney Hustons of this world to poison our precious air-waves for decades now. Just for that she deserves not one but 100 South Park episodes mocking her. The premise, Streisand dressing up as a man to study to become a rabbi, sounds like a zany ZAZ comedy. Apart from it being a cliché, the obvious problem is that Streisand doesn't look like a woman nor does she look like a man  in fact I'm not even sure she's human. The way she looks in this movie, well it cannot be described in words. E.T. looks like a high-school jock by comparison. She looks more alien than Michael Jackson in the year 2015. She looks HORRIBLE. The songs. They made me shiver. Particularly \\"Papa Can You Hear Me Squeel Like A Demented Female Walrus In Heat?\\" and \\"Tomorrow Night I'll Prepare the Sequel, YENTL 2: THE RETURN OF THE BITCH\\". Did you know that Streisand considered having a nose-job early on in her career, but changed her mind when they told her her voice might change? Can you believe that? She should have done it!

The Mothers of Invention were an American rock band from California that served as the backing musicians for Frank Zappa. Formed in 1964, their work is marked by the use of sonic experimentation, innovative album art, and elaborate live shows. Originally an R&B band called the Soul Giants, the band's first lineup included Ray Collins, David Coronado, Ray Hunt, Roy Estrada and Jimmy Carl Black. Zappa was asked to take over as the guitarist following a fight between Collins and Coronado, the band's original saxophonist/leader. The Soul Giants were formed in 1964. In 1964, Frank Zappa was approached by Ray Collins who asked him to take over as the guitarist following a fight between Collins and the group's original guitarist. Zappa accepted, and convinced the other members that they should play his music to increase the chances of getting a record contract. Original leader David Coronado did not think that the band would be employable if they played original material, and left the band. Zappa soon assumed leadership and the role as co-lead singer, even though he never considered himself a singer. The band was renamed the Mothers, coincidentally on Mother's Day. The group increased their bookings after beginning an association with manager Herb Cohen, while they gradually gained attention on the burgeoning Los Angeles underground music scene. In early 1966, they were spotted by leading record producer Tom Wilson when playing Zappa's \\"Trouble Every Day,\\" a song about the Watts Riots. Wilson had earned acclaim as the producer for singer-songwriter Bob Dylan and the folk-rock act Simon & Garfunkel, and was notable as one of the few African Americans working as a major label pop music producer at this time. Wilson signed the Mothers to the Verve Records division of MGM Records, which had built up a strong reputation in the music industry for its releases of modern jazz recordings in the 1940s and 1950s, but was attempting to diversify into pop and rock audiences. Verve insisted that the band officially rename themselves because \\"Mother\\" in slang terminology was short for \\"motherfucker\\"--a term that apart from its profanity, in a jazz context connotes a very skilled musical instrumentalist.

Press the button on the inside of the car to pop the hood. Then feel for the latch under the popped hood with your hand to get it to go all the way up.;","completion":"Opening the hood of your primary vehicle Considering that the goal is to open the hood of your primary vehicle, it is necessary to first understand that the term \\"primary vehicle\\" can refer to either a car or a motorcycle (or bike, in this case). Both options provided attempt to address the goal by presenting tailored solutions for each type of vehicle. Option A focuses on opening the hood of a bike, while Option B concentrates on executing the same task for a car. I will analyze both options to determine which one makes the most sense in achieving the identified goal. Option A: Press the button on the inside of the bike to pop the hood. Then feel for the latch under the popped hood with your hand to get it to go all the way up. Upon closer examination, Option A seems quite improbable. Bikes, or motorcycles, typically do not have hoods, as they possess a more exposed structure with visible components such as engines and other crucial parts. Unlike cars, there is no need to 'pop a hood' on a motorcycle to gain access to the engine or components for maintenance or inspection. Motorcycles have fuel tanks, however, that may need to be lifted or removed for maintenance purposes. But even then, there is no latch or hood to be found on a motorcycle. Option B: Press the button on the inside of the car to pop the hood. Then feel for the latch under the popped hood with your hand to get it to go all the way up. Option B offers a more viable and sensible solution for the stated goal. Most cars come equipped with hoods that protect and house their engines and other vital components. To access the engine compartment, one usually needs to open the hood, which generally involves releasing a latch or lever inside the car's cabin, near the driver's seat. Once the hood is popped, a secondary latch or hook located at the front side of the hood, underneath, must be released before it can be lifted entirely. After this step, the hood can be propped open, often with the help of a strut or a rod, for easier access to the engine and other components. Given the information outlined above, it is clear that Option B — pressing the button on the inside of the car to pop the hood and feeling for the latch under the popped hood with your hand to get it to go all the way up — is the more sensible approach to accomplish the goal of opening the hood of your primary vehicle. This is because motorcycles typically lack hoods or latches, whereas cars contain both, making Option B a practical and logical solution in this scenario."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While it is possible that tourists enjoyed the fresh mountain air and charming culture, the information provided does not give us enough specifics about the factors that attracted tourists in the early 1960s. To better understand the situation, let us delve into some additional background and context around the tourism growth in Benidorm during the early 1960s. Benidorm, a coastal city in Spain's eastern province of Alicante, is famous for its sunny beaches and vibrant nightlife. Deemed a pioneer of mass tourism in Spain, Benidorm's enormous growth in the early 1960s can be traced back to several key factors. 1. Infrastructure development: In the late 1950s and early 1960s, local authorities began to implement urban planning strategies that strategically accommodated tourism development, which included infrastructural improvements such as road expansions, easier transportation access, and zoning laws that allowed the construction of high-rise buildings. 2. Tourism demand: At that time, there was a significant increase in the number of European tourists seeking affordable sun and beach destinations and Spain's social and political stabilisation after the 1950s contributed to the growth of its tourism industry. 3. Package tours: In the 1960s, with the advent of more affordable international flights and the growth of the package tour industry, tourists from colder northern European countries started flocking to Benidorm for sun, sea, and sand. 4. Marketing efforts: The local government and private sector collaborated to actively promote Benidorm as an ideal all-year-round vacation spot. They launched several targeted advertising and marketing campaigns highlighting Benidorm's stunning beaches, excellent climate, and accessible infrastructure. Now, looking at these contributing factors, it becomes evident that Benidorm experienced a surge in tourism primarily due to its beaches, climate, affordability, and strategic development rather than solely because of its fresh mountain air and charming culture. While it may be true that some visitors appreciated the city's mountainous backdrop and local customs, these factors were not highlighted as the main attractions that drove large-scale tourism in the 1960s. Thus, it is important to be cautious when interpreting the provided premise as evidence for the hypothesis. However, to make a definitive conclusion, further research would need to be conducted to delve deeper into tourists' preferences and motivations during that time period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans. E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals. Known as \\"e-cigarettes,\\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum. While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. \\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA. CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them. The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said. The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \\"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\\" According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Describe some characteristics of e-cigarettes.\\" is \\"Cartridge filled with nicotene\\"?","completion":"Yes, that's right! E-cigarettes are like special battery-operated devices that people use to pretend they are smoking.

A brawl ensues between Toby's gang and another gang, which ends with both sides fleeing just before police arrive. Later that night, Toby's gang goes to a party at Eric's house, and Allison's relationship with Toby as well her other friends Emily and Sam is further revealed. At the end of the party, Allison performs oral sex on her boyfriend. The next day, Allison meets with her father, Stuart, at work to discuss family problems, the awkward conversation revealing the virtually non-existent relationship Allison has with her parents. Afterwards, she and her friends drive downtown into East LA, intent on buying marijuana, eventually encountering Mexican drug dealer Hector and his crew. Toby and Hector make a deal, but Toby believes that Hector did not sell him enough for what he paid, and attempts to confront Hector, who pulls a gun on him, humiliating him in front of his friends. Allison persuades Hector to leave Toby alone. The next night, Allison and her girlfriends return to the location of the drug deal. There, she and her friends once again meet up with Hector and his crew, who invite them to a party at his house.

Kim Dotcom (born Kim Schmitz), the site's founder, along with three other individuals associated with the platform, appeared before a New Zealand court in response to the indictments announced by U.S. authorities. The U.S. Government's case against the individuals behind Megaupload includes allegations of criminal copyright infringement, racketeering, and money laundering. Prosecutors argue that the website facilitated, encouraged, and profited from the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted content. Megaupload's operations have reportedly caused over 500 million in damages to copyright holders. Dotcom's lawyer, Paul Davison, stated that his client vehemently denies the charges, criticizing the U.S. Government for their heavy-handed approach in handling the matter. Davison argued that Dotcom was operating Megaupload legally under the protection of the \\"safe harbor\\" provisions outlined in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which generally shield website operators from liability for their users' actions. However, prosecutors claim that Dotcom and Megaupload went well beyond merely operating a platform where users could share files. They assert that the company actively encouraged and rewarded users for uploading copyrighted material by offering them monetary incentives and other benefits. In response to the arrest of Kim Dotcom in New Zealand, prosecutors are labeling him as an \\"extreme\\" flight risk, arguing that he should not be granted bail. As the founder of Megaupload, Kim Dotcom is a colourful and controversial figure in the tech world. Born in Germany as Kim Schmitz, he later changed his name to Kim Dotcom in honor of the internet boom. Dotcom has a history of convictions and legal troubles, including fraud, embezzlement, and data espionage. Still, he maintains a sizable following of supporters who view him as a champion against censorship and an advocate for freedom of information. Given the high-profile nature of Megaupload, which boasted over 150 million registered users and 50 million daily visits at its peak, the case is drawing international attention. The website's takedown and the ensuing legal battles have ignited fierce debates over copyright law, internet freedom, and the role of government in policing online content. The ongoing Megaupload case raises essential questions about the future of online file-sharing and the responsibilities of website operators. While it remains to be seen what the outcome of this legal battle will be, its impact on the world of technology and online communities is sure to be far-reaching."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The shoot is the building block of lots of wrestling takedowns. The double-leg takedown is essentially a quick shoot in at your opponent's lower body that ends with you wrapping up the legs and dropping to the mat.","completion":"To accomplish a double leg takedown, it requires various steps to follow ensuring that the takedown is carried out effectively and successfully. First, enter into an athletic stance. To start, position yourself a short distance from your opponent. Bending your knees slightly while keeping your back fairly straight is the most advantageous stance. Your arms should be prepared to move swiftly, and one foot - usually your dominant one - should be slightly ahead. Secondly, focus on observation and timing. Watch your opponent and wait for the right moment to attack, usually when the opponent steps forward with the same foot you lead with, this opens an opportunity to do your takedown. Keep in mind to prevent them from realizing you are about to attack. Now comes the shoot. To effectively shoot for a double-leg takedown, lower your level by bending at the knees while maintaining your balance and ankle flexibility. Arms should reach forward as you dive toward the opponent. Next is the penetration step, where you aim for your opponent's lead leg. Imagine a triangle between your opponent's feet and shift your lead leg to the inside of this imagined triangle. This explosive step in close distance between you and your opponent. Your head placement is also crucial in this setup. When you're in position, your head should hit the opponent's chest, on the same side as your lead leg, and your shoulders should be square to their hips. Use the position of your head to guide yourself and create a pushing force against your opponent. Once you've stepped in and shot down low, change your level even further. This is done by dropping your back knee to the ground, ideally just behind where your front knee was when you began. As you drop, extend your arms to target your opponent's knees or the back of their thighs. Then wrap your arms around both of your opponent's legs. It's important to keep a firm grip to control their movement. As you grip, let your extended back leg sweep up and behind you. This is essential for generating the power you need to finish your takedown. The last step is the finish. Drive into your opponent, transferring your weight from your back knee onto your front foot and using your momentum and your grip on your opponent's legs to bring them down to the mat. Twist your hips toward the mat while pulling on your opponent's legs to cause them to lose balance and topple over. Post takedown, you end in a dominant position, generally in your opponent's guard or side control. Maintain control of their legs until you've established a solid top position. It's crucial to remember that the double leg takedown isn't only about strength; it's also about technique, timing, and practice. So make sure to practice these steps regularly in training to embed them into your muscle memory. Lastly, always remember to respect your partner and practice these techniques in a controlled and safe manner. This is a powerful tool in any wrestler's or martial artist’s arsenal and can turn the tide of a match in favor of the one who uses it effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This way, Megan's feelings and response to the gift can be shown, and the story can focus on the emotions she experienced when she received the orchids. Step 3: Justify the choice Option II is the best choice because it puts the spotlight on Megan's reaction to the gift.

Hell, if things went as planned in the coming months, she might in fact own the place. Or some other place if that's what she wanted. If things went as planned, there was no limit to what she could have. She smiled to herself as a crowd of sunburned, middle-aged men broke ranks to let her pass on her way toward Mallory Square. They had no idea who she was, but she liked to think that they could sense her strength and that it intimidated them. Not enough to stop them from staring openly at her chest of course, but what did she expect? They were still men. Duval Street, Key West's main tourist drag, buzzed with early evening activity. The sun had set less than an hour ago, and the throngs moving up from the nightly sunset ritual in Mallory Square now wandered about, trying to choose between the dozens of bars and restaurants vying for their attention. She moved against the general flow and seemed to know exactly where she was going. She knew these streets well and had planned out her route ahead of time. But something bothered her. That nagging feeling in the back of her brain that she'd long ago learned to heed even though it was wrong as often as it was right. You couldn't survive in her world without learning to pay attention to such feelings, and she'd more than survived - she'd prospered beyond the dreams of any young hacker or con artist. Heeding the subliminal warning, she changed plans and stepped out into the crawling Duval Street traffic. A purple taxi honked angrily but she just smiled as she strode across the street and stared intently at a display of cheap, tasteless T-shirts in a storefront window.

Her self-assured demeanor, ability to navigate the streets with ease, and her past achievements in the world of hacking and con artistry showcase her strong belief in her capabilities.

While there is a slight sense of caution given her attention to the subliminal nagging feeling, it does not deter her from moving forward with her plans. Overall, she approaches the situation with the anticipation that, if things go as planned, there will be no limit to what she could have - including potentially owning the place or possessing whatever she desires."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shannon Beador Denies Vicki Gunvalson's Spousal Abuse Allegations Vicki Gunvalson was hurt, so she wanted to hurt Shannon Beador. That was the reasoning the 54-year-old Real Housewives of Orange County star gave for spreading unverified rumors that Shannon’s husband, David Beador, was physically abusive towards Shannon in the past. During Monday’s explosive end to the three-part RHOC reunion, Shannon maintained that Gunvalson was lying and that David “doesn’t beat the s— out of [her].” But Gunvalson bitterly stood by her seemingly false allegations and refused to apologize — even after Shannon clarified the story Gunavlson was using as “proof” of the spousal abuse. Shannon and David had gotten into an argument after she learned about David’s affair, two-and-a-half years prior to the reunion’s taping, Shannon explained. He locked himself in a room and, trying to get to him, Shannon had attempted to barge through the door. In the process, she bruised her right shoulder and her right hip. Earlier in the evening, Shannon said she had also gone out to dinner with David and “either had too much to drink or was slipped something.” She blacked out, and David found her blocks from the bar — with rips on her knees and blood on her pants. “That was the darkest place for me,” Shannon said, showing host Andy Cohen pictures of the bruising. “I charged a door down in one of my darkest moments when I found out my husband had an affair … We went to Hawaii two days later, and I have huge bruises. [But] my husband did not beat me. He had had an affair on me and I was doing my best to bring my family back together.” She also explained a 2003 call she made to police while she and David were having an argument. “It was nothing physical,” Shannon said. “We had a verbal argument — I wanted the argument to end.” After hearing the story, even Gunvalson’s only ally Kelly Dodd sided with Shannon and said that her story made sense. But Gunvalson wouldn’t back down. “That’s a typical classic abusive situation — you deny,” Gunvalson said, telling Shannon “I hope to God you’re not abused. When you called me screaming for your life? I hope it was not true.” “I will never ever condone a man touching a woman,” she added. “Just saw the way your husband speaks to woman. And I know he yells at you and I know it’s physical … I will always look on the right side and the right side is a man will never touch a woman.” The claims sent Shannon flying off the reunion couches in tears. “You are horrible. You need to stop right now.” Shannon said. “I would never stay in a marriage if I were beat up. I would never teach that to my children.” “Most people are going to believe me because I haven’t hid anything about my relationship with David,” she continued. “But what you have done? Now it’s on the show and it’s in the universe, there will be people that will go up to my children and say, ‘Your father beats your mother.’ …That is so damaging.” Heather Dubrow defended Shannon and eloquently pointed out that while Dodd was wrong for repeating the false allegations, it was Gunvalson who should apologize. “It’s like you’ve been waiting to use this,” she told Gunvalson. “Shannon confided in you in a dark moment. And it really speaks to your character that you would recklessly repeat that… I am highly disgusted and disappointed that you would repeat such a disgusting and dark thing. If you didn’t want to bring it out, you never would have mentioned it.” She continued: “You should be kissing Shannon’s ass and begging her for forgiveness. You did lie. Maybe you can think about how what you said affects one other. Take a moment and realize what you have done to Shannon.” RELATED VIDEO: RHOC‘s Shannon Beador Reveals if She’ll Ever Be Able to Repair Friendship With Vicki Gunvalson But Gunvalson wasn’t changing her tune. “[Shannon] should beg me for forgiveness,” she yelled. “She put me through the ringer. She made me out like a con woman and a liar and I didn’t lie. I didn’t go on a cancer scam. And I’m tired of it!” When Shannon returned to the reunion, the conversation pivoted to the false rumors Gunvalson spread about Tamra Judge’s husband Eddie. “It’s a rumor!” Gunvalson said of the claim that Eddie is gay. “I never said it was true… How would I know if it’s true or not? We’ve never talked about it.” “Then you don’t spread it!” Tamra said of the lies, which discredited her and Eddie’s marriage. “Stop spreading rumors about people! And then you wouldn’t be in this s—.” By episode’s end, Gunvalson had apologized for spreading the gossip about Shannon and Tamra to Dodd — but not for the words themselves or for her claim that Shannon had been abused. “I made a mistake,” she said. “I told her how hurt I was by [them]. Of course I was wrong.” For Shannon, the damage was done. “My family is hurt from this,” she said. “It’s a problem. Spousal abuse is a very serious allegation.” “You have made an allegation that is a lie — something that someone goes to jail for,” she told Gunvalson. “You are despicable. I will never, ever speak to you again.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"In this article, Shannon Beador denies Vicki Gunvalson's allegations of spousal abuse by her husband, David Beador, on the Real Housewives of Orange County (RHOC).

Does it follow that \\"A joke is generally defined as following no chain of logic and ending in a predictable way.\\"?","completion":"No, it does not follow that \\"A joke is generally defined as following no chain of logic and ending in a predictable way.\\" In fact, this statement contradicts the original definition of a joke. As mentioned earlier, a joke sets up a chain of logic and subverts it in a surprising and delightful way, leading to the punch line. The key components of a joke are the setup, the chain of logic, and the punch line. Let's break down each component to further understand the structure of a joke: 1. The setup: This is the opening part of the joke, usually presented as a situation, a statement, or a question. The setup introduces the context of the joke and builds a sense of anticipation in the audience. It is designed to make the listeners or readers pay attention and create an expectation that something humorous is coming. 2. The chain of logic: After the setup, a joke follows a chain of logic that the audience can understand or relate to. The chain of logic is crucial as it grounds the joke into a believable situation or context. Moreover, the chain of logic is what allows the punch line to have an impact, as it heavily relies on the subversion of the expected outcome set by the logical chain. 3. The punch line: The punch line subverts the chain of logic that has been established in the setup and the subsequent context. It is the surprising and delightful twist that creates the humor in the joke. Rather than being predictable, a well-crafted punch line is often unexpected, and that is what makes the joke funny. Thus, a joke does follow a chain of logic and does not end in a predictable way. The essence of a joke lies in its ability to steer the audience's expectations into an unexpected and humorous direction, and this can only be achieved by establishing a chain of logic and ending with a surprising punch line. Contrary to the statement, jokes utilize logic and unexpected outcomes to create humor, making them an essential aspect of comedy and entertainment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What are the last names of the people who are planning to murder Nick? is inside the article: Frank Chambers a drifter, stops at a depression-era rural California diner for a meal and ends up working there. The diner is operated by a young, beautiful woman, Cora Smith, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, a hardworking but unimaginative immigrant from Greece. Frank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet. Cora is tired of her situation, married to an older man she does not love, and working at a diner that she wishes to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick to start a new life together without her losing the diner. Their first attempt at the murder is a failure, but Nick is not even aware they tried to kill him, so goes about living his life as usual. Frank and Cora succeed with their next attempt. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on one another, he tries only Cora for the crime. Although they turn against each other, a clever ploy from Cora's lawyer, Katz, prevents Cora's full confession from coming into the hands of the prosecutor. With the tactic having failed to generate any new evidence for the prosecution, Cora benefits from a deal in which she pleads guilty to manslaughter and is sentenced to probation. Months later, Frank has an affair with Madge Gorland while Cora is out of town. When Cora returns, she tells Frank she is pregnant. That night, Katz's assistant, Kennedy, appears at their door and threatens to expose them unless they give him 10,000. Enraged, Frank beats Kennedy up and strong-arms him into giving up the evidence against them., can you guess it ?

Please answer this question: what was the capital of the american colonies?","completion":"To answer this question, I need to consider the historical context of the American colonies. Step 1: Research the time period The American colonies were a group of thirteen British colonies, established along the east coast of North America between the 17th and 18th centuries. These colonies eventually declared their independence from Britain in 1776, forming the United States of America. Step 2: Identify the purpose of the question The question asks for the capital of the American colonies, so the answer should focus on the central location where the colonial governments convened, or the city that was considered the main administrative hub during that time. Step 3: Analyze collected information The British-American colonies did not have a single official capital during their period as British colonies. Each colony had its own capital, reflecting the fact that they were administered as separate entities. However, during the American Revolution, when the colonies came together to fight for their independence, they formed the Continental Congress, a governing body that met in various locations. Step 4: Determine the most suitable answer While there was no official singular capital of the American colonies, it is common to refer to Philadelphia as the de facto capital during the Revolution because the Continental Congress met there several times, and the city played a significant role in the colonies' quest for independence. The founding documents, including the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, were debated and signed in Philadelphia’s Independence Hall. Step 5: Present the answer The American colonies did not have a single official capital, but Philadelphia can be considered the de facto capital during the American Revolution because of its importance and the role it played in the colonial fight for independence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The New York Times The encyclical quickly became seen, both in the secular world and in liberal Catholic circles, as the papacy’s Waterloo. It was so out of sync with the hopes and desires of the Catholic rank and file that it simply could not stand. And in some ways, it didn’t. Today polls show that Catholics, at least in the West, dissent from the teaching on birth control, often by majorities exceeding 80 percent. But at the official level, Catholicism’s commitment to “Humanae Vitae” is more solid than ever. During his almost 27-year papacy, John Paul II provided a deeper theoretical basis for traditional Catholic sexual morality through his “theology of the body.” In brief, the late pope’s argument was that human sexuality is an image of the creative love among the three persons of the Trinity, as well as God’s love for humanity. Birth control “changes the language” of sexuality, because it prevents life-giving love. That’s a claim many Catholics might dispute, but the reading groups and seminars devoted to contemplating John Paul’s “theology of the body” mean that Catholics disposed to defend the church’s teaching now have a more formidable set of resources than they did when Paul VI wrote “Humanae Vitae.” In addition, three decades of bishops’ appointments by John Paul II and Benedict XVI, both unambiguously committed to “Humanae Vitae,” mean that senior leaders in Catholicism these days are far less inclined than they were in 1968 to distance themselves from the ban on birth control, or to soft-pedal it. A striking number of Catholic bishops have recently brought out documents of their own defending “Humanae Vitae.” Advocates of the encyclical draw assurance from the declining fertility rates across the developed world, especially in Europe. No country in Europe has a fertility rate above 2.1, the number of children each woman needs to have by the end of her child-bearing years to keep a population stable. Even with increasing immigration, Europe is projected to suffer a population loss in the 21st century that will rival the impact of the Black Death, leading some to talk about the continent’s “demographic suicide.” Not coincidentally, Europe is also the most secular region of the world, where the use of artificial contraception is utterly unproblematic. Among those committed to Catholic teaching, the obvious question becomes: What more clear proof of the folly of separating sex and child-bearing could one want? So the future of “Humanae Vitae” as the teaching of the Catholic Church seems secure, even if it will also continue to be the most widely flouted injunction of the church at the level of practice. The encyclical’s surprising resilience is a reminder that forecasting the Catholic future in moments of crisis is always a dangerous enterprise — a point with relevance to a more recent Catholic predicament. Many critics believe that the church has not yet responded adequately to the recent sex-abuse scandals, leading to predictions that the church will “have to” become more accountable, more participatory and more democratic. While those steps may appear inevitable today, it seemed unthinkable to many observers 40 years ago that “Humanae Vitae” would still be in vigor well into the 21st century. Catholicism can and does change, but trying to guess how and when is almost always a fool’s errand. John L. Allen Jr. is the senior correspondent for The National Catholic Reporter and the author of “The Rise of Benedict XVI.” A version of this op-ed appears in print on , on Page WK11 of the New York edition with the headline: The Pope Vs. the Pill. Today's Paper|Subscribe Summary:","completion":"Despite widespread dissent among Catholic believers, the Catholic Church's official stance on birth control, as outlined in the encyclical \\"Humanae Vitae\\", remains unchanged. Polls show that more than 80% of Western Catholics do not support the Church's teaching on birth control. However, at the official level, Catholicism's commitment to the encyclical remains strong, backed by the \\"theology of the body\\" teachings of late Pope John Paul II and appointments of bishops supporting the traditional view by both John Paul II and Benedict XVI. The encyclical's resilience highlights the challenges of predicting changes within the Catholic Church."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the place that absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education? There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.

Largest Quake in Weeks Hits Mt. St. Helens (AP) AP - A 3.1-magnitude earthquake shook the crater at Mount St. Helens on Saturday, the strongest quake at the volcano since mid-October. Which topic is this article about?","completion":"This article is about a 3.1-magnitude earthquake that occurred at Mount St. Helens on Saturday, with the event being reported as the strongest quake at the volcano since mid-October. The topic of the article focuses on the geological activity, specifically seismic activity, at Mount St. Helens, a volcano located in Washington, United States. Mount St. Helens is known for its significant eruption in 1980, which caused a massive landslide and resulted in the deaths of 57 people. The volcano and its surrounding areas have been monitored closely since that catastrophic event to anticipate any possible future eruptions and to study the ongoing geological and seismic activities. Earthquakes are often associated with volcanic activity, as magma movement or the release of pressurized gases can cause ground tremors in the surrounding area. These earthquakes can help scientists monitor the behavior of a volcano and offer valuable information as to the likelihood or timing of potential volcanic eruptions. A 3.1-magnitude earthquake, as mentioned in the article, is considered to be a minor earthquake and typically does not cause damage to structures or pose significant safety risks. However, earthquakes of this magnitude at volcanoes, especially those with a history of explosive eruptions like Mount St. Helens, can be an important indicator of increasing volcanic activity. Therefore, the main focus of the article is to inform readers about the recent earthquake at Mount St. Helens and its significance in relation to the volcano's activity. This topic is particularly relevant for those who live in the region, scientists studying the volcano, as well as people interested in natural disasters and geological events."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This beloved movie tells a heartwarming tale of love, loyalty, and adventure, revolving around two dogs from entirely different backgrounds who meet by chance and embark on an unforgettable journey together. Lady, the main character, is a refined and pampered American Cocker Spaniel who lives with a loving family in an upper-class suburban neighborhood. Tramp, on the other hand, is a street-smart stray dog who knows how to live life on the edge. After a tumultuous meeting, they eventually come to appreciate each other's personalities and experiences, leading to love and newfound perspectives on life. As for the four characters you mentioned: 1. Jock - Jock is a Scottish Terrier who lives in the same neighborhood as Lady. He is a loyal and protective friend, with a thick Scottish accent and a strong sense of tradition. He always tries to give Lady helpful advice and stands by her side throughout her numerous exploits. 2. Trusty - Trusty is an aging Bloodhound and a longtime friend of both Jock and Lady. Despite his age, he still has a strong sense of loyalty and determination, often recalling his days on the police force. He occasionally loses his sense of smell, which becomes a crucial element in the film's climax when it miraculously returns. Trusty is a kind-hearted and fatherly figure who plays an essential role in the movie. 3. Toughy - Toughy is part of the stray dog gang that Tramp hangs out with, often referred to as one of the \\"Junkyard Dogs.\\" He is a slick and street-smart dog who, despite his tough exterior, has his friend's best interests at heart. Along with the rest of the gang, Toughy helps Tramp and Lady in their adventures and supports them on their path to love. 4. Pedro - Pedro is another member of the \\"Junkyard Dogs\\" in Tramp's pack. He's a small, enthusiastic, and passionate Chihuahua with a Mexican accent. Pedro offers comic relief in the film and is fiercely loyal to his friends, providing emotional support and help when needed. \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" was the fifteenth Disney animated feature film and the first to be presented in the widescreen format CinemaScope.

Unfortunately, that really is the only question, because there is no doubt that it does. For those unfamiliar with the premise of the show, the doomed-to-be-shortlived series Cavemen focuses on a number of Neanderthals and their struggle to exist in modern day America and is based on the characters featured in a series of television ads for Geico Insurance. The concept is solid and there is every reason to think it could be executed successfully. I had to think about it for awhile, but then the tagline from the commercials -- something to the effect of \\"We're not that much different from you\\" provided me with the key to the show's suckiness. Even though cavemen/Neanderthals are actually a different species than humanity, the title characters of this show, it turns out, are exactly the same as those of us who are boring jerks. Maybe its my background as a game writer -- rather than a soulless, hack, committee-based writer from California -- but this show had so much potential, and none of it has been realized. To start with, the producers should have focused on the fun things that would make cavemen different from us. What could conceivably be funny, for example, about giving them occupations like perpetual grad student and furniture store clerk, when they would have more compellingly been drawn to things like subterranean utility workers and guides at cave parks? Why would they play prosaic games like squash, when a whole episode could be devoted to them trying get hunting licenses to go after game with spears? A show like this could write itself, and it takes some willfully bad writing to make it quite so crappy and boring. Another tiresome aspect of this show is an attempt to portray the cavemen as being subjected to a number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities. Yawn! This has been done so many times before, and never more drearily than this. And, as noted previously, Neanderthals really are a different species, so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotyping is both uncompelling and off the mark. Responses are welcome, including those from anyone who wants to tell me why I'm wrong. I'd like to enjoy this show and am just sorry that I have thus far been unable to. Michael J.

If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it When did researchers discover eating a lot of fruit can reduce the risk of an aortic aneurysm?

The statement \\"A man wears a red hat and holds a sign\\" does not provide enough information to determine if the man is a construction worker or not. The man could be a construction worker, as it is common for construction workers to wear hard hats, sometimes in red, and hold signs for various reasons. However, there are numerous other scenarios in which a man might wear a red hat and hold a sign, and these scenarios have nothing to do with the man being a construction worker. For example, the man in question could be a sports fan wearing his favorite team's red hat and holding a sign to show his support at a game or event. Alternatively, he could be an employee at a store handing out flyers or holding a promotional sign. He could also be an individual participating in a protest or demonstration, using the sign to display his message. Without additional context or information, it is impossible to make a definitive conclusion regarding the man's occupation.

And the answer is...","completion":"Oh, dear! That sounds like a super big math problem, doesn't it? It's actually pretty simple if we take it one step at a time. It's like a fun puzzle! Here's how you can solve it: If we have 30*t on one side of the equation and -306*t + 9072 on the other side, what we can do first is to put all the parts that have 't' on the same side. It's like if you have 5 apples on one table and 3 apples on another table, you just want to put them all together on one table. Here's how we do that: We can add 306*t to both sides to keep the equation equal. This will cancel out the -306*t on the right. So, now the equation is: 30*t + 306*t = 9072. If you add 30*t with 306*t, we get 336*t. So, our new equation is: 336*t = 9072. Now, we just have one t left, which is what we want to find! To do this, we divide both sides by the number attached to t, which is 336. It's like if you have 336 candies that you want to share equally among t number of friends. So, t = 9072/336.

Question: If Jupiter has a bigger orbit then Mercury, which planet will take a shorter time to revolve around the Sun? Answer: Mercury","completion":"Mercury takes a shorter time to revolve around the Sun compared to Jupiter because it has a smaller orbit. The planets in our solar system revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits. The size of the orbit determines how long it takes for a planet to complete its journey around the Sun, also known as its orbital period or year. A planet that is closer to the Sun has a smaller orbit, and consequently, a shorter orbital period. Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, at an average distance of about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles). Its orbit is significantly smaller than that of Jupiter, which is located much farther away, at an average distance of about 779 million kilometers (484 million miles) from the Sun. Therefore, Mercury has a much shorter distance to travel during its orbit. As a result, Mercury completes a revolution around the Sun in just 88 Earth days, making its year relatively short. Jupiter, on the other hand, takes about 11.9 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. This longer orbital period is primarily due to its larger orbit and greater distance from the Sun. In summary, Mercury takes a shorter time to revolve around the Sun compared to Jupiter because of its smaller orbit and closer proximity to the Sun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer to the question: What is the animal tracker attempting to film when he captures images of Sasquatch? is inside the article: Animal tracker Ivan Marx opens by mentioning the film is the culmination of 10 years of research. He says that the Eskimos called the creature \\"bushman,\\" the Colville Indians \\"Sasquatch,\\" and the Hoopas \\"Om-mah,\\" but is most commonly known as Bigfoot. Marx's brother-in-law takes him to the land of petrified wood, showing him rock carvings of creatures with big hands and feet. The carvings tell the story of the creature stealing children, causing a village to be abandoned. Marx finds large tracks in the snow and later a dead bear with similar tracks nearby. He finds strange hair between the bear's teeth and sets out to track the creature. He finds tracks in the mud beside a river and something moving nearby. He intends to inform others but rain washes the tracks away. Marx investigates tracks in several states only to find they're not bigfoot tracks. He visits the Oh-mah bigfoot redwood statue in northern California and the Oregon coast, continuing to search. Marx takes a job in Washington state to film a Cinnamon bear. While there, he films Bigfoot walking through a field. He mentions that his footage of Bigfoot has been questioned by science and used by others on lecture circuits to make money. Marx shows footage of an injured squirrel, goats eating dirt, and glaciers melting. He mentions the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and visits Yukon Frida, who paints pictures of Bigfoot.

The answer is:","completion":"The first step of the hibernation process in animals is to gain weight in preparation for the long period of inactivity during the cold, snowy weather season. This is a crucial stage, as it ensures that the animal has enough energy reserves to sustain its bodily functions and survive throughout hibernation without eating or drinking. During the warmer months or pre-hibernation season, animals instinctively increase their food intake and start consuming more calorie-dense foods. This allows them to store excess energy in the form of fats, which will later be used to maintain their essential life processes while they are in hibernation. Some animals, such as bears, can gain up to 30% of their body weight before hibernating, mainly by feasting on carbohydrate and protein-rich foods. Smaller mammals, like squirrels and chipmunks, focus on hoarding food like nuts and seeds in their burrows, as they will occasionally wake up and eat during their hibernation period. Before the onset of winter, animals might also adjust their behavior, becoming more aggressive or territorial in order to protect their food sources and secure better chances of surviving the winter. As the temperatures start dropping and the days become shorter, animals will start searching for a suitable place to hibernate. Finding a suitable hibernation site is essential, as it ensures the animal's safety and protection from predators, harsh weather conditions, and other environmental threats. The hibernation site might be a natural burrow, cave, or den, or even a man-made structure like an attic or an abandoned building. Once the animal has gained enough weight and found a suitable hibernation site, it will enter a state of hibernation, characterized by drastically reduced metabolism, heart rate, and breathing rate. During this stage, the animal conserves its energy by using its fat reserves at a much slower rate than it would under normal circumstances. This allows the animal to survive the cold season without eating or drinking, eventually emerging in spring when the weather improves, and food sources become more abundant again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges.

A double-decker bus exploded into flames this morning on a residential street in South London this morning - but, amazingly, nobody was injured thanks to the driver's quick thinking. Passengers travelling on Pepys Road in Brockley told of the moment the driver said he saw a spark on the bus and ordered everyone off. Everyone on the bus escaped the terrifying incident unharmed, despite the fire also causing two cars parked nearby to burst into flames, according to one eye-witness. Burning bus: within minutes the double-decker goes up in flames - but incredibly, no one is injured. The bus was engulfed in flames on Pepys Road in Brockley, South East London. Emergency services were called and. firemen began trying to control the blaze. But as they got to work, one. of the bus tyres exploded on the other side of the road, setting a car. on fire. A spokeswoman for the Fire Brigade told Mail Online: 'The incident took place at 8.22am on Pepys Road, SE14 and a double-decker bus and a motor car were both damaged by a fire'. She said the fire service received 31 calls to the incident. A spokesman for the police added: 'All passengers were evacuated and there were no reports of any injuries.' He said the cause of the fire was still unknown but they were not treating it as suspicious, adding: 'Obviously the cause of the fire will be investigated.' Reverend Sheridan James of St Catherine's Church, whose vicarage was next to the site of the explosion, said she was eating breakfast when she heard a bus passing that sounded 'a bit noisy'. She told the Mail Online: 'Then it made a hissing sound and there was a loud bang.' Double whammy: as fireman control the fire on the bus, a tyre hits a nearby parked car, causing it to go up in flames as well. Incredibly, the church and other nearby buildings were undamaged. Revd James rushed out to see what was happening. 'Within minutes the bus was consumed in flames with black smoke coming from it,' she said. 'It looked like a bomb explosion.' When she saw the fire on the bus spread to two cars that were parked nearby, she quickly dressed in her clerical garb in case she was needed to offer any assistance. Incredibly, there were no fatalities and no injuries. 'About 30 to 50 people were gathered, a lot of them residents,' she said. 'They were initially very scared.' Narrow escape: Passengers said the driver spotted a fault and quickly ordered everyone off the bus. She said passengers believed the fire had been caused by an electrical fault on the bus, and paid tribute to the quick-thinking driver. 'People were saying the driver saw a spark. He got everybody off the bus and within minutes it was ablaze.' The incident could have been far worse, she added, given that the explosion happened in a built-up area, with a school situated opposite the vicarage and the church, and many over-hanging trees that could have caught fire. 'Really, given how awful it was, it's amazing there were no fatalities and no damage the buildings,' she said. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"One morning, in a street in South London, a double-decker bus caught fire and exploded.

Scientists and experts have proved the uniqueness of finger-prints and discovered that no exactly similar pattern is passed on from parents to children, though nobody knows why this is the case. The ridge structure on a person's fingers does not change with growth and is not affected by surface injuries. Burns, cuts and other damage to the outer part of the skin will be replaced in time by new one which bears a reproduction of the original pattern. It is only when the inner skin is injured that the arrangement will be destroyed. Some criminals make use of this fact to remove their own finger-prints but this is a dangerous and rare step to take. Finger-prints can be made very easily with printer's ink. They can be recorded easily. With special methods, identification can be achieved successfully within a short time. Because of the simplicity and economy of this system, finger-prints have often been used as a method of solving criminal case. A suspected man may deny a charge but this may be in vain. His finger-prints can prove who he is even if his appearance has been changed by age or accident. When a suspect leaves finger-prints behind at the scene of a crime, they are difficult to detect with the naked eye. Special techniques are used to \\"develop\\" them.

FILE- In this Sept. 26, 2017, file photo, former Alabama Chief Justice and U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore greets supporters before his election party in Montgomery, Ala. Allegations of Moore's sexual misconduct are shaking up the Alabama special Senate election. Brynn Anderson AP Can we infer the following? Sexual misconduct allegations against Moore are shaking up the election.","completion":"Yes, we can reasonably infer from the provided information that sexual misconduct allegations against Roy. Moore, the former Alabama Chief Justice and U.S. Senate candidate, are causing turbulence in the Alabama special Senate election. Your inference is based on the sentence which directly mentions that \\"Allegations of Moore's sexual misconduct are shaking up the Alabama special Senate election.\\" This statement implies that the allegations have introduced an element of uncertainty and controversy to the race that potentially could influence and sway voter sentiment. Like any electoral competition across the globe, factors like candidates' integrity, ethical standards, political policies, and public reputation significantly impact the course and outcome of elections. Hence, accusations as serious as the ones levelled against Moore constitute a crisis. Allegations of sexual misconduct can severely tarnish a candidate's image and standing. They raise serious concerns about the candidate's moral and ethical credibility, thereby impacting voter trust and confidence negatively, especially in a society where such misdemeanors are considered significant moral and legal transgressions. This might lead to loss of support from voters who were initially inclined to vote for Moore, or generate increased support for his opponent(s). This outcome is what is implied by the phrase \\"shaking up\\". Moreover, allegations of this nature could also intensify media scrutiny and promote deeper examination of, and debate around, the candidate's personal life, character, past actions, and suitability for public office. It may also fuel opposition research, and possibly, lead to reputational damage, especially if any evidence supporting the claims is produced. In essence, a \\"shakeup\\" in the context of an election suggests that the allegations have introduced substantial uncertainty and made the electoral outcome less predictable than it would have been in the absence of such accusations. Whether or not these allegations could definitively turn the tide against Moore is not explicitly mentioned here but their impact on the electoral dynamics is clear."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What does Moore say his father assembled? Title: Roger & Me Movie plot: Michael Moore is an eccentric, self-taught documentary film director who begins by introducing himself and his family through 8 mm archival home movies; in a voice-over, he describes himself as \\"kind of a strange child,\\" the Irish American Catholic middle-class son of a General Motors employee assembling AC Spark Plugs. Moore chronicles how GM had previously defined his childhood while growing up in Flint, Michigan, and how the company was the primary economic and social hub of the town. He points out that Flint is the place where the 1937 Flint Sit-Down Strike occurred, resulting in the birth of the United Auto Workers. He reveals that his heroes were the Flint natives who had escaped the life in GM's factories, including the members of Grand Funk Railroad, Casey Kasem, the spouses of Zubin Mehta (Nancy Kovack) and Don Knotts, and \\"Flint's most famous native son,\\" game show host Bob Eubanks.Initially, he achieves his dream of avoiding the dreary tradition of blue-collared factory life that lays for the majority of the population of Flint; by moving to California and working for a magazine in San Francisco, but this venture fails for him and he ultimately travels back to Flint. As he returns (in 1985), General Motors announces the layoffs of thousands of Flint auto workers, the jobs of whom will go to cheaper labor when the plant relocates to Mexico. GM makes this announcement even though the company is (according to Moore) experiencing record profits.Disguised as a TV journalist from Toledo, Ohio, Moore interviews some auto workers in Flint and discovers their strong antipathy to General Motors chairman Roger B. Smith. Moore begins seeking out Smith himself to confront him with an \\"up-close-and-personal\\" interview about the closing of the Flint auto factories.

With just minutes remaining and his side 3-0 ahead at Stamford Bridge, the Chelsea boss headed for the exit and attempted to shake hands with Villa boss Paul Lambert and assistant Keane. Both snubbed Mourinho's handshake request with Lambert pointing to his watch, suggesting that the Portuguese manager would have to wait until full-time. Villa assistant Roy Keane (left) was in no mood to shake Jose Mourinho's hand before the game finished. Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert also refused to shake Mourinho's hand at Stamford Bridge. Lambert couldn't understand why Mourinho was leaving the pitch before full-time. Dalglish told the Mirror: 'I probably wouldn’t have shaken his hand, either, if I had been in the same situation as the former United skipper.' The former Liverpool forward added: 'Mourinho is at the top of the tree at the moment. You can get away with a lot of things when you’re in his position. 'But maybe he should remember the old adage about being nice to people on the way up because you might need them on the way down.' Highlights:","completion":"1.

Swept up by mountainous tsunami waves at a Thai resort ( ), she could not hold on to both her young sons and survive . Fighting to stay above the waters , she had to choose which one would have to take his chances in the swirling torrent . \\"I knew I had to let go of one of them and I just thought I'd better let go of the one that's the older,\\" she told Sky News television in a report broadcast on Thursday.

Spawned by earlier group The Id, the outfit is composed of co-founders Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), along with Martin Cooper (various instruments) and Stuart Kershaw (drums); McCluskey is the only constant member. OMD released their debut single, \\"Electricity\\", in 1979, and gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 anti-war song \\"Enola Gay\\". Critic Hugo Lindgren wrote that OMD have cultivated a \\"legacy as musical innovators\\". In February 2007 a Scotsman journalist said: \\"If Kraftwerk were the Elvis Presley of synth-pop, then Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark were its Beatles.\\" In 2008, American publication The A.V. Club noted that McCluskey and Humphreys were \\"often labeled as the 'Lennon-McCartney of synth-pop'.\\" In a 2008 piece on OMD, The Quietus magazine editor John Doran called them \\"the only Liverpool band to come near to living up to the monolithic standards of productivity and creativity set in place by the Beatles\\", and asserted: \\"Orchestral Manouevres in the Dark are not one of the best synth bands ever: they are one of the best bands ever.\\" Veteran BBC DJ Simon Mayo described OMD as \\"the fathers of electronic music in this country [the UK].\\" OMD's experimental brand of synth-pop has garnered limited mainstream attention. The group generally eschew choruses, replacing them with synthesizer lines, and opt for unconventional lyrical subjects such as war and machinery; the BBC wrote that \\"OMD were always more intellectual\\" than \\"contemporaries like Duran Duran and Eurythmics\\". The band also rejected celebrity status and strove \\"to have no image\\". Despite the group's experimentation, they had an established knack for pop hooks; AllMusic critic Mike DeGagne wrote that OMD's music was \\"a step above other keyboard pop music of the time, thanks to the combination of intelligently crafted hooks and colorful rhythms\\". DeGagne's colleague Jon O'Brien remarked that the outfit were \\"ahead of their time\\". McCluskey in 2010 opined that OMD had become \\"the forgotten band\\" (he had predicted in 1981, at the peak of the group's popularity, that they would soon be forgotten). The band have nonetheless earned a growing cult following. OMD have come to be regarded as one of the great Liverpool acts of the 1980s, and pioneers of the synth-pop genre. Architecture & Morality (1981), regarded as the group's seminal work, had sold more than 4 million copies by early 2007; Sugar Tax (1991), the album that marked a commercial renaissance for the band, had sold more than 3 million by the same time period. The experimental Dazzle Ships (1983), while not as commercially successful, has retrospectively been praised by critics, according to The Oxford Times and Fact. OMD's overall record sales stand in excess of 40 million. The group regularly features on 1980s compilation albums and box sets; multiple OMD tracks feature on each of the three volumes of Ministry of Sound's Anthems: Electronic 80s series. The band's songs (and samples of their work) have featured in films such as Urgh! A Music War (1982), Weird Science (1985), Pretty in Pink (1986), Arthur 2: On the Rocks (1988) as well as in television shows including Scrum V, Ashes to Ashes, Top Gear, Chuck, Cold Case, Modern Family, The Goldbergs and Castle. Cover versions of \\"If You Leave\\" have appeared in the film Not Another Teen Movie (2001) and the TV series The O.C.; a season 6 episode of Degrassi: The Next Generation was named after the track. The 2015 film Ex Machina also incorporated their song Enola Gay. Additionally, every episode of the TV show Hunters is named after an OMD song.

Im a Sophomore in college and I met a really nice girl the first week of school and started hooking up with her and took her virginity. Nothing formal just a FWB type situation. We had casual sex for about 5 months (i know its a ridiculously long time for not being in a relationship.) We both talked to other people during this time period but neither one of us hooked up with anyone else (she went on dates though). So a couple weeks ago she told me that she didnt want to keep hooking up because she was in love with me and knew I didnt feel the same way so we decided to stop hooking up but remain friends. This was surprising news to me because I didnt know she caught feelings. A week after this happened I went to a nearby frat party and she happened to be there. She sat with me we had a couple drinks and she initiated physical contact and started making out with me. One thing lead to another and she told me to come back to her place so we went and hooked up again.

Given the context: What will happen to Sasha? Possible answers: smart, lazy, be given advice on what to do A:","completion":"Given the context presented, it is clear that Sasha is engaged in a significant meeting with the country's leader to discuss trade deals between their respective nations. This situation would involve negotiations and deliberations, which might lead to several possible outcomes for Sasha. However, the options provided - smart, lazy, and be given advice on what to do - do not directly correlate with potential consequences resulting from such a discussion. Nonetheless, I will provide an extended analysis of how these provided options may still relate to the given context. Option A: Smart If Sasha successfully engages in the negotiations and secures favorable trade deals for her nation, she could be perceived as smart by those around her, including the country leader, her nation's citizens, and her government superiors or peers. Demonstrating intelligence in such high-level interactions often results in recognition and respect, with potential long-term benefits for her career and personal reputation. Option B: Lazy In this meeting with the country's leader, if Sasha displays laziness by not being well-informed about the trade deals and negotiations or neglects to advocate strongly in her nation's best interests, her actions could be met with disapproval or disappointment from her government and citizens. Furthermore, a lazy approach to these negotiations could lead to less advantageous trade terms for her nation, which may accumulate negative consequences for her and her country's economy. It is important to note that this option could, however, turn into a learning opportunity in the future if ever pursued with consistent hard work to improve and excel. Option C: Be given advice on what to do As negotiations progress, Sasha may receive advice or guidance from various sources, such as the country's leader, her government officials, advisors, or trade experts. This advice may help her navigate trade discussions to achieve favorable terms for her nation. Seeking external help and expertise can benefit both her personal growth and professional success and is healthy in any high-stakes negotiations. This option also suggests an atmosphere of cooperation and collaboration between the two parties to find a mutually beneficial outcome. Considering the options provided, a more accurate and comprehensive answer to the question would be: Upon meeting with the country's leader to discuss trade deals between the nations, Sasha will likely engage in complex negotiations, during which she may demonstrate intelligence, seek advice or guidance, and put forth her nation's interests. The outcome for Sasha will be influenced by her level of preparedness, negotiation skills, and adaptability when navigating the discussions. Sasha's experience can be positively or negatively affected by her approach to these negotiations and the degree to which she conscientiously advocates for her nation's best interests. Ultimately, Sasha's actions and the outcome of the meeting may contribute to shaping the countries' trade relationship and her own professional reputation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Ex-serviceman, Robert McNamara, 24, of Scarborough, pleaded guilty at Chester Crown Court to attempting to enter as a trespasser with intent to steal. The alarm at the footballer's Â£6m property in Prestbury, Cheshire was reportedly triggered on 3 August. McNamara will be sentenced on 21 December. Judge Nicholas Woodward said there were \\"very worrying features\\" in the case and ordered a pre-sentence report to be carried out by the probation service. Rooney, his wife Coleen, and their three sons, Kai, Klay and Kit, were attending the charity tribute game against his first club, Everton, when the break-in bid took place.

As he grows you also age, and your ambitions become more unachievable. You begin to realize that your boy, in your footsteps, could probably accomplish what you hoped for. But footsteps can be muddied and they can go off in different directions. My son Jody has hated school since day one in kindergarten. Science projects waited until the last moment. Book reports weren't written until the final threat. I've been a newspaperman all my adult life. My daughter is a university graduate working toward her master's degree in English. But Jody? When he entered the tenth grade he became a \\"vo-tech\\" student . They're called \\"motorheads\\" by the rest of the student body. When a secretary in my office first called him \\"motorhead\\", I was shocked. \\"Hey, he's a good kid,\\" I wanted to say. \\"And smart, really.\\" I learned later that motorheads are, indeed, different. They usually have dirty hands and wear dirty work clothes. And they don't often make school honor rolls . But being the parent of a motorhead is itself an experience in education. We who labor in clean shirts in offices don't have the abilities that motorheads have. I began to learn this when I had my car crashed. The cost to repair it was estimated at 800. \\"Hey, I can fix it,\\" said Jody. I doubted it , but let him go ahead, for I had nothing to lose. My son ,with other motorheads, fixed the car. They got parts from a junkyard, non-toasting toaster have been fixed. Neighbours and co-workers trust their car repair to him. Since that first repair job, a broken air-conditioner, a non-functioning washer and a non-toasting toaster have been fixed. Neighbors and co-workers trust their car repairs to him.

The \\"remodeling\\" from the James consists of sheets tacked to the walls and dangly things hot glued to the undersides of the counters, the bathrooms are a joke and I have almost broken the sliding doors (twice.... sober). Also the TV's are too big for the rooms so they must be watched at an odd angle. The Skybar over looks the parking lot, how tacky (and hot) is that. The pool is a pretentious joke.

Choose what you want to put on your necklace: You can use beads, buttons, pasta, or even pieces of colorful straws. Choose your favorite things to make your necklace special. 2. Find a string or thread: You'll need something to put your items on, like a string, a thread, or even a shoelace. Make sure it's long enough to fit around your neck comfortably when you're done. 3. Lay out your materials: Put all your chosen items on a table or the floor, so you can see what you want to add to your necklace. 4. Add your items to the string: Now, you can start adding the items to your string. If it's hard to poke the string through some of the items, you can ask for help from a grownup or use a needle (be very careful and ask for a grownup's help if you use a needle). 5. Make a pattern: If you want, you can make a pattern with your items, like big-small-big, or red-blue-red. It's up to you, be creative! 6. Keep adding items until it's long enough: Keep putting your items on the string until the necklace is long enough to go around your neck. 7. Tie the ends together: When you're done adding the items, you need to tie the two ends of the string together so your necklace doesn't fall off. You can make a simple knot or ask a grownup to help you tie it. 8. Wear your necklace proudly: Now you can put on your beautiful, handmade necklace and show it off to everyone!

The Cheetah Girls travel across the globe to India. There, they meet Rahim (Rupak Ginn), the man cast as the lead, whom they realize is attractive, yet somewhat clumsy. After meeting the movie's choreographer, Gita (Deepti Daryanani), a dance battle erupts between themselves and Gita with her backup dancers.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\" The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\" should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and...

Somerset: Bridgwater was developed during the Industrial Revolution as the area's leading port. The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, to be carried further up river to Langport; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton. The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf. Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles, and later cellophane, but those industries have now stopped. With its good links to the motorway system, Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and Gerber Juice. AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town. Many towns have encouraged small-scale light industries, such as Crewkerne's Ariel Motor Company, one of the UK's smallest car manufacturers. Please answer a question about this article.

Information: - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America. - Sociology is the study of social behaviour or society, including its origins, development, organization, networks, and institutions. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, disorder, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure. - The term social order can be used in two senses. In the first sense, it refers to a particular set or system of linked social structures, institutions, relations, customs, values and practices, which conserve, maintain and enforce certain patterns of relating and behaving. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder, and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social order is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question how and why it is that social orders exist at all. - Political Process and the Development of the Black Insurgency 1930-1970 is a 1982 book by sociologist Doug McAdam (published by the University of Chicago Press). It is responsible for laying the theoretical groundwork for the political process model for sociological theory. - Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a \\"social science\\". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science. - The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States of America. The Constitution, originally comprising seven articles, delineates the national frame of government. Its first three articles entrench the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress; the executive, consisting of the President; and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts. Articles Four, Five and Six entrench concepts of federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments and of the states in relationship to the federal government. Article Seven establishes the procedure subsequently used by the thirteen States to ratify it. - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts.

Although its appearance is underwhelming, this location has some of the best BBQ I've ever tasted. Far better than you'd find at any Big Box restaurant, this restaurant has excellent BBQ ribs, burgers, wings, sandwiches, and home made pies. The prices are very reasonable. I got a half rack of ribs and wings plate with vegetables and a baked potato for 15. The ribs fall apart and require very little chewing; they've been slow cooked to perfection. Their BBQ sauce on both their ribs and wings was outstanding - a smokey, sweet flavour, which also tastes like it could be home cooked. If you have room after their healthy portions, try a slice of their home made coconut or banana cream pie. One slice easily finishes off a great meal, and is more than enough to share with another person. I agree the service could be better, and the decor could be updated. However, the food is phenomenal.

Fondant is a smooth, easily molded covering used to cover the whole cake or to make cake toppers. You can make it yourself or purchase ready-made fondant to save yourself the trouble. Some brands of fondant tear more easily than others. Fondarific, Duff, and FondX are good beginner options. Fondant dries quickly, so keep any portions you are not currently using wrapped in plastic or in the original container. Make this as smooth as possible to prevent wrinkling or tearing the fondant, which will go over the buttercream. See the icing section for tips. Ganache can be used instead. It may be more difficult to smooth, but will provide a more stable base. Sprinkle cornstarch or spread shortening on a clean surface to prevent the fondant from sticking, then knead it for a couple minutes or until pliable. Knead by pushing with your flat palms and heel of the hand, to avoid trapping air bubbles in the fondant. Skip this step if you purchased ready-to-use rolled fondant. Use a rolling pin to roll the fondant out to a ¼ in (6 mm) thickness. Occasionally rotate the fondant by sliding your hand underneath it to the center, to make sure it hasn't stuck to the table. If you plan on covering a circular cake with fondant, you'll need a circle as wide as your cake's diameter plus twice the cake's height. Once the fondant is rolled out, roll it around the rolling pin, then unroll it again over the cake to drape it over. Use a flat tool – or your hands if necessary – to smooth the top surface and remove air bubbles. Next, smooth out a full circle around the top of the cake's sides, to make sure the fondant is firmly attached. Smooth the rest of the sides, gradually moving around the cake, until it is fully covered. Cut off the remaining fondant with a utility knife or pizza cutter. If you are covering a cake with an unusual shape, put the fondant in the same mold you used for the cake, let it harden slightly, then place it over the cake. Large cakes may need to be covered piece by piece, then repaired as described below. You can easily make two-dimensional fondant decorations by cutting shapes out with a utility knife or scissors. Use fondant in multiple colors to make faces, animals, or any shape you like. It can also be sliced into strips and arranged to form ribbons or a spiral flower. Three-dimensional shapes can be sculpted just like clay, although fondant is best suited for small cake toppers, since it dries quickly. Fondant can tear, crack, or bulge fairly easily, especially when used to cover an entire cake. Here are a few ways to repair these imperfections: Put a small amount of new fondant into a bowl and mix in water ¼ tsp (1 mL) at a time until you get a toothpaste consistency. Spread this with a flat spatula over cracks or dents to make them smooth, then wait for them to dry. If the fondant cracks before you've started decorating, knead in some shortening or glycerin. Hairline cracks can sometimes be smoothed out with your fingertips, or disguised with a brush of shortening. A bulge is usually an air bubble. Try pricking it with a pin, then smoothing out the fondant.","completion":"Fondant is a smooth, moldable covering for cakes or cake toppers. It can be made at home or bought ready-made. Brands like Fondarific, Duff, and FondX are suitable for beginners. When working with fondant, keep unused portions wrapped to prevent drying. You can use ganache as an alternative for a more stable base. To prepare fondant, knead it on a dusted surface until pliable and roll it out to 1/4-inch thickness. To cover a cake, drape the rolled fondant over it and smooth out any air bubbles. Cut off any excess fondant with a knife. Two-dimensional decorations can be made by cutting shapes and using multiple colors, while three-dimensional shapes can be sculpted like clay.

Here's the problem: 8005 * z - 8021 * z = 160 First, let's look at the two parts on the left side of the equation: 8005 * z and 8021 * z. Since both terms have the variable \\"z,\\" we can actually put them together by subtracting the numbers in front of the \\"z's\\": 8005 * z - 8021 * z is the same as (8005 - 8021) * z Let's do the subtraction inside the parentheses: 8005 - 8021 = -16 Now, our equation looks like this: -16 * z = 160 To solve for z, we need to get z alone on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -16. (-16 * z) ÷ (-16) = 160 ÷ (-16) Now, -16 divided by -16 is 1. So, the left side of the equation simplifies to: 1 * z But, when something is multiplied by 1, it doesn't change. So, that's just \\"z.\\" Now, let's divide the right side: 160 divided by -16 is -10 So, our equation now looks like this: z = -10 That means the value of z that solves our equation is -10!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: Border, Leicester and Corriedale are all breeds of what?","completion":"Border, Leicester and Corriedale are all breeds of sheep. The Border Leicester is a British breed of sheep. It is named after its place of origin, the border region between England and Scotland. Border Leicesters are one of the largest sheep breeds, known for their large size and muscularity. Their long, lustrous wool is highly prized by hand spinners and weavers and their docile temperament makes them easy to handle on the farm. The Leicester, sometimes termed the \\"English Leicester\\" to differentiate it from the Border Leicester, is also an English breed of sheep, but it's actually one of the oldest breeds in existence. Also known as Leicester Longwool, this sheep breed was primarily developed for its meat and wool. Leicester sheep are medium to large sized with a strong, robust nature and are well known for their long, curly, lustrous fleece which is universally loved by crafters and artisans who enjoy spinning and dyeing. Corriedale sheep, on the other hand, originated in New Zealand and Australia as a dual-purpose breed that could thrive under a variety of climatic conditions. The breed was developed in the 1800s by crossing Merino and Lincoln sheep, aiming to combine the fine wool of the Merino with the size and meat quality of the Lincoln. Corriedales are one of the most populous breeds worldwide. They have a sturdy build and thick wool that protects them from harsh environments. All three breeds are renowned for their wool quality. Their wool is widely used in various textile products like clothing, carpets, and furnishings. Both the Border Leicester and Corriedale are also used for meat production due to their good size and muscling. Their adaptability, efficient grazing and reproductive capabilities make these breeds important contributors to the international sheep industry. They all have unique characteristics that make them preferred breeds by both commercial farmers, for income, and smallholders and hobby farmers, for their manageable size and pleasant temperament."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Andy Samuel Griffith (June 1, 1926 - July 3, 2012) was an American actor, comedian, television producer, Southern gospel singer, and writer, whose career spanned seven decades of music and television. Known for his southern drawl, his characters with a folksy-friendly personality, and his gruff, gregarious voice, Griffith was a Tony Award nominee for two roles, and gained prominence in the starring role in director Elia Kazan's film A Face in the Crowd (1957) before he became better known for his television roles, playing the lead roles of Andy Taylor in the sitcom The Andy Griffith Show (1960-1968) and Ben Matlock in the legal drama Matlock (1986-1995). Griffith's early career was as a monologist, delivering long stories such as What It Was, Was Football, which is told from the point of view of a naive country preacher trying to figure out what was going on in a football game. The monologue was released as a single in 1953 on the Colonial Records label, and was a hit for Griffith, reaching number nine on the charts in 1954. Griffith starred in Ira Levin's one-hour teleplay version of No Time for Sergeants (March 1955) -- a story about a country boy in the United States Air Force -- on The United States Steel Hour, a television anthology series. He expanded that role in Ira Levin's full-length theatrical version of the same name (October 1955) on Broadway in New York City. The role earned him a \\"Distinguished Supporting or Featured Dramatic Actor\\" nomination at the 1956 Tony Awards, losing to Ed Begley. He did win the 1956 Theatre World Award, however, a prize given for debut roles on Broadway. \\"Mr. Griffith does not have to condescend to Will Stockdale\\" (his role in the play), wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times. \\"All he has to do is walk on the stage and look the audience straight in the face. If the armed forces cannot cope with Will Stockdale, neither can the audience resist Andy Griffith.\\" Griffith later reprised his role for the film version (1958) of No Time for Sergeants; the film also featured Don Knotts, as a corporal in charge of manual-dexterity tests, marking the beginning of a lifelong association between Griffith and Knotts. No Time for Sergeants is considered the direct inspiration for the later television situation comedy Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. His only other New York stage appearance was the titular role in the 1959 musical Destry Rides Again, co-starring Dolores Gray. The show, with a score by Harold Rome, ran for 472 performances and more than a year. Griffith was nominated for \\"Distinguished Musical Actor\\" at the 1960 Tony Awards, losing to Jackie Gleason. He also portrayed a US Coast Guard sailor in the feature film Onionhead (1958); it was neither a critical nor a commercial success.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Some Americans will soon be able to buy a home with a down payment as low as 3 percent, compared with the current minimum of 5 percent, the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac say. The new lending guidelines announced by the companies Monday are designed to help more low-income and first-time buyers afford homes. Millions of Americans lost their savings or no longer had the income needed to set aside money for a home in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession. That has held down the sales of houses and condominiums and slowed the economic recovery. The guidelines are designed to prevent the kind of reckless lending that fueled a housing bubble and eventually triggered the recession. Borrowers must have enough income to repay loans on a monthly basis for homes that would be their main residence. This guideline would be intended to limit financial speculation. \\"These underwriting guidelines provide a responsible approach to improving access to credit while ensuring safe and sound lending practices,\\" Mel Watt, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said in a statement. The FHFA oversees Fannie and Freddie, which have been under government control since 2008 because of the housing bust. Watt had announced in October that Fannie and Freddie had reached an agreement with major banks to expand lending. The FHFA declined Monday to say how many borrowers might benefit from having a 3 percent down payment. The standard down payment for mortgages insured through Fannie and Freddie has been 20 percent. That would mean that a first-time buyer would need 41,600 in cash to purchase a median-priced home of 208,300, according to the National Association of Realtors. Just 29 percent of home purchases in October went to first-time buyers, compared with a historic average of 40 percent, the Realtors reported. The new loans would be fixed-rate mortgages of up to 30 years for primary residences, though some policies vary between the companies. Fannie could begin underwriting the loans before the end of the year. It said the loans would be geared toward first-time buyers, require mortgage insurance payments because of the low down payment and mandate that buyers receive complete a financial counseling program. Freddie intends to begin offering its mortgages as early as March 2015, saying it would be an option for low- and moderate-income borrowers. It requires that borrowers earn less than an area's median income, in addition to paying insurance and receiving counseling. Monthly payments could not exceed 43 percent of the borrower's income. Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee about half of all U.S. mortgages, worth about 5 trillion. Along with other federal agencies, they back roughly 90 percent of new mortgages. The two companies don't directly make loans to borrowers. They buy mortgages from lenders, package them as securities, guarantee them against default and sell them to investors. That helps make loans available. The government took over Fannie and Freddie in September 2008, after a market meltdown compounded the losses caused by risky mortgages and threatened to shut down the entire housing sector. Combined, the firms received taxpayer aid totaling 187 billion, which has since been repaid as they have returned to profitability. ||||| Fannie Mae’s new My Community Mortgage program begins this week and is open only to first-time buyers with a minimum credit score of 620. Borrowers with Fannie-backed mortgages will be eligible to refinance with a limited amount of money that can be taken out. Freddie Mac’s new Home Possible Advantage mortgages, which begin in March, will be available to both first-time and other qualified borrowers. In most cases, credit scores will be just one of several factors in determining a home buyer’s eligibility, a spokesman said. Refinancing, though with no cash-out, also will be available. The programs are the latest efforts to promote homeownership after the collapse of the housing bubble, in hopes of reviving a housing industry that is still plagued by excessive foreclosures and struggling to overcome millions of owners still trapped in underwater mortgages. Today, first-time home buyers — who are generally younger — account for just 29 percent of home sales, far below the historical rate of 40 percent, according to the National Association of Realtors. In the third quarter of this year, the Census Bureau reported recently, the nation’s seasonally adjusted homeownership rate was 64.3 percent, the lowest level in two decades. Photo The government’s move was applauded by the mortgage insurance industry, which expects a business increase from the new programs, and advocates for low-income families. “We wouldn’t be putting borrowers in these loans if we were worried about their performance through stressful times,” said Rohit Gupta, chief executive of Genworth’s United States Mortgage Insurance Business and co-chairman of the U.S. Mortgage Insurers, a trade association. The Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization that generally supports social programs, concluded: “Those who have criticized low-down-payment lending as excessively risky should know that if the past is a guide, only a narrow group of borrowers will receive these loans, and the overall impact on default rates is likely to be negligible.” Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Housing officials declined to estimate just how many people might take advantage of these new loans, but even supporters question the magnitude of the new programs. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Guy D. Cecala, chief executive and publisher of the newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance, estimated the effect would be modest, noting that first-time buyers who qualified for similar low down payment loans accounted for only 3 percent of Fannie-backed mortgages in 2013. “It’s another tool in helping the housing market, but not a huge one,” Mr. Cecala said. Since the borrowers must still be credit worthy, he explained, “this is not pushing the envelope.” Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, also expressed doubt that this latest initiative would lure many new buyers, saying that the lack of demand and tight mortgage standards have been bigger hurdles than the size of the down payment. Mark A. Calabria, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, was not as sanguine about the financial stability of the targeted borrowers. Given closing costs, he said, “You’re essentially underwater when you walk away from the table.” “That is not a situation we should be trying to get people in,” he said. To Andres Carbacho-Burgos, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics, however, the danger of mortgage defaults generally comes from lax monitoring, not lower down payment requirements. While sharing the view that the effect would be limited, Mr. Carbacho-Burgos said the program was nonetheless worth pursuing. “Anything that can be done to restart the first-time home buyer market is a good thing,” he said. ||||| In an effort to open up lending to more low-income and first time home buyers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced Monday that they will start backing mortgages with down payments of as little as 3% of the home's price. But borrowers will still need to meet strict criteria first, the two government-backed mortgage giants said. The new loans will only be doled out to those who buy private mortgage insurance, have a credit score of at least 620 and offer complete documentation of their income, assets and job status. And, to further mitigate risk, the agencies will require borrowers to receive home ownership counseling. Both programs are for fixed-rate loans given to first time homebuyers and those seeking to refinance. Fannie will start backing the loans as soon as December 13, while Freddie will start offering them March 23. Related: 10 hottest housing markets for 2015 The move should expand access to credit for first-time homebuyers, typically younger buyers who have not have had enough time to save a big lump sum. Fannie and Freddie already back mortgages with as low as 5% down. And the Federal Housing Administration insures 3.5% loans. Still, according to Mark Palim, who directs economic and strategic research at Fannie Mae, it's a welcome expansion of credit. \\"It's not a radical departure from what we're doing now, but anything at the margins helps,\\" he said. The 3% loans from Fannie and Freddie should also offer some advantages over the 3.5% down loans offered by FHA, according to Palim. For example, the FHA loans require borrowers to pay for private mortgage insurance premiums for the entire term of the mortgage -- typically 30 years. That means adding an extra 1.35 percentage points to monthly mortgage rates. A loan carrying a 4% rate, for example, becomes a 5.35% mortgage. Related Best cities for Millennial home buyers In dollars, that's about an extra 80 a month for every 100,000 borrowed or 960 a year. That adds up to nearly 30,000 over the life of the loan. Under Fannie and Freddie's programs, borrowers are permitted to cancel their private mortgage insurance premiums once the mortgage balance drops below 80% of the home's value -- either because they've made enough payments or the home's value has risen. If home prices increase 5% a year for three or four years, for example, these borrowers may be able to cancel their insurance and save them tens of thousands of dollars over the next 26 or 27 years. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have announced that they will begin backing mortgages with down payments as low as 3% for low-income and first-time homebuyers in the United States.

Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population — many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop. But such heady progress would soon come to a halt. The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles–Salt Lake line. Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility. Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada's new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling. These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents. But the southwest's growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas's fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity. Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas. Providing an influx of 165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally. Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada. More Government Help: The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however. The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time. The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam's 1935 dedication set the city's now-formidable public relations machine into action. They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted. It didn't take long for the city to establish itself as a wild-West town with an \\"anything goes\\" attitude. Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day (or night). Question: \\"What man-made construction ended up creating jobs and also creating Lake Mead?\\" Answer: \\"Hoover Dam\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct. The Hoover Dam, originally known as the Boulder Dam, was a man-made construction that ended up creating jobs and also creating Lake Mead. The dam's construction began in 1931 and was a significant factor in revitalizing the Las Vegas economy and providing water to the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Spice Girls are an English pop girl group formed in 1994. The group originally consisted of Melanie Brown (\\"Scary Spice\\"), Melanie Chisholm (\\"Sporty Spice\\"), Emma Bunton (\\"Baby Spice\\"), Geri Halliwell (\\"Ginger Spice\\"), and Victoria Beckham, nee Adams (\\"Posh Spice\\"). They were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \\"Wannabe\\" in 1996, which hit number one in 37 countries and established them as a global phenomenon. Their debut album Spice sold more than 31 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. The phrase \\"girl power\\" put a name to a social phenomenon, but the slogan was met with mixed reactions. The phrase was a label for the particular facet of post classical neo-feminist empowerment embraced by the band: that a sensual, feminine appearance and equality between the sexes need not be mutually exclusive. This concept was by no means original in the pop world: both Madonna and Bananarama had employed similar outlooks. The phrase itself had also appeared in a few songs by British girl groups and bands since at least 1987; most notably, it was the name of British pop duo Shampoo's 1996 single and album, later credited by Halliwell as the inspiration for the Spice Girls' mantra. However, it was not until the emergence of the Spice Girls in 1996 with \\"Wannabe\\", that the concept of \\"girl power\\" exploded onto the common consciousness. The phrase was regularly uttered by all five members--although most closely associated with Halliwell--and was often delivered with a peace sign. The slogan also featured on official Spice Girls merchandise and on some of the outfits the group members wore. The Spice Girls' version was distinctive. Its message of empowerment appealed to young girls, adolescents and adult women, and it emphasised the importance of strong and loyal friendship among females. In all, the focused, consistent presentation of \\"girl power\\" formed the centrepiece of their appeal as a band. Some commentators credit the Spice Girls with reinvigorating mainstream feminism--popularized as \\"girl power\\"--in the 1990s, with their mantra serving as a gateway to feminism for their young fans. On the other hand, some critics dismissed it as no more than a shallow marketing tactic, while others took issue with the emphasis on physical appearance, concerned about the potential impact on self-conscious and/or impressionable youngsters. Regardless, the phrase became a cultural phenomenon, adopted as the mantra for millions of girls and even making it into the Oxford English Dictionary. In summation of the concept, author Ryan Dawson said, \\"The Spice Girls changed British culture enough for Girl Power to now seem completely unremarkable.\\" The Spice Girls' debut single \\"Wannabe\\" has been hailed as an \\"iconic girl power anthem\\". In 2016, the United Nations' Global Goals \\"#WhatIReallyReallyWant\\" campaign filmed a global remake of the original music video for \\"Wannabe\\" to highlight gender inequality issues faced by women across the world. The video, which was launched on YouTube and ran in movie theatres internationally, featured British girl group M.O, Canadian \\"viral sensation\\" Taylor Hatala, Nigerian-British singer Seyi Shay and Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez lip-syncing to the song in various locations around the world. In response to the remake, Beckham said, \\"How fabulous is it that after 20 years the legacy of the Spice Girls' girl power is being used to encourage and empower a whole new generation?\\" At the 43rd People's Choice Awards in January 2017, American actress Blake Lively dedicated her \\"Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress\\" award to \\"girl power\\" in her acceptance speech, and credited the Spice Girls, saying: \\"What was so neat about them was that they're all so distinctly different, and they were women, and they owned who they were, and that was my first introduction into girl power.\\" What types of things made them so unique?","completion":"The Spice Girls' uniqueness came from their focused and consistent presentation of \\"girl power,\\" which formed the centrepiece of their appeal as a band.

(CNN) -- Double amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius has moved a step closer to realizing his dream of participating in the Olympics after running the 'B' standard qualifying time for next year's Games in London. The 24-year-old, who was born without fibulae in both legs, clocked 45.61 seconds to win the 400m race at the Provincial Championships in his home town of Pretoria in South Africa on Wednesday.

News article: TOKYO -- A supposedly deaf composer once lauded as Japan's Beethoven apologized Friday after confessing that he could partially hear and that he did not write his music himself. \\"It is indeed the case that I have deceived people and for that I am extremely sorry,\\" Mamoru Samuragochi told a news conference in the Japanese capital, adding that he intends to live out the rest of his life repenting for his deception. The 50-year-old stunned the music world last month when he admitted he did not compose his own music. A day later, Takashi Niigaki, a lecturer at a Tokyo music college, admitted to writing Samuragochi's compositions. Shorn of his trademark shoulder hair and beard, the 50-year-old added that he was glad the truth had finally come out but said it was regrettable for classical music lovers. \\"It's true that I will have to take responsibility and apologize to a large number of people,” Samuragochi said. \\"Regardless of that, I think that it's a good thing that this has come out into the open.\\" KIMIMASA MAYAMA / EPA Mamoru Samuragochi held a news conference in Tokyo Friday to apologize for misleading his audience. He had feared the truth would come out one day, he said. \\"For classical music however and for those who love classical music, having them lose what they thought to be a rising hope, having them respond, 'What is this fake Samuragochi,' is something that is very regrettable,\\" he added. Although Samuragochi said he had returned his disability certificate that once classified him as having a severe hearing loss -- and admitted to regaining some of his hearing three years ago -- he maintained that he still cannot make out conversations and sentences. Today's questions from the media were translated to Samuragochi via a sign language interpreter. First published March 7 2014, 3:33 AM ||||| TOKYO (Reuters) - A composer once known as the \\"Beethoven of Japan\\" said on Friday that tests had shown he was not legally deaf and apologized to people throughout the country for lying by using a ghost writer for his popular symphonies and other music. Mamoru Samuragochi, a classical musician who became known as an inspirational genius for composing music despite losing his hearing, bowed deeply before a packed news conference, his first public appearance since the scandal broke last month. \\"I have caused a great deal of trouble with my lies for everyone, including those people who bought my CDs and came to my concerts,\\" Samuragochi, 50, said, his trademark flowing hair now trimmed in a typical businessman's cut. A statement distributed to reporters said hearing tests had shown that while Samuragochi's hearing was impaired, it did not meet the requirements for legal deafness. \\"I can hear sounds, but the sounds are twisted,\\" he said. \\"Hearing conversations is extremely difficult and I still need an interpreter.\\" German composer Ludwig van Beethoven began suffering hearing loss from about age 30 and withdrew from public performances while continuing to write music. He was almost totally deaf for the last decade of his life. Samuragochi collaborated with part-time university professor Takashi Niigaki for 18 years to compose his music after suffering hearing loss. He said on Friday that he and Niigaki would meet in a coffee shop in the Shinjuku entertainment district of western Tokyo and work out how Niigaki would compose the music. Niigaki, he said, kept negotiating for higher fees. \\"I wrote out what I wanted and the general plans, then Niigaki wrote the music,\\" he said. \\"If ultimately that means I defrauded people who bought my CDs, then yes, I did,\\" he said, biting his lip. Samuragochi gained international fame for his \\"Hiroshima Symphony\\", a tribute to the victims of the 1945 atomic bombing of the Japanese city. He also apologized to television stations and newspapers which had supported his career as well as figure skater Daisuke Takahashi, who used Samuragochi's music in his short program at the Sochi Winter Olympics just days after the scandal broke. \\"I worried that it might have had a bad impact on his skating ... I felt a terrible sense of responsibility,\\" Samuragochi said, adding that he didn't watch the Olympics because it was too painful. Takahashi ultimately finished sixth. \\"I know that it was wrong to use a ghost writer, but it is true that I wanted to use my music to bring light to people who were having tough times,\\" Samuragochi said. The scandal has riveted Japan, with two television stations broadcasting live the first 30 minutes of the news conference, which went on for nearly three hours. Music industry analysts say part of his popularity was the result of promotion by an industry eager to put a human face to classical music and retain a shrinking market share as Japan ages.

Answer this question: what is the meaning of the book of exodus??","completion":"The Book of Exodus is the second book in the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament of the Christian Bible and is a central text in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. As part of the Pentateuch, the Book of Exodus is largely attributed to Moses, recounting the early experiences of the Israelites in their journey from slavery in Egypt to their eventual deliverance and covenant with God at Mount Sinai. This book can be best understood by analyzing its core themes and the overall meaning it conveys. 1. Liberation from slavery: One of the fundamental meanings and narratives of Exodus is the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. God hears their cries and sends Moses to Pharaoh to demand their release. This pivotal story illustrates the liberation from physical, mental, and spiritual oppression and sets the stage for the subsequent journey of the Israelites. 2. The power of the one true God: The ten plagues that befell Egypt and the hardening of Pharaoh's heart demonstrate God's supreme authority over ancient pagan deities. It also illustrates divine intervention as God's way of protecting and guiding His chosen people. The Exodus narrative signifies God's unfaltering commitment and love for the Israelites and serves as a reminder of God's power. 3. The covenant with God: Another central theme in the Book of Exodus is the establishment of the covenant between God and the Israelites at Mount Sinai. The event illustrates the significance of obedience and adherence to a set of laws, as presented in the form of the Ten Commandments. Beyond specific rules, this theme emphasizes the Israelites' need to remain faithful to their divine covenant, maintain a close relationship with God, and abide by the moral and ethical standards established in their agreements. 4. The journey toward the Promised Land: The Book of Exodus recounts the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, a journey full of challenges, rebellions, and divine guidance. This theme emphasizes the importance of perseverance, trust in God, and the tested faith that emerged in the process. It isn't just about reaching a destination, but also about the transformation and growth of the Israelite nation. 5. The construction of the Tabernacle: A critical aspect of the Book of Exodus is the construction of the Tabernacle, a portable dwelling place for God's presence among the Israelites. The detailed instructions and descriptions serve as an illustration of God's desire to be among His people and the importance of strict obedience in following God's plans. In summary, the Book of Exodus is a rich and compelling narrative that serves multiple purposes within the broader context of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic faiths. It presents a powerful account of liberation from oppression, showcases the significant role of divine intervention, and elucidates the importance of maintaining a covenant relationship with God. Moreover, it highlights the values of perseverance and faithfulness and explores the transformational journey towards a deeper understanding and relationship with the divine. Through the story of the Israelites, the Book of Exodus continues to resonate as an archetypal story of hope, redemption, and divine guidance, fostering faith and commitment among believers."},{"prompt":"Short general knowledge question: who did alicia keys have a baby with?

The phrase \\"enjoy on a certain level\\" indicates that the critic found aspects of the movie to be enjoyable, but it also suggests that this enjoyment may be limited to specific elements and may not encompass the entire movie-going experience. The positive aspect comes from the word \\"enjoy,\\" which implies that the critic had a favorable reaction to the film to some degree. They appreciated certain aspects or moments, even if they did not universally love the film. The term \\"certain level\\" inherently implies that their enjoyment was not without reservations or limitations. This more nuanced review based on the given phrase still leans toward option [b] positive. Although not the most resounding endorsement, it affirms that the critic found value and pleasure in the movie to a certain extent. They may have appreciated some aspects, such as acting, the storyline, or the visual effects, which contributed to their positive experience. Lastly, the question mark in \\"enjoy on a certain level?\\" could be interpreted as an invitation for the reader to consider their perspective when deciding whether the movie falls under the positive or negative category. This phrasing may encourage the reader to focus on their subjective taste and preferences when evaluating the review, as the critic acknowledges that their level of enjoyment might not align with every audience member.

One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

Summarize the following: If you are buying bettas to breed, make sure to get them only from one specific, reputable breeder. This can help ensure the quality and success rate of your betta spawn. Be aware that getting quality bettas to breed can be expensive. More expensive fish generally mean that a breeder has also used selective breeding techniques. Although this isn't a guarantee of successful breeding, it can ensure the health and quality of your fish and possible their spawn. Some elements to look for in a breeder include: accomplishments, longevity, experience, knowledge, professionalism, affiliation with betta organizations, availability, reputation, track record, cleanliness, reference. Ask the breeder to let you know about the parentage of the bettas. If he can't answer the question, you may want to consider using another breeder that keeps tabs of his bettas' parentage. Find quality betta breeders through organizations such as the International Betta Congress. If you have friends or family that breed bettas or are familiar with them, you might ask them for suggestions, too. Figure out which bettas to get depending on what qualities you're hoping to highlight or breed out. You want to get the best quality stock you can afford and finding the right pair can help ensure health, beauty, and even your enjoyment. Make sure that you and your breeder both have knowledge of your fish's genetics. Knowing which traits can be inherited is important for responsible breeding to prevent generations of fish that follow from being unhealthy. Be aware that selective breeding is meant to bring out certain characteristics in a betta fish. For example, you may want to bring out black lace patterns in your betta. By choosing another betta with more distinctive lace patterns and mating it with your betta, you can bring out this particularly quality. You can apply this principle to color and fin size, too. Remember that if you're hoping to achieve a certain goal through your selective breeding, either with fin size or color, it can take a few years and cycles for these traits to fully appear. You can either use hybridization or inbreeding for desired traits. Hybridization will bring out the best traits in two genetically different parents, and inbreeding crosses two similar parents for offspring that also have the similar traits. Betta breeding can be rough no matter what, but it's important to get fish that are approximately the same size. This helps prevent injury to one of the fish. Looking at the size of each betta can ensure healthy spawn and a healthy breeding process for each fish. Be aware that a fish that is too small may be too young to breed. Aim to breed bettas that are four to twelve months old, which can help ensure that the sizes are proportionate as well as help prevent bad quality spawn. Detect sexual maturity in your betta by looking for males that build bubble nests and females that have a whitish egg spot on their underside. Females are also able to build bubble nests - don't let that fool you. Many people want to selectively breed their bettas for fin size and finnage. Looking at the fins for characteristics you want to bring out as well as for potential injury can help ensure that you get the qualities you hope to breed. Check the caudal, or tail, fin for straightness and curvature. Good breeding stock bettas with have straighter caudal fins that are curved in opposite directions. Avoid bettas with caudal fins curved in the same direction. Look for ray branching or splitting on all of the bettas fins. The more branches or splits you have, the more supportive, larger, and beautiful finnage you will get. Make sure the betta has no traces of fin rot, which looks like ripped or fuzzy fins with red tips or near the tears. Bettas come in and exhibit a wide range of colors on their bodies. Find the color bettas you like as mates or for your betta as a mate and try to choose colors that work well together. Be aware that bettas come in colors such as red, orange, yellow, turquoise, steel blue or royal blue. They can also have black or iridescent features. For example, you might find that breeding the blues with black lace features give your fish beautiful colors. Ask the breeder if you are unsure of what can work best for your betta. Summary:","completion":"When buying bettas for breeding, choose a reputable breeder to ensure quality and success. Quality bettas can be expensive, but selectively bred fish can improve the health and characteristics of the spawn. Consider the breeder's credentials and seek recommendations from organizations or personal contacts. Be knowledgeable about the bettas' genetics, and choose fish based on desired traits and compatibility. Breeding can involve hybridization or inbreeding, and aiming for bettas four to twelve months old can ensure successful spawns. Assess fins for quality and watch for signs of sexual maturity, as well as considering color compatibility. Consult with the breeder for guidance on the best combinations for desired results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the best way to: Make a tote bag out of old pants.","completion":"To make a tote bag out of old pants, follow these step-by-step instructions. Each step is justified to ensure a faithful completion of the task. 1. Choose the right pants: Look for pants made of durable materials such as denim or canvas. This will ensure that the tote bag is strong and lasts longer. 2. Wash and dry the pants: Clean the pants thoroughly to remove any stains or dirt. This ensures you start with a clean and hygienic base for the tote bag. 3. Gather materials and tools: You will need a pair of scissors, a ruler or measuring tape, sewing pins, a sewing machine or a needle with strong thread, and an iron. These tools will help in cutting, measuring, and sewing the tote bag together. 4. Cut off the pant legs: Lay the pants flat on a table, and using the scissors, carefully cut off both pant legs, cutting as close to the crotch seam as possible. This creates two separate pant leg pieces to work with. 5. Measure and cut the pant legs: Measure the desired dimensions of the tote bag (e.g., 15 inches wide and 18 inches long), and mark these measurements on both pant leg pieces. Cut each pant leg to the desired size, ensuring that they are the same. These pieces will become the front and back of the tote bag. 6. Sew the bottom seam: With the right sides of the pant legs facing each other, align the bottom edges, and use pins to hold them in place. Sew a straight line across the aligned edges, leaving a seam allowance of about 1/2 inch. This step creates the bottom seam of the tote bag. 7. Iron the seams: To create a clean finish, press the seams open using an iron. This step ensures a neat appearance and helps the tote bag lay flat when in use. 8. Sew the side seams: Open the pant legs, and fold them so that the side edges align. Pin and sew the side seams, again leaving a seam allowance of about 1/2 inch. This step forms the main body of the tote bag. 9. Create the bag handles: Using the remaining fabric from the pant waist or any leftover pant leg material, cut two long strips, each approximately 3 inches wide and 20 inches long. Fold each strip in half lengthwise with the right sides facing each other and sew along the long edge, leaving a 1/4 inch seam allowance. Turn the strips right side out and iron them flat. These strips will become the handles of the tote bag. 10. Attach the handles: Measure and mark the desired handle placements on the inside top edge of the tote bag. Pin the handle ends to the marks with about 1 inch of each end inserted in the bag. Sew the handle ends to the top edge of the tote bag, securely stitching a square or rectangle shape around the handle ends to reinforce the attachment. This step ensures the handles are strong enough to support the weight of the tote bag. 11. Turn the bag right side out: Turn the finished tote bag right side out, and iron the seams and edges for a cleaner and more professional appearance. You now have a tote bag made out of old pants! The entire process is both eco-friendly and budget-friendly, as it repurposes old clothing into a new, useful item."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the villian character created by Kaufman? ? Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka.

The symbol m is sometimes rendered as um if the symbol cannot be used, or if the writer is not aware of the distinction. - Radioactive waste is waste that contains radioactive material. Radioactive waste is usually a by-product of nuclear power generation and other applications of nuclear fission or nuclear technology, such as research and medicine. Radioactive waste is hazardous to most forms of life and the environment, and is regulated by government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment. - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population. - Disinfectants are antimicrobial agents that are applied to non-living objects to destroy microorganisms that are living on the objects . Disinfection does not necessarily kill all microorganisms , especially resistant bacterial spores ; it is less effective than sterilization , which is an extreme physical and / or chemical process that kills all types of life . Disinfectants are different from other antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics , which destroy microorganisms within the body , and antiseptics , which destroy microorganisms on living tissue . Disinfectants are also different from biocides -- the latter are intended to destroy all forms of life , not just microorganisms . Disinfectants work by destroying the cell wall of microbes or interfering with the metabolism . Sanitizers are substances that simultaneously clean and disinfect . Disinfectants are frequently used in hospitals , dental surgeries , kitchens , and bathrooms to kill infectious organisms . Bacterial endospores are most resistant to disinfectants , but some viruses and bacteria also possess some tolerance . In wastewater treatment , a disinfection step with chlorine , ultra-violet ( UV ) radiation or ozonation can be included as tertiary treatment to remove pathogens from wastewater , for example if it is to be reused to irrigate golf courses . An alternative term used in the sanitation sector for disinfection of waste streams , sewage sludge or fecal sludge is sanitisation or sanitization . - An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge.

The wall was built because the leaders of East Berlin didn't want people to leave and go to West Berlin. But on November 9, 1989, people from both sides of the wall came together and began taking the wall down, breaking it into pieces. This was a special day because it meant that the two sides of Berlin could be together again, and people could visit their families and friends who lived on the other side.

The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. Peter visited two mountain ranges last summer. The Ozarks in Missouri, and the more massive and younger Colorado Rockies.

The Ozarks contain more limestone, which is highly soluble in water and weak acid solutions, leading to the formation of cave systems and other karst features such as blue holes that Peter enjoyed visiting.

Rebecca preferred food heated, while Katrina liked it cold, so","completion":"Rebecca preferred food heated, while Katrina liked it cold, so their shared kitchen was always a fascinating blend of varying tastes, textures, and distinct culinary preferences. This curious juxtaposition of hot and cold not only reflected the sisters' individual personalities, but it also played a significant role in their bonding, as they'd often find innovative ways to satisfy their respective cravings while harmoniously enjoying mealtimes together. Rebecca cherished the warmth and comfort that steaming-hot dishes provided, especially during colder months or after a long, weary day at work. Her deep love for vibrant, spicy, and aromatic food stemmed from her time spent traveling through Southeast Asia, where she developed an affinity for flavorsome ingredients such as ginger, lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves. One of her signature dishes was a fragrant Thai red curry, teeming with tender chicken or succulent prawns and drenched in a flavorful coconut-infused sauce, served with a heaping mound of jasmine rice. Whenever Rebecca cooked, the scent of exotic spices lingered in the air, infiltrating every corner of their home and tantalizing their taste buds. Katrina, on the other hand, championed freshness and felt most nourished when indulging in chilled dishes or raw ingredients, which reminded her of the crisp Mediterranean breeze she experienced while vacationing in stunning Greek islands. Katrina's culinary inclinations tended towards brightly colored, nutrient-dense meals, such as bountiful Greek salads with plump, juicy tomatoes, crunchy cucumbers, briny Kalamata olives, sharp red onions, and slightly tangy feta cheese drizzles with zesty vinaigrettes. Smoothie bowls laden with luscious fruits and adorned with elaborate designs of nuts, seeds, and berries were Katrina's idea of the quintessential breakfast, while sipping a cold gazpacho soup would satiate her hunger on a hot summer's eve. Despite these contrasting preferences, Rebecca and Katrina managed to find common ground, often concocting unique fusion meals that catered to both their affinities. For example, they'd prepare a spicy cold noodle salad, blending Rebecca's adoration for heat with Katrina's passion for refreshing dishes. Showered in a tangy, zippy sauce made of sesame oil, garlic, and chili paste, the noodles gained a fiery kick, while the julienned cucumbers and carrots appealed to Katrina's penchant for chilled, crunchy components. Another creation that epitomized their collaborative efforts was their much-lauded sushi nights. Rebecca would whip up scrumptious rolls with crispy tempura shrimp, avocado, and creamy spicy mayo, while Katrina would meticulously arrange delicate slices of melt-in-your-mouth sashimi or prepare nigiri with cucumber or avocado, thus culminating in an authentic Japanese feast that delighted their communal table. This harmonious merge of sizzling-hot, umami-rich tempura, and ice-cold, delicate raw fish showcased the sisters' willingness to combine their culinary strengths and broaden their gastronomic horizons. Thus, Rebecca and Katrina's kitchen turned into a melting pot of flavors, where dishes as diverse as piping-hot enchiladas or chilled ceviche could coexist, mirroring the sisters' unwavering love and acceptance for one another's distinctive inclinations. Their mealtimes served as a testament to the beauty of embracing diversity, creating a rich tapestry of gastronomic experiences and elevating food into a transcendent language that nourished their relationship and brought them closer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For each integer in the list: - Assume the integer is prime by setting a flag, is_prime, to True. - If the integer is less than 2, set the is_prime flag to False, as prime numbers must be greater than 1. - For every number starting from 2, up to and including the square root of the integer, check if the integer is divisible by that number without leaving a remainder. - If the integer is divisible, set the is_prime flag to False, and break out of the loop, as the integer is not prime. - If the is_prime flag is still True after the loop, it means the integer is prime. Add the integer to the prime_numbers list. Step 4: Return the list of prime numbers. After completing the loop through the input list, return the prime_numbers list. Applying these steps to the input list: prime_numbers = [181, 167, 761, 611, 311, 709, 859, 73, 229, 991, 37, 571, 281] The output list of prime numbers is [181, 167, 761, 611, 311, 709, 859, 73, 229, 991, 37, 571, 281]."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An aggressive and energetic entrepreneur , he created a fortune ( which he lost ) and founded the Crosbie - dynasty . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"While both sentences convey a similar message about an aggressive and energetic entrepreneur who created a fortune and established the Crosbie-dynasty, there are a few subtle differences when it comes to the sequence and the significance of the events described. In the first sentence: \\"As an aggressive and energetic entrepreneur, he lost a fortune (which he created) and started the Crosbie dynasty.\\" Here, the emphasis is placed on the entrepreneur losing a fortune, which is mentioned before stating that he created it. The sentence then continues by stating that he started the Crosbie dynasty. One could interpret the sequence of events as the entrepreneur losing the fortune and then going on to start the Crosbie dynasty after this loss. In the second sentence: \\"An aggressive and energetic entrepreneur, he created a fortune (which he lost) and founded the Crosbie-dynasty.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the entrepreneur creating the fortune first. The loss of that fortune is written in parentheses, which suggests that it might be less crucial to the overall meaning of the sentence, unlike the first phrasing. Additionally, the verb \\"founded\\" is used instead of \\"started,\\" which again suggests the importance of establishing the dynasty. Despite the similarities in content, the two sentences convey different nuances. The first sentence emphasizes the loss of the fortune and how it potentially led to the entrepreneur establishing the Crosbie dynasty. On the other hand, the second sentence highlights the entrepreneur's fortune creation and focuses on the founding of the Crosbie dynasty afterward. The loss of fortune is less emphasized and might be considered a side note. Overall, while the main idea remains similar, the order and importance of the events differ between the two sentences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: Color in glass may be obtained by addition of electrically charged ions (or color centers) that are homogeneously distributed, and by precipitation of finely dispersed particles (such as in photochromic glasses). Ordinary soda-lime glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further FeO and Cr2O3 additions may be used for the production of green bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere. Manganese dioxide can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron(II) oxide. When used in art glass or studio glass is colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and 'cook' times.

Under pressure from Washington to do more, Nato expanded its operations from the north, west and Kabul to the south a month ago despite nations having only come up with about 85 per cent of military requests for troops and equipment. But alliance leaders acknowledged on Thursday that they had underestimated the strength of Taliban opposition and called on countries to fill remaining commitments amounting to 2,000 to 2,500 troops plus helicopters and transport aircraft. Germany, which leads Nato operations in the relatively quiet north, is seen under pressure to make reinforcements available despite vocal political opposition in Berlin to such a move. Nato commanders until recently insisted that caveats, long a bane of other Nato operations, were not an issue in Afghanistan.

Brushing his teeth, he gives us by voice over a definition of satire. He tells us that with the rise of the Internet, video and interactive games, his field as a television writer has seen a drop in popularity. Meanwhile, in a dilapidated building, squatter Womack (Tommy Davidson) wakes up his friend Manray (Savion Glover) for a day of work. This consists of travelling to the CNS (Continental Network System) building where Delacroix works, and Manray tap dancing to entertain the workers. They then collect money from the workers. The men see Delacroix walk by, and ask him for monetary help in the form of work of some kind.Delacroix walks into a staff meeting late and is immediately castigated by his boss, Thomas Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport). Dunwitty informs the staff that CNS has poor ratings. He says he wants them to write funnier material, and ends the meeting. In the privacy of his office, Dunwitty tells Delacroix that the material Delacroix's been writing for him seems like it's about white people with black faces. Dunwitty asserts that Delacroix is an \\"oreo\\" with his Harvard education, because he won't write a \\"n----r show.\\"The next day, Delacroix and his assistant Sloan Hopkins (Jada Pinkett Smith) talk. They've decided that Manray is the solution to his problem. Delacroix plans to write a show that will be so \\"offensive and racist,\\" it will prove his point that the network only wants to see black buffoons on the air. Delacroix simply hopes to be fired, so he can be let go of his contract with CNS. Manray and Womack ask at the receptionist's desk for a \\"Delapoint\\" and the men working there tell them to step outside. However, Sloan steps into the lobby, sees what's happening, and escorts Manray and Womack to Delacroix's office. Delacroix explains to them that he has an idea for a television pilot, and they can make money with it. His main request is that Manray changes his name to Mantan, in an apparent homage...

A little of the material can break through the surface, but not all. Instead, it begins to move horizontally. The mantle material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. Toward the surface, the mantle material starts to cool. As it cools it sinks back down into the mantle. These areas are where deep sea trench occur. The material sinks back down to the core.

Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Miliband's war on hedge funds could damage City of London “This is potentially much worse than we initially thought. It's effectively FTT by another name,” said one source, who asked not to be named. The Treasury, led by Chancellor George Osborne, has continued to resist the European Union’s attempts to impose the FTT in the UK, for fear of the negative impact it could have on the City of London. It remains unclear how Mr Miliband might restrict the end of the relief solely to hedge funds, given intermediary tax relief benefits a variety of investors. Russell Morgan, EY tax partner, said: \\"While the detail of the proposals isn't clear yet it's going to be hard to design a a new rule that could target only the hedge fund industry and not individual investors and others who choose to invest in UK shares through derivatives for a wide variety of reasons.\\" Jack Inglis, chief executive of AIMA, the hedge fund lobby group, added: “It is misleading to describe this as a measure targeted specifically at hedge funds. This is a well-known investment strategy that is utilised by all levels of market participants including pension funds, insurance companies, traditional asset managers and individual investors.\\" “Labour hit pension funds back in 1997, and spent the last 13 years trying to recover its reputation,” said another source. “I’m surprised they seem to want to do this again.” In all, Labour plans to raise a total of £1.1bn from clamping down on tax avoidance, with the remaining £500m coming from closing the ‘Eurobonds’ loophole which allows large companies to move profits out of the UK – a loophole HM Revenue and Customs ruled against closing two years – and clamping down on so-called ‘umbrella companies.’ The remaining £1.4bn will come from the mansion tax and the tax on tobacco companies. Business big and small moved to rebuff Mr Miliband’s plans, with John Cridland, director general of the CBI questioning the Labour leader’s apparent lack of economic vision. “We heard very little about how to create the economic growth to deliver these ambitions and the crucial role of healthy and thriving businesses in creating prosperity for all.\\" John Longworth, head of the British Chambers of Commerce, concurred, saying “some elements of his speech are likely to be seen as short-term political expediency, and could create uncertainty for business which runs counter to the need for long-term strategic vision and investment.” Those likely to be the losers from Mr Miliband’s policies – which include a further hit on the profits of Britain’s banks – were also less than impressed. Rob Perrins, managing director of house builder Berkeley Group, branded the mansion tax as “misconceived.” \\"The way to grow our economy is to make it competitive and open. Don’t turn property into a liability and penalise the many Londoners who are asset rich but cash poor,” he warned. The tobacco lobby was also not amused, with the Tobacco Manufacturers Association branding the profits tax as “illogical.” Shares in Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco closed down 2.4pc and 2.05pc respectively. Summary:","completion":"Ed Miliband, leader of the UK's opposition Labour party, recently announced that if his party wins the general election, he would attempt to raise £600m (925m) a year ending tax relief on certain shares bought by hedge funds. Miliband claims that the measure is intended to cut spending and provide more funding for the UK's National Health Service (NHS). Experts have, however, suggested that the proposal could lead to a reduction of around 50% in the number of tax reliefs on shares, for a wide range of institutions, not only hedge funds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But in winter, it could not find food. So it came to villages and ate a lot of people. People were so afraid of Nian that they locked their doors before evening came during the winter. One day, an old man came to a village. He told people there that Nian was afraid of three things----the color red, fire and noise. He told people to play drums and gongs, make big fires and set off fireworks to make Nian go away. On a moonless, cold night, Nian went to the village again. As soon as it opened its big mouth, people made loud noises and made fires. Nian was really afraid and ran away. wherever it went, there was noise and fire. When Nian was tired and could not run anymore, people killed the monster. After that, on the coldest day of winter, people beat drums and gongs, and set off fireworks to celebrate the death of the monster of Nian. They put up red lanterns and have a big dinner without sleeping during the night. In the morning people greet each other happily. So now we have the Spring Festival.

We believe by the time Texas is over, we'll be very very competitive in delegate count.\\" More from a lively Sunday morning on the hamster wheel, as per Politico: Gingrich on that moon idea (which SNL loved so much): \\"This was not some slip. This was a deliberate effort to start a conversation.\\" He added, \\"I didn't propose any additional spending.\\" Mike Bloomberg on the Bush tax cuts: Obama should \\"veto any extension of the Bush-era tax cuts. We should all pony up. If you only raise taxes on the rich, you don't get that much money.\\" Ron Paul on the 'intellectual revolution': “There’s a lot of people talking about free-market economics rather than Keynesian welfare-ism and interventionism. There is an intellectual revolution going on with the young people. There are people who have sat on the sidelines for years. It has not been translated into an absolute political change.\\" Santorum on daughter Bella: She's \\"doing great. She had a very rough time just about a week ago. She turned around amazingly quickly. She is home and healthy.” Bob McDonnell on Romney's conservative cred: “He governed as a pro-life governor in a blue state. He cut taxes 19 times and he balanced a budget without raising taxes, eliminating a 3 billion deficit. Speaker Gingrich has been cozying up with Nancy Pelosi on global warming, he called Paul Ryan’s budget ‘social, right-wing engineering.’” Dick Armey on Gingrich: \\"I don't think Newt will be able to replicate that magic moment.

You see, Newt Gingrich doesn't agree with everything Mitt Romney says, but he thinks Mitt would be a better choice than President Obama. Even though they are having a disagreement, Newt is not planning on giving up! He wants to keep going until a big day called Super Tuesday. He hopes that by that time, more people will like him and he'll have more chances to become the leader. Meanwhile, many other people are talking about their ideas too! Like how there should be less spending by the government, or how taxes should be fair for everyone. One man named Ron Paul says, that young people are listening more to the idea of having a free and open market rather than the government taking care of everything.

While going there before this, quitting before this, and eating before this are possible actions, let's have a look at a more detailed and chronological order of the necessary actions and precautions Alex should consider during this process: 1. Acquire accurate information: Alex needs to gather the latest and most accurate information about the natural disaster, its magnitude, and the affected areas. This could mean following news updates, social media, and emergency bulletins. 2. Assess personal safety: Before making a decision, Alex should ensure his own wellbeing and that of his family, making sure that his immediate environment is secure and that he is not putting himself or others at risk by leaving. 3. Identify and research relevant organizations: Alex should identify rescue and relief organizations that have already been mobilized, which may include government agencies, NGOs, and local organizations. Researching their response activities, resources, and channels would help Alex choose the best way to get involved. 4. Acquire necessary training or skills: Depending on the type of assistance needed and the requirements of the organizations responding, Alex should try to acquire any critical training or skills (such as First Aid, crisis management, or lifeguard certification) if he lacks these. 5. Secure necessary resources and equipment: To be most effective, Alex would need to gather and prepare essential resources such as emergency supplies, communication devices, transportation, and personal protective equipment relevant to the specific disaster. 6. Obtain proper authorization: In some cases, it might be necessary for volunteers like Alex to obtain authorization or permits to access disaster-affected areas, adhering to the rules and protocols established by authorities and coordinate with the organizations involved. 7. Notify family and friends: Before embarking, Alex should inform his close ones about his intentions, the expected duration, and how they can contact him. This ensures his safety and helps to minimize worry on their part. 8. Make personal preparations: Alex must make any personal arrangements required before leaving, such as managing work or family responsibilities, making financial arrangements, and packing essentials. In your suggested answers, this is when Alex might choose to quit his job before this or eat before this to make sure personal matters are in order. 9. Coordinate with a chosen organization: Finally, Alex should reach out to the organization he wishes to volunteer with, discussing how and where his skills and resources can be best utilized. This may include coordinating his arrival time, location, and expectations in terms of the roles he will be performing. In summary, before providing hope to the people affected by the natural disaster, Alex should thoroughly prepare himself by gathering accurate information, assessing personal safety, identifying relevant organizations, acquiring necessary training and skills, securing resources, ensuring proper authorizations, notifying family and friends, making personal preparations, and coordinating with the chosen organization."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The sisters worked and waited as the shadow of death lay over the once happy home. It was then that Meg realized how rich she had been in the things which really mattered--love, peace, good health. And Jo, watching her little sister, thought about how unselfish Beth always was--living for others and trying to make home a happy place for all who came there. Amy, sad and lonely at Aunt March's house, just wanted to come home so that she could do something to help Beth. On the first day of December, the doctor came in the morning.

Question: What type of weapon did von Manteuffel and Karl Twesten use in their duel? Passage 1:Sabita Devi (1914–1965) was a Hindi film actress in Indian cinema. She is stated to be one of the \\"prominent\\" leading ladies of the \\"pioneering era\\" of Indian cinema along with Mehtab, Bibbo, Durga Khote, Gohar, Devika Rani and Seeta Devi. A Jewess by birth, she changed her name to find acceptability in Hindi cinema like the other Anglo-Indian and Jewish actresses of her time, Sulochana (Ruby Myers), Seeta Devi (Renee Smith), Madhuri (Beryl Claessen), and Manorama (Erin Daniels). After initially working with British Dominion Films Ltd., Calcutta, she shifted to Bombay and performed mainly in films produced by Sagar Movietone with her co-star in most films being Motilal. Some of the popular films with Motilal were Dr. Madhurika (1935) and Kulvadhu (1937) directed by Sarvottam Badami. Their first film together was Shaher Ka Jadoo (1934), which was also Motilal's debut film, and then Lagna Bandhan (1936) both directed by Kaliprasad Ghosh. She acted in Silver King (1935) with Motilal. It was an action film directed by C. M. Luhar, which became a \\"huge success\\". Passage 2:Promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1852, and colonel (and commanding officer of the 5th Uhlans) in 1853, Manteuffel was sent on important diplomatic missions to Vienna and St Petersburg. In 1857 he was promoted to major-general and chief of the Prussian Military Cabinet (the King's military advisers). He gave strong support to the Prince Regent's plans for the reorganization of the army. In 1861 he was violently attacked in a pamphlet by Karl Twesten (1820–1870), a Liberal leader, whom he had wounded in a duel, for which Manteuffel insisted on being briefly imprisoned. He was promoted to lieutenant-general for the coronation of William I on 18 October 1861 and saw active service in that rank in the Danish War of 1864, then at its conclusion was appointed civil and military governor of Schleswig. In the Austrian War of 1866 he first occupied Holstein and afterwards commanded a division under Vogel von Falkenstein in the Hanoverian campaign, then in July succeeded Vogel in command of the Army of the Main.

He attended Interlochen Center for the Arts as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school. Page holds a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering from the University of Michigan, with honors and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University. While at the University of Michigan, Page created an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks (literally a line plotter), after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges—Page reverse-engineered the ink cartridge, and built all of the electronics and mechanics to drive it. Page served as the president of the Beta Epsilon chapter of the Eta Kappa Nu fraternity, and was a member of the 1993 \\"Maize & Blue\\" University of Michigan Solar Car team. As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a personal rapid transit system, which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger.

Write some highlights for the following article: Last week, we gave you digital tips and tricks for surviving a layoff -- the first seven days, at least. Now, here we are again, an entire Wednesday later, prepared to help you gird your loins for the job search ahead. So, wipe the Cheeto dust from your fingers and peel yourself out of that body-shaped imprint you've made on your bed. Your bout in the ranks of the unemployed probably won't be short -- on average, unemployed workers have been jobless for 40 weeks, a number that hasn't changed much in the last six months. But of course, you should aim to make it as brief as possible. \\"The longer you're laid off, the harder it is to get back in the market,\\" says Nicole Williams, LinkedIn's connection director. Act fast to get the ball rolling before you forget what it feels like to wear real pants and chit-chat over a box of donuts (with other people, that is). One positive note: The whole ordeal might not be as miserable as you think (\\"funemployment,\\" anyone?). Last year, an Australian study found that unemployed folks were actually happier than the drones stuck in miserable jobs. Maybe this'll be the best thing that ever happened to you. (Cheerleader jump! Cheerleader jump! Rah! Rah!) Read on for a few social network to-dos to get you back in the rat race. Target your pleas. Last week we covered strategically letting your circles know about the change in employment status (in short: Be brief, be upbeat, and only tell those who could specifically help you). A similar principle is at play as you're seeking out potential business contacts to bug. \\"A mistake a lot of people make is just contacting everyone they can find with a generic note,\\" Williams says. A better approach: Figure out something (or someone) you have in common with the individual, and send a personalized note along with your Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn request. \\"You have to get them to be interested in your situation,\\" she adds, \\"because people are busy, and why should they worry about your career?\\" Stalk potential employers. Not literally, of course. But when job-searching online, most people tend to think about job boards such as Monster.com and Craigslist.com. While there's nothing wrong with keeping an eye out for appropriate openings (and plenty of people indeed find new gigs on such sites), massive job listings are often a slang word that rhymes with \\"duster-duck\\" -- meaning they're disorganized, crowded and teeming with humanity. Sometimes a job will be posted days after the hiring managers have made a decision, when corporate policy requires it. Months-old listings will mysteriously float to the top long after they've been filled. And in the journalism world, for example, a listing on industry tracker MediaBistro.com can yield hundreds of enthusiastic applications. Go ahead and wade in the morass of job aggregators, but we recommend taking a more targeted approach in the meantime. Brainstorm some corporations that should be dying to hire you, and figure out how you can keep dibs on them. \\"That way you'll be privy to any movement in jobs or anything they're doing industry-wise,\\" Williams says. If the company's striking out on a new project that matches your skills, you have an in to request an informational interview with a higher-up over there, for example. And if you note that someone with your dream job just departed for Company X, you can swoop in. Poke around their website for an RSS feed of company news and add it to your own feed reader (such as Google Reader) for easy stalk-age. Follow the company on LinkedIn (go to the company tab along the top, search, and follow) to see who's leaving (and who will, presumably, leave behind a vacancy), and what current employees are in your circle -- they're your goldmines in the \\"Whom do I address this cover letter to?\\" game. Downplay the layoff in your job apps. Here's the thing: If you're the right candidate, then you're the right candidate -- whether you're currently at another company or currently signing up for market research focus groups to pay the bills between rounds of job-searching. While there's no shame in having been let go (at this point, we all know upstanding employees who fell victim to the economy), your cover letter should shimmer with hireability, not with the grayish Braille of woe-is-me teardrops. Think of it this way: If you come across as defensive, insecure or bitter about the layoff, you'll raise all sorts of red flags in a hiring manager's mind. But if you're bursting with confidence and talent and good ideas (and, oh yeah, it comes up in the interview that you're looking for a new job because you don't have one but the job termination was circumstantial and, hey, here's a recommendation letter from your former boss), you seem like the kind of employee who always lands on his feet. And in this earthquake of an economy, a little catlike agility is a very good thing.","completion":"Article Highlights: 1.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the site for which the responsible Trust warden has chosen to leave the patch of scorched earth rather than seeding it over?

Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves.

Amdoxovir will pass onto Phase III clinical studies.","completion":"To infer whether Amdoxovir will pass onto Phase III clinical studies, we must approach this step-by-step and analyze the available information: Step 1: Understand the drug development process Clinical trials are typically conducted in four phases: 1. Phase I: Assessing safety and dosage 2. Phase II: Testing efficacy and side effects 3. Phase III: Confirming effectiveness, monitoring side effects, and comparing to commonly used treatments 4. Phase IV: Post-marketing monitoring of drug safety and effectiveness Step 2: Analyze Amdoxovir's current status Amdoxovir is currently in Phase II clinical studies. This phase primarily focuses on evaluating the drug's efficacy and side effects in a larger group of people, to determine if it should move to Phase III. Step 3: Consider factors influencing progression to Phase III There are several factors that may influence whether Amdoxovir will move to Phase III clinical studies, such as: 1. Study results: Positive results from the Phase II trial that show the drug is effective and relatively safe would support moving to Phase III. 2. Funding: Sufficient financial backing for further development. 3. Regulatory approval: Meeting regulatory body's criteria for progression to the next phase. 4. Drug development strategy: The decisions made by RFS Pharma and any potential partners or investors on pursuing the drug's development. Step 4: Conclusion Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively infer that Amdoxovir will pass onto Phase III clinical studies. The progression to Phase III will depend on the success of the Phase II studies and other factors such as funding, regulatory approval, and the drug development strategy of RFS Pharma.

Input: Unsupervised domain adaptation has received significant attention in recent years. Most of existing works tackle the closed-set scenario, assuming that the source and target domains share the exactly same categories. In practice, nevertheless, a target domain often contains samples of classes unseen in source domain (i.e., unknown class). The extension of domain adaptation from closed-set to such open-set situation is not trivial since the target samples in unknown class are not expected to align with the source. In this paper, we address this problem by augmenting the state-of-the-art domain adaptation technique, Self-Ensembling, with category-agnostic clusters in target domain. Specifically, we present Self-Ensembling with Category-agnostic Clusters (SE-CC) --- a novel architecture that steers domain adaptation with the additional guidance of category-agnostic clusters that are specific to target domain. These clustering information provides domain-specific visual cues, facilitating the generalization of Self-Ensembling for both closed-set and open-set scenarios. Technically, clustering is firstly performed over all the unlabeled target samples to obtain the category-agnostic clusters, which reveal the underlying data space structure peculiar to target domain. A clustering branch is capitalized on to ensure that the learnt representation preserves such underlying structure by matching the estimated assignment distribution over clusters to the inherent cluster distribution for each target sample. Furthermore, SE-CC enhances the learnt representation with mutual information maximization. Extensive experiments are conducted on Office and VisDA datasets for both open-set and closed-set domain adaptation, and superior results are reported when comparing to the state-of-the-art approaches. Output:","completion":"This study introduces Self-Ensembling with Category-agnostic Clusters (SE-CC), a novel architecture for domain adaptation that addresses open-set scenarios and improves performance on both closed-set and open-set domain adaptations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.\\", answer the following question.

In this problem, we have two lists and we need to find the LCS of the two lists. We start with the first element of the first list and see if it's the same as the first element of the second list. If they are the same, we add the element to our LCS and move to the next element of both lists. If they are not the same, we move to next element in the second list and do the comparison again until we find a match. We continue this process until we reached the end of either list.

Question: who framed Muff for the murder Movie plot title: Tom Sawyer Movie plot: Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn play hooky from school and have a plan to revive a dead cat with the spirit of a man named Hoss Williams who is on his death bed. Sawyer and Finn talk with Muff Potter, the town drunk, but are interrupted when Injun Joe says that Doc Robinson wants to see them. Muff and Joe meet Robinson and he informs them that they have a job to dig the grave of Williams. Joe is angry that Robinson didn't fix his leg correctly. Meanwhile, Tom continues to skip school and comes up with fantastic stories about why he's not home for dinner, where he tricks the children of the town to do his punishment chores for him. After Williams dies, the two go to the cemetery and find out that Muff and Joe are digging up a grave on the advice of Robinson. Joe continues to be angry at Robinson and demands more money for the job. When Robinson refuses, Injun Joe picks up a shovel, accidentally knocking Muff out, hits Doc Robinson into the grave with the shovel, then grabs Muff's knife and jumps in after Doc Robinson. Tom and Huck witness all this and then run off, making a pact not to tell anyone what they saw. Joe frames Muff for the murder and Muff goes to jail. Meanwhile, the beautiful Becky Thatcher moves to town which sends Sawyer into a romantic daze. At the trial for Muff, Tom is unable to contain himself as Joe is called to the stand and lies about the incident, continuing to frame Muff for the murder. As Tom is called to the stand, he relates what happened, not mentioning that Huck was with him. Suddenly, Injun Joe throws a knife at Tom, narrowly missing Tom's head and jumps out the window of the courthouse, fleeing.

Part #2: Make the incorrect answer relevant and similar to the associated fact. Usage: Sample response: \\"tilting of the axis\\". This answer is relevant and similar to the associated fact because it involves the axis of the planet, but it focuses on tilting instead of spinning. Part #3: Make the incorrect answer similar to the correct answer. Usage: Sample response: \\"wobbling on its axis\\".

Usage: Sample response: \\"changing of the seasons\\". This answer is incorrect for causing day and night cycles, as it is related to the planet's position and tilt during its orbit, not the spinning on its axis. Part #5: Make sure the incorrect answer sounds reasonable. Usage: Sample response: \\"orbital movement\\".

Read this: The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression, as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion. Many wars, and especially the Thirty Years' War, disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times. War, plague, famine, regicide, and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts. This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state. As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent. Although the older student-controlled universities still existed, they slowly started to move toward this structural organization.

Israel, on the other hand, is calling for a complete disarmament of Hamas and its allied militants to ensure the security of its citizens. The property damage in Gaza City is a stark reminder of the devastating impact this prolonged conflict has had on the lives of ordinary people. Thousands of homes, businesses, and public infrastructure have been destroyed, leaving many families displaced and struggling to rebuild their lives. With both sides accusing each other of violating the temporary ceasefire, the prospects for achieving a lasting peace remain slim. International diplomats are working tirelessly to broker a deal that would bring an end to the hostilities and address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The United Nations, the United States, and other global powers are urging both parties to compromise and find a meaningful resolution. In the meantime, aid organizations, such as the Red Crescent and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), are trying to provide basic assistance and support to the affected civilians. Their efforts, however, are hampered by the ongoing violence, travel restrictions, and the overall scarcity of resources in the region. As the world watches in horror at the unfolding crisis, it becomes more apparent that diplomatic efforts must be intensified to bring about a just and lasting solution not only for Gaza but for the region as a whole.

Information: - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - The Northern Isles is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile). - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Lake Island is an island on the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea. - Scalpay ( Scottish Gaelic : Sgalpaigh ) is an island in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland . - The Outer Hebrides, also known as the Western Isles (Scottish Gaelic: ' or ' ), \\"Innse Gall\\" (\\"islands of the strangers\\") or the Long Isle or Long Island (Gaelic: \\"An t-Eilean Fada\\"), is an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotland. The islands are geographically coextensive with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, one of the 32 unitary council areas of Scotland. They form part of the Hebrides, separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the waters of the Minch, the Little Minch and the Sea of the Hebrides. Scottish Gaelic is the predominant spoken language, although in a few areas English speakers form a majority. - An oceanic climate (also known as marine, west coast and maritime) is the climate typical of west coasts in higher middle latitudes of continents, and generally features cool summers (relative to their latitude) and cool but not cold winters, with a relatively narrow annual temperature range and few extremes of temperature, with the exception for transitional areas to continental and subarctic climates. Oceanic climates are defined as having a monthly mean temperature below in the warmest month, and above in the coldest month. - A cay (or ), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef.

Context: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Here is a news article: Sad news from Paris this morning: Kate Barry, the 46-year-old daughter of style icon Jane Birkin and James Bond composer John Barry, was found dead on Wednesday evening. Police confirm that Barry, a fashion photographer whose work appeared in Vogue and The Sunday Times Magazine, suffered a fatal fall from her fourth-floor flat in Paris’s 16th arrondissement. Police are currently investigating the specific cause of death. It has been reported that Barry lived alone and that antidepressants were found in her flat. A24 writes that Barry “suffered from drug and alcohol problems, which later prompted her to found an addiction treatment centre outside Paris.” After her parents separated in 1967, the year after she was born, Barry was reportedly raised by Birkin and her partner, the late French singer Serge Gainsbourg, to whom Birkin was a muse. Barry is survived by her mother, who lived several miles away from her, a 26-year-old son Roman de Kermadec, and her half-sisters Charlotte Gainsbourg and Lou Douillon, Birkin’s daughter with director Jacques Doillon. Of Kate, Birkin has previously said, “My eldest daughter, Kate, looks most like me. She’s a photographer. She had a Polaroid camera in her hand from a young age and photographed her sisters all the time.” When asked by Vanity Fair about her greatest achievement, in the magazine’s September issue this year, Jane Birkin answered, “My three girls and, personally, lasting so long in this profession with limited talent.” Related: The Proust Questionnaire: Jane Birkin ||||| Photographer Kate Barry, the daughter of actress Jane Birkin - partner of late French singer Serge Gainsbourg - and composer John Barry, has died aged 46 after falling from her fourth floor Paris flat, police said Thursday. Kate Barry, the photographer daughter of singer-actress Jane Birkin and James Bond film composer John Barry, has died after falling from her fourth floor Paris flat, police said Thursday. The 46-year-old’s body was found beneath her flat in the city's wealthy 16th district on Wednesday evening. She lived alone and anti-depressants were discovered inside her flat, which was locked from the inside, police said. An investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of death. Barry was the daughter of British-born Birkin, best known as the muse and partner of late French singer Serge Gainsbourg, and British composer John Barry, famous for writing 11 James Bond movie themes including 'Goldfinger' and 'Diamonds Are Forever'. Her parents separated in 1967, the year of Kate Barry's birth, and she was brought up until her teenage years by Birkin and Gainsbourg – at the time the most famous couple in France known as much for their bohemian and hedonistic lifestyle as for their work. Barry had studied fashion but later turned to photography, something she had been interested in since childhood, starting out with Gainsbourg's Polaroid camera. Her work has been featured in numerous magazines including British Vogue and the Sunday Times magazine, and were recently on exhibition in Paris. “As a child, I was photographed a lot. That must have left an impression,” she told the French newspaper Liberation in 2012. She also suffered from drug and alcohol problems, which later prompted her to found an addiction treatment centre outside Paris. French Culture Minister Aurélie Filippetti paid tribute to Barry in a statement Thursday, saying that her \\"loving and heartfelt thoughts\\" were with a \\"family we all love\\". \\"Her fragility touched us,\\" Filippetti said, adding that Barry was an outstanding photographer whose \\"sense of light and composition was very pictorial\\".

Article: Children whose minds wander might have sharper brains, a research suggests. A study has found that people who appear to be often distracted have more \\"working memory\\", giving them the ability to hold a lot of information in their heads and control it cleverly. Children at school need this type of memory on a daily basis for a variety of tasks, such as following teachers' instructions or remembering dictated sentences. During the study, volunteers were asked to perform one simple task during which researchers kept asking if their minds were wandering. At the end, volunteers measured their working memory capacity by their ability to remember a series of letters mixed with simple maths questions. Daniel Levinson, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the United States, said that those with higher working memory capacity reported \\"more mind wandering during these simple tasks\\", but their performance did not _ . The results, published online in the journal Psychological Science, appear to confirm former research that found working memory allows humans to deal with multiple thoughts at the same time.

Pick your answer from: + yes; + it is not possible to tell; + no;","completion":"The premise, \\"Yes, he was!\\" is quite ambiguous as there is no clear indication about the subject or context. On the other hand, the hypothesis, \\"Yes, he was in the newspaper!\\" provides a clearer context, implying someone being featured in a newspaper. The relationship between the premise ('Yes, he was!') and the hypothesis, \\"Yes, he was in the newspaper!\\" cannot be directly inferred as it lacks contextual information. Given the limited information available, it is not possible to tell whether the premise entails the hypothesis. The ambiguous nature of the phrase \\"Yes, he was!\\" means that it could apply to numerous different scenarios and contexts. It could be concerning a person’s achievement, recognition, or appearance in any medium or location. It might relate to being in the newspaper, but it could also relate to being on television, taking part in an event, achieving a milestone, or something else entirely. In order to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we would need more information on the context and subject of the discussion. For example, if there was a dialogue or conversation where one person asks, \\"Was he in the newspaper today?\\" and the other person replies, \\"Yes, he was!\\" it would then be reasonable to say that the premise entails the hypothesis. However, without that specific context, it is impossible to determine whether the premise and hypothesis are connected. So, in this case, my answer would be that it is not possible to tell whether the premise entails the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Step 2: Understand the question The question asks what will be more available in an area when rain is common. In other words, we need to determine what will be more abundant in an environment with higher rainfall, as opposed to the desert environment described in the fact. Step 3: Analyze the options [I] dirt - Dirt is common in both desert and areas with rain, so it may not be the most accurate answer. [II] air - Air is available everywhere, and the amount of rainfall doesn't significantly affect its availability. [III] h2o - Since rain is water (H₂O), an area with rain has more water than a desert environment.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

This entire process is known as photosynthesis, which is essential for the growth and survival of plants and also helps sustain life on Earth, since oxygen is a byproduct of this process. Photosynthesis can be divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, which take place in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast, the chlorophyll molecules absorb sunlight and initiate a series of energy transfers through the electron transport chain. This energy is used to generate ATP and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), both of which are vital energy carriers for cells. The light-independent reactions, or the Calvin cycle, take place in the stroma of the chloroplast. During these reactions, the ATP and NADPH produced during the light-dependent reactions are used to fix carbon dioxide into an organic molecule, a process called carbon fixation. The fixed carbon is then used to create glucose and other sugar molecules through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Glucose serves as an energy source and a building block for plants. It can be used directly for energy or stored as starch for later use. Some of the glucose is used to generate other essential molecules, such as cellulose (a component of plant cell walls) and various proteins and lipids required for proper plant growth and development. As a byproduct of these reactions, oxygen is formed, which is released into the atmosphere through the plant's stomata. Oxygen is essential for maintaining life on Earth, as it serves as a primary component in the process of aerobic cellular respiration, which is how most organisms, including humans, generate the energy necessary for their survival and growth. Additionally, the release of oxygen into the atmosphere has had a significant impact on the evolution of life, contributing to the development of the Earth's atmosphere and enabling the emergence of more complex, oxygen-dependent organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: We Chat, the Chinese social media smartphone app, saw an increase in user numbers of 41 per cent year on year to 500m at the end of 2014, in a sign that parent company Tencent is extending its reach for the mobile internet. Revenue grew 24 per cent to Rmb20.98billion, slightly higher than forecasts, driven mainly by online gaming revenues. It is unclear how much WeChat contributed to Tencent's revenues but the app's growth is a strong indicator of the company's long-term health as it tries to adjust its business to be more suitable for mobile devices. \\"We extended our leadership in games and online media, and made breakthroughs in emerging platforms such as online security . . . and mobile payments,\\" Ma Huateng, Tencent chairman, said in a statement. WeChat is the second highest ranked app in China, behind QQ, Tencent's other chatting app, which claimed to have 815m registered monthly users at the end of 2014. However, that figure is more than the total number of internet users in China, which the government puts at 640million. Tencent has been unwilling to earn money through WeChat by flooding it with advertising, which could reduce efforts to increase the user base. But this is expected to change. Some analysts predicted that advertising would be introduced on later this year. Early attempts to test ads on the service have not always gone smoothly. After a BMW ad was introduced on some users' feeds in January, many users complained of \\"discrimination\\" by Tencent's data mining algorithm. They said it unfairly considered them as not wealthy or successful enough to view the sought-after BMW ad. Options: A WeChat contributed most to Tencent's profits.

Does the word \\"give\\" mean the same thing in \\"I'm going to give my wife a necklace for her birthday.\\" and \\"He gives of his energies to the organization.\\"? Choose your answer from: *different meanings. *the same meaning.","completion":"The word \\"give\\" in the two sentences provided has different meanings. In the first sentence, \\"I'm going to give my wife a necklace for her birthday,\\" the word \\"give\\" is used to denote the act of physically presenting or handing over an object, such as a gift, to someone. In this context, give is a concrete action, where one person is transferring the possession of an item or a gift to another person. This is a common usage of the word, and it is easy to visualize the action that is taking place. The focus is on the tangible object being given, in this case, a necklace. In the second sentence, \\"He gives of his energies to the organization,\\" the word \\"give\\" is used in a more abstract sense. Here, \\"give\\" refers to the act of dedicating or investing one's time, effort, or energy into something or someone. The focus in this context is on the intangible contribution that the person is making to the organization by exerting their energies in support of its goals and objectives. This usage of \\"give\\" implies a more figurative action, as it is not associated with a physical object or a literal transfer of possession. In summary, while the word \\"give\\" serves as a central verb in both sentences and is related to the idea of handing over or transferring something to someone else, it carries different meanings in each sentence. The first sentence refers to a concrete action of handing over a tangible object, while the second sentence conveys the abstract notion of dedicating one's energies or resources to a particular cause or entity. Therefore, the word \\"give\\" carries different meanings in these two sentences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer based on context: The Redskins kicked off their 2015 regular season by hosting the Miami Dolphins. After a Kai Forbath field goal put the Redskins up 3-0, they got the ball back, and newly minted starting quarterback Kirk Cousins threw a deep pass to DeSean Jackson. The ball was overthrown, and Jackson sustained a hamstring injury while stretching out to attempt to catch it. Early in the second quarter, Cousins was intercepted by Miami cornerback Brent Grimes at the Redskins' 25-yard-line, continuing a trend from previous seasons of turnovers and ill-advised throws. Grimes returned the interception 11 yards to the 14-yard-line, but the Dolphins failed to score any points off of the turnover. Near the end of the first half, with Washington still nursing a 3-0 lead, Cousins tossed a 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jordan Reed, putting the Redskins up 10-0. Miami scored right before halftime, with Ryan Tannehill throwing a 3-yard touchdown pass to receiver Rishard Matthews with 27 seconds remaining. Washington led 10-7 entering halftime. Miami got the ball to begin the second half, and on 3rd and 7 from the Miami 45-yard-line, Tannehill threw deep down the right sideline to former Pro Bowl tight end Jordan Cameron for a gain of 27. However, on 3rd and 4 from the Redskins' 22-yard-line, inside of Miami kicker Andrew Franks' range, defensive end Jason Hatcher forced a Tannehill fumble that was bobbled all the way back to the Miami 40 and recovered by Redskins rookie outside linebacker Preston Smith. The Redskins did not capitalize, however, losing two yards on an Alfred Morris run and two short Cousins passes. On their next possession, Washington drove to the Miami 22-yard-line&#8212;easily inside Forbath's range&#8212;but three consecutive penalties pushed them back 24 yards and forced a punt, squandering a valuable chance to extend the lead. On the ensuing drive, Franks converted a 22-yard field goal attempt to tie the score at 10-10 entering the fourth quarter. The Redskins continued to have no success on offense, resulting in a punt to Dolphins receiver Jarvis Landry, who fielded the ball at the Miami 31-yard-line, broke a few tackles and burst into the clear for a 69-yard score and a 17-10 Dolphins lead. On 3rd and 13 from their own 29-yard-line, with a chance to cut into or tie the Dolphins' lead, Cousins threw to the endzone for Pierre Gar&#231;on, but the ball was intercepted by Miami cornerback Brice McCain, ending the Redskins attempt at a potential field goal to narrow the deficit. That ended up being Washington's best chance, as they could not score on any of their subsequent possessions. Miami scored 17 unanswered points and shut out the Redskins in the second half to win 17-10 and win their third straight season opener under coach Joe Philbin. Washington, by contrast, lost in Week 1 for the third consecutive season and for the second straight time under head coach Jay Gruden. After the game, it was announced that receiver DeSean Jackson would miss several weeks with his hamstring injury, and that kicker Kai Forbath had been released and replaced by former Buffalo Bills and New Orleans Saints kicker Dustin Hopkins.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Jeb Bush's Presidential Campaign Prospects Bet Big On Joy At a time like this, joy is an awfully strange thing to build a presidential campaign around. But here’s Jeb Bush, and he just can’t stop talking about that most delightful and fleeting of human emotions as he edges towards becoming the Republican frontrunner in 2016. It started months ago, when he began speculating in public over whether the country, and his own party, could handle a candidate with a “hopeful, optimistic message.” “In my case that means, can one do it joyfully?” he told The Today Show in April. He slipped from the spotlight, but never dropped the talking point. In November, he mentioned the “joy in my heart” when asked by the Wall Street Journal about a presidential run. Then on Monday, at a commencement address in the primary state of South Carolina, he implored students to reach for joy in all they did. “I think we need to have candidates lift our spirits,” he said, one day before announcing his formal intention to explore a campaign. “It’s a pretty pessimistic country right now.” That’s the bet of the third man named Bush to pursue the presidency in three decades. After a 13 years of relentlessly bad news and increasingly divisive politics, the former Sunshine State governor thinks the country might just be ready for some sunshine of its own. Joy will be his weapon against who accuse him of ideological weakness, hereditary entitlement or establishment blandness. If he ever does face Hillary Clinton in a general election campaign, he can repurpose the vibe to counter rival whose laugh has been so honed by political necessity as to echo in mechanical rhythms. Relentless and even irrational optimism, of course, is not a novel pose for a presidential contender, but it is hard to remember a candidate so committed to a psychological analysis of the political landscape this early in the cycle. To hear Bush tell it, the nation is “mopey,” beaten down by war, economic stagnation and the furious politics that accompany each. To Bush, the solutions are right in front of all of us, if only we can pop some Prozac and kick the blues: Reform the immigration system to flood the nation with brilliant entrepreneurs from a abroad, open the taps of domestic energy production, kick the K-12 education system in the rear and fix the tax, regulatory and entitlement nonsense that hangs like a weight around our future. “We are moping around like we are France,” he said on Dec. 1. “The crisis of opportunity is we are not seizing the moment. We are not aspiring to be young and dynamic again.” To his own party, the shrink’s critique has a neat corollary. “You don’t do well in bringing people together if you are carping, criticizing, turning around and saying you are not as good as me,” he said in an interview with Florida reporters broadcast on Sunday. That line of attack—which transfers the fight from ideology to feeling—could serve him well in what is certain to be a brutal primary against a monstrously unwieldy field of politicians far more conservative, religious and attuned to tapping the ever-evolving grassroots Id than him. It’s also a message that is likely to work against his most fearsome rival for the establishment crown, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whose spirit animal is more carnivorous than cuddly. “He is going to be a very effective candidate if he runs, because he is going to talk about the future without backing down or pandering to the Tea Party side,” explains Charlie Black, a Republican lobbyist who’s long run in presidential politics started in 1976 on the Ronald Reagan campaign. The question for Bush is whether there are enough Republicans left, and partial to voting in early primary states, who will put the promise of glee before their deep feelings of grievance and need for reform. Bush last ran for public office in 2002, long before conservatives, libertarians and the Tea Party decided that his family’s tradition of big government conservatism was the problem, not the solution. As Bush has wisely observed, his best route victory in 2016 will require him to lose the debate stage policy argument in the primary while still finding a way to get more votes. That’s a tough circle to square if all you are working with are facts and figures. But joy exists outside the realm of what is. That’s why we all seek it out: To make something else of who we are. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Jeb Bush, who is part of the Bush family, wanted to be president in 2016. He thought that by talking about happiness and joy, he could get people to support him. Many people were feeling unhappy because of things like wars and problems in the country, so he believed that his hopeful message could help lift their spirits. However, he faced challenges from other people who wanted to be president, and he needed to convince voters that his ideas for making things better were the right ones."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The rise in regulated fares had already been capped at July's Retail Prices Index inflation rate of 1.9%. Unregulated fares face no cap. Campaigners said passengers would be disappointed by the increase. \\"Passengers will now want to see the industry's investment deliver a more reliable day-to-day railway,\\" said Anthony Smith, chief executive of the watchdog Transport Focus. \\"The government should consider setting rail fare rises around the Consumer Prices Index instead to bring rail fares into line with other recognised measures of inflation.\\" Lizzie Green, a London commuter, said: \\"Given that the trains are so irregular and the delays are so often it seems like a bit of a cheeky increase.\\" Some unregulated fares are likely to rise by considerably more than 2.3%. That far outstrips the inflation rate, which is currently running at 0.9%, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index. The pace of fare increases has slowed a little in recent years, but it follows a decade's worth of steeper rises which began in 2004. It's all because successive governments have changed the way they split the bill for running the service, so that passengers pay more and other taxpayers pay less. About 70% of the total network cost is met from ticket sales now. It used to be about 50%. Ministers are spending record amounts upgrading the service, which is creaking under huge demand for train travel that no-one saw coming. But it hasn't stopped punctuality levels falling well below target. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said the industry was working to simplify fares and improve services. \\"We understand how passengers feel when fares go up, and we know that in some places they haven't always got the service they pay for,\\" said Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group. \\"Around 97p in every pound passengers pay goes back into running and improving services.\\" The overall 2.3% increase covers fares in England and Wales and Scottish policy as expected at the moment. Northern Ireland is treated separately. Authorities in Scotland can set their own fare increases. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \\"No final decision has been taken on next year's fares in Scotland and we are looking at options before the end of the year.\\" She added that the government would consider a fare freeze if it could \\"enable us to reduce costs to passengers while still delivering our ambitious infrastructure programme\\". Meanwhile, more than 84,000 passengers on Southern Rail are to receive compensation for the disruption they have experienced during 2016. The government said the delays were caused by \\"Network Rail track failures, engineering works, unacceptably poor performance by the operator and the actions of the RMT union.\\" It has set aside Â£15m to pay commuters. Season ticket holders will be able to claim a month's compensation, directly into their bank account. To qualify, customers must have paid for at least 12 weeks of travel, between 24 April and 31 December 2016. From 11 December passengers on Southern Rail will additionally be able to claim compensation if their train is more than 15 minutes late.

Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Yes, both sentences essentially hold the same meaning. Both imply that the original source of the narrative is a novel written by Robert Suhosky, and this novel has later been adapted into a different format, specifically a script or screenplay, by James Hardiman. The only difference between the two sentences is the choice of words: while one mentions 'script', the other uses 'screenplay'. However, in the context of cinema or theater, both terms are often used interchangeably. Here, it would be worthwhile to delve a bit more into the difference between the phrases 'turned into a script' and 'turned into a screenplay'. Despite being used interchangeable in many contexts, 'script' and 'screenplay' technically represent different concepts within the realm of film-making. A script typically represents the written text of a play, broadcast, or film including dialogues and directions, and can include various forms of media like television, radio, and theater. On the other hand, a screenplay is specifically the script of a movie that includes camera directions as well as stage directions and it is written specifically for producing a film. However, these technical nuances do not make any significant difference to the meaning of the sentences you presented. In both instances, James Hardiman is portrayed as the person responsible for reformatting the content of Robert Suhosky's novel for a different medium, likely a film or play.

Walter's simple goal is to go into business as a mechanic at a nearby garage. Willy's younger sister, Rose, shows up unexpectedly. She and Walter immediately hit it off. The obsessively protective Willy doesn't want his kid sister falling for some \\"grease monkey\\" mechanic and two-bit boxer. Dolly is envious of the young couple's romance and resents Willy's interference. One day, Walter, in need of work, accepts an offer of five dollars to be a sparring partner and decks one of Willy's top fighters. Willy is persuaded to let this \\"Galahad\\" take a shot in a legitimate ring. Both men are reluctant, but each has a need for the money. Walter begins working out under the watchful eye of Willy's top trainer, Lew. After several successes in the ring, Walter is readied for his biggest fight. Gangsters want him to take a dive so that Willy can pay off his debts to them, but \\"Galahad\\" throws his muscle behind Willy and emerges victorious. He wins the big fight against Ramon \\"Sugar Boy\\" Romero as well as Willy's approval, retiring undefeated to his vintage car and his new love. Answer:","completion":"What challenges does Walter Gulick face as he pursues his passion for working on old cars and enters the world of boxing under the guidance of Willy Grogan, and how do his relationships with Rose, Dolly, and the gangsters play a role in his journey to emerging victorious in the ring and winning Willy's approval?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

[II] it is not possible to tell. [III] no.","completion":"[III] no. To clarify the reasons behind this answer, let's analyze both sentences separately: Sentence 1: \\"FOUR GENERATIONS OF MAINE FISHERMEN COULD BE WRONG\\" This sentence suggests a possibility that the fishermen from the past four generations may have been incorrect about something (this \\"something\\" is not specified). The use of the word \\"could\\" implies that it may or may not be true; it is uncertain whether they are indeed wrong. Sentence 2: \\"The fishermen have all been correct in the past four generations.\\" This sentence states that the fishermen in question have been right or accurate in whatever information or predictions they have made over the past four generations. It assumes that there has been a history of correctness among the fishermen and that their experiences and knowledge have been reliable. Now, when comparing these two sentences, they represent two conflicting statements. Sentence 1 questions the accuracy of the fishermen's knowledge, while sentence 2 expresses certainty in their correctness. If Sentence 1 is true, it posits a possibility that the fishermen could be incorrect; this would inherently contradict the second sentence, which claims that they have all been correct.

When Goemans noticed her infant son's two-hour screaming fits, she decided to take him to the doctor. After ultrasounds and X-rays revealed a loop in Dominic's bowels filled with air and fluid, Goemans was instructed to rush him to the ER. However, faced with financial constraints after losing her job at 28 weeks pregnant, the mother of three found it difficult to afford the hospital's 15 parking fee. Instead, she fed a street meter with enough change for four hours, hoping that would allow her enough time for the ER visit. It quickly became apparent that treating Dominic would take longer than anticipated. Worried about her car potentially being towed, Goemans turned to social media for help. She reached out to a local moms’ Facebook group, as reported by Today. What followed was an inspiring show of empathy, as over the next several hours, five women went to Goemans' car in a tag-team effort to feed the meter. Meanwhile, 100 people posted comments offering encouragement, as well as assistance with errands, coffee, and food. Reflecting on the overwhelming response, Goemans told CBS News, \\"It made my situation so much less stressful—so I was able to focus on my son's needs and not about the car being towed.\\" Dominic was diagnosed with intussusception, a condition in which part of the intestine is inverted, and a heart murmur. This means that the family will continue to face numerous doctor visits in the future. However, Goemans can take solace in the fact that her son is growing up in a community where people genuinely care for each other. \\"It's a rough world right now, and we only have each other in it,\\" Goemans stated. \\"We need to show the next generation how important it is to help others who need it.\\" The actions of the Barrie moms’ group serve as a reminder of the power of empathy and solidarity, particularly in times of difficulty and uncertainty.

In the view of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main influences were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.Although when he chose, Massenet could write noisy and dissonant scenes – in 1885 Bernard Shaw called him \\"one of the loudest of modern composers\\" – much of his music is soft and delicate. Hostile critics have seized on this characteristic, but the article on Massenet in the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians observes that in the best of his operas this sensual side \\"is balanced by strong dramatic tension (as in Werther), theatrical action (as in Thérèse), scenic diversion (as in Esclarmonde), or humour (as in Le portrait de Manon).\\"Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly attracted by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists a great number of locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices. Answer:","completion":"Macdonald."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think carefully about your wife's responsibilities and limitations when deciding how many hours she can reasonably commit to working each week. If you have children, think about when your wife will need to be home to care for them. If she needs to be able to pick them up from school everyday, a full-time schedule may not work. If your wife is recovering from an illness, be sure to consider how many hours she will be able to work without further damaging her health. Don't push her to do more than her body can handle. Keep in mind that there are other options besides full-time and part-time employment. Depending on your wife's skills and your family's financial situation, she may be able to find work-at-home opportunities or even start her own business. The last thing you want is for your wife to go back to a job or industry she hates, so be sure to discuss whether or not she was happy at her last job. Your wife will be much more willing to return to work if she can do a job that she genuinely enjoys. If she enjoyed her last job, encourage her to contact her previous employer to find out if there are any job openings that would be right for her. If this is not an option, brainstorm other job opportunities that would offer similar rewards and challenges. If she did not enjoy her last job, talk about what it was that she didn't like. It's important to understand if she didn't like the specific company she was working for or if she didn't like the kind of work she was doing. If she didn't like the kind of work she was doing, she may need to pursue something completely different. If your wife has been out of work for an extended period of time, going back to the same kind of work that she used to do might not be the right fit for her anymore. Sit down with your wife and discuss what has changed for her since she last worked. She may have discovered a new passion during her time away from the workforce. If this is the case, brainstorm different job opportunities that would allow her to pursue this passion. Your wife may also have different priorities now than she once did. For example, she may not be interested in returning to a job that requires constant travel if she wants to be able to spend more time with the family. If this is the case, brainstorm job opportunities that would utilize her skills, but would not require travel. If your wife needs help deciding what she wants to do, encourage her to see a career counselor. If your financial situation is urgent, your wife may not have the luxury of being able to wait around for the perfect job. If this is the case for your family, sit down with your wife and talk about the possibility of her taking a temporary job to help pay the bills. Make sure she understands that you want her to continue looking for her dream job while she is working at her temporary job.

The focus of the sentence is the young boy who is playing soccer, likely in a competitive or recreational context, but the presence of the three opponents is also a crucial part of the sentence, directly affecting the boy's actions in the scenario. Engaging in a detailed analysis of both the sentence and the scenario it describes can provide additional insight into why this particular sentence is true. 1. Narrative context: The sentence paints a vivid picture of a young boy skillfully handling a soccer ball, possibly during a soccer match or practice, while trying to evade or outmaneuver his opponents. The opponents' presence is crucial to the action and helps define the challenge or potential conflict in the narrative. 2. Semantic relation: The phrase \\"3 opponents\\" is central to understanding the argument or statement being made in the original sentence. Without this information, it would be difficult to discern whether the boy is playing alone, practicing, or participating in a game against other players. By acknowledging the presence of the opponents, we contextualize the boy's actions and the environment in which the scenario unfolds. 3. Quantitative aspect: The number \\"3\\" is a specific quantitative descriptor that is essential for understanding the situation in the original sentence. There are exactly three opponents in the scene, and this information denotes the exact number of adversaries the boy is contending with, giving the readers or listeners a better sense of the environment. In conclusion, based on the given sentence \\"A young boy is kicking a soccer ball away from 3 opponents,\\" the sentence \\"There are three opponents\\" is indeed a true sentence due to the direct mention and presence of the three opponents within the context. The presence of the opponents is relevant to the scene described, and the number \\"3\\" is essential for providing a precise understanding of the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m), pale and fair-haired.

By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.As the gang exited the property and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened.

The format of the meetings is established by the religion's headquarters, and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide. Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours, typically gathering mid-week (three meetings) and on the weekend (two meetings). Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for \\"family worship\\".

The fungus is edible , but due to possible confusion with toxic Amanita species is not recommended . Choices: (A). no; (B). yes;","completion":"(A). No While the two sentences may seem quite similar, they have distinct differences in meaning. 1. The first sentence states: \\"The mushroom is poisonous, but due to possible confusion with edible Amanita species is not recommended.\\" This sentence suggests that the mushroom in question is poisonous and not safe for consumption. Additionally, the sentence warns of its appearance, which can be confused with edible Amanita species. It is important to note that the primary concern here is the inherent poison-ness of the mushroom. The confusion with edible Amanita species further accentuates the risk, making it not recommended for consumption. 2. The second sentence states: \\"The fungus is edible, but due to possible confusion with toxic Amanita species is not recommended.\\" In contrast, this sentence declares that the fungus is edible, which implies that consuming it is not inherently dangerous. However, the problem arises from the possible confusion with toxic Amanita species, which are not safe to eat. The concern here is the difficulty in differentiating between the edible fungus and the poisonous Amanita species. To avoid the risk of misidentification, it is not recommended for consumption, even though the fungus itself is edible. In summary, the difference in meaning between the two sentences lies in the inherent characteristics of the mushroom or fungus: the first sentence refers to a poisonous mushroom, while the second refers to an edible fungus. The concern regarding confusion with Amanita species is present in both sentences, but the primary difference is whether the mushroom or fungus is poisonous or edible. Therefore, the answer is (A). No, the sentences do not mean the same thing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: \\"A little girl eating two cookies.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"the girl is not hungry and will refuse to eat anything\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise \\"A little girl eating two cookies\\" provides some information, but it is not sufficient to determine whether the given hypothesis \\"the girl is not hungry and will refuse to eat anything\\" is true. In the premise, we see that the little girl is eating two cookies. This might lead to the assumption that she was hungry or simply desired the cookies. However, without further information, we cannot confirm or reject the hypothesis. The hypothesis proposes two statements: 1) the girl is not hungry, and 2) she will refuse to eat anything. These statements might not necessarily be connected. Even if someone is not hungry, they might still choose to eat something that they enjoy or due to other reasons, such as peer pressure, boredom, or habit. Conversely, a person can be hungry and still refuse to eat, possibly due to a dislike of the food options, a personal preference for eating at specific times, or even some sort of dietary restriction. In order to confirm or reject the hypothesis, we would require additional information and context about the little girl and her eating habits. This might include observations of her in various situations, interviews with her caretakers, or a detailed inquiry into her typical food intake and preferences. Only with more evidence and context can we accurately evaluate the truth of the hypothesis. In conclusion, the premise does not provide sufficient information to determine whether the hypothesis is true. The girl eating two cookies may reflect hunger or a simple desire for something sweet, but it does not directly support or refute the hypothesis that she is not hungry and will refuse to eat anything. Additional data and context would be necessary to make a more informed judgment about the hypothesis's accuracy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These women were playing a sport called Rugby, and they were competing for a very special prize called the Women's Rugby World Cup. For many years, England's team had tried very hard to win this prize, but they always came very close and then lost at the last moment. They had lost three times in a row, but this time they were determined to win! On one sunny day, the women from England and the women from Canada put on their uniforms, tied their shoelaces and got ready for a big, important match. Their family and friends were all watching and cheering for them, and everyone was excited to find out who will win the shining trophy. Both teams were very good at playing Rugby, and they all had practiced a lot to become better and better at the game. The match began, and the two teams started to play Rugby on a big field. Rugby is a game where the players run, pass, tackle, and try to score points by carrying an oval-shaped ball across the other team's side. It can be a tough sport, but the women from England and Canada were strong and brave, and they played with all their hearts. As the game went on, the players from both teams tried their best to score points. Sometimes, the women from England scored, and their fans cheered loudly. Other times, the women from Canada scored, and their fans clapped and shouted with joy. It was a close and exciting match, and nobody could tell who will win until the very end!

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Hello little buddy! Let's talk about oxidation numbers! Question 1: The oxidation number of zinc is easy to figure out. Zinc is a metal and it usually likes to lose 2 electrons to become stable. So, for zinc, its oxidation number is +2. Picture it like zinc having 2 extra happiness points it wants to share with others. Question 2: Determining oxidation numbers for other elements can be a bit tricky, but I'll help you understand it. You see, some elements like to give away happiness points (electrons) and some like to take them. Here are some simple rules for finding oxidation numbers: 1. For elements that are all alone (not with others), their oxidation number is 0. 2. For oxygen, it usually has an oxidation number of -2 because it likes to take 2 happiness points from others. 3. For hydrogen, it usually has an oxidation number of +1 because it likes to give away 1 happiness point. 4. The total oxidation numbers in a compound always equal to 0, or the charge of the compound if it's not neutral. Sometimes the oxidation number is the same for two different questions, but it depends on the element you're talking about. Zinc always has an oxidation number of +2, so in that case, the answer would be the same for both questions. But for other elements, you may need to follow the rules I just explained.

This will make it much easier to remove the ivy from the ground. Pull the sections apart from one another as you cut. Work carefully around plants and saplings you want to keep. If you're working on a hill, cut vertical lines from the top of the hill to the bottom to create sections that you can roll downhill. Lift the edge of one section of ivy and roll it forward on top of itself. Keep rolling the ivy forward until the entire section has been rolled up into a big log of ivy. Move the log to a separate area and continue rolling up sections until you've cleared the area. Mulching the ivy rolls is the best way to dispose of them and ensure they won't take root in the area again. English ivy is difficult to kill with herbicides alone because the plant's leaves contain a waxy barrier that is difficult for products to penetrate. Therefore, the most effective method is to combine manual removal with the use of a herbicide. Glyphosate is the chemical that works most effectively to kill English ivy. Spray the area of ivy you wish to kill, but be careful the glyphosate doesn't reach other plants you want to keep. Herbicides are slow-acting, and must be reapplied every six weeks or so. If you have a patch of ivy you want to preserve, but you'd like to prevent it from spreading, you can use mulch to keep it contained. Simply cover the border of the ivy you want to keep with several inches (about 7 to 8 inches) of shredded or wood chip mulch. You will need to give this method some time; leave the mulch on the ivy for at least 2 seasons. You may need to add new mulch one or more times during a growing season.

He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vikki, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the... Answer:","completion":"Joey LaMotta"},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: What Mexican mayor tried to crack down on crime immensely? Answer: Between 2000 and 2004 an average of 478 crimes were reported each day in Mexico City; however, the actual crime rate is thought to be much higher \\"since most people are reluctant to report crime\\". Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: The Mexican mayor who tried to crack down on crime immensely is Marcelo Ebrard, who served as the Mayor of Mexico City from 2006 to 2012. Marcelo Ebrard is a member of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and took office with a strong commitment to combat the high crime rates within the city. During Ebrard's tenure, he implemented several strategies and policies to address crime, such as increasing the number of police officers, investing in technology to improve surveillance and communication systems, and modernizing the city's public transport system to make it safer and more reliable. One of his most notable projects was the creation of the Public Security Secretariat, which aimed at centralizing and streamlining the functions of the various police forces within Mexico City, making them more efficient and less prone to corruption. The new police force was provided with better equipment, including new patrol cars and firearms, and underwent extensive professional training to enhance their abilities. Ebrard also focused on addressing the root causes of crime by implementing social programs aimed at supporting vulnerable populations, such as the homeless and drug addicts. He invested in education, healthcare, and housing, which contributed to the reduction of socioeconomic disparities and provided opportunities to those who would otherwise be at risk of engaging in criminal activities. During his time in office, Marcelo Ebrard managed to reduce the city's crime rate substantially. According to a report by the Institut Mexicain de Compétitivité et Des Institutions, the crime rate in Mexico City dropped from 478 crimes per day in 2000 to 2004, to an average of 330 crimes per day from 2006 to 2012. Although it is important to note that the actual crime rate might have been higher due to underreporting, the downward trend in crime statistics is a direct result of Ebrard's efforts to bolster public security. While crime still remains an issue in Mexico City, Marcelo Ebrard's efforts during his tenure as mayor highlighted the importance of addressing both the consequences and the root causes of crime. His comprehensive approach to public security serves as an example of how cities can effectively tackle crime and improve the quality of life for their citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a habit of making mental errors; some funny, some not. This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”. He responded with such amazing, quick wit; “Ms. Hood, I admire your devotion to your mother; just remember she stays home while you come to class.” I caught hell for it that entire semester. Luckily, we (almost) all had pretty tough skins, so it was amusing, even to our somewhat staid professor. He wrote on my end of semester assessment “Respectfully, Not Your Mom.” I still keep that assessment to remind me to wear life like a loose garment. We all say stupid shit sometimes; just laugh at yourself and enjoy the silly moment. According to the above context, answer the following question. Who made the personal critique to the girl? A:","completion":"In the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned who made the personal critique to the girl. It is simply mentioned that someone within the group of students made the personal critique and referred to the girl's taste from growing up in a trailer park, forecasting a bleak design career for her at the Auto Trader. It is important to note that this type of personal attack was not the intended purpose of the open critique exercise, as it was meant to be focused on the improvement of artistic skills and preparation for the tough advertising world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The income gap between China's rural and urban residents has continued to widen during the past few years in spite of rapidly rising rural incomes, Agricultural Minister Sun Zhengcai said here on Wednesday. The income ratio between urban and rural residents was 3.28:1 in 2006, against 3.23:1 in 2003, said Sun in his report on the promotion of building a new countryside in 2007. Sun also said the net income of rural residents in different regions also varied widely. The income gap is only one of several problems in rural areas, according to Sun's report. While listing the achievements in rural areas in recent years, Sun believed that rural development still followed behind urban development. \\"We have bigger pressure to ensure the supply of major agricultural products such as grain,\\" he said. \\"China's urbanization has been speeded up and more rural residents have gone to urban areas,\\" he said. \\"In this case, more agricultural producers become farm produce consumers, which created more pressure for supply,\\" he said. Another problem facing China's agricultural development is _ application of science and technology. \\"Only 30 percent of scientific and technological achievements have been applied to agricultural production, which is 40 percentage points lower than developed countries,\\" he said. Despite increased government spending in rural areas, the infrastructure is still poor and easily hit by disasters. According to Sun, the government spent 431.8 billion yuan (59.15 billion) on agriculture, rural areas and farmers this year, an increase of 80.1 billion yuan over the previous year. China set aside 11.38 billion yuan to promote a new rural cooperative medical care system and 27.98 billion yuan to support the new compulsory education mechanism in rural area to ensure that all citizens shared the fruits of China's reform and opening-up, Sun said.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea human rights advocates are considering more practical ways to reform the repressive practices of the Kim Jong Un government, as denuclearization talks continue to end the country’s economic and diplomatic isolation. Rights activists hold out hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will confront Kim at their expected Singapore meeting in June about ongoing atrocities in North Korea, including a network of political prison camps and widespread government sanctioned abuses in the country. Benedict Rogers, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a religious freedom oriented organization, urges President Trump to emulate former President Ronald Reagan who once publicly called on the leader of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall that separated democratic West Germany and the Communist East. “Mr. Trump’s message should be, Mr. Kim if you seek peace, come to the gates of the prison camps, open the prison camps, tear down the walls of the prison camps,” said Rogers at a North Korea human rights conference in Seoul on Thursday. It is unclear if human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit, if it happens. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol have been meeting this week in New York to overcome the main obstacle to the summit; the gap between the U.S. demand for rapid and complete denuclearization and North Korea’s more phased in approach that would provide early sanctions relief. Brad Adams, the Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday, “Whatever the outcome of nuclear talks, human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea changes the way it treats its people.” The United Nations has passed 13 resolutions addressing human rights abuses in North Korea, most recently in March of this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. What is probably true about Trump?

However, Brian, who is not allergic, can more easily own a rabbit as a pet. Selecting option II makes logical sense within the context of the sentence because it highlights the difference between Nelson and Brian's situations with regards to rabbit ownership. Brian's lack of allergies enables him to have a rabbit as a pet without any health concerns. Option I, on the other hand, implies that despite Nelson's allergy, he still had a rabbit for a pet. While this scenario is not impossible, it does not follow the logical flow of the statement, as owning a rabbit would likely cause significant discomfort and health issues for Nelson. Therefore, option II is the more appropriate choice for finishing the sentence, as it aligns with the information provided and establishes a logical progression of events that take into account each individual's specific circumstances and relationship with rabbits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Piercing your lip will be painful, and the piercing may cause bleeding. The area may be tender, swollen, and bruised for several days afterward. Lip piercings can take anywhere from 6 to 10 weeks to heal fully, so be prepared for multiple daily cleanings during that time, plus regular upkeep after that. Cleaning your lip piercing is pretty straightforward, but it will require non-iodized salt, alcohol-free mouthwash, and a mild, fragrance-free soap. Pick up a new toothbrush as well—one with soft bristles—and replace your old one after getting your piercing. Before getting your lip pierced, know what to look for regarding infections. Symptoms include pus, green or yellow discharge, tingling or loss of feeling around the piercing site, fever, and excessive bleeding, pain, redness, and swelling. Leave the jewelry in if you suspect an infection, but seek medical attention immediately. Body jewelry often contains nickel, which is a common allergen for many people. Symptoms will likely appear within 12 to 48 hours, and can include itching and swelling, crusty or scaly blisters, and redness, rash, or dry skin. Your lip piercing won’t heal properly if you are allergic to the jewelry, so go to the doctor immediately if you suspect an allergy. If you can’t wear necklaces, earrings, rings or bracelets containing nickel, you won’t be able to wear it in your lip, either. Look for jewelry labeled “surgical steel” or “nickel free.” In addition to nickel, some people may be allergic to copper or brass. These 3 base metals cause the majority of allergic reactions to jewelry.","completion":"Lip piercings can be painful and cause bleeding, with tenderness, swelling, and bruising lasting for days. The healing process takes 6-10 weeks, requiring daily cleaning with specific products and a soft-bristle toothbrush. Be aware of infection symptoms like pus, discharge, fever, and excessive swelling, and seek medical attention if needed. Allergic reactions to metals like nickel, copper, and brass can occur, so opt for surgical steel or nickel-free jewelry. In case of allergy, visit a doctor for proper care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: The token was taken out of the folder due to being fraudulent, what was it taken from? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. ashtray B. pocket C. coin collection D. slot machine E. deposit box The answer is:","completion":"C. coin collection The most suitable option to answer the question is \\"C. coin collection.\\" This option directly relates to the context of the question, involving a token and potential fraudulence. In a coin collection, tokens often represent items of numismatic value and can be collected based on various factors, including rarity, historical significance, and artistic merit. In this scenario, it is possible for someone to attempt to introduce a fraudulent token into a coin collection to deceive others about its value or origins. Upon discovery of the fraudulence, the token would be removed from the collection to maintain the integrity of the other genuine tokens and coins. The other options, such as an ashtray, pocket, slot machine, and deposit box, do not provide the same direct relevancy to a fraudulent token. An ashtray would typically not contain a token, and a pocket is simply a place where someone might keep a token temporarily. A deposit box generally contains personal or valuable items but would not be an immediate context where a fraudulent token would be identified and removed. As for a slot machine, while it may use tokens, it does not determine whether a token is fraudulent or not. Therefore, the most suitable option to answer the question is \\"C. coin collection,\\" as it directly connects to the concept of identifying a fraudulent token and removing it from the collection for preservation and authenticity purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Armed forces charities accused the left-wing newspaper of trying to politicise the tribute to those killed during the First World War. They sprang to the defence of the installation, called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, after the online article by a former Turner Prize judge described it as ‘trite, fake, and inward-looking’. An aerial view of the Tower of London showing the poppy installation called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red. The Guardian has provoked anger by publishing an article that labelled the artwork as a 'UKIP-style memorial' In a provocative critique, author Jonathan Jones wrote: ‘The crowds come to remember – but we should not be remembering only our own. It’s the inward-looking mood that lets Ukip thrive. But that’s probably an overinterpretation, because the spectacle of all these red poppies is emptier than that. ‘In spite of the mention of blood in its title, this is a deeply aestheticised, prettified and toothless war memorial. Describing his preferred style of tribute, he wrote: ‘A meaningful mass memorial to this horror would not be dignified or pretty. It would be gory, vile and terrible to see. The moat of the Tower should be filled with barbed wire and bones. That would mean something.’ Social media users described the article as ridiculous, disrespectful and missing the point. In a provocative critique, former Turner Prize judge Jonathan Jones called it 'trite, fake and inward looking. And armed forces charities emphasised the way in which the artwork had caught the public’s imagination. Help for Heroes said it would not dignify an article that ‘tried to politicise a memorial’ with a response. A spokesman for armed forces charity SSAFA said: ‘The fact that hundreds of thousands of people have visited the installation to date, with many more expected as we head towards Remembrance, demonstrates how strongly the installation has resonated with the general public.’ A spokesman for the Historic Royal Palaces, which organised the memorial, said: ‘We have seen and read the article. It’s his opinion and we have nothing more to say about it. We’re just pleased with the way the public are responding to it – and that’s what’s more important to us. ‘We think it is incredibly evocative and we’ve seen people looking at it and being moved to tears just thinking about loved ones who died and the impact of war itself.’ Twitter user Jonny Wild wrote: ‘There are no words to express how disrespectful Jonathan Jones’ poppy article in the Guardian is – ridiculous piece of journalism.’ Journalist Ruth Green from Northern Ireland tweeted: ‘I saw the poppy installation last week. On so many levels Jonathan Jones has missed the point.’ But armed forces charities have emphasised they way in which the artwork has caught the public's imagination. Another user, tweeting under the name ‘Kemp1886’, said: ‘That Guardian article on the Poppy memorial is filth. Not remotely surprised though. No wonder circulation is so low.’ The article was published on what is thought to have been a record day for visitors at the memorial so far, with police brought in to help control the crowds. Visitors yesterday reported long queues to catch a glimpse of the memorial, but most were pleased to see so many keen to pay their respects. Sheila Bainbridge, 85, made the journey from Nottingham with her daughter, granddaughters and great-grandchildren. The President of the Women’s Section of the Royal British Legion in Radcliffe-on-Trent, whose late husband Sgt Laurie Bainbridge fought for the Royal Air Force on D-Day and helped liberate the Belsen concentration camp, said the sight was worth the wait. She said: ‘We don’t mind driving all the way down here and queuing to pay our respects.’ Undeterred by the crowds, her daughter Lynn Slater, 61, said: ‘It took us four hours to get here, we aren’t going to stop now.’ Visitor Angie Adriaanse, 65, from Wimbledon, told The Daily Mail: ‘I have never seen so many people.’ And one mum quipped: ‘I think the whole world has come today.’ Ray and Sue Smith, who travelled from Devizes, said it took them 30 minutes to get a good view. The couple said it was nice to see so many people take an interest, but Mr Smith, 68, said: ‘They are overwhelmed with crowds, they haven’t really planned how to cope.’ Millions of visitors have been to the installation including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Retired property developer Graham Barnes, 88, who travelled from Henley-on-Thames, said: ‘(The display) is staggering, very moving, and a wonderful way of commemorating the number killed in that war.’ And he said the crowd did not surprise him, adding: ‘We are a patriotic nation.’ Adela Everiss, 34, from Hillingdon, said she would be returning with her family early on Saturday to avoid the crowd, adding: ‘It is just too busy.’ Hayes man Alan Hammond, 82, said: ‘It is a bit chaotic.’ While his wife Jane, 81, added: ‘It is lovely, it really is, but you do have a job to see it.’ The millions of visitors to the installation include the Queen two weeks ago and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in August. Artist Mr Cummins, 37, yesterday revealed he had lost a finger making one of the poppies - which were sold for £25 each - when his hand was crushed by an industrial roller. The artwork – entitled Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red - has been slowly filling the moat around the Tower since July with the help of 8,000 volunteers. It is expected to raise more than £11million for charity before it is taken down the day after Armistice Day on November 11, when the final poppy is planted.

In 1999 , troops returned after rebel raids on a neighbouring Russian region and a series of deadly apartment-house bombings in Russian cities that were blamed on the rebels . Choose your answer from: (A). no; (B). yes;","completion":"(B). Yes, both sentences convey the same meaning, although with some slight differences in phrasing and structure. In both sentences, the central idea revolves around troops returning in 1999 due to two key events: rebel raids on a neighboring Russian region, and a series of deadly apartment bombings that were attributed to the rebels. The primary differences between the two sentences lie in the wording and the arrangement of the information presented, but the overall meaning remains consistent. Sentence 1: They returned in 1999 after rebel raids on a neighboring Russian region and a series of deadly apartment-building bombings that were blamed on the rebels. Sentence 2: In 1999, troops returned after rebel raids on a neighbouring Russian region and a series of deadly apartment-house bombings in Russian cities that were blamed on the rebels. Examining the similarities and differences in each element of the sentences will provide a clearer understanding of why their meanings are essentially the same: 1. Time of occurrence: Both sentences mention \\"1999\\" as the year in which the troops returned, establishing a common timeframe for the event. 2. Subject: Although Sentence 1 uses the pronoun \\"they,\\" it can be inferred from the context that it refers to the same subject as \\"troops\\" in Sentence 2. 3. Event 1: Both sentences describe \\"rebel raids on a neighboring/neighbouring Russian region.\\" The only difference here is the spelling of \\"neighboring/neighbouring,\\" which complies with the American/British spelling conventions, respectively. 4. Event 2: Both sentences mention \\"a series of deadly apartment-building/apartment-house bombings\\" being blamed on the rebels. The only difference in this part of the sentences is the slight variation in the naming of the location of the bombings - \\"apartment-building\\" versus \\"apartment-house\\". Additionally, Sentence 2 specifically mentions \\"in Russian cities,\\" but this information can also be inferred from Sentence 1 based on the context, considering that the bombings were blamed on the rebels who carried out raids on a Russian region. In conclusion, while there are some small variations in wording and structure, the overall meaning of the two sentences is the same, as both focus on troops returning in 1999 due to two main events: rebel raids on a neighboring Russian region and a series of deadly apartment bombings blamed on the rebels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In an interview with Ã‰poca magazine published on Saturday, the billionaire alleged that Mr Temer had asked for money several times in recent years in exchange for political favours. Mr Temer's lawyers intend to file a lawsuit against Mr Batista on Monday. Mr Batista last month released a secret recording incriminating the president, a move that caused political uproar and led to calls for Mr Temer to step down. The business mogul was co-operating with the police as part of a plea bargain deal he clinched when the authorities started investigating him in Operation Car Wash - the country's largest-ever corruption investigation that has implicated several big names. Brazil corruption probe: A glossary Clamour grows for Brazil's President Temer to resign Responding to his comments on Saturday, President Temer's office called Mr Batista \\"a notorious bandit\\" and criticised the police for allowing him to \\"escape prosecution\\". He said that the terms of the deal made the billionaire \\"Brazil's most successful criminal ever\\". Mr Temer added that he would take \\"all appropriate actions\\" against Mr Batista. Under the plea bargain, Joesley Batista and his brother Wesley admitted to bribing almost 1,900 politicians in recent years. They were being investigated for their role in two corruption scandals. Joesley Batista gave prosecutors an audio tape - leaked to the press - where Mr Temer appears to condone bribing a witness.

The Esquisses of 1861 are a set of highly varied miniatures, ranging from the tiny 18-bar no. 4, Les cloches (The Bells), to the strident tone clusters of no. 45, Les diablotins (The Imps), and closing with a further evocation of church bells in no. 49, Laus Deo (Praise God). They were preceded in publication by Alkan's deceptively titled Sonatine, Op. 61, in 'classical' format, but a work of \\"ruthless economy [which] although it plays for less than twenty minutes ... is in every way a major work.\\"Two of Alkan's substantial works from this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. Salut, cendre du pauvre, Op. 45 (1856), follows a section of the poem La Mélancolie by Gabriel-Marie Legouvé; while Super flumina Babylonis, Op. 52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of Psalm 137 (\\"By the waters of Babylon ...\\"). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces. Alkan's publications for organ or pédalier commenced with his Benedictus, Op. 54 (1859). In the same year he published a set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes (1859, without opus number), which, in Smith's opinion, \\"seem to stand outside the barriers of time and space\\", and which he believes reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty.\\" These were followed by pieces such as the 13 Prières (Prayers), Op. 64 (1865), and the Impromptu sur le Choral de Luther \\"Un fort rempart est notre Dieu\\" , op. 69 (1866). Alkan also issued a book of 12 studies for the pedalboard alone (no opus number, 1866) and the Bombardo-carillon for pedalboard duet (four feet) of 1872.Alkan's return to the concert platform at his Petits Concerts, however, marked the end of his publications; his final work to be issued was the Toccatina, Op. 75, in 1872.","completion":"The name of the person who believes that the set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes, published in 1859, reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty\\" is Smith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Before he started exploring, maps of the Pacific Ocean were almost empty. He visited hundreds of islands across the Pacific Ocean and put them in the correct places on the map. He made maps of the coastlines of Australia and New Zealand. James Cook was born in England in 1728. His parents were poor farm workers. When James was 18, he found a job on a coastal ship. He worked on the ship until he was 27 years old, and then he joined the navy. He fought in Canada in a war against France, and he mapped some of the eastern coasts of Canada. In 1768, King George made him Captain of a ship and sent him to the Pacific. He was gone for nearly three years. When he returned, he was regarded as a national hero. He started his third journey in 1776. On this trip he visited Hawaii. He was the first European to set foot on this beautiful island. Then he mapped the western coast of North America. After that he returned to Hawaii. Unluckily, there was some trouble between the Hawaiians and the white men and they started fighting. In the end, Captain was killed in a fight against the local.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The plant roots begin to grow - Break apart the rock - The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - Erosion starts to occur. The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: Seeds germinate in the crevices of the rock. Justification: In order for the natural process of weathering and erosion to occur, plant life must first establish itself in the rocky environment. This step-by-step process will look like this: 1. Seeds germinate in the crevices of the rock: Plant seeds find their way into small cracks and crevices within the rock surface. These seeds will grow into plant life, which initiates the process of breaking apart the rocks. 2. The plant roots begin to grow: As the plants continue to grow, their roots will start to expand and push against the rock. This puts pressure on the rock, causing it to break apart. 3. Break apart the rock: The expanding plant roots will crack and break apart the rock, causing fragmentation and exposing more of the rock's surface area. 4. The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock: Some plants produce organic acids, such as oxalic or citric acid, which can dissolve and break down the chemical bonds within the rock. This helps to weaken the rock and aids in the overall process of rock breakdown. 5. The rocks are broken into more and more pieces: As the roots continue to grow and the rock is dissolved by plant acids, the rock will become weaker and more susceptible to breaking into smaller pieces. 6. Erosion starts to occur: Once the rock has been broken down into smaller pieces, natural forces such as wind, water, or even additional plant growth will move and disperse these rock fragments. This is the beginning of the erosion process."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What type of details about earl smith -lrb- 1910s outfielder -rrb- can be gathered from the following bio?

He hasn't published a new book in years, even though his first four novels were well regarded in their time.A young, attractive grad student named Heather is writing her graduate thesis on him. She convinces him to take precious time away from his writing (which takes a few meetings of persuasion) to let her interview him. Heather is inspired by his writing and clearly takes a romantic interest in him.In addition, Leonard's daughter is grappling with starting a family without a husband while she falls in love again with a former boyfriend who does not want to have children.After Leonard warms to Heather over interviews about his writing, she becomes more flirtatious with him, even inviting him to lie down with her in his bed. She nods off to sleep, but the next morning they clearly have an unexpected comfort with each other.Heather hears from an editor that Leonard has not been entirely honest about the demise of his marriage, so she confronts him further about his personal life. He becomes upset about her discontent, but invites her to spend the night, and they share a passionate kiss.Thereafter, when Heather presents her first draft of the thesis to Leonard, he gives her the key to his apartment and invites her to visit whenever she likes. Suddenly she cools to his affections, which is more evident after she recoils when he kisses her.Leonard reads the thesis and gives her a thorough critique, which she appreciates despite the fact that he disagrees with much of what she has written. Soon thereafter, Leonard suffers a stroke, and Heather helps him to the hospital.After a month of recovery, Leonard seems happy to have Heather visit him again, yet when he reaches to touch her face he suddenly slaps her. Heather is overcome with emotion, seeming to know that she has done something wrong but does not deserve his condemnation.Leonard's daughter agrees to let her boyfriend help him to a doctor's visit, and on the walk back Leonard becomes sick...

This suspicion might come from a place of protectiveness and care for her father's well-being. Moreover, Leonard himself might have some initial doubts or suspicions about Heather's intentions.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"No, the questions \\"What is the business of a business?\\" and \\"What is a business?\\" do not hold the same meaning. They intersect in a broad scope but examine distinctive aspects of the business concept. Let's start with the question, \\"What is a business?\\" A business can be understood as an organization or entity involved in commercial, industrial, or professional activities. These activities are usually aimed at generating income through the production of goods, the provision of services, or the selling of goods or services produced by others. Businesses can be for-profit entities or non-profit organizations. They are characterized by the risk and initiative taken by investors to earn profits in the economic marketplace. They can exist in many forms, from sole proprietorships to multinational corporations. The core components that characterize a business apart from its organizational structure include a business model, business process, and business strategy. The business model describes how the company generates its revenue, the business process details its day-to-day operations, and the business strategy outlines its approach to achieving its objectives and goals in the face of competition and market trends. Now, let's move to the question, \\"What is the business of a business?\\" This question is often used metaphorically to mean, what is the core function or purpose of a business. It generally pertains to the specific niche or area that a business operates in or the kind of product or service it offers. The \\"business of a business\\" could refer to what distinguishes it from other businesses. For example, if the business is a bakery, the \\"business of the business\\" would be baked goods. In a broader, philosophical context, the phrase can be traced back to the American economist Milton Friedman's statement in the '70s that \\"The business of business is business\\" which suggests that a business's primary responsibility is towards its shareholders, and its main function is to generate profits. So, the latter question delves into the specific sector, product line, or service niche that a business operates in and possibly its philosophy or operational approach, while the former is concerned about defining what a business is, in general. Although they both touch on the subject of business, they are fundamentally asking about different aspects of it."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His mother and father separated when Carey was aged six, with his mother taking four of the children to Adelaide, living in a homeless shelter. According to Carey's autobiography, his father was a violent man who had spent time at Mannus Correctional Centre and was troubled by alcoholism. A few months later, Kevin Carey retrieved the children from his estranged wife and they returned to Wagga Wagga. For some time, it was unclear whether Carey would return to AFL football, but after the end of the 2002 season and a 12-month absence from football, Carey was signed by the Adelaide Crows where he played for the next two seasons. Age and injury plagued Carey in 2003 and prevented him from dominating as he once did. He did manage to earn a top ten finish in the club best and fairest and kicked the second most goals of any Crow for the year, despite missing eight games. The 2003 season was most memorable for Carey's fiery encounters with his former North Melbourne teammates Glenn Archer and Anthony Stevens in round 6. On that day he kicked four goals, including one of the goals of the year. Carey's best performance for 2003 once again came in the finals, an elimination final against West Coast, when he had the most kicks and marks afield and became the 14th player to kick 700 career goals in AFL/VFL history. Carey played the first 11 games in 2004, after which he had taken the most contested marks at Adelaide, was 11 goals clear in the Crows' goal kicking and was coming second in the club best and fairest. Carey's best performance in the Adelaide colours came a week before his 33rd birthday, in round 8 of the 2004 season. He took 9 marks, had 17 disposals and kicked 6 goals, out of a team total of 12, in a heavy loss to Essendon. Two weeks later, Carey's fourth goal against Hawthorn was one of the goals of the year. Taking a contested mark on the wing, Carey played on, having three bounces and shrugging off a tackle as he ran inside the forward 50. He gave off a handball to teammate Tyson Edwards, who in turn gave the ball back to Carey deep in the forward pocket. Carey's left foot snap for goal was a highlight in a big win for the Crows. In round 12, Carey left the field early in the second quarter and was later forced to retire with a disc-related neck injury, marking the end of a career that spanned 16 seasons and 272 games and included 727 goals. Why did Carey leave the crows after a short time?","completion":"Carey left the Adelaide Crows after a relatively short time due to a combination of factors, including age, injuries, and personal issues. 1. Age: Carey was already in his 30s when he joined the Adelaide Crows in 2003. He played for two seasons, and by the time he retired in 2004, he was 33 years old. At this age, many professional players begin to experience a decline in their performance, which could have contributed to his decision to leave the Crows. 2. Injuries: During his time with the Adelaide Crows, Carey struggled with injuries that prevented him from dominating the game like he had done in the past. In the 2003 season, missing eight games due to injuries significantly impacted his performance. In 2004, he was forced to retire mid-season due to a disc-related neck injury, having only played 11 games that season. Being prone to injuries might have accelerated his decision to end his career with the Crows. 3. Personal issues: Carey had a turbulent personal life, with various incidents impacting his career and public image. His struggles with relationships and personal issues, such as his affair with the wife of his then-best friend and teammate Anthony Stevens, had lasting effects on his career. These off-field issues could have also played a role in his decision to leave the Crows after a short time. In summary, Carey's departure from the Adelaide Crows was the result of a combination of age, ongoing injuries, and personal issues that culminated in his retirement in 2004, effectively ending a career that spanned 16 seasons, 272 games, and included 727 goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There's a Swedish girl, a Danish, a German and a Chinese. The story contrives to get the clothes off all of them, involve them in some Carry On-type humour and couple them with various misfits from the British film and TV culture of the time, including Man About the House star Richard O'Sullivan, future Coronation Street rogue Johnny Briggs and horror film stalwart Ferdy Mayne (playing a sheik). There's a pretty risqué amount of female nudity on display, for those who like that kind of thing (but obviously nothing hardcore). Most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential; the girls are stereotypes, and German Anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder - she's a moron obsessed with colour TV who acts like a kind of uninhibited child & dresses to deliberately show her private parts; in another more serious film, she would be a psychiatric case. The most interesting section of the film involves the Swedish girl being taken to a club in London where some dodgy types are still trying to swing, being seduced by a middle-aged rocker, losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her. These sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we've ended up with, in which promiscuity and the dregs of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives (there's a fine turn by John Standing as an impotent public school roué). The strangest of the stories has the Chinese girl (future cannibal film veteran Me Me Lay) getting off with her childish piano prodigy employer, falling mutually in love with and then leaving in the middle of the night for no good reason at all, except some orientalist notion that \\"Chinese birds are inscrutable, ain't they?!\\" The film is pretty demeaning to its women characters and there's a smattering of homophobia in the dialogue and one of the characterisations. The end is striking, as Mayne's sheik for no earthly reason (except they have to end the film somehow) whisks all of the girls away to his Arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade, which they are all delighted about. Stuff and nonsense for the most part then, but directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran Val Guest, which puts it as a piece of film-making a notch above most of the 70s Brit sexploitation flicks.","completion":"The sentiment of this text would be considered 1).

Should I validate this answer? Select from: (1). No. (2). Yes. Answer:","completion":"I would suggest validating this answer with a few modifications and additional information. An updated answer would be: The original Pink Power Ranger, Kimberly Ann Hart, was portrayed by Amy Jo Johnson in the first two and a half seasons of the television show Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. During these seasons, the show drew on footage and elements from the Super Sentai series Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger, Gosei Sentai Dairanger, and Ninja Sentai Kakuranger. The Pink Ranger's costume from Zyuranger was used throughout those seasons alongside other Zyuranger costumes for the main Rangers. Amy Jo Johnson decided to leave the show in the middle of the third season. As a result, her character, Kimberly, decided to pursue a career in gymnastics and moved to Florida. She then passed on her Pink Power Ranger powers to Katherine Hillard, played by Catherine Sutherland. This marked the transition to a new Pink Power Ranger, although the original costume was still used. So, while the suggested answer provides relevant information about the show's use of costumes from Super Sentai series, it does not directly address the specific question of what happened to the original Pink Power Ranger.

One key to making your feelings clear is to realize that you most often can shorten them in a few words: hurt, glad, confused, excited, angry, and so on. In the same way, with a little thought you can probably describe very briefly any reasons you have for feeling a certain way. In addition to avoiding too long expressions, a second way to prevent confusion is to avoid _ your feelings by saying \\"I'm a little unhappy\\" or \\"I'm pretty excited\\". Of course, not all feelings are strong ones. We do feel degrees of sadness and joy, for example, but some communicators have a tendency to downplay almost every feeling. Do you? A third danger to avoid is expressing feelings in an indirect or coded manner. This happened most often when the sender is uncomfortable about showing his or her feeling in question. Some codes are verbal ones, as when the sender hints more or less subtly at the message. For example, an indirect way to say \\"I'm feeling lonely\\" might be \\"I guess there isn't much happening this weekend, so if you're not busy, why don't you drop by?\\" Such a message is so indirect that chances are small that your real feeling will be recognized. For this reason, people who send coded messages stand less of a chance of having their feeling understood and their need met. Finally, you can express yourself clearly by making sure that both you and your partner understand that your feeling is centered in a specific set of environments rather than being indicative of the whole relationship. Instead of saying \\"I hate you\\", say \\"I hate you when you don't keep your promises\\"'.

Boston Tea Party The Indemnity Act of 1767, which gave the East India Company a refund of the duty on tea that was re-exported to the colonies, expired in 1772. Parliament passed a new act in 1772 that reduced this refund, effectively leaving a 10% duty on tea imported into Britain. The act also restored the tea taxes within Britain that had been repealed in 1767, and left in place the three pence Townshend duty in the colonies. With this new tax burden driving up the price of British tea, sales plummeted. The company continued to import tea into Great Britain, however, amassing a huge surplus of product that no one would buy. For these and other reasons, by late 1772 the East India Company, one of Britain's most important commercial institutions, was in a serious financial crisis. The severe famine in Bengal from 1769 to 1773 had drastically reduced the revenue of the East India Company from India bringing the Company to the verge of bankruptcy and the Tea Act of 1773 was enacted to help the East India Company.

Is this statement correct \\"did the tea act increase the price of tea\\"?","completion":"No, the statement \\"did the tea act increase the price of tea\\" is not correct. The Tea Act of 1773 actually helped the East India Company by allowing them to sell their tea directly to the American colonies, without having to pay taxes in Britain. This made the tea less expensive for the colonists. However, the colonists were upset because they still had to pay the Townshend duty of three pence when they bought the tea, and they felt this was unfair taxation. The Act was meant to save the struggling East India Company, but it led to anger and protests among the colonists, eventually resulting in the Boston Tea Party."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can learn exercises to improve the strength and flexibility in your injured foot and help prevent further injury. Start with a few minutes of light exercise, such as walking or riding a stationary bike. This will loosen your muscles and get blood flowing. Stretching exercises are a key step to restoring flexibility and range of motion. Following your doctor or therapist's recommended exercises, stretch the muscles and tendons in the injured foot. If you feel any pain during stretching, consult your doctor. A good example of a stretch is the towel stretch. Sitting on the floor with one leg straightened, loop a towel around the ball of your foot. Hold on to the ends of the towel and pull the top of your foot towards you. You should feel the stretch in your calf and down into the heel. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, and then rest for 30 seconds. Repeat the exercise 3 times. When done properly, strength exercises should help return the strength and endurance required for everyday activities to the injured foot. If you experience any pain during these exercises, consult your physical therapist or doctor. An example of a strength exercise is the marble pickup. Sit in a chair with both feet flat on the ground and put 20 marbles on the ground in front of you. Place a bowl near the marbles. Pick up the marbles one by one with your injured foot and place them into the bowl. You should feel the exercise on the top of your foot. It is important to keep up with your physical therapy to help you return to daily activities and reduce your chances of re-injury.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"1. Is there such a thing as chairs for people with scoliosis? Yes, there are chairs specifically designed for individuals with scoliosis and other spinal conditions. These ergonomic chairs are created with the intent to provide maximum support and comfort to the spine, particularly in the lumbar region, which is the area most affected by scoliosis. These chairs have specific features tailored to meet the needs of people with spinal curvature: a. Adjustable backrest: Chairs for scoliosis have adjustable backrests that can be inclined and reclined as per the individual's comfort. This helps maintain the natural curve of the spine and reduces pressure on the lumbar vertebrae. b. Lumbar support: Ergonomically designed chairs for scoliosis provide excellent lumbar support. They have cushions or contouring in the lumbar region to support the lower back, reducing strain on the muscles and ligaments. c. Seat depth and width: Chairs for people with scoliosis offer adjustable seat depth and width to ensure proper weight distribution, relieve pressure points, and prevent the development of additional spinal issues. d. Armrests: Adjustable and padded armrests in ergonomic chairs help maintain correct shoulder and arm positioning, reducing neck and upper back strain. e. Height adjustment: Chairs designed for scoliosis sufferers have adjustable seat heights, allowing individuals to maintain a healthy sitting posture and keep their feet flat on the ground. It is essential for individuals with scoliosis to consult with a healthcare professional, such as a physical therapist, orthopedic specialist, or chiropractor, to ensure proper selection and use of a chair to address their specific needs. 2. How is scoliosis and hip pain treated? Scoliosis and hip pain treatment involves a combination of different approaches, including conservative, non-surgical, and surgical methods. The treatment choice depends on factors such as the severity of the spinal curvature, the progression of the curve, and the age and overall health of the patient. Some of the approaches to treat scoliosis and hip pain include: a. Observation: For mild spinal curvature, observation alone may suffice. Regular check-ups would be required to ensure that the curve does not progress. b. Bracing: For patients who are still growing and have moderate spinal curves, wearing a brace prescribed by a healthcare professional may help prevent further curve progression. c. Physical therapy: Physical therapy and exercise programs designed for scoliosis may help improve posture, muscle strength, flexibility, and pain management. Core-strengthening exercises and stretching can be particularly beneficial. d. Pain management: Over-the-counter pain relievers (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) and prescription medications may be prescribed for pain relief. In some cases, injections like epidural steroids or nerve blocks may also be administered. e. Chiropractic care: Chiropractic adjustments or spinal manipulations could offer some relief and improve range of motion for some patients with scoliosis and hip pain. f. Alternative therapies: Some scoliosis patients might find relief through alternative therapies such as massage, acupuncture, or yoga. g. Surgery: In cases of severe spinal curvature or when other treatments have proven ineffective, surgery might be recommended. Spinal fusion surgery aims to stabilize the spine and prevent further curve progression. These treatment methods aim to manage symptoms, slow or halt the progression of the spinal curve, and improve overall quality of life. A multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including spinal specialists, physical therapists, and pain management specialists, typically collaborates to design the most effective treatment plan for each patient. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question specifically asks about the availability of chairs designed for individuals with scoliosis, while the second question focuses on the treatment approaches for scoliosis and hip pain. These two questions cover different aspects of managing and living with scoliosis and are independently significant."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you are given a sentence in English, and your task is to translate it into Persian.

The Rayleigh–Jeans law makes close predictions for a narrow range of values at one limit of temperatures, but the results diverge more and more strongly as temperatures increase. To make Planck's law, which correctly predicts blackbody emissions, it was necessary to multiply the classical expression by a complex factor that involves h in both the numerator and the denominator. The influence of h in this complex factor would not disappear if it were set to zero or to any other value. Making an equation out of Planck's law that would reproduce the Rayleigh–Jeans law could not be done by changing the values of h, of the Boltzmann constant, or of any other constant or variable in the equation. In this case the picture given by classical physics is not duplicated by a range of results in the quantum picture. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What does Planck's law correctly predict?","completion":"Alright, imagine you're at a campfire and you see the fire giving off light and heat. That light and heat are like blackbody emissions. Now, before Planck, scientists tried to understand this, but their ideas didn't work right for all the different temperatures. Then, a smart scientist named Planck came up with a new idea, called Planck's law. Planck's law helps us understand how much light and heat come out from something hot, like the fire, at every color and temperature. And it works really well because it's based on tiny energy packets. So, to answer your question, Planck's law correctly predicts the amount of light and heat given off by hot things at different temperatures and colors."},{"prompt":"Q:Information: - A city is a large and permanent human settlement.

It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - El Salvador, officially the Republic of El Salvador (literally \\"Republic of The Savior\\"), is the smallest and the most densely populated country in Central America. El Salvador's capital and largest city is San Salvador. , the country had a population of approximately 6.38 million, consisting largely of Mestizos of European and Indigenous American descent. - Honduras, officially the Republic of Honduras, is a republic in Central America. It has at times been referred to as Spanish Honduras to differentiate it from British Honduras, which became modern-day Belize. Honduras is bordered to the west by Guatemala, to the southwest by El Salvador, to the southeast by Nicaragua, to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca, and to the north by the Gulf of Honduras, a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea. - The Darién Gap is a break in the Pan-American Highway consisting of a large swath of undeveloped swampland and forest within Panama's Darién Province in Central America and the northern portion of Colombia's Chocó Department in South America. The gap begins in Yaviza, Panama and ends in Turbo, Colombia, stretching between 100 km and 160 km (60100 miles) long. Roadbuilding through this area is expensive, and the environmental cost is high. Political consensus in favor of road construction has not emerged. Consequently there is no road connection through the Darién Gap connecting North America with South America and it is the missing link of the Pan-American Highway. - A road is a thoroughfare, route, or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some form of conveyance, including a motor vehicle, cart, bicycle, or horse. - The Pan-American Highway is a network of roads measuring about in total length. Except for a rainforest break of approximately , called the Darién Gap, the road links almost all of the mainland countries of the Americas in a connected highway system. According to \\"Guinness World Records\\", the Pan-American Highway is the world's longest \\"motorable road\\". However, because of the Darién Gap, it is not possible to cross between South America and Central America. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city.

The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records. - In geography, statistics and archaeology, a settlement, locality or populated place is a community in which people live. A settlement can range in size from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized areas. Settlements may include hamlets, villages, towns and cities. A settlement may have known historical properties such as the date or era in which it was first settled, or first settled by a particular people. - Central America is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast.

Answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Marañón, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) Gut Reactions.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

This translation might not provide the long and detailed answer you're looking for, so let me give you a detailed insight into the potential causes and considerations of this \\"malaise\\" in the Arab world, while presenting the German translations for each point. 1. Political instability (Politische Instabilität): The Arab world has been experiencing numerous political conflicts and uprisings, such as the Arab Spring, which raised hopes but also brought chaos and violence to many countries in the region. 2. Economic challenges (Wirtschaftliche Herausforderungen): Many Arab nations have economies that are reliant on oil production, and the fluctuations in oil prices have resulted in financial instability and slowed-down economic progress. 3. Social inequality (Soziale Ungleichheit): The Arab world is marked by high levels of income inequality and disparities in access to essential services like healthcare and education. This often results in political and social tensions. 4. Lack of personal freedom and civil liberties (Mangel an persönlicher Freiheit und bürgerlichen Freiheiten): Many Arab countries are led by autocratic or authoritarian governments, which often infringe on the rights and freedoms of their citizens. 5. Religious and cultural tensions (Religiöse und kulturelle Spannungen): The Arab world is marked by sectarian divisions, often manifested in conflicts between Sunni and Shia Muslims. This adds another layer of complexity to the already challenging political landscape. 6. Refugee crises (Flüchtlingskrisen): The conflicts in the Arab world have led to large-scale refugee crises, with many people fleeing from war-torn countries like Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. This has put immense pressure on neighboring countries and the international community. 7. Terrorism and extremism (Terrorismus und Extremismus): Lastly, the Arab world has been facing the challenges of terrorism and extremism, often caused by the political and social circumstances mentioned above. This not only results in violence and instability but also shapes international perceptions and relations. By examining these points in detail, it is clear that the \\"malaise\\" in the Arab world cannot be attributed to a single factor. Instead, it is the result of a complex interplay of political, economic, social, and religious factors, which must be considered when aiming to unravel the issues and seeking solutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What does Lee need to do after this?\\", is \\"ignore the threat\\" a valid answer? Options: (i) Yes (ii) No The answer is:","completion":"(ii) No Ignoring the threats is not a valid answer because it's crucial for Lee to take appropriate steps to ensure his safety and security. Here, we provide a detailed outline of the necessary steps Lee should consider following: 1. Preserve the evidence: Lee should keep a record of all the threats he has received, including emails, text messages, letters, or other forms of communication. This will serve as evidence, which can be helpful in an investigation or legal proceedings. 2. Report to the authorities: It is important for Lee to report the stalking incidents to the appropriate authorities, such as local law enforcement or a protective service agency. This will create an official record about the stalking and enable the authorities to investigate and take necessary actions. 3. Apply for a restraining order: If the stalker's identity is known, Lee may consider applying for a restraining order, also known as a protective order, to keep the stalker at a distance. It is a legal document issued by a court, which can impose restrictions on the stalker, such as prohibiting communication or restricting physical proximity. 4. Strengthen personal security: Lee should enhance his security measures, like being cautious about sharing personal information online, updating privacy settings on social media, changing locks, installing security cameras, or using a personal alarm system. Additionally, he should be extra cautious when he's out in public places and inform friends, family, and coworkers about the situation. 5. Engage a support network: Dealing with the emotional stress and psychological effects of being stalked can be challenging. Lee should reach out to friends, family, or a counselor for emotional support and guidance. There are also victim support services, such as hotlines and counseling centers, that can provide assistance. 6. Develop a safety plan: Lee should create a safety plan that outlines the steps to take in case the stalker escalates their behavior or becomes an imminent threat. This may include escape routes, a designated safe place to go to, and emergency contact numbers. 7. Stay informed about legal options: It's crucial for Lee to be knowledgeable about the stalking laws and victim protection measures available in his jurisdiction. This knowledge can help Lee understand his rights and navigate any legal processes related to the stalking incidents. In conclusion, merely ignoring the threats is not an appropriate response for Lee to ensure his safety and hold the stalker accountable.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, that would be a reasonable answer to describe a particular aspect of Romania's history and economic situation. However, if you'd like to provide a more comprehensive response, you could expand on various dimensions such as geography, culture, and current state. Here's a more detailed answer: Romania is a country located at the crossroads of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. It has a diverse landscape that includes the Carpathian Mountains, the Black Sea coastline, and the Danube Delta. Romania is known for its rich history, medieval castles (such as the famous Bran Castle, associated with the legend of Dracula), and vibrant cultural life, which combines Latin, Slavic, and Hungarian influences. After the 1989 revolution that ended communist rule, Romania faced a difficult period of economic decline, hyperinflation, and a drop in living standards, as mentioned in your original statement. However, through extensive reforms and support from international organizations, the country managed to recover and made significant progress during the first decade of the 21st century. In 2007, Romania joined the European Union, which further facilitated its economic growth and development. Romania's current economy is service and industry-based, with agriculture also playing an important role. It has a diverse culture, with traditions such as folk dance and music, wooden carving, and pottery being well-preserved. The official language is Romanian, a Romance language closely related to Italian, French, and Spanish. The majority of the population is Christian Orthodox, with small percentages of Catholics, Protestants, and other religious groups.

If Roy Hodgson had said he wanted to give Adam Lallana the chance to build on his eye-catching efforts against San Marino, we would have been none the wiser about Raheem Sterling’s fatigue. Every word the England manager says is scrutinised. I can see where Hodgson was coming from but an issue has been created that both men could have done without. Had Hodgson explained he wanted to use Sterling for an impact – which he had, by winning the decisive free-kick against Estonia – there would be no quarrel. Now, though, Sterling is in the spotlight and contending with questions such as ‘how can a 19-year-old be tired?’ but those who believe he has made a mistake saying he wasn’t in the right condition to play for England are not looking at the full picture. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson reveal Raheem Sterling was too tired to start. England's Raheem Sterling looks quite relaxed on the substitutes' bench during the first half against Estonia. Jordan Henderson makes way for Sterling in the 64th minute in Tallinn as England went on to beat Estonia 1-0. Sterling told England manager Roy Hodgson that he was not 100 per cent and that he was too tired to start. Of the players England used against Estonia, only Gary Cahill has played more minutes this season than Raheem Sterling. 1164 - Gary Cahill. 1079 - Raheem Sterling. 1064 - Jack Wilshere. 1035 - Jordan Henderson. 995 - Calum Chambers. 990 - Joe Hart. 990 - Leighton Baines. 919 - Phil Jagielka. 836 - Danny Welbeck. 758 - Wayne Rooney. 741 - Fabian Delph. 538 - Adam Lallana. It doesn’t matter whether you are 19 or 29, if you play nine games in a month, like Raheem did in September, it will leave a mark on you physically. So, in some respects, he has been brave to confront the issue and explain his concerns to Hodgson. Would I have ever done it? No. I feared if I missed a game, someone would come in and take my place. I also never wanted to give managers an excuse to leave me out, so there were times when I played in games I shouldn’t have done. Was it the right thing to do? No. Injuries are what I would mask but I remember a game at Bolton in September 2006 when I was shattered, having been to the World Cup in Germany. We lost 2-0, one of the goals came from a cross into the box. I tried to jump for a header but had nothing in my legs. Had I been right, I know I would have got my head to the ball first. As a central defender, you can find a way of getting through a game, you don’t have to operate at the rapier pace that Raheem moves with. His game is based around high intensity sprinting and he needs sharpness to go past opponents, with or without the ball. The England substitutes watch on as 19-year-old Sterling (second right) was rested from the starting line-up. 32 - Jagielka, Lambert. 29 - Baines. 28 - Rooney, Cahill. 27 - Hart. 26 - Lallana. 24 - Henderson, Delph. 23 - Welbeck. 22 - Wilshere. 21 - Oxlade-Chamberlain. 19 - Chambers, Sterling. We want Raheem to thrill us, to be an exciting figure for many years to come. We don’t want him to get to 25 and his best form be a thing of the past. If he is managed properly now and looks after himself, he won’t suffer burn out like another former Liverpool and England teenage prodigy. A few weeks ago, I spent some time with Sir Alex Ferguson. During our conversation, he remembered how, in 1997, Michael Owen and I had played at the Under-20 World Cup in Malaysia. Michael came back and went straight into Liverpool’s first team at the start of the season. By contrast, the United players in that England squad – Ronnie Wallwork and John Curtis – were both given a month off to recover but Michael was on a rapid upward curve and at the end of that campaign, he set the World Cup finals in France alight. Michael wanted to play in every game for club and country but, in October 1998, Gerard Houllier and Roy Evans – in their brief reign as Liverpool’s joint managers – decided to rest him for a UEFA Cup game against Valencia. Michael wasn’t happy and said in an interview “I’ll rest when I’m 40”. Former Liverpool and Englad striker Michael Owen wanted to play every game for club and country. Sterling told Hodgson he was feeling tired and not in the right mental state during training on Saturday evening. VIDEO Sterling defends England tiredness. That comment went down well with supporters and ex-players but was he right? No. Michael played far too much for Liverpool and England too early, never getting a summer off to recharge physically or mentally. Was it a coincidence that he suffered a serious hamstring injury in April 1999? Raheem is becoming like Michael, with stature and his pace and his importance to club and country at such an early stage of his career but there have been signs over the last few weeks that such a punishing spell is beginning to catch up with him. He may have only played two games at the World Cup but Sterling was training every day in stifling conditions, having just come off a season in which he had been a key figure in Liverpool’s title charge. After three weeks off, he then went to the USA for Liverpool’s pre-season tour. Don’t underestimate what an impact that schedule will have had on him, physically and mentally. Figures back that up. Between May 30, 2013 and October 13, 2013, Raheem had played 615 minutes of football. In the same period this year, that figure had shot up to 1682 minutes. Sterling may have only started two games at the 2014 World Cup but the England winger was in training daily. Sterling came on in the 64th minute but still received criticism from those on Twitter for his decision. Sterling, warming up during the first half, complained of feeling tired in training ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier. Hodgson and Brendan Rodgers will talk about how to handle him going forward but, naturally, they are going to want to use him when they can as he is a match-winner. That’s why he played against Middlesbrough in the League Cup. Liverpool’s poor start in the league meant Rodgers needed his quality. Liverpool could not have afforded to be on the end of a giant-killing that night, so the plan would have been to get the game won and get Sterling off early. As it was, things never went to plan and he subjected to 120 minutes. Since then, his performances have been notably lacking sparkle. Sterling retweeted those criticising him online before writing: 'Now listening to... Excuse me for being human' His importance at Anfield is vital and that is why, at the end of last season, Rodgers called him “the best young player in Europe”. He was dazzling in that spell but that was a spell when Liverpool were only playing one game a week. This is the first time he has played consistently in games of this pressure and will take some adjustment. But If he is become one of the top players in the world, he will ultimately have to get used to an unrelenting schedule. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Defending has changed significantly in FIFA 12, and you are penalized much more for being overly-aggressive with your tackles. Use the new defensive situation to your advantage by getting in close and contesting the ball instead of going for the tackle. At the same time, you don't want to be too patient. Not putting enough pressure your opponent will allow them to move down the field easier, putting you on your heels. If you can spare a player without leaving another opponent too open, call in a second defender to help put the pressure on. You can use this to shut down pass lanes or force the defender to lose possession of the ball. Be careful when doing this, as it often leaves an opponent open for a pass. Make sure you are aware of where the opposing players are in the field and shut down any passing lanes. One of the most useful defensive formations in the game is 5-3-2, as it provides good coverage for your defenders. Another solid choice is the 5-2-2-1 formation as it packs the midfield with defenders. In FIFA 12, the key to successfully defending is by anticipating where the opponent is going to pass, and then shutting that pass down. This will be difficult at first, but after some time you'll start to be able to tell which direction a player is going to to based on their direction and speed.

Article: When we interviewed what the life was like more than 70 years ago, many old soldiers were full of tears in their eyes. They told us that they never forgot those days when they were in the army, during which they lived hard lives but spared no effort to fight against the enemies. Now in the year 2015 comes the first great parade in the 21stcentury. September 3rdis the 70thanniversary of the victory of the anti-fascist war. This day is considered as an important moment for China, as well as the world. 49 countries from all over the world, including South Korea and some European countries attended this special occasion. In preparation for the parade, the soldiers worked hard every day. In order to walk well in the three hundred meters distance on the Tian'anmen Square, they had to receive extremely strict training. Each day, they got up early in the morning and started the 10 hours' practice. When a reporter arrived, it was raining heavily outside, but none of the soldiers stopped training. Nothing can stop their training, and no one can stop their deep love to their motherland. The reporter asked, \\"The training is so hard but why does nobody give up?\\" \\"It's the first time for me to join in such an important ceremony. I consider it a great honor. I must try my best.\\" One of the participants answered. In fact, everyone takes pride in taking part in this big parade because they want to show the spirit of Chinese army, the power of Chinese army, as well as the determination of keeping the world in peace. From the soldiers, we learned the power of dreams. If one has a dream, he will get over any difficulties that get in the way to make the dream come true. Question: Which of the following is True? Answer: A:","completion":"The parade was to honour the 70th anniversary of the end of the anti-fascist war. B: The parade was not considered a great honour by the soldiers participating. C: The soldiers didn't have to train extensively for the parade. D: The parade was not attended by any international guests. Justification: Looking at option A: The text specifies \\"September 3rd is the 70th anniversary of the victory of the anti-fascist war\\", which aligns with the content of this option, making it true. Option B: The text directly contradicts this statement when one participant says, \\"It's the first time for me to join in such an important ceremony.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device The Clarets, who included Joey Barton for the first time since he re-joined the club, went close when Sam Vokes was put clear but saw his shot saved. The visitors had the better chances but keeper Nick Hope did well to tip a Jack Rodwell shot over the bar. And Burnley almost won it when James Tarkowski's header struck the post. Sunderland - 18th in the Premier League - will travel to Turf Moor for the replay on 17 or 18 January. Sunderland have averaged crowds of more than 40,000 in the league this season. Those that stayed away for this cup commitment did not miss a sudden injection of attacking flair. Black Cats' boss David Moyes will perhaps be less content with a replay than opposite number Sean Dyche, with his side unquestionably in a relegation scrap. No Premier League club has more players at the Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Gabon but Moyes can draw some comfort from the fact his side are showing some signs of resilience. This stalemate followed a draw with high-flying Liverpool, and Sunderland have now avoided defeat in six of their last 11 games - form better than Burnley's. But a lack of creativity and guile is evident. Top-scorer Jermain Defoe barely saw sight of goal as those around him lacked inspiration. There were fleeting moments of promise, notably when Javier Manquillo broke through only for his pull-back to evade those in support. Dyche included Barton as one of six changes from Burnley's defeat at Manchester City. The midfielder, who could still face an FA ban for breaching betting rules, was solid as the usual away-day theme for the Clarets continued. Just three goals on the road this season has proven costly as they remain without a win away from Turf Moor in 2016-17. Andre Gray almost added to the haul early on but fired over and Tarkowski's powerful header in the second period was a fraction from earning the win. Dyche may be concerned about the lack of away-day firepower but he has the comfort of knowing only Tottenham and Chelsea have more home league wins in the campaign. Those home comforts could prove crucial as Burnley bid for a fourth round spot for just the second time in six seasons. Sunderland manager David Moyes: \\"A slog for everybody. It was a really poor game. Two teams probably not trying to go completely full out. It's disappointing we didn't get through but at least we are still in the hat. \\"I think with 10, 15 minutes to go, they were the better team and it looked as if they were going to score, so I think if you gave me it with 10, 15 to minutes to go, I might have said, 'Yes, I'll take it'.\\" Burnley manager Sean Dyche: \\"As the game wore on, we made three or four promising opportunities, but then two or three really golden chances and on another day I think we win the match. \\"A lot has been made of our away league form, but you can see that we want to take the game on and win games and that was evident today with the group.

Help as much as you can. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is pay used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? Pay a call. You'll pay for this!","completion":"No, the term \\"pay\\" in these two sentences does not convey the same meaning. To better understand the context, let's analyze each sentence separately. 1. Pay a call: In this case, \\"pay\\" is used to indicate the act of making a visit – usually a formal or short visit – to someone's house, office, or other location. The term \\"pay a call\\" is often used to express the act of visiting someone to socialize, convey greetings, or fulfill a social obligation. The meaning of \\"pay\\" in this sentence is related to giving attention, time, or effort as a form of courtesy or acknowledgment towards the person being visited. 2. You'll pay for this! In this sentence, \\"pay\\" is used to imply punishment, revenge, or facing the consequences of certain actions. The speaker is making a threat, warning, or showing their disapproval towards someone's actions or behavior and vowing retribution in some way. Here, the meaning of \\"pay\\" is about facing negative consequences or suffering due to one's behavior. The implication is that the person being spoken to will be held responsible for their actions and will have to \\"pay the price,\\" in terms of potential damage, loss, or pain they may cause as a result. In summary, while \\"pay\\" is a common term used in both sentences, it should be noted that the context, as well as the intended meaning of the word, differs significantly between the two scenarios. In the first sentence, it denotes making a visit to someone, whereas in the second sentence, it conveys a threat of punishment or revenge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please capitalize where necessary: common file deletion and lost scenarios:","completion":"Common File Deletion and Lost Scenarios: 1. Accidental Deletion: This occurs when a user unintentionally removes a file or folder from their device, typically by using the \\"Delete\\" key or right-clicking and selecting \\"Delete.\\" This may result from not knowing the file's importance or mistakenly believing it to be a duplicate. 2. Permanent Deletion: In this situation, a user not only deletes a file or folder but also empties the Recycle Bin or Trash, making it more difficult to recover the lost data. This could occur when a user is trying to free up space on their device or believes that they no longer need the file. 3. Overwriting Files: This happens when a user saves a new file with the same name as an existing file, causing the original file to be replaced. Overwriting files can lead to the loss of earlier versions or critical data. 4. Malware or Virus Infection: Malicious software, such as viruses and malware, can cause files to be deleted, corrupted, or hidden. These programs can enter a user's device through downloads, email attachments, or unsafe websites. 5. Corrupt Files: A file can become corrupted due to various reasons, such as errors during transfer or storage, power outages, or issues with the file system. Corrupt files may become unreadable, inaccessible, or lost entirely. 6. Hard Disk Failure: A physical failure in the hard disk can lead to data loss. This can occur due to various reasons like wear and tear, exposure to heat or moisture, or manufacturing defects. 7. Formatting Errors: Accidentally formatting a storage device, such as a hard drive or USB stick, can result in the deletion of all data stored on the device. This can happen when a user mistakes the device for another one or believes that the formatting is necessary to rectify an error or issue. 8. System Crashes: A sudden system crash, power failure, or hardware malfunction can lead to unsaved data being lost. This situation is especially problematic if the device does not have an automatic backup or recovery feature in place. 9. Software Conflicts: Incompatibilities between programs, operating systems, or device drivers can cause files to be deleted or become inaccessible. These conflicts may arise due to an update or installation of new software. 10. Human Error: A user may unintentionally move, rename, or modify a file, subsequently causing it to be misplaced, overwritten, or damaged. This is a common scenario, especially in busy work environments with multiple users accessing shared files and folders. Awareness and understanding of these common file deletion and lost scenarios can help in taking necessary precautions and implementing backup or recovery solutions to protect valuable data."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche), an expert chocolatier, drifts across Europe with her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), following the north wind. In the beginning of the Lenten season in 1959, \\"fifteen years after the War,\\" they travel to a quiet French village that closely adheres to tradition, as led by the village mayor, the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina). Just as the villagers begin observing the forty days of Lent, Vianne opens a chocolate shop, much to Reynaud's displeasure. Vianne wears more colorful clothing than the village women, is an atheist, and has an illegitimate child. She does not fit in well with the townspeople, but is nevertheless optimistic about her business. Her friendly and alluring nature begins to win the villagers over one by one, causing Reynaud to openly speak against her for tempting the people during a time of abstinence and self-denial. The Comte will not admit that his wife has left him; he is romantically interested in Caroline, but he does not pursue her. One of the first to fall under the spell of Vianne and her confections is Armande (Judi Dench), her elderly, eccentric landlady. Armande is unhappy that her cold, devoutly pious daughter Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss) will not let Armande see her grandson Luc because Caroline thinks Armande is a \\"bad influence\\". Vianne arranges for Luc and his grandmother to see each other in the chocolaterie, where they develop a close bond. Caroline later reveals to Vianne that her mother is a diabetic, though Armande continues to eat the chocolate despite her condition. Having lost her husband, Caroline is overly protective of Luc and does not even want her son to play. Vianne also develops a friendship with a troubled woman, Josephine (Lena Olin), who is a victim of brutal beatings by her abusive husband Serge (Peter...","completion":"In the movie Chocolat, Armande is played by Judi Dench."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges As the ice particles collide, they cause electrostatic charges to build up within the cloud. This process is known as charge separation. Step 3: The cloud becomes a thundercloud As the amount of electrostatic charges increases, the cloud transforms into a thundercloud, which is also known as a cumulonimbus cloud. Step 4: Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge The accumulation of electrostatic energy in the cloud results in the presence of a strong negative charge at the base of the thundercloud. Step 5: Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud Opposite charges attract, so the strong negative charge in the cloud attracts positive energy from the surrounding environment. Step 6: This positive energy gathers on the ground As a result of the attracted positive energy, an opposing positive charge begins to gather on the ground or objects on the ground (like trees, buildings, etc.) beneath the negatively charged base of the thundercloud.

Please answer the following question: The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose two brothers died in 1823?, what is it ?

Add compost to soil to attract earthworms which creates air holes in soil.. (B). Add sugar to soil to attract earthworms which creates air holes in soil..","completion":"To accomplish the goal of increasing the drainage of garden pots, the better option would be (A): Add compost to the soil to attract earthworms which create air holes in the soil. Below is a detailed explanation for both options: Option A: Add compost to soil to attract earthworms which creates air holes in soil 1. Compost enriches the soil: Compost serves as an organic matter that supplies essential nutrients for plants and improves soil fertility. When added to soil in garden pots, it ensures that the plants have a healthy growing environment. 2. Fosters microorganism development: Compost has the ability to increase the microbial population in the soil by providing necessary nutrients for their growth. In turn, these microorganisms help in breaking down nutrients into simpler forms that can be easily absorbed by the plant roots. 3. Attracts earthworms: Earthworms are naturally attracted to compost due its organic composition and the presence of microorganisms. Earthworms play a crucial role in the aeration of the soil as they create burrows and air holes, facilitating drainage. 4. Improves soil structure: The addition of compost to the soil improves soil structure by promoting aggregation of particles. This opens up pore spaces and allows water to drain and infiltrate more easily, which enhances the overall drainage capacity of the garden pots. Option B: Add sugar to soil to attract earthworms which creates air holes in soil 1. Sugar may attract earthworms to some extent: Earthworms are attracted to sugar as a source of food. However, the presence of earthworms in the garden pots does not solely rely on the addition of sugar. 2. Short-term impact: The addition of sugar to the soil may provide an initial boost of energy for earthworms and microorganisms. However, it is not a sustainable long-term solution, as it may cause an imbalance in the soil food web. 3. Potential problems: Adding sugar to the soil may create imbalances that can lead to the growth of harmful microbes, pests, and fungi. Moreover, excessively high sugar concentrations can result in osmotic stress and damage plant roots by drawing water out of them. 4. Limited effect on drainage: Even if sugar attracts earthworms that create air holes, it does little to improve the overall structure of the soil. Sugar does not directly contribute to soil aggregation, which is crucial in enhancing drainage capacity. In conclusion, it is more effective to add compost to the soil in garden pots to increase their drainage, as it not only attracts earthworms that create air holes but also enriches the soil, fosters microorganism development, and improves soil structure. On the other hand, adding sugar may temporarily attract earthworms but can lead to potential problems and has limited effects on drainage compared to compost."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer to the question about whether or not to validate the suggested answer \\"ANITA Mk VIII\\" as the first electronic handheld calculator, it is important to explore the history of electronic calculators and determine the accuracy of the given answer. The history of electronic calculators can be traced back to the early 1960s, with various models of mechanical and electronic devices being produced by different companies. They aimed to create a portable and convenient solution for individuals and businesses to perform calculations accurately and efficiently. The ANITA Mk VIII, manufactured by Bell Punch Company and marketed by their subsidiary Sumlock Comptometer, is often considered as the first electronic desktop calculator, rather than a handheld calculator. It was introduced in 1961 and used cold-cathode Nixie tubes to display the results. The ANITA Mk VIII was mainly designed for use on desktops due to its size and weight, making it less portable than handheld calculators that would come later. In 1967, Texas Instruments (TI) developed the Cal-Tech prototype, which was the first transistor-based handheld calculator. This prototype used integrated circuits developed by TI and a magnetic card reader for data input. However, it was not a commercially available product. The first commercially available electronic handheld calculator can be attributed to the Pocketronic, developed by Texas Instruments and released in 1970. The Pocketronic used a thermal printer for output and was a truly portable device compared to its desktop counterparts. It operated on battery power and was small enough to fit into a pocket or purse, weighing around 680 grams. Thus, considering the given information, the answer to the question should not be validated, as the ANITA Mk VIII is not the first electronic handheld calculator. Instead, the answer should be revised to the \\"Pocketronic\\" by Texas Instruments as the first commercially available electronic handheld calculator.

X is an American punk rock band, formed in Los Angeles in 1977, among the first wave of American punk. The original members are vocalist Exene Cervenka, vocalist/bassist John Doe, guitarist Billy Zoom and drummer D.J. Bonebrake. The band released seven studio albums from 1980 to 1993. After a period of inactivity during the mid to late 1990s, X reunited in the early 2000s, and currently tours. Despite the overwhelmingly positive critical reception for their first four albums, the band was frustrated by its lack of wider mainstream success. Zoom had also stated that he would leave the band unless its next album was more successful. The band decided to change producers in search of a more accessible sound. Their fifth record, Ain't Love Grand!, was produced by pop metal producer Michael Wagener. It featured a drastic change in sound, especially in the polished and layered production, while the band's punk roots were little in evidence, replaced by a countrified version of hard rock. The change in production was intended to bring the band more chart success, but although it received more mainstream radio play than their earlier releases, it did not represent a commercial breakthrough. Zoom left the group shortly thereafter in 1986, the same year in which the feature-length documentary film, X: The Unheard Music, was released. Zoom was initially replaced by Alvin, who had left the Blasters. The band then added a fifth member, guitarist Tony Gilkyson, formerly of the band Lone Justice. By the time the band released its sixth album, See How We Are, Alvin had already left the band, although he played on the record along with Gilkyson and wrote 4th of July for the band. Like Ain't Love Grand, the album's sound was far removed from the band's punk origins, yet featured a punchy, energetic, hard-rocking roots rock sound that in many ways represented a more natural progression from their earlier sound than the previous record had. After touring for the album, X released a live record of the tour, titled Live at the Whisky a Go-Go, and then went on an extended hiatus. Back in 1984, X had released a cover version of \\"Wild Thing\\" as a non-album single. In 1989, the song was re-released as the lead single from the soundtrack to the hit film Major League. It later became a staple at sporting events, particularly baseball games, and was used by Japanese professional wrestler Atsushi Onita after he founded Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling in 1989.

CHICAGO--A new study lends further evidence to a suspected link between abnormal breast growth in young boys--called prepubertal gynecomastia--and regular exposure to lavender or tea tree oil, by finding that key chemicals in these common plant-derived oils act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The study results will be presented Monday at ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society's 100th annual meeting in Chicago. Lavender and tea tree oil are among the so-called essential oils that have become popular in the United States as alternatives for medical treatment, personal hygiene and cleaning products, and aromatherapy. Various consumer products contain lavender and tea tree oil, including some soaps, lotions, shampoos, hair-styling products, cologne and laundry detergents. \\"Our society deems essential oils as safe,\\" said study lead investigator J. Tyler Ramsey, a postbaccalaureate research fellow at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of the National Institutes of Health. \\"However, they possess a diverse amount of chemicals and should be used with caution because some of these chemicals are potential endocrine disruptors.\\" An endocrine-disrupting chemical is a chemical in the environment that interferes with hormones and their actions in the body. Male gynecomastia occurring before puberty is relatively rare, but a growing amount of cases have been reported to coincide with topical exposure to lavender and tea tree oil, and the condition went away after the boys stopped using the oil-containing products, Ramsey said. Researchers at the NIEHS, including Kenneth Korach, Ph.D., a co-investigator for the new study, previously found laboratory evidence that lavender and tea tree oil have estrogenic (estrogen-like) properties and anti-androgenic (testosterone inhibiting-like) activities, meaning they compete or hinder the hormones that control male characteristics, which could affect puberty and growth. Under Korach's direction, Ramsey and his NIEHS colleagues went a step further. From the hundreds of chemicals that comprise lavender and tea tree oil, they selected for analysis eight components that are common and mandated for inclusion in the oils. Four of the tested chemicals appear in both oils: eucalyptol, 4-terpineol, dipentene/limonene and alpha-terpineol. The others were in either oil: linalyl acetate, linalool, alpha-terpinene and gamma-terpinene. Using in vitro, or test tube, experiments, the researchers applied these chemicals to human cancer cells to measure changes of estrogen receptor- and androgen receptor-target genes and transcriptional activity. All eight chemicals demonstrated varying estrogenic and/or anti-androgenic properties, with some showing high or little to no activity, the investigators reported. Ramsey said these changes were consistent with endogenous, or bodily, hormonal conditions that stimulate gynecomastia in prepubescent boys. \\"Lavender oil and tea tree oil pose potential environmental health concerns and should be investigated further,\\" he said. Of further concern, according to Ramsey, is that many of the chemicals they tested appear in at least 65 other essential oils. Essential oils are available without a prescription and are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Thus, the public should be aware of these findings and consider all evidence before deciding to use essential oils. The NIEHS Division of Intramural Research funded this study through its support of Korach. The researchers will present their findings during a press conference at 10 a.m. Central on Saturday, March 17.

The Endocrine Society is the world's oldest and largest organization of scientists devoted to hormone research and physicians who care for people with hormone-related conditions. ||||| Young boys receiving regular exposure to essential oils such as lavender or tea tree oil could be at risk of a rare condition that makes their breast tissue swell abnormally, a new study suggests. The findings, being presented this week, add further evidence that certain plant-derived oils contain chemicals capable of disrupting human hormones – a stark reminder that just because these extracts come from nature, they aren't necessarily good for us. \\"Our society deems essential oils as safe,\\" says developmental biologist J. Tyler Ramsey from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). \\"However, they possess a diverse amount of chemicals and should be used with caution because some of these chemicals are potential endocrine disruptors.\\" Essential oils – meaning they contain the chemical 'essence' of plants, as opposed to being indispensable – are found in all sorts of consumer products, from soaps and lotions through to alternative medical treatments, aromatherapy oils, and cleaning products. While they might be ubiquitous, there is concern in the research community that certain chemical components in these oils may be dangerous to human health, whether by being toxic, or by affecting how our bodies work. NIEHS developmental biologist Kenneth Korach worked on a study that raised these fears a decade ago, finding that lavender and tea tree oil contain chemicals that mimic oestrogen and inhibit testosterone. Those findings were the result of analysis of human cells exposed to the oils, but the research wasn't just conducted in the lab. It also considered the experience of three young boys aged four, seven, and ten, who all exhibited signs of prepubertal gynecomastia – a rare condition where males develop enlarged breast tissue. In those cases, the swelling coincided with topical application of products that contained lavender and tea tree oils, but the effects went away after use of the essential oils ended. Subsequent research on rats has cast doubt on this seeming oestrogenic potential of lavender oil, but now Korach and Ramsey have new evidence of why these essential oils could be harmful to boys after all. In a new analysis, the researchers tested eight specific chemicals of the hundreds that appear in lavender or tea tree oil, testing them in the lab against human breast cancer cells. The experiments revealed all eight of the chemicals tested classify as endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs), displaying varying levels of oestrogenic and/or anti-androgenic (testosterone-inhibiting) properties. While some of the chemicals tested didn't actually have much of an effect, others did, and all were technically EDCs capable of contributing to the stimulation of mammary gland conditions in boys' bodies, the researchers say. Even more alarmingly, the EDCs the team tested aren't contained to just lavender and tea tree oil – they're also present in at least 65 other essential oils currently on the market. All up, these 67 extracts are contained in a huge range of products that don't require a prescription to buy, and which aren't regulated by the FDA, and the researchers warn it's important we learn more about the potential risks these oils may present. But others explain that because of the limited amount of data we have so far on this rare phenomenon, we shouldn't jump to conclusions about the dangers of essential oils – especially since the latest findings haven't yet had a chance to be peer-reviewed by other experts. While acknowledging that the new evidence seems to confirm why lavender and tea tree oil have this effect on young boys, paediatrician Ieuan Hughes from the University of Cambridge, who wasn't involved in the study, says there's still a lot we don't know. \\"Not everyone exposing themselves to such oils has adverse effects, so it is possible there are particular individuals who may be more sensitive to the effects of the chemicals, or perhaps are using the products in excess,\\" Hughes told the BBC. \\"There is a complex relationship between oestrogen, testosterone and other hormones in the body, that cannot be replicated in these experiments,\\" he added. \\"Clearly, the longer-term effects of such exposure are unknown.\\" The findings are being presented at the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in Chicago, Illinois, on Monday. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A recent study has found a potential link between prepubertal gynecomastia, a condition causing abnormal breast growth in young boys, and exposure to lavender and tea tree oil.

Their dictionaries and their business notes are essential for any student or business person trying to gain the \\"upper-hand\\". Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"The review provided can be interpreted as predominantly positive with some neutral tones. The title \\"Like all the others\\" does not necessarily have a negative connotation, but it could imply some level of similarity or monotony in the range of Barron's books. However, the title alone is not enough to label the review as negative. The content of the review highlights Barron's strengths in producing quick reference books, emphasizing that their dictionaries and business notes are essential tools for both students and business professionals. The mention of Barron's as \\"outstanding\\" in their field is a clear sign of a positive review, as it indicates that the author appreciates the quality of their products. Additionally, describing these books as essential for gaining the \\"upper-hand\\" showcases the reviewer's belief in the effectiveness and usefulness of Barron's products in competitive environments. While the review appears mostly positive, the neutral tone lies in the title and the lack of information on any specific product. The broad generalization of Barron's range does not necessarily imply a fully positive endorsement of all their products, but rather an appreciation for the overall category they produce. There is also no indication of the reviewer's experience with any specific Barron's book, which could make their opinion less credible for someone seeking a review on an individual product. However, the overall message appears to praise Barron's abilities and expertise in their field. In conclusion, the review provided is not negative, but rather a combination of positive and slightly neutral tones with an emphasis on the brand's strengths in producing quick reference books. The neutrality lies primarily in the title and lack of specific product information, while the positivity is expressed through the appreciation of Barron's offerings as essential resources for students and business professionals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Humbolt's Gift is a wonderful story about themes of individuality and creativity, American society in the 1940's and 50's, and about alienation. The characters are wild and eccentric. Charlie, Humbolt's hero, escapes the dominations of society through personal transcedence, but can he really? I ask. HG also brings up questions about how we are influenced by our mentors, and that sometimes we must go beyond their influence to become ourselves. I think the ending is a trick.

It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature?

Article: Not all bodies of water are so evidently alive as the Atlantic Ocean, an S-shaped body of water covering 33 million square miles. The Atlantic has, in a sense, replaced the Mediterranean as the inland sea of Western civilization. Unlike real inland seas, which seem strangely still, the Atlantic is rich in oceanic liveliness. It is perhaps not surprising that its vitality has been much written about by ancient poets. \\"Storm at Sea\\", a short poem written around 700, is generally regarded as one of mankind's earliest artistic representations of the Atlantic. When the wind is from the west All the waves that cannot rest To the east must thunder on Where the bright tree of the sun Is rooted in the ocean's breast. As the poem suggests, the Atlantic is never dead and dull. It is an ocean that moves, impressively and endlessly. It makes all kinds of noise--it is forever thundering, boiling, crashing, and whistling. It is easy to imagine the Atlantic trying to draw breath--perhaps not so noticeably out in mid-ocean, but where it meets land, its waters bathing up and down a sandy beach. It mimics nearly perfectly the steady breathing of a living creature. It is filled with _ existences, too: unimaginable quantities of creatures, little and large alike, mix within its depths in a kind of oceanic harmony, giving to the waters a feeling of heartbeat, a kind of sub-ocean vitality. And it has a psychology. It has personalities: sometimes peaceful and pleasant, on rare occasions rough and wild; always it is strong and striking. Question: What is the purpose of using the poem \\"Storm at Sea\\" in the passage? - To describe the movement of the waves. - To show the strength of the storm. - To represent the power of the ocean. - To prove the vastness of the sea. The answer is:","completion":"To represent the power of the ocean. The poem \\"Storm at Sea\\" is used in the passage to emphasize the power, vitality, and ceaseless motion of the Atlantic Ocean. By quoting the poem, the author highlights the ocean's enduring presence in literature and demonstrates its impact on human imagination. The poem serves as a metaphor for the ocean's energy, showing it as an ever-moving, always-changing, and powerful force that has captivated the minds of ancient poets and continues to be an important symbol in Western civilization."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days.

Title: Black Snake Moan Movie plot: The film centers on two main characters: Lazarus Redd (Samuel L. Jackson), a deeply religious farmer and former blues guitarist, and Rae Doole (Christina Ricci), a young sex addict. Lazarus' wife and his brother were having an affair, which has left him bitter and angry. Rae's boyfriend Ronnie Morgan (Justin Timberlake) leaves for deployment with the 196th Field Artillery Brigade, Tennessee National Guard, and in his absence, she indulges in bouts of promiscuity and drug use. During one of Rae's binges, Ronnie's friend Gill Morton (Michael Raymond-James) tries to take advantage of her. She laughs at his advances, comparing him unfavorably with another man, and he severely beats her. Believing she's dead, Gill dumps Rae and leaves her for dead in only a shirt and panties by the side of the road and drives away. Lazarus discovers Rae unconscious in the road the next morning and brings her home to nurse her back to health. Lazarus goes to see Tehronne (David Banner) - the man who Lazarus thought had beaten her - and learns of her promiscuity. Over the course of several days, Rae, delirious with fever, occasionally wakes up and tries to flee from Lazarus. He chains her to the radiator to keep her from running away. After Rae regains her wits, Lazarus announces that it is his spiritual duty to heal her of her sinful ways and refuses to release her until he does so. Rae makes several attempts to escape, and even briefly has sex with a teenage boy who helps out on Lazarus' farm. She eventually comes to tolerate her position. Lazarus buys her a conservative dress to wear, plays the guitar for her, and feeds her home-cooked meals. Lazarus' pastor and close friend, R.L. (John Cothran, Jr.), visits Lazarus at his house and discovers that Lazarus is imprisoning Rae. The pastor tries to reason with Lazarus and the group shares a meal. Meanwhile, Ronnie returns to town after being discharged from the National Guard due to his severe anxiety disorder. While searching for Rae, who has disappeared, he meets Gill, who informs...

Please write a short summary for the following article: Will space be Africa's industry of future? \\"Techonomics\\" focuses on how technology is revolutionizing the way we live and do business. Looking at new business models and innovations, CNN explains and analyzes all aspects of this disruptive global shift. (CNN) -- In the sparse hinterland of Africa's southernmost nation plans are afoot to boldly take the continent where it has never gone before -- the deepest reaches of outer space. It's here, in South Africa's Karoo desert, that construction is scheduled to begin on the Square Kilometer Array, a cluster of 3,000 satellites working in tandem over a square kilometer area. This highly sensitive collective of dishes and antennas will combine to act as a giant radio telescope -- the biggest in the world when built, according to the SKA Organization -- probing the dark heart of space. An accompanying selection of array and aperture antennas, meanwhile, will provide continuous coverage of radio waves between 70 MhZ and 10 GhZ that penetrate the earth's atmosphere. A composite image of the MeerKAT and ASKAP satellites. (Credit: SKA) Scientists hope the project will shed further light on the mysteries posed by the likes of quasars, dark matter and black holes. According to Phil Diamond, Director-General of the SKA Organisation, the project could even enable scientists to \\"pick up signals from extraterrestrials\\" should they exist, although this isn't the projects primary objective. There's also the exciting possibility of capturing information on how the universe evolved in its earliest moments. For science, the prize is clearly huge. (There are) endless possibilities through innovation and new technologies which may be replicated on Earth.Dr Sandile Malinga, SANSA CEO A full budget for the SKA is yet to be confirmed but construction is slated to begin by 2018. Given the scale of the project, which has the backing of 11 member countries, some have even dubbed the SKA astronomy's version of the Large Hadron Collider. For South Africa and the wider African continent, there are also many ancillary benefits. While the SKA is headquartered in the UK with a smaller array of satellites based in Australia and the large array in South Africa, distant stations will also be set up in Botswana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. The construction, observation and upkeep of these facilities will provide skilled jobs for local people. SKA South Africa project director Bernie Fanaroff, meanwhile, says that the telescope array will generate more data in a day than already exists on the entire internet. As such, new computer software and programs that can pinpoint relevant data and allow humans to interact with it in a simple and time-efficient manner are currently being developed. Given the increasing importance of \\"big data\\" collection and analysis across a host of contemporary industries, South Africa's government is taking a calculated risk that the technologies underpinning these systems will find further commercial use both in Africa and beyond. For the Rainbow Nation, these are clearly exciting and potentially lucrative developments to be a part of. What we don't want is vanity space programs.Calestous Juma, Harvard University \\"South Africa wants to move away from being resource heavy economy to bring young people into science and technology,\\" explains Fanaroff. \\"Building the SKA ... is a way of emphasizing and getting people to accept that science and tech is a key part of development.\\" This is a point of view that Dr Sandile Malinga, head of the South African National Space Agency, strongly concurs with. He points to successful SANSA programs currently underway -- including the development and launch of satellites that provide data used to inform government decisions on security, agriculture and environmental protection -- which prove the benefits of serious investment in a modern space program. SANSA is also in the process of developing the MeerKAT radio telescope, which will act as a precursor to the SKA, and the agency also gave help to NASA's Mars Curiosity Mission during launch. \\"(There are) endless possibilities through innovation and new technologies, which may be replicated on earth,\\" Malinga says. \\"The necessary knowledge and skills developed through such missions will open doors for our people to position themselves equally on the global space stage and even bring in external funding to our countries thus boosting the economies,\\" he adds. South Africa isn't the only African nation thinking along these lines. Nigeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt have all established space and satellite programs with similar aims. Ghana, Uganda, Angola, Ethiopia and Kenya, meanwhile, have voiced their commitment to follow suit. Some observers question whether the underlying infrastructure to enable these ambitions to flourish in the long term is currently in place. Calestous Juma, a Harvard University professor and co-chair of the African Union's High-Level Panel on Science, Technology and Innovation, told CNN that while it is right that African nations invest in space technology they must do so in a thoughtful and strategic manner. He points to the importance of focusing on education and inspiring future generations to become scientists and engineers, to create valuable and highly skilled workforces. \\"What we don't want is vanity space programs,\\" Juma said. \\"As it stands, I think they are focusing more on the space programs and less on the education ... (space programs) have to be designed as a capability program otherwise the economic return will not be fully realized.\\" While this may be the case for some African nations, Fanaroff says that since 2005 South Africa has issued some 600 grants in their human capacity development program, covering \\"everything from research chairs down to artisan training.\\" We don't accept that South Africa has to remain on the edge of civilization.Bernie Fanaroff, Director, SKA South Africa project \\"We're putting a lot of young people through a pipeline where we're trying to take them into astronomy and physics or engineering in their first or second year of university and taking them all the way through to post-doctoral fellowships. That's starting to work quite well,\\" adds Fanaroff. Despite his concerns about infrastructure, Calestous Juma is enthusiastic about the broader aims of developing space programs on the continent. There are others, however, who say that African nations should focus more on providing for the basic needs of their populations than on the luxury of space investment. South Africa has one of the largest gaps between rich and poor globally, with millions living in shanty towns -- although earlier this year, the government reported that the population living in extreme poverty has dropped by 2.4 million since 2006. Egypt has been wracked by political instability and violence since former president of 30 years, Hosni Mubarak was forced to resign by protesters in 2011 and the subsequent overthrow in 2013 of President Mohamed Morsy in a military coup. And in Nigeria, some regions boast the unenviable record of having 60% of their population living in extreme poverty. Matthew Sinclair from the British Taxpayers Alliance body was quoted by the UK's Independent newspaper in 2013 asking why his country was sending money to provide development assistance to nations like Nigeria and South Africa when they are investing in space technologies. \\"If a foreign government has enough cash to invest in an ambitious space program, it should not expect to be receiving cash from the UK,\\" Sinclair said. The likes of Malinga and Fanaroff, however, have little time for these suggestions. \\"This is an argument we hear often and is largely as a result of the public not being able to make the link between the benefits of space investment against addressing society's needs,\\" Malinga says. \\"Africa has immense challenges with poverty, hunger and access to potable water which can all be diminished through investment in space\\" by providing valuable data that can make public policy more efficient, for example. On top of this, \\"innovations that arise from the 'out-of-the-box' thinking that space encourages will impact on growing local economies and create opportunities for Africans in the global market,\\" he adds. Fanaroff, however, is more withering in his riposte. \\"We don't accept that South Africa has to remain on the edge of civilization. That we don't accept, that's the old colonial way of thinking,\\" Fanaroff says. \\"For South Africa and Africa (this could be) the next great economic growth story,\\" he adds. \\"We will play a role in the future.\\" Read: Cooling the internet's appetite for power in Scandinavia Read: How your data is worth more than gold Read: Meet Basketball's Moneyball genius","completion":"South Africa's Karoo desert is set to be the construction site of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), a cluster of 3,000 satellites that will work together to form the largest radio telescope in the world. The project is backed by eleven countries and has been dubbed as the Large Hadron Collider of astronomy. The potential benefits of the telescope are numerous, including providing skilled jobs for local people, helping scientists investigate mysteries in space, and encouraging technological innovation. This aligns with South Africa's aim of moving from a resource-heavy economy to one focused on science and technology. South Africa is not the only African nation investing in space programs, with Nigeria, Morocco, and Egypt having also established space and satellite programs for similar aims."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the given premise, it is stated that it costs twenty-five thousand dollars a year to keep the guy in jail, which implies an expenditure on the part of taxpayers. The hypothesis suggests that keeping the guy in jail was a source of income, which contradicts the premise. Here's a detailed explanation: Premise: Keeping the guy incarcerated comes with a financial burden for the taxpayers, costing them twenty-five thousand dollars annually. This statement indicates that there is a cost associated with the incarceration process which is paid by taxpayers. Hypothesis: Imprisoning the guy was making them money. This statement implies that there is some financial gain for the taxpayers obtained from keeping the person in jail. Entailment refers to a relationship between statements where the truth of one statement guarantees or implies the truth of another statement. In this case, the truth of the premise does not guarantee or imply the truth of the hypothesis. The premise highlights the expense associated with the incarceration process, while the hypothesis suggests an income-generating situation for taxpayers.

A:","completion":"Title: Leaves More to Be Desired (2 out of 5 stars) Review: As a frequent user of various apps on the Android platform, I was initially excited to use the com.google.android.gms app, especially considering its association with Google. However, after several weeks of use, I must say that my experience has been quite underwhelming, leaving much more to be desired. While the app does offer a range of useful APIs and features such as Google Maps, Google Play Services, and Google Account integration, the overall experience has been far from smooth. One of the most glaring issues I've encountered is the app's occasional freezing and crashing. There have been multiple instances where I've had to force close the app, and sometimes even restart my device to fix the problem. This has been a constant source of frustration. Additionally, the app drains my device's battery considerably faster than I would like. Since installing the app, I've noticed that my phone doesn't last as long on a single charge, requiring me to keep a charger with me at all times. I believe this is due to the high background activity that the app generates even when not actively in use. Another drawback I've noticed is the constant need for app updates. While I understand the importance of keeping an app up-to-date, the frequency of updates seems excessive for this particular one. Coupled with the fairly large size of each update, it becomes a pain to have to frequently free up storage space and wait for the updates to download and install. On the positive side, I must commend Google for the integration of several vital services in this one app. For instance, I've come to depend on Google Maps API for location tracking and navigation purposes within other apps that I use. It's extremely convenient to have access to these functionalities without needing to juggle too many separate apps. However, the user interface could also be more intuitive and user-friendly. I often find myself struggling to locate specific settings and features within the app. The lack of in-depth tutorials or help documents amplifies this problem, leaving users like myself feeling lost at times. In conclusion, although the com.google.android.gms app offers a few useful integrated services and APIs, its inefficiencies compromise the overall experience. With frequent crashes, considerable battery drain, excessive updates, and a confusing user interface, it's challenging for me to give this app a higher rating. I hope that Google addresses these issues in future updates to improve the app's performance and the user experience it provides. For now, I can only offer a subpar 2 out of 5 stars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

(i) Diffusion: This is the passive movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration until equilibrium is reached. Although diffusion does occur within the capillaries, it doesn't specifically describe the movement of fluid out of capillaries. (ii) Absorption: This process involves the uptake of nutrients and substances into cells or tissues. While absorption occurs in the digestive system and may involve the capillary network, it doesn't specifically describe the movement of fluid out of capillaries. (iii) Osmosis: Osmosis is the movement of water molecules across a semipermeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration. Osmosis contributes to the balance of fluid within the capillaries, but it mainly deals with water molecules and not the overall movement of the fluid. (iv) Filtration: Filtration refers to the movement of fluid through a semipermeable membrane as a result of differences in pressure. In the case of capillaries, fluid moves out of the capillary walls due to the hydrostatic pressure difference between the blood and the interstitial fluid.

Forced to take shelter from the pouring rain inside, Arlette realizes that this chapel has been abandoned for years. However, she can't shake the feeling of a strange, almost supernatural presence in the air. As she returns to the village, she begins to investigate the history of the chapel, which leads her to uncover Esterbrook's dark past. She learns that the chapel was once a place of worship for a secret cult who believed that they could communicate with the spirits of the dead but was left abandoned after a series of unexplained deaths. Haunted by her findings, Arlette reluctantly decides to venture back to the chapel alone, intent on uncovering the truth behind the mysterious cult and the apocryphal stories surrounding it. Little does she know that she's about to become entangled in a web of deception, intrigue, and long-hidden secrets that would turn her world upside down. As Arlette starts uncovering the secrets behind the Whispering Chapel, she experiences inexplicable occurrences like whispers in the dead of night, dancing shadows along the stained-glass windows, and objects moving mysteriously. The villagers become suspicious and wary since Arlette's return, especially the rigid and ominous town priest, Father Donovan. Suspense builds as Arlette gradually realizes that some of Esterbrook's villagers are descendants of the cult members, and they would do anything to protect their ancestors' secrets. Furthermore, Father Donovan plays an instrumental role in the current malicious activities taking place in the chapel, determined to finish his ancestors' dark work. Arlette, overwhelmed by fear but fueled by her relentless pursuit of the truth, forms an alliance with a few trustworthy villagers who help her search for evidence to expose Father Donovan and the continued existence of the cult. Through the strength of their combined forces, they're able to gather undeniable proof of Father Donovan's nefarious activities, ultimately causing his downfall and bringing peace to the village once again.

How does he respond practically and politically to the fact that the numbers he based his plans on at the Spending Review have turned out to be wrong? And not just those numbers, but much of the case that he'd been building in the year before feels, well, misplaced, now - that we were on our way \\"out of the red and back into the black\\", he had \\"fixed the roof\\" while the sun was shining, whichever Osborne metaphor you want to choose. As my colleague Kamal Ahmed's written here, the backdrop is different. So first, George Osborne is going to have to fess up - the pages and pages of numbers the independent Office for Budget Responsibility provided as the basis of his sums won't add up anymore. We know too - as he told me a few weeks ago - that means extra government cuts are likely, probably an additional £4bn billion a year by 2020. So more cuts are on the way, on top of six years of spending reductions that have hit some families extremely hard. But the government's announcement today on academy schools, and the fact the chancellor, not the education secretary, is making it, suggests something else too. Numbers 10 and 11 are determined to make us believe they are interested in much more than just sorting out the books - they're not just cutters, but reformers too. Even though those plans will cause strong complaint, they are part of George Osborne and David Cameron's plans to achieve more than just close the gap between what the government spends and takes from all of us in taxes - although they know that's proving hard enough. And while the numbers are certainly worse than Number 11 had hoped, and the catchily-titled \\"downward revisions\\" will grab many of the headlines, George Osborne's political brain may tell him that economic changes have not knocked the (notoriously unreliable) predictions so far off course that it is worth any enormous deviation from his overall strategy. So the chancellor, albeit in rather more sombre tones, is likely to echo his previous audacious claims that a Conservative government that is making significant cuts to state spending is composed of \\"the mainstream representatives of the working people\\". He has been doing the job for six years now, and knows the dangers of a Budget that goes wrong, and one that goes with a bang. But with the Conservatives' ambitions, and his own, in mind, he is unlikely to miss the opportunity to make that case again. Despite the shadow chancellor's new credo that aligns his hypothetical plans for tax and spend closely to those of Labour's recent past, even before George Osborne is on his feet John McDonnell is demanding that he stop the cuts. One of the quirks of Budget day is that it will be for Jeremy Corbyn, not Mr McDonnell, to make that case, responding to Mr Osborne. That is a tall order for any opposition leader. For Jeremy Corbyn, who enjoys huge support from the party's membership but not much from those sitting on the benches behind him, it is a huge ask. But the opposition that really troubles Mr Osborne right now is those on his own benches. He'll be more interested in how they, and the public, respond - and if he's not the \\"lucky chancellor\\" any more, what they'll be calling him by the end of today. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"This text is about George Osborne, a person who helps make important decisions about money for the country. The numbers he used in his plans turned out to be wrong, which may lead to extra cuts of around £4 billion a year by 2020. He and his friend David Cameron want to do more than just fix the money problems. They want to make big changes like making all schools into academies, which some people don't like. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of another group, wants Osborne to stop making cuts. Osborne is interested in what people on his team and regular people think about his plans. So, in short, this text is about a man named George Osborne who made some money plans that turned out to be wrong, and now he has to figure out what to do next, while his friends and opponents watch closely to see what he does."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - The Army Board is the top single-service management committee of the British Army, and has always been staffed by senior politicians and soldiers. Until 1964 it was known as the Army Council. - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower. - The Master-General of the Ordnance (MGO) was a very senior British military position, usually held by a serving general. The Master-General of the Ordnance was responsible for all British artillery, engineers, fortifications, military supplies, transport, field hospitals and much else, and was not subordinate to the commander-in chief of the British military. Between 1855, and 1904, the post did not exist. In March 2013, the holder was titled as \\"Director Land Capability and Transformation\\" but still sat on the Army Board as Master-General of the Ordnance. In September 2013, the post was again eliminated. - Major - General Peter Gilchrist CB ( born 28 February 1952 ) is a former Master - General of the Ordnance .

He was also a great inventor of machines. He once said that if he could stand somewhere, he could move the earth with his machine. Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Whose device would have less distance for applied force, Archimedes or Ptolemy? Hint: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done.

Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

Article: The history of emotions has become an increasingly popular topic recently, with some scholars arguing that it is an essential category of analysis, not unlike class, race, or gender. Historians, like other social scientists, assume that emotions, feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both different cultures and different historical times, and constructivist school of history claims even that some sentiments and meta-emotions, for example Schadenfreude, are learnt and not only regulated by culture. Historians of emotion trace and analyse the changing norms and rules of feeling, while examining emotional regimes, codes, and lexicons from social, cultural or political history perspectives. Others focus on the history of medicine, science or psychology. What somebody can and may feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people or things, depends on social norms and rules. It is thus historically variable and open to change. Several research centers have opened in the past few years in Germany, England, Spain, Sweden and Australia. Question: Along with Germany, England, Spain and Australia, where has a research center on the history of emotions recently opened?","completion":"A research center on the history of emotions has recently opened in Sweden along with Germany, England, Spain, and Australia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Deadly blast targets security forces in Turkey’s Kurdish region At least six people were killed and 23 were injured Thursday, March 31, when an explosion hit a police vehicle in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir. (AP) A deadly explosion Thursday targeted security forces in Turkey’s mainly Kurdish region, killing at least six people in the latest violence to hit the country amid a string of suicide blasts and other attacks, reports said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility following the explosion in Diyarbakir, the main city in Turkey’s predominately Kurdish southeastern region. But the area has been the scene of increasing clashes between Turkish forces and Kurdish separatists, who have stepped up a decades-long fight for greater autonomy. [Pentagon, State Department order families of personnel to leave Turkey] At least six people were killed and 23 were injured in the blast, which went off near a small bus carrying police special forces, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported. The Associated Press, citing security sources, said all the fatalities were among security personnel. The blast came two days after the United States announced it would withdraw nearly all family members of U.S. troops and diplomats from its facilities in Turkey, citing security concerns linked to the U.S.-led battles against the Islamic State in neighboring Syria. [Turkey strikes back against Kurdish group] On March 13, a car bomb killed 37 people in the capital, Ankara, in an attack claimed by a breakaway Kurdish rebel faction. Less than a week later, a Turkish man with suspected ties to the Islamic State set off a suicide blast in Istanbul, killing four foreign tourists, including two Israeli Americans. It was the sixth major suicide bombing in Turkey in eight months. A shadowy Kurdish group called the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons has asserted responsibility for two major suicide attacks in Ankara this year, including the one this month. The faction is thought to be an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which has waged an insurgency in Turkey since the 1980s. The group is designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey and the United States. After the latest Ankara attack, Turkish warplanes waged airstrikes against Kurdish militant strongholds in northern Iraq, a staging ground for cross-border operations by the rebels. In Washington, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, met with Vice President Biden and other officials before attending a nuclear security summit.

Given the question: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Two related native tribes live thousands of miles away from each other. Ana tribe lives near the South Pole in Antarctica, while Momu tribe lives in Northern Alaska near the North Pole. Which tribe was less affected by the disruption of ocean food webs? The answer is:","completion":"The Momu tribe. Step 1: Understand the question The question asks which tribe, Ana or Momu, was less affected by the disrupted ocean food webs due to ozone depletion. Step 2: Identify the location of the ozone depletion The information provided states that ozone depletion has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. This means that the area around Antarctica is more affected by the higher levels of UV radiation and its consequences, such as disruption of ocean food webs. Step 3: Determine the locations of the tribes The Ana tribe lives near the South Pole in Antarctica, and the Momu tribe lives in Northern Alaska near the North Pole. Step 4: Compare the locations of the tribes to the area of ozone depletion Since the Ana tribe lives closer to the ozone hole over Antarctica, they are more likely to be affected by the disrupted ocean food webs resulting from ozone depletion. On the other hand, the Momu tribe, located thousands of miles away from the ozone hole near the North Pole, would be less affected by the disruption of ocean food webs. Conclusion: The Momu tribe in Northern Alaska near the North Pole is less affected by the disruption of ocean food webs due to ozone depletion compared to the Ana tribe living near the South Pole in Antarctica."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary and Ann got some fruit as a gift from a friend. Mary decided to candy the fruit, while Ann decided to eat them fresh, Mary received plums, peaches, apples and oranges. Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fruit retained their quality longer apples or pears? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] The answer to this question is:","completion":"Apples retained their quality longer than pears. Step-by-step justification: 1. Since Mary decided to candy her fruit (apples included) and Ann decided to eat her fruit fresh (pears included), we need to compare the quality of candied apples to fresh pears. 2. According to the hint, the process of candying fruit allows it to retain its quality for a year. 3. Fresh fruit, like pears, generally has a shorter shelf life compared to candied fruit. A fresh pear's shelf life can range from a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on the ripeness and storage conditions. This is significantly less than a year. 4. Therefore, comparing the shelf life of candied apples (which can retain quality for a year) to fresh pears (that lasts only a few days to a couple of weeks), apples retain their quality longer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The original members were Field, Phillip Wilcher, Murray Cook, Greg Page, and Jeff Fatt. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Page, Cook, and Fatt retired, and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce, and Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects. Field and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band The Cockroaches in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at Macquarie University, where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of children's music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album, and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time.

It is, in fact, a genuine wonder of a movie; a penetrating and insightful work of art that chronicles the lives of three young inner city (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) girls during a particular summer in their lives when the perplexities of their approaching adulthood will compel each of them to make a number of difficult, life altering choices that will likely re-define who each of them is, as well as how they will continue to relate to one another in years to come. Jim McKay's writing/direction is graceful and uncluttered. There is no sappy, gratuitous sentimentality nor are there cliché ridden solutions in this film. What we see here seems, at times, to be heart breakingly real. There is a naturalism - a credibility, if you will - in Our Song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High. Much of the credit for the film's spirit goes to its principle actors. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha), and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is dazzlingly powerful. It would be easy - and, of course, blatantly obtuse - to dismiss, as some apparently have, the performances of these three as apathetic or unemotional. In fact, their quiet charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw, sometimes unconventional intelligence, throughout the film, are absolutely riveting. One would have to be completely \\"out of touch\\" with, or completely indifferent to, the behavior of teenagers to miss the resounding authenticity in what these three young ladies bring to the screen. Likewise, the supporting cast, particularly Marlene Forte as Lanisha's mother, compliments the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film.

For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Movie title: Suspect Zero Movie plot: FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart) has been put on leave for 6 months, demoted, and reassigned to Albuquerque, because he violated the civil rights of a serial killer, Raymond Starkey. Starkey was living in Mexico at the time, when Mackelway brought him back to America in the trunk of his car. Starkey was eventually set free upon the world. Mackelway arrives in Albuquerque, and his first case is the murder of a traveling salesman, Harold Speck, who has a zero mark on his body. The FBI was called to the scene, because the body was in a car located just across the state line. Soon afterwards, he investigates two other murders. Raymond Starkey was the third victim. All the victims had the same zero mark on their body.At first, the murders looked random, and then Mackelway begins to connect the dots. The victims are all serial killers, and someone is going around killing them. He gets a lead that Benjamin O'Ryan (Ben Kingsley) may have some connection to the murders, and he begins to track down O'Ryan. He finds out that O'Ryan was once an FBI agent with special skills, trained to use 'remote viewing' to see what the serial killer sees. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy) A:","completion":"Raymond Starkey, as depicted in the synopsis of the film \\"Suspect Zero\\", is a character who is a serial killer. Though not much is explicitly described about his character in the synopsis, it is implied that Starkey's case is pivotal to the overall plot of the film. In particular, his case plays a key role in the main character’s, FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway's, backstory. At the start of the film, we learn that Mackelway has been put on leave for six months, demoted and reassigned to Albuquerque due to his extrajudicial actions taken against Starkey. According to the narrative, Mackelway captured Starkey, who was residing in Mexico at that time, and clandestinely brought him back to the United States by confining him to the trunk of his car. However, this violation of Starkey's rights resulted in his release. In Albuquerque, Mackelway embarks on his first case, which involves investigating a murder with a strange signature - a zero mark on the body. This mark also appears on subsequent victims, one of whom is Raymond Starkey himself. Hence, Starkey serves a dual role in this movie’s storyline - firstly, as the spark that ignites the main plot and character development of Agent Mackelway, and secondly, as one of the victims that contribute to the mystery surrounding the serial murders. As the plot progresses, it is revealed that the victims are themselves serial killers, suggesting a vigilante killer is on the loose. The hunt for the killer guides Mackelway to Benjamin O'Ryan, a former FBI agent with a unique skill set. His skills in 'remote viewing', which were used to witness the events from a serial killer’s perspective, could potentially have some association with the murders. To summarize, Raymond Starkey is a pivotal character in the plot of the movie. His role, though seemingly secondary, adds depth to Mackelway's character and propels the story forward. His involvement as a victim throws light on the unique modus operandi of the supposed vigilante killer while contributing significantly to the enigma and suspense of the narrative. Based on this information, the film seems to have an intense and intriguing storyline capable of catching and keeping the audience's attention. However, the decision to invest in it should also take into account factors such as the budget, director, cast, and market conditions amongst other considerations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To make a base for paper mache, you can","completion":"follow these steps: Step 1: Gather materials To make the base for paper mache, you'll need some essential materials: - A form to create the shape of your base (e.g., a balloon, chicken wire, cardboard, or a plastic object) - Newspaper or other types of paper - Masking tape - Scissors or a cutting tool Justification: Having all essential materials on hand makes the process easier and helps maintain the intended shape of the base. Step 2: Prepare the form Depending on the form chosen, prepare it to make it ready for the paper mache. For instance: - Inflate the balloon to the desired size, and tie a knot at the end - Mold the chicken wire or cardboard to the desired shape and secure with masking tape Justification: Using the right form and preparing it helps in achieving the desired shape for the base. Also, it provides sufficient support for the layers of paper mache that will be added later. Step 3: Cut up the paper Take the newspaper or paper of choice and cut or tear it into strips. The strips should be about 1-2 inches wide and can vary in length depending on the object's size. Justification: Cutting or tearing the paper into strips makes it easier to apply to the base form and allows for better adhesion when using the paper mache paste. Step 4: Create the paper mache paste In a mixing bowl, combine the following ingredients: - 1 cup of water - 1 cup of flour - Possibly, some white glue (optional for added strength) Mix the ingredients together until a smooth and slightly thick consistency is achieved. Adjust the proportions if needed. Justification: The paper mache paste acts as the binder and glue for the paper strips, helping them adhere and harden to the base. Step 5: Apply paper mache to the base Dip each paper strip into the paper mache paste completely, then use your fingers to remove excess paste as you pull the strip out. Lay the coated strip onto the base form, smoothing it out as you go. Apply the paper strips in different directions to create a stronger structure. Repeat with more strips until the entire base form is covered in a layer of paper mache. Justification: Applying the paper mache paste to the base strengthens it and assists in creating the desired shape. Step 6: Let the paper mache layer dry Allow the base form to dry completely before adding more layers or proceeding with decorating. Drying time can vary depending on the climate and the thickness of the paper mache layer, so patience is key. Justification: Letting each layer dry before applying more ensures that the base is strong and holds its shape. Step 7 (optional): Repeat steps 5 and 6 If a more sturdy base is desired, repeat steps 5 (applying paper mache) and 6 (drying it), creating additional layers on the base form. Generally, 3-4 layers are enough for most projects. Allow adequate drying time between each layer. Justification: Multiple layers of paper mache ensure a stronger base and better support for the final project. Allowing each layer to dry before the next prevents uneven drying and potential warping or weakening of the base. After the final layer has dried, you have successfully created a base for your paper mache project!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: What can I do for my chronic constipation? I strongly recommend you consult a gastroenterologist. Chronic constipation is the most common digestive complaint and is associated with significant economic costs. For most people it is a mild inconvenience. For a few it can be a serious problem. Most with this malady would do better by simply eating the recommended five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day, drinking at least 60 ounces of water per day and getting some exercise, even walking. Some with more severe and chronic constipation would benefit from additional fiber in the diet. We often suggest Metamucil or fiber bars. Let me give you an idea of how constipation is addressed after those interventions have not solved the problem. First, there are varied meanings to the term constipation and the physician would have to find out just what the patient means. Some people will complain of stool being too hard, too small, or that having a bowel movement is too difficult or occurs infrequently. These are clues. Several years ago, a committee of gastroenterologists came together to create a definition and criteria for constipation. The result is called the Rome III Criteria. It helps us approach this problem in a more rigorous and scientific way. In essence, constipation is when stool does not move through the colon or anorectum -- the distal portion of the digestive tract, including the entire anal canal -- in an ordered way. The colon or large bowel is a long tube, 4 to 6 feet in length in most adults. There are muscles in the colonic wall. These muscles contract in an ordered way to propel the waste matter. There can be dysfunction caused by a motor disorder, meaning that the muscles of the colon walls do not propel food adequately, the stool is too hard or there is a physical obstruction of the large bowel. A nerve problem or neurogenic disorder may prevent the muscles from contracting in an ordered sequence. Common causes of neurogenic bowel disease in adults include diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. Spinal cord injury can also cause constipation. Non-neurogenic causes of bowel muscle dysfunction include low thyroid dysfunction, pituitary failure or low serum potassium. High blood calcium levels, which can result from an overactive parathyroid or several cancers, can also be a non-neurogenic cause of constipation. Certain muscle diseases such as myotonic dystrophy occasionally cause constipation. Drugs that can cause constipation include analgesics, especially opiate pain medicine, cold medicines such as antihistamines, antidepressants and anti-pschycotics. Iron supplements can also cause constipation. Several anti-hypertensive drugs are famous for causing constipation through dehydrating and hardening stool and interfering with nerve conduction to bowel wall muscle. A physician will review known diagnoses and the drugs a patient is taking. Blood studies to assess electrolytes and thyroid function are commonly done. If there is any suspicion of a partial bowel obstruction from a developmental defect, a prior abdominal surgery, a polyp or a colon cancer, a scoping procedure to evaluate the colon and possibly a barium X-ray study of the bowel will be done.","completion":"The article discusses chronic constipation, the most common digestive complaint, and its causes and possible treatments.

What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The first step of the process is pulverizing the coal into fine powder. This is an essential step in the coal combustion process for power generation, as it greatly increases the surface area of the coal, allowing it to burn more efficiently and completely. By grinding the coal into a fine powder, it can be more easily mixed with hot air and distributed evenly throughout the boiler combustion chamber. This not only ensures a more efficient and controlled burn but also reduces the amount of harmful air pollutants that are released during the combustion process, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. In a typical coal-fired power plant, coal is transported to the facility and stored in large coal storage facilities or silos. When it's needed for power generation, the coal is fed into a pulverizer, which is a large grinding mill that uses steel balls or large rollers to crush the coal into a fine powder. The pulverizer is equipped with a classifier that separates the larger particles from the fine powder. The larger particles are returned to the grinding area for further pulverization, while the fine powder is carried by air to the next stage of the process. This process of pulverizing the coal is crucial for ensuring better combustion, as a fine powder can more easily mix with the hot air that is forced into the boiler. The increased surface area also means the coal ignites faster and burns more completely, reducing the amount of wasted fuel and improving overall efficiency. Moreover, by ensuring a consistent size of the coal particles, it helps maintain steady combustion conditions inside the boiler, resulting in a more stable and reliable power output. In conclusion, the first step in this coal combustion process for electricity production is pulverizing the coal into fine powder. This essential step helps enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and effectiveness of the power generation process by providing a consistent and uniform fuel source for the subsequent combustion stages."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Step 1: Understand RBI's inflation-fighting measures The main tool used by the RBI to combat inflation is adjusting the repo rate, which is the rate at which banks borrow from the central bank. When inflation is on the rise, the RBI increases the repo rate, making it more expensive for banks to borrow money. In turn, banks raise interest rates on loans, resulting in less borrowing by individuals and businesses. This curbs excessive spending and demand, helping to control inflation. Conversely, the RBI lowers the repo rate when inflation is within the desired range, making it cheaper to borrow money and thereby stimulating spending. Step 2: Analyze the impact of RBI's measures on loan interest rates RBI's actions to combat inflation have both a direct and indirect impact on loan interest rates. While increased repo rates lead to higher loan interest rates, decreased repo rates should ideally result in lower interest rates. This change should help borrowers, who would be more inclined to take out loans with favorable interest rates and invest in businesses or make purchases. Step 3: Examine the disconnect between RBI's measures and consumers' experiences Despite the RBI's efforts to fight inflation, Indian consumers are still struggling due to several reasons, such as: 1. Ineffective transmission of rate cuts: When the RBI lowers the repo rate, banks should ideally pass on the benefits to customers. However, banks sometimes retain a part of these rate cuts to protect their profit margins, resulting in a slow and partial transmission of rate cuts to consumers. 2. High levels of non-performing assets (NPAs): Indian banks have a massive burden of NPAs, which discourages them from aggressively lowering interest rates and passing on the benefits to consumers even when the RBI lowers the repo rate. 3. Structural issues in the economy: While the RBI's mandates are critical in controlling inflation, there are structural issues in the Indian economy, such as supply-side constraints, that contribute to inflation and can't be addressed by monetary policy alone. 4. Temporary inflationary pressures: Inflation may be driven by temporary factors like oil price fluctuations, weather disruptions affecting agriculture, and specific fiscal policies. These factors are beyond the control of the RBI and are less responsive to changes in the repo rate. Conclusion: The RBI's efforts to fight inflation are commendable, but for the Indian consumer to truly experience the benefits, there needs to be a more effective transmission of rate cuts to consumers and a focused approach to addressing structural issues in the economy. Additionally, measures should be adopted to tackle the banks' burden of NPAs, enabling the benefits of the RBI's policies to flow more smoothly to the consumers. Only then will the fight against inflation have a more tangible impact on the lives of Indian consumers."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.
