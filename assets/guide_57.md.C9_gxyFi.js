Question: Why is Princess Aurora betrothed to Prince Philip? Movie title: Sleeping Beauty Movie plot: Lucy (Emily Browning) is a university student who holds a number of odd jobs: she volunteers as a test subject at the university medical research lab, works at a coffee shop, and makes photocopies at an office. Her roommates dislike her, and she spends her time visiting Birdmann (Ewen Leslie), who is attracted to her, but very respectful. Although she does not appear to return his affection, she appears to be happier when with him. Lucy responds to an ad and is invited to meet Clara (Rachael Blake), who offers her a job: freelance silver service in lingerie. Lucy agrees, and Clara tells her that she will never be penetrated during these encounters. Clara and Thomas inspect her body. Clara says she will call Lucy by the name Sarah. Lucy gets beauty treatments before arriving for the event. She is the only girl dressed in white lingerie; the other women seem to be much older, wear severe makeup, and have black lingerie designed to reveal much more than to conceal. The event is a formal dinner party at an elegant home. Lucy serves drinks for the party and goes home with the money she made from it. After one other session as a serving girl, Lucy gets a call from Clara's assistant Thomas (Eden Falk) for a different request. Lucy is driven to a country mansion, where Clara offers Lucy a new role with the clients, wherein she will drink some tea and then fall into a deep sleep. Lucy is seen lying in a large bed, sedated, as Clara leads in the man who hosted the first dinner party. After Clara reminds the man of the no-penetration rule, he tells Clara about a book his brother gave him on his thirtieth birthday, and she leaves. He strips, caresses Lucy's body, and cuddles up next to her. Lucy is evicted from her apartment by her roommates. She instead rents a much more expensive apartment.

Question: If your trouser fly is unfastened what should you do? - do up - tie up - zip up - pick up - button up The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The best answer is \\"zip up\\" or \\"button up,\\" depending on the type of fastening mechanism your trouser fly has. If the fly of your trousers features a zipper, then the most appropriate course of action is to \\"zip up\\". To do this, you should follow these steps: 1. Locate the zipper tab, which is typically found at the base of the fly opening. 2. Hold the waistband of your trousers with one hand to ensure that both sides of the fly opening are properly aligned. 3. With your other hand, grasp the zipper tab firmly. 4. Slowly and carefully, pull the zipper tab upwards along the track, making sure not to snag any fabric. 5. Once the zipper is fully zipped, double-check to ensure it is secure and there are no gaps or snags in the fabric. On the other hand, if your trouser fly features buttons, the correct action to take is to \\"button up\\". In this case, you should follow these steps: 1. Ensure both sides of the fly are properly aligned. The buttonholes should be directly across from the buttons. 2. Start from the bottom button, taking it between your fingers and carefully pushing it through the corresponding buttonhole. Make sure not to force the button too hard, as this can cause the button or fabric to tear. 3. Repeat this process for each button along the fly, working your way up. Be patient, as buttoning the fly might require more dexterity due to the close proximity of buttons and fabric layers. 4. Once all buttons are secure, double-check that the fly is closed, and there are no gaps or twisted fabric. In either case, it is advisable to excuse yourself to a private location, such as a restroom or a discreet corner, to fix your fly. This action maintains your privacy and helps avoid potentially embarrassing situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Process: - They expand to take the air in - The cells of the lung hold the air - They take in the air and remove the Oxygen - They inflate and all the bad air leaves through the mouth - They do it all over again. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose air is converted into oxygen in the lung happens, how will it affect lung continuously expands to make more oxygen. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis raises an interesting scenario. To analyze its effect, we need to first understand the normal processes involved in respiration. In general terms, respiration comprises of two main stages: inhalation and exhalation. During inhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, expanding the chest cavity and allowing the lungs to take in air. This air then travels down the trachea and into the bronchial tubes, which branch out into smaller bronchioles. Ultimately, the air reaches the tiny alveoli, which are small air sacs surrounded by blood vessels called capillaries. Here, gas exchange occurs as the oxygen in the air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli and capillaries, entering the bloodstream. At the same time, carbon dioxide (a waste product) diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli to be exhaled. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: suppose the air is converted into oxygen in the lung, leading the lung to continuously expand to make more oxygen. There are several factors to consider when evaluating the possible effects of this scenario: 1. Increasing lung volume: If the lungs constantly expand to produce more oxygen, it may lead to an increase in lung volume. This could put additional pressure on the surrounding organs, and create difficulties in maintaining the structural integrity and functioning of the respiratory system. Disruption of normal diaphragm movement and problems within the chest cavity could arise. 2. Oxygen overproduction: If the lungs constantly convert air into oxygen, the oxygen concentration in the bloodstream could reach extreme levels. While oxygen is vital for our cells to function, having too much oxygen in the blood could cause oxygen toxicity and lead to various complications, such as cell damage, respiratory problems, and even seizures. 3. Disrupted gas exchange: In the perturbation hypothesis, it is unclear how carbon dioxide would be removed from the bloodstream if air is being directly converted into oxygen within the lungs. The normal process of gas exchange in the alveoli could be disrupted in this scenario, which might lead to an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the body. This could result in respiratory acidosis, a condition where blood pH drops due to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. 4. Energy expenditure: The continuous expansion of lungs to create more oxygen may also require an increase in the body's energy expenditure. This could impact the body's overall energy balance and may lead to a variety of effects on other physiological systems, such as an increased demand for nutrients and a need to allocate more resources for lung functioning and maintenance. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation, wherein air is converted into oxygen within the lungs, could have several direct and indirect effects on the respiratory process. The continuous expansion of the lungs to create more oxygen may result in increased lung volume and pressure on neighboring organs, disrupted gas exchange, oxygen overproduction, and an escalation in energy expenditure. Such physiological changes could significantly impact the body's normal functioning, leading to various complications and health conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Ca'daan took a deep breath.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Ca'daan was short on breath.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"Ca'daan took a deep breath,\\" it is not possible to determine with certainty whether the hypothesis \\"Ca'daan was short on breath\\" is true. Various scenarios could lead to Ca'daan taking a deep breath, and not all of them necessarily involve being short of breath. To provide a comprehensive analysis, let's explore different situations in which Ca'daan might take a deep breath. 1. Ca'daan might be short on breath: In this case, the hypothesis would be true. Ca'daan could have been doing some physical activity or been in a tense situation, leading to shallow and rapid breathing. In a situation like this, taking a deep breath is a natural response to replenish the body's oxygen levels. 2. Ca'daan might be trying to calm down: The premise could also suggest that Ca'daan is taking a deep breath to calm down or gather their thoughts in a moment of stress, anxiety, or impatience. In this case, the hypothesis would be false as taking a deep breath is a practiced technique to help reduce stress levels and regulate emotions. 3. Ca'daan might be preparing for an action: Ca'daan might take a deep breath to prepare for some activity or event that requires them to hold their breath momentarily, such as diving underwater or playing a wind instrument. Here, the hypothesis would be false because Ca'daan is not short on breath; instead, they are consciously taking a deep breath in anticipation of an action. 4. Ca'daan might be practicing mindfulness or meditation: Deep breaths are commonly associated with mindfulness exercises or meditation practices. In this scenario, taking a deep breath would be part of the practice and not an indication that Ca'daan is short of breath. The hypothesis would be false in this case. 5. Ca'daan might be reacting to a strong smell: Another reason to take a deep breath could be that Ca'daan is experiencing a strong or pleasant smell. In this case, the hypothesis would be false because Ca'daan is not short on breath; they are merely reacting to their environment. Overall, as can be seen from these different scenarios, it is not possible to conclude whether the hypothesis \\"Ca'daan was short on breath\\" is true based solely on the premise \\"Ca'daan took a deep breath.\\" Additional context or information about the situation would be necessary to draw a definite conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is normally played in early December. - The University of Oxford (informally Oxford University or simply Oxford) is a collegiate research university located in Oxford, England, United Kingdom. While having no known date of foundation, there is evidence of teaching as far back as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled northeast to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two \\"ancient universities\\" are frequently jointly referred to as \\"Oxbridge\\". - The University of Paris, metonymically known as the Sorbonne (its historical house), was a university in Paris, France.

Other rugby union games played at the stadium include the Middlesex Sevens, the Aviva Premiership final, the LV Cup, the Varsity Match between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and European Rugby Champions Cup matches. The RFU headquarters are based in the stadium. - A try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football. A try is scored by grounding the ball (the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground) in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining 'grounding the ball' and the 'in-goal' area. - Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line. - Oxbridge is a portmanteau (blend word) of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The term is used to refer to them collectively in contrast to other British universities and more broadly to describe characteristics reminiscent of them, often with implications of superior social or intellectual status. - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.

We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.

When a person consumes alcohol, it affects their central nervous system, causing disorientation as well as impairing cognitive and motor functions. Drinking alcohol can lead to the following effects that contribute to car crashes: 1. Slowed reaction time: Alcohol slows down a person's reaction time, making it more challenging to respond quickly to potential hazards on the road. 2. Impaired judgment: Alcohol impairs a person's ability to make sensible decisions which can result in risky behavior, such as speeding, tailgating, or not using seatbelts. 3. Decreased coordination: Alcohol can affect a person's coordination, which is essential for proper control of the vehicle. 4. Blurry or double vision: Alcohol can impair a person's vision, making it difficult to see and judge distances accurately. 5. Drowsiness or passing out: Alcohol consumption can make a person drowsy, increasing the risk of falling asleep at the wheel or experiencing a momentary lapse of attention, leading to a crash. While having sex, snapchatting, sickness, and throwing up can also contribute to car crashes in certain situations, disorientation is the most relevant choice as it directly relates to the impairments caused by alcohol consumption. Alcohol-induced disorientation can have various negative consequences on driving ability, making it more likely for a person to be involved in a car accident."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eating a well-rounded diet means eating different kinds of foods to make sure you get all the nutrients your body needs to grow strong and stay healthy. One day, Joel and William decided to visit the magical land of Nutritionville. In this land, the food was bright, colorful, and made sure everyone had the right energy to play and have fun. The clouds in the sky were made of fluffy cotton candy, and the flowers were made of crunchy vegetables that grew bigger every time it rained. In Nutritionville, Joel liked to spend his time at the fruit playground, playing on the slides that were made of big banana peels and swinging on the apple swings. It was important for him to get vitamins and minerals from the fruits to help keep his eyes shiny and his skin glowing. William, on the other hand, preferred hanging out at the Candy Castle, where everything was made of sweet treats like chocolate and gummy bears. Although yummy, too many sweets are not very good for your body; they can make your teeth hurt and your tummy ache. Soon, Joel noticed that William was starting to feel tired and sluggish from all the candy. Joel knew that he had to help his friend understand the importance of a well-rounded diet. So he took William to the magical balanced meal buffet, where they found plates full of colorful fruits, tasty vegetables, crunchy grains, and yummy proteins like chicken and fish. As they ate, Joel explained to William that having a mix of these healthy foods would help them both stay strong, feel good, and have more energy for playing and exploring. After trying a little bit of everything, William started feeling much better, and he agreed that a well-rounded diet was important. From that day on, William and Joel made sure to eat a variety of foods in Nutritionville. They enjoyed balanced meals together and continued having fun adventures, knowing that their well-rounded diets were helping them grow strong and healthy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what can infect and destroy helper T cells?\\" is \\"cooking\\", given that viruses can infect and destroy helper T cells? The answer is:","completion":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what can infect and destroy helper T cells?\\" is not \\"cooking.\\" The correct answer in this context is \\"viruses,\\" specifically the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Helper T cells, also known as CD4+ T cells, play a crucial role in the human immune system. They are a type of white blood cell that helps coordinate the overall immune response. Their main function is to identify pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, and to stimulate other immune cells, such as cytotoxic T cells and B cells, to attack these pathogens. Viruses, in general, can potentially infect any cell within a host, depending on the specific virus and its affinity for a particular type of cell. HIV, a type of lentivirus, targets and infects helper T cells. HIV does this by binding to specific receptors, such as the CD4 receptor, found on the surface of helper T cells. Once the virus gains entry into the helper T cell, it integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, effectively hijacking the cell's machinery to produce more copies of the virus. Eventually, the infected helper T cell is destroyed as new virus particles are continually produced, leading to a decline in the number of functional helper T cells in the body. The destruction of helper T cells by HIV weakens the immune system by interfering with its ability to coordinate an effective immune response. This can lead to the development of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which is characterized by a severely compromised immune system, making the individual vulnerable to opportunistic infections and certain types of cancer. In contrast, \\"cooking\\" refers to the process of preparing food using various techniques, such as heating, baking, frying, or boiling, which can potentially kill some microorganisms that might be present in raw food. However, cooking has no direct effect on helper T cells or their susceptibility to infection by viruses like HIV.

An angry supporter of the 'Bersih' (Clean) electoral reform coalition reacts as he recovers after police fired tear gas during clashes in downtown Kuala Lumpur July 9, 2011. KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian police fired repeated rounds of tear gas and detained over 1,400 people in the capital on Saturday as thousands of activists evaded roadblocks and barbed wire to hold a street protest against Prime Minister Najib Razak's government. At least a dozen people were hurt in the demonstration for electoral reform in downtown Kuala Lumpur. There were no reports of serious injuries but some analysts said the police action was excessive and would dent Najib's image. \\"We are not criminals, we are just asking for free and fair elections,\\" opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's daughter, Nurul Izzah Anwar, told reporters after her father was knocked down and hurt in a melee when he and his supporters were tear gassed. \\"Many innocent people were injured. We condemn this act of cruelty by UMNO and Barisan Nasional,\\" she said, referring to Najib's party and the ruling coalition. Street protests are rare in this Southeast Asian nation, but foreign investors are worried that any groundswell of anti-government sentiment could delay economic reforms seen as essential to draw investment. If he is put under popular pressure, Najib may reconsider plans for a snap election and hold back on reforms such as cutting fuel subsidies or unwinding an affirmative action program for the country's Malay majority. Polls are not due until 2013 but analysts have said Najib could seek an early mandate after economic growth accelerated to a 10-year high in 2010. \\"From Najib's perspective, holding elections anytime soon would be a mistake because of the damage that has been done today,\\" said Bridget Welsh, Malaysia specialist at Singapore Management University. \\"The fact that such a large crowd turned up despite a crackdown shows that voter anger is deep and this is going to push a lot of people who are in the middle toward the opposition.\\" Reuters witnesses saw tear gas shells lobbed repeatedly at groups of protesters in downtown Kuala Lumpur as the crowds chanted \\"Long Live the People\\" and \\"Reformasi, reformasi,\\" the Malay word for reform. Several people were seen bleeding after the tear gas was fired, but police gave no details of any injuries. Crowds around the city's main bus station were also sprayed with water cannon. Malaysia's inspector-general of police, Ismail Omar, said 1,401 people were taken into custody, but many will be released after questioning. At least three senior opposition leaders were among those detained, other officials said. \\"We have made our point that we want free and fair elections,\\" said Chan Mei Yin, a 32-year old accountant who joined the protest. \\"The police are just showing that they are brutal to Malaysians. I will not vote for this government.\\" NOT THAILAND While Malaysia is far from being divided by political strife like its northern neighbor Thailand, the opposition has been steadily growing more vocal. Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets at a November 2007 rally, which analysts said galvanized support for the opposition ahead of record gains in a 2008 general election. Analysts said the turnout of protesters on Saturday was more than 10,000, around the same as in 2007. Police, however, put the number at 5,000-6,000, while protest organizers claimed 50,000 attended. \\"Malaysian civil society is showing the government that intimidation will not work,\\" said Ooi Kee Beng, a political analyst at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies of Singapore. \\"We're seeing a lack of will on the part of the government to try to negotiate and to defuse the situation. It's all going to look very bad outside Malaysia.\\" After Malaysia's constitutional monarch tried to defuse the situation, the government initially offered Bersih (Clean), the group that called the protest, the use of a stadium to hold its demonstration. But it baulked at allowing the group to use the main stadium in downtown Kuala Lumpur, at which point Bersih said it would defy the ban. From midnight, police locked down the central shopping district of the city of 1.6 million people, setting up roadblocks and barring taxis and buses from the area. Suburban trains, however, continued to operate and other areas of the city were not affected. Bersih has vowed to bring together tens of thousands of supporters to the protest but it fell short. Still, some analysts said the government faced a problem. \\"Just looking at the crowd there were many 'first timers', young people from the Facebook generation who just wanted to have a peaceful life,\\" said Ibrahim Suffian, director of the independent opinion polling outfit Merdeka Center. \\"This is trouble for Najib as it will polarize traditionally non-political segments of society like the young even further away from him.\\" Najib took power in 2009, and inherited a divided ruling coalition which had been weakened by historic losses in the 2008 polls. He has promised to restructure government and economy and introduced an inclusive brand of politics aimed at uniting the country's different races. Najib's approval ratings have risen from 45 percent to 69 percent in February, according to independent polling outfit Merdeka Center. But analysts said recent ethnic and religious differences have undermined his popularity.

(Associated Press) At least 20,000 Malaysians defied government warnings by marching for electoral reforms Saturday, as police fired tear gas and detained more than 1,600 in the country's biggest political rally in four years. The crackdown on the opposition-backed demonstration in Malaysia's main city, Kuala Lumpur, triggered criticism that Prime Minister Najib Razak's long-ruling coalition was unwilling to allow public dissent or make election laws fairer ahead of national polls widely expected by mid-2012. Najib's administration declared the rally illegal and warned people repeatedly over the past month to avoid it. Officials insisted it was simply an opposition scheme to spark chaos and stir anti-government sentiment, while activists accused authorities of being afraid of a protest that could undermine their authority. Authorities blocked roads, shut rail stations and deployed trucks with water cannons near the Independence Stadium in downtown Kuala Lumpur where activists sought to gather. More than 200 activists had been arrested over the past two weeks for promoting the rally. The large number of demonstrators who showed up despite the threat of arrests and the disruptions in transport links bolstered claims by activists that the government had misjudged public opinion by not allowing what they insisted would have been a peaceful rally. The crackdown \\"stirred a sense of outrage against the exhibition of raw power by our government,\\" said Ambiga Sreenavasan, head of the Bersih coalition of civic groups that organized the rally. \\"What is the necessity for a show of might against right? No matter what, right will always prevail,\\" she said. Police said in a statement that they detained 1,667 people Saturday in a clampdown called \\"Operation Erase Bersih.\\" Those arrested included several senior opposition officials. Some were released after several hours, with police indicating that most would not be held overnight. Thousands tried to reach the stadium from various parts of Kuala Lumpur, chanting \\"Long live the people\\" and carrying yellow balloons and flowers as they marched. Police fired numerous rounds of tear gas and chemical-laced water in repeated attempts to disperse the crowds, causing demonstrators to scatter into nearby buildings and alleys before they regrouped. Police helicopters flew overhead as a brief downpour failed to deter the protesters. Witnesses said riot police armed with batons charged at some protesters and dragged them into trucks. Some were seen bleeding, but police could not confirm any injuries. Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's top opposition figure, was being treated at a hospital for a \\"minor injury\\" he said he received when his group was hit by tear gas. The Malaysiakini news website said he had a knee injury. \\"We were attacked from both corners but what was horrifying is that the police shot directly at the protesters, some of them clearly aimed at me personally, so my security assistants had to cover me and one was badly injured because the canister was shot direct, he is badly injured,\\" Anwar told Associated Press Television News. \\"This is a simple portrayal of the extent of desperation of brutal action approved by the Prime Minister Najib.\\" The demonstrators dispersed after a five-hour standoff with police. Only several hundred reached the stadium. Prime Minister Najib insisted Saturday the protesters only represent a minority, and that most Malaysians support his administration. \\"If there are people who want to hold the illegal rally, there are even more who are against their plan,\\" the prime minister was quoted as saying by the national news agency, Bernama. Organizers said 50,000 took part in the rally, but police claimed there were only up to 6,000. Other observers and participants said the total was between 20,000 and 30,000, noting that it was highly unlikely that police could have arrested a quarter of the demonstrators. An accurate count was impossible because they were scattered in various areas. The rally has galvanized the opposition and has been credited for a surge in political awareness among the public in recent weeks. Opposition leaders accuse Najib's National Front coalition of relying on fraud to preserve its 54-year grip on power, which has been eroded in recent years amid mounting complaints about corruption and racial discrimination. The government insists the current electoral policies are evenhanded. The activists' demands include an overhaul of voter registration lists, tougher measures to curb fraud and fairer opportunities for opposition politicians to campaign in government-linked media. The National Front's mandate expires in mid-2013 but many analysts expect elections to be called by next year. Supporters of the Bersih coalition were also planning solidarity marches over the weekend in foreign cities, including in Australia, Britain, France, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and the United States. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the U.S. has been communicating to Malaysia the importance of respecting human rights, including freedom of expression and assembly. \\"We consider it incumbent on all sides to refrain from violence,\\" she told a news conference Friday. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","completion":"On July 9, 2011, Malaysian police fired multiple rounds of tear gas and detained over 1,400 people amid a large-scale street demonstration against Prime Minister Najib Razak's government.

Authorities' response deemed 'excessive' by some has hurt Najib's image. Street protests are uncommon in Malaysia, but any significant anti-government sentiment could potentially impact economic reforms crucial for investment. Given the demonstration, Najib may reconsider his reform plans and possible early elections. The protestors' defiance against governmental intimidation signifies public outrage and could look negative for the Malaysian government internationally. Many of the demonstrators were young first-time protesters, which could signify growing unrest among traditionally non-political demographics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(a). no; (b). yes;","completion":"(b). Yes, both questions are essentially asking how to calculate steel quantity in different structural elements of a building such as footings, beams, columns, and slabs. They are both related to the calculation of steel reinforcement for these elements using given dimensions. To answer these questions, I will explain how to calculate steel quantity for each of these elements in construction. 1. Footings: To calculate steel quantity in footings, first, determine the type of footing being used, for example, isolated, combined or strip footing. Calculate the required reinforcement area using the given dimensions, including the width, depth, and length of the footing. Once the area is determined, use the following formula: Steel Quantity = (Reinforcement Area x Length of Footing) / Weight of Steel per Unit Length 2. Beams: For a beam, you need to determine the size of the beam, which includes width (b), depth (d), and length (L). Then, for reinforcement, determine the number and size of rebars required. Calculating the steel quantity can be done using the following formula: Steel Quantity = (Total number of rebars x Length of Beam x Weight of Rebar per Unit Length) / Weight of Steel per Unit Length 3. Columns: To calculate steel quantity in columns, you have to start by determining the dimensions such as the height, width, and length of the column. Also, calculate the number and size of rebars needed for proper reinforcement. Use the following formula: Steel Quantity = (Total number of rebars x Length of Column x Weight of Rebar per Unit Length) / Weight of Steel per Unit Length 4. Slabs: For slabs, start by determining their dimensions, thickness and reinforcement requirements by using the given slab dimensions. Based on the required reinforcement, calculate the area of reinforcement. Use the following formula to calculate steel quantity: Steel Quantity = (Reinforcement Area x Length of Slab) / Weight of Steel per Unit Length. It is important to note that the weight of steel per unit length depends on the type and size of the steel bars used. Usually, steel reinforcement bars (rebars) come in different diameters (mm) and weights (kg/m). So, you should know the size and weight of the rebars being used to calculate the accurate steel quantity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Is the volcanic crust on Sarahn or Timon hotter? Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now. Hint: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. Answer:","completion":"The volcanic crust on Sarahn is hotter. This conclusion is based on the information given in the paragraph that Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift with many continents breaking apart and moving. According to the given hint, during periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. This young volcanic crust is relatively hotter than old oceanic crust. On the other hand, Timon has been a stable planet with no such continental movements, thus implying it has older, cooler volcanic crust."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

India added an Alphabet Inc. subsidiary as a customer this year, heightening its profile just as the global launch market surges because of the demand for constant internet connectivity and monitoring of the earth by commercial, scientific and military entities.

Kiran Kumar, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, said at its Bengaluru headquarters. “Why are people coming to us? Because they are looking for the most cost-effective, short turnaround-time launches.” India competes for commercial launches with space agencies in Europe and Japan, and with private players such as Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin LLC. The nation has launched 37 satellites this year, almost double last year’s total, with more planned, according to Kumar’s organization. Most trips departing from India use the workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, or PSLV, which can take a microsatellite into space for about 30 million, according to U.K.-based researcher Seradata Ltd. The tab is split if multiple satellites are hauled. That’s about half the price charged by SpaceX for rides on its Falcon 9 rockets, though the Hawthorne, California-based company says its payloads are bigger. It’s also cheaper than the prices charged by the U.S. for its Minotaur rocket and Arianespace SA for its Vega, according to Seradata.

Its last failure was in the 1990s. “It has reached the ‘Nirvana’ stage in a modern launch vehicle’s experience,” Todd said. “It has settled into having a long series of perfect flights with no failures.” The agreement with Google-owned Terra Bella, a satellite imagery company, took seven years to negotiate, said Susmita Mohanty, co-founder and chief executive officer of Bengaluru-based Earth2Orbit, which brokered the deal. That’s because the U.S. in 2005 started discouraging domestic companies from hiring the Indian Space Research Organisation and its affiliate, Antrix Corp., for commercial launches after the Indian government wouldn’t sign a pact setting quotas and minimum prices. As India held out, the market came around. The burgeoning need among phone companies, electronics makers and broadcasters for rockets prompted the U.S. government to issue waivers on an individual basis. Global satellite industry revenue -- including services, manufacturing and launching -- almost doubled to 208 billion in the decade through 2015, according to the Washington-based Satellite Industry Association. Terra Bella uses images taken from space to analyze port traffic, help disaster-response teams, and track changes in mining pits, according to its website. India’s space agency launched its 110-kilogram (243-pound) SkySat microsatellite in June -- one of 20 atop a single rocket. ISRO plans to launch more than 80 at once -- the most ever -- early next year. Terra Bella wouldn’t comment except to refer to a blog post showing one of its first images: Chicago’s Soldier Field.

Source: ISRO “Our launch agreement was pioneering,” said Mohanty, whose father was a space scientist in India during the 1970s. “We have opened the door and left it ajar for other satellite makers to access India’s frequent and affordable launches.” The nation’s most famous liftoff occurred in 2013, when a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle carried the Mars Orbiter Spacecraft from Sriharikota. The craft, called Mangalyaan in Sanskrit, made India the fourth nation to reach the fourth planet from the sun. Mangalyaan’s objectives include looking for methane and carbon dioxide in Mars’ atmosphere to determine whether life ever existed on our neighboring planet. It cost about 74 million, or about 11 percent of the price tag for NASA’s Maven probe. By comparison, 20th Century Fox spent an estimated 108 million making “The Martian,” according to Box Office Mojo.

Rakesh Sharma spent almost eight days aboard the orbiting Salyut 7 station conducting experiments. Cost efficiency is imperative in a country where about 21 percent of its population lived on less than 1.90 a day in 2011, according to the World Bank. That poverty makes relevancy even more significant, Kumar said. “In most other places, generally, the space program started as a strategic or a military program,” said Kumar, who joined the space organization in 1975 and took over last year after working on the Mars orbiter. “In our program, right from the beginning, what has been looked at is how this space technology can be used for societal benefits.” An image of a regional dust storm over the northern hemisphere of Mars taken by the Mars Colour Camera (MCC) on board India’s Mars Orbiter Spacecraft. Source: ISRO The Mars mission kick-started efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to use the space program to lift the standard of living. India operates about 35 satellites for broadcasting, navigation, scientific research and weather monitoring, and Kumar said the nation needs to double that. One key area is disaster management since 60 percent of the land mass is prone to earthquakes and about 70 percent of its cultivable area is susceptible to drought. The nation also suffers devastating tropical cyclones. India plans to launch a satellite to look for potential risks and then provide information for mitigation, response and recovery, Modi said. The machine will scan all of South Asia. “India is ready to make its space capabilities available to any country for purposes of disaster risk management,” Modi told a Nov. 3 conference in New Delhi. The government also is putting a mining surveillance system in space, hoping to curb illegal digging through remote sensing detection technology. Currently, the nation depends on eyewitness accounts. But the Indian Space Research Organisation’s 1.09 billion budget is also about boosting the space industry. India currently is building its own competitor to the U.S.-run Global Positioning System. *Estimated Chinese space spending for 2015 Source: NASA, JAXA, ISRO, The Space Report 2016 *Estimated Chinese space spending for 2015 Source: NASA, JAXA, ISRO, The Space Report 2016 *Estimated Chinese space spending for 2015 Source: NASA, JAXA, ISRO, The Space Report 2016 *Estimated Chinese space spending for 2015 Source: NASA, JAXA, ISRO, The Space Report 2016 The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System consists of seven satellites and provides coverage for users in India and within 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) of its borders.

Question: How are Barbara and Johnnie related? Movie plot title: Night of the Living Dead Movie plot: Siblings Barbara and Johnnie visit their mother's grave in a remote Pennsylvania cemetery. During their visit, Barbara is attacked by a zombie. Her brother comes to her defense but is killed. Barbara flees the cemetery and discovers what at first seems to be an abandoned farmhouse. She seeks shelter there, only to find another pack of zombies. Shortly after, a man named Ben arrives, and the two clear the house of the dead and begin the process of barricading the doors and windows. They discover other survivors who have been hiding in the cellar of the house: Harry Cooper, a loud and argumentative husband; his wife Helen; their daughter Sarah, who was bitten by a zombie and has fallen seriously ill; teenager Tom Bitner and his girlfriend Judy Rose Larson. The group is divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a \\"death trap\\" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that the group should simply leave the house on foot after she notices the zombies' limited mobility. An argument between Ben and Harry leaves the Coopers in the basement to tend to their ailing daughter, and the remaining members remain upstairs to continue their work reinforcing the doors and windows. The loud construction attracts even more zombies to the farmhouse, soon collecting a large mob. The group devises a plan to escape using Ben's truck, which is out of fuel, by refueling at a locked gas pump a couple hundred yards away. A search of the corpse who lived in the farmhouse produces an unknown set of keys. Judy Rose, Tom, and Ben proceed up the hill toward the gas pump, but their plan begins to unravel when Ben falls from the bed of the truck and is left to defend himself.

People visiting the area always stop in Berg village and feel great, but they feel bad and winded once they get to Steep village. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village has a lower oxygen content in the air? Hint: Regions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7] At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8] The answer is:","completion":"Steep village has a lower oxygen content in the air. The two villages, Berg and Steep, are situated at different altitudes, with Berg village at 3000 ft and Steep village at 8500 ft. As mentioned in the hint, high altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level. Steep village, which is located at 8500 ft, falls into this category of high altitude. At high altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower than at sea level due to the competing effects of gravity and the heat content of the air. Gravity pulls the air closer to the ground, while the heat content causes air molecules to bounce off each other and expand. As a result, the air becomes thinner and contains less oxygen at high altitudes compared to lower altitudes. Since Steep village is located at a higher altitude than Berg village (8500 ft compared to 3000 ft), the atmospheric pressure is lower in Steep village. This lower pressure results in less available oxygen in the air. Therefore, Steep village has a lower oxygen content in the air compared to Berg village. This is why people visiting the area feel great in Berg village, but feel winded and unwell once they reach Steep village, as their bodies are adjusting to the lower oxygen content in the air at the higher altitude."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1947, Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged European professor of French literature, travels to the United States to take a teaching position in New Hampshire. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze, largely because he is romantically attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \\"Lo\\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \\"nymphets\\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and gets married to Charlotte only just to be near her daughter. Charlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed. Her death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \\"Lolita\\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending an all-girls Catholic school. However, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty, who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name. Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography.

I read this background article the other day: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] I am facing a new situation today: Dan decided to preserve some fruit and roots to see how long they last before they spoil. He also bought other fruit that he plans to eat fresh. He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fruit have a lower sugar content candied plums or fresh oranges? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article, candied fruits are made through a preservation process that involves soaking them in heated sugar syrup for an extended period of time. This process causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, resulting in a higher sugar content. Fresh fruits, on the other hand, do not undergo this preservation process and retain their natural sugar content. Considering the new situation where Dan has candied plums and fresh oranges, it is logical to deduce that the fresh oranges have a lower sugar content compared to the candied plums. This is because the candied plums have undergone the sugar preservation process mentioned in the background article, whereas the fresh oranges have not experienced any such sugary treatment and retain their natural sugar levels. It is important to note that while fresh fruits generally have a lower sugar content compared to their candied counterparts, the actual sugar content in different types of fruits may vary.

He calls his house during a break, but Renee does not answer (several different phones at the house are seen to be ringing). Arriving home later, Fred sees Renee asleep in bed. Fred's expression shows his lingering doubts about Renee's faithfulness.The next morning, a mysterious package arrives on the front doorstep containing a videotape.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"a person doesnt have many ice trays\\" happens, how will it affect Less trays are filled to the appropriate level. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process. The process outlined by the user involves using an ice tray to make ice cubes. If a person doesn't have many ice trays, it affects the volume of ice that can be made at once. The number of trays influences the number of available slots for filling with water and subsequently creating ice cubes. The less the ice trays, the fewer the ice cubes that can be produced in one cycle. Consequently, for a person who needs a large volume of ice but has few trays, it means they would have to repeat the process multiple times, which could be time-consuming.

Please answer this question: Asked 'Can you see anything'? who replied 'Yes, wonderful things'?","completion":"The famous reply \\"Yes, wonderful things\\" was given by British archaeologist and Egyptologist Howard Carter when asked \\"Can you see anything?\\" by his patron and financial backer Lord Carnarvon. This significant moment in history happened on November 26, 1922, when Carter discovered the long-lost tomb of the Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamun, often referred to as King Tut, in the Valley of the Kings, Egypt. The discovery had a lasting impact on archaeology, Egyptology, and our understanding of ancient Egyptian history. In modern Western popular culture, ancient Egypt has long captivated the imagination, due in large part to the architectural marvels like the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx, as well as the mysterious culture and the complex religious pantheon. Therefore, when the entirely intact tomb of a young pharaoh was unearthed in the 1920s, it fueled a fascination with ancient Egypt, leading to a surge in interest called \\"Egyptomania.\\" Lord Carnarvon, an English nobleman with a passion for archaeology, had been financing Carter's expeditions in Egypt since 1907. Prior to the discovery of King Tut's tomb, Carter had worked for over 30 years in Egypt as an archaeologist, artist, and excavation overseer. His knowledge of archeology and attention to detail played a significant role in locating the tomb. Following the discovery, a meticulous process of excavating and documenting the tomb's contents took a decade to complete. Upon entering the tomb, Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon first discovered an antechamber filled with various artifacts, such as statues, pottery, and chariots. This was followed by the opening of the sealed door that led to the burial chamber, where the sarcophagus and the beautifully detailed golden death mask of Tutankhamun were found. The discovery not only provided a wealth of information about Egyptian burial practices and the era when Tutankhamun ruled (around 1332-1323 BC) but also offered valuable historical context on his reign and life, significantly enriching the understanding of ancient Egyptian history. Additionally, the discovery of the tomb raised public interest and increased tourism in Egypt, inspiring people to learn more about ancient Egypt and visit its monuments. It also influenced art, fashion, and design, leaving a lasting impact on various aspects of modern culture. While the allure of ancient Egypt extends far beyond the tomb of Tutankhamun, the famous exchange between Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon remains a symbol of human curiosity, persistence, and fascination for the unknown."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In architecture, what is the name for an ornamental vertical groove in a column?","completion":"In architecture, the term for an ornamental vertical groove in a column is called \\"fluting\\". Fluting refers to the shallow grooves or channels which run vertically along the length of the column, adding both visual appeal and structural integrity to the design. The use of fluting can be seen extensively throughout various architectural styles, particularly in classical architecture, including ancient Greek and Roman architecture. Fluting is commonly associated with three classical orders of architecture, namely the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, each of which has its own distinctive column style. The primary purpose of fluting in these classical orders is to create an aesthetically pleasing appearance while minimizing the weight of the column and enhancing its structural strength. In each of the three classical orders, fluting varies in terms of the number of grooves and their shape: 1. Doric Order: This is the earliest and simplest of the classical orders, typically featuring 20 flutes on a column. The flutes in Doric columns are straight, deep, and have a slightly concave shape with a sharp edge, called arris, separating the flutes. The shallow curves, also known as fillets, give a sense of depth and help guide the viewer's eye upward, enhancing the column's verticality. 2. Ionic Order: Columns in the Ionic order usually have 24 flutes. These flutes are more slender and less prominently separated compared to the Doric order. Additionally, the flutes in Ionic columns are not as deeply carved and have a rounded appearance, giving the column a more graceful and delicate look. 3. Corinthian Order: Corinthian columns, the most elaborate of the three orders, also feature 24 flutes similar to the Ionic order. However, these flutes tend to be even more slender and shallow, contributing to the refined and sophisticated appearance of Corinthian columns. The overall appearance of the fluted Corinthian column is focused on ornate decoration and intricate detailing. It is important to note that not all columns in classical architecture are fluted. Some variations of these orders, as well as other architectural styles, incorporate smooth columns or columns adorned with different patterns or relief work. However, fluting remains a hallmark of classical architecture and continues to be utilized in various architectural styles and forms today, maintaining its status as an important decorative and structural element in columns."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

From 2000 to 2012, consumption of cigars more than doubled in the United States, from slightly over 6.1 billion in 2000 to more than 13.7 billion in 2012. Cigar use is most common among young people. In the 2012 National Youth Tobacco Survey data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that 12.6% of high school students had smoked at least one cigar in the past 30 days. After cigarettes, cigars were the second most commonly used tobacco product in youths and the most commonly used tobacco product among African American high school students. From the CDC’s national Adult Tobacco Survey for 2009-2015, data suggest that prevalence among adults was highest among 18-24 years (15.9%) followed by 25-44 years old (7.2%). From the same survey, prevalence among men (10.4%) was significantly higher than women (3.1%) and likewise among LGBT (12.2%) and heterosexual (6.5%) respondents.

Through the fissure, a giant monster appears, and destroys portions of San Francisco. After many days and countless lives, the creature is defeated by human military forces.However, what seemed to be an isolated attack builds, as more creatures begin to come through the fissure, attacking coastal cities around the Pacific. The World unites to stop the invaders, and build The Jaeger Program: a series of giant mechanical 'monsters,' intended to stop the creatures.Original tests to have one pilot per Jaeger prove unsuccessful, as the test subjects were not able to handle the stress and strain of controlling such a huge robot by themselves. It was then decided that each Jaeger would be piloted by two pilots, their memories linked together in The Drift, synchronizing their movements to maneuver the massive machines.As the Jaegers go to work, they begin to turn the tides, and take down the creatures (known as Kaiju). Pretty soon, the world is enthralled by the Jaegers and their pilots. They become celebrities, and even have merchandise made.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less / smaller caverns happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER caverns. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If less or smaller caverns are formed due to the perturbation hypothesis, it will affect the formation and size of the caverns, potentially resulting in fewer or less extensive cave systems. This could be caused by factors such as reduced rainfall, lower concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, or changes in the soil composition that may limit the acidification process. The supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process. If there are fewer or smaller caverns as a result, it may imply that the processes leading to their formation, such as the dissolution of limestone by rainwater with carbon dioxide turned into acid, are not as effective or as frequent as in cases where larger or more extensive caverns are formed.

First of all, the 'epoch' is kind of like a special date or time for astronomers. An epoch helps them keep track of where different things in space are at certain times. So, when it says '2015-06-27', that means whatever they were observing or recording about 1000 Piazzia happened on June 27, 2015. Next, there's this 'formerName' part, which says \\"1967 ED\\". Just like sometimes people or pets might have an old name that they used to use before, same thing happens with objects in space as well. So 1000 Piazzia used to be called 1967 ED.

Build a movie plot around this: Who lectures Kiara about the danger posed by the outsiders? Simba","completion":"Step 1: Establish the Setting and Main Characters To build the movie plot, we first need to establish the setting and the main characters. In this case, the main setting is the animal kingdom in Africa, and the two main characters are Kiara (a young lioness and princess) and Simba (her father, the Lion King). Step 2: Introduce the Outsiders Next, we need to introduce the outsiders who pose a threat to the kingdom. These outsiders can be a group of renegade animals, led by a cunning and manipulative hyena named Zarkon, who wants to take over Simba's territory. Step 3: Develop Kiara's Curiosity As the plot progresses, Kiara is shown to be adventurous and curious about the world beyond the boundaries of her father's kingdom. Despite the warnings from her father and the other animals in the kingdom, she strays too close to the outsider territory, where she meets Lee, a young and charismatic member of the outsider group. Step 4: Develop Friendship and Conflict Kiara secretly develops a friendship with Lee, who shows her the world beyond her father's kingdom's borders, which seems wonderful and exciting. Her growing connection with Lee causes her to question her father's beliefs and rules about the outsiders, leading to a conflict between Kiara, Simba, and the rest of the kingdom. Step 5: Lecture on the Dangers of Outsiders As Kiara's relationship with Lee deepens, Simba discovers her secret friendship and confronts her. He lectures her about the danger posed by the outsiders, revealing the past incidents involving the kingdom and the outsiders that led to the loss of many lives. Simba's intense concern stems from the pain of losing his father to a similar situation caused by the actions of the hyena clan long time ago. Step 6: Proving Simba's Concerns Just as Kiara starts to see her father's point of view, Zarkon uses Lee to manipulate her and set a trap for Simba, planning to overthrow him and take control of the kingdom. Kiara will ultimately discover Lee's involvement and be heartbroken by his betrayal. Step 7: Climax and Resolution Kiara, filled with determination to right her wrongs, will work with her father, her friends, and the kingdom's animals to foil Zarkon's plans. During the battle, Lee returns to help Kiara and the kingdom, redeeming himself and proving his true loyalty. In the end, the kingdom is saved, and Simba realizes that not all outsiders are dangerous. Kiara learns important lessons about trust and the value of her father's wisdom, and the kingdom becomes a safer and more united place as they embrace the positive outsiders into their territory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

By Joel Christie Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger was joined by up to 70 close family and friends yesterday as he celebrated the life of his late partner L'Wren Scott. The family attended the famed Hollywood Forever Funeral Home, in Los Angeles, at about 12.30pm yesterday before moving on to a reception at Sunset Tower Hotel, where they were seen arriving in a black mini-van and a limousine. Traditional folk song Will The Circle Be Unbroken was sung by longtime Rolling Stones backing vocalist Bernard Fowler and three generations of Jaggers gave speeches at the fashion designer's funeral. However it was the memories that a devastated Mick Jagger shared with mourners of his late partner that was said to have provided the most poignant part of the service. Covered arrivals: The OPTIONS: - Bernard Fowler arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Bryan Adams arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Ellen Barkin arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Hollywood Forever Funeral Home arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Jagger arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Jaggers arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Joel Christie arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Keith Urban arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - L'Wren Scott arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Los Angeles arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Mick Jagger arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - New York arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Nicole Kidman arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Rolling Stones arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Sunset Tower Hotel arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral - Will The Circle Be Unbroken arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral","completion":"- Hollywood Forever Funeral Home arranged to have curtains blocking the view of the guests' arrivals on Tuesday ahead of the funeral The other options are incorrect because they are individuals or non-related entities that would not have the authority or responsibility to arrange such a thing.

Kyle took their flask to the concert, while Kenneth left his flask at home, because Select from: -Kyle wanted to stay sober.; -Kenneth wanted to stay sober.;","completion":"-Kenneth wanted to stay sober. Reflecting on the situation revealed an interesting contrast between Kyle and Kenneth and how they approached their enjoyment of the concert. Kenneth, a more conservative individual, had learned from a myriad of past experiences that feasting too heavily on liquor, particularly in such enthusiastic environments as a concert, could drastically affect his ability to entirely savor the music, the ambiance, and the overall event experience. He opted for a lucid mind to soak up and remember every vivid detail of the concert, every pulsating rhythm that vibrated the air around them, the luminescence of the stage lights painting a panorama of colors in the enveloping darkness, and ultimately the raw talent displayed by the musicians that commanded their admiration. Therefore, Kenneth, an epitome of prudence and tranquility, made the conscious decision to leave his flask at home, aiming to engage in the concert's festivities without the alluring veil of alcohol-induced euphoria clouding his judgment or hindering, to any extent, the pleasure he derived from the music itself. His appreciation for the symphony of sound that concerts provided went beyond the mere surface-level indulgence; he perceived these musical spectacles as a union of hearts resonating to the same beat. On the other hand, Kyle, making a drinking flask accompany him, approached the concert with a different perspective. His thrill lied more in the combination of the musical extravaganza with the exuberance that came with a slight intoxication, thus aiming for a distinctive kind of ecstasy. For Kyle, spiking up his senses with his favorite beverage from the flask somehow amplified the enjoyment, a practice that rendered the beats to touch his soul, letting him release his joy and excitement in a more uninhibited manner. While Kenneth originated his joy from purity, Kyle derived it from pleasure, infusing a slightly risky but amplified approach to enjoying his night at the concert. The difference in their choices spoke volumes about their personalities. Where Kenneth fit the mold of the sober, discerning, individual variety, passionate about harnessing every sensory detail woven into the fabric of the concert, Kyle served as an example to the risk-takers, the thrill-seekers who dared to venture into edging their experiences with a spike of something that heightened their senses. In a rich tapestry of life's experiences, this concert was yet another thread sewn in by Kyle and Kenneth, in their unique and characteristic styles, further spiced up by their decisions revolving around a simple flask."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To do that, we will add 571*i to both sides (that will cancel out the -571*i on the right side) and add 13956 + 10275 to the right side (that'll cancel out the numbers on the left side). When we do that, our equation will look like this: 196*i + 571*i = -1988 + 13956 + 10275 Now, let's add the numbers with \\"i\\" together on the left side: 767*i = -1988 + 13956 + 10275 Next, we will add the numbers on the right side: 767*i = -1988 + 13956 + 10275 = 8243 Now, we want to find what number \\"i\\" stands for. To do that, we're going to divide both sides by 767 (since 767*i means 767 multiplied by i).

What are the most important words in the following sentence: train coming out of a tunnel into station","completion":"The most important words in the sentence \\"train coming out of a tunnel into station\\" are: 1. Train: It is the primary subject of the sentence. The word \\"train\\" refers to the mode of transportation consisting of a series of connected cars that run on a track, usually carrying passengers or freight. In this sentence, the focus is on the movement and location of the train. 2. Tunnel: This word helps to describe the environment through which the train is traveling. A tunnel is an underground passage or enclosed space that allows transportation systems like trains, cars, or pedestrians to pass through obstacles such as mountains or beneath bodies of water. The mention of the tunnel helps us visualize the train emerging from a dark, enclosed space and approaching a destination. 3. Coming out: These words describe the action of the subject in the sentence – the \\"train.\\" The phrase \\"coming out\\" signifies the emergence of the train from the tunnel, highlighting its movement and implying that the train has successfully navigated through the tunnel. 4. Station: This word refers to the destination of the train and where this particular action is occurring. A train station is a location where trains stop to load or unload passengers and cargo, which often serves as a central hub for local transportation services. In the sentence, \\"station\\" specifies where the train is headed, providing context to the action and offering a sense of arrival or completion of the train's journey from the tunnel. By focusing on these essential words, the sentence portrays a specific and vivid scene: a train moving out of a tunnel and arriving at a station. Each of these words plays a crucial role in describing the situation and helps provide a clear understanding of the train's location and action."},{"prompt":"Q: Is this product review positive?

(CNN) -- Whether you're a domestic company or an international business, failure to comply with China's strict Internet regulations risks having your online presence curtailed or shut down completely. This means being subjected to the so-called \\"Great Firewall of China,\\" where websites, from newspaper portals to micro-blogging services, come under intense scrutiny from government censors who prohibit topics deemed unsuitable. \\"Bottom line is that there's a list of topics that domestic and international media based in China doesn't allow discussions on,\\" said Doug Young, journalism professor at Fudan University in Shanghai and author of \\"The Party Line: How The Media Dictates Public Opinion in Modern China.\\" OPTIONS: - CNN, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - China, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Chinese, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Doug Young, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Facebook, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Fudan University, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Google, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Great Firewall, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Hong Kong, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Modern China, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - Shanghai, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - The Media Dictates Public Opinion, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - The Party Line, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009. - YouTube, which is owned by Google, was also blocked in 2009.","completion":"The Great Firewall of China is a stringent Internet censorship system that monitors and restricts various websites and online platforms in the country. As Doug Young, a journalism professor at Fudan University in Shanghai and the author of \\"The Party Line: How The Media Dictates Public Opinion in Modern China,\\" points out, both domestic and international media companies must avoid discussing certain topics in China, or else they risk being blocked or shut down entirely. One of the most notable instances of this censorship occurred in 2009 when Google-owned platforms such as YouTube and even Google itself were blocked in mainland China. The decision to block YouTube was due to the presence of politically sensitive content, while Google's search engine was targeted after it encountered issues with the Chinese government over Internet censorship and a cyber attack that targeted the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. This incident highlights the challenges that international companies, including tech giants like Google, face while operating in China. It’s critical for businesses to adapt to China's strict regulations and ensure compliance in order to maintain their online presence. Non-compliance could lead to penalties, and ultimately, being blocked by the Great Firewall, which could severely impact their access to the vast and lucrative Chinese market. It's important to note that Google doesn't own several of the options listed, such as Facebook, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. Facebook is an independent entity, while Hong Kong and Shanghai are cities and not owned by any corporation. Navigating the Chinese Internet landscape is difficult for both domestic and international companies, as they have to strike a delicate balance between abiding by the Chinese government's demands and maintaining their freedom of expression. The consequences of non-compliance are severe, potentially derailing a business's chances of thriving in one of the world's most important economies. For this reason, it's crucial for companies to remain vigilant and adaptable when doing business in China, recognizing the role that the Great Firewall of China plays in controlling public opinion and shaping the online environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A). no. B). yes.","completion":"B). Yes. Both questions essentially ask the same thing - can a state of reality occur wherein an animal, specifically dogs, can communicate with humans in a linguistically comprehensible manner akin to human speech. Trying to dissect these questions in more detail, we find: The question \\"Will dogs one day be able to talk?\\" directly presents the notion of whether dogs can develop the capacity to 'talk' or, in more precise terms, utilize human language for communication. This directly goes into musings about the evolutionary potential of that specific species (canis lupus familiaris) and whether it could develop such complex cognitive abilities. On the other hand, \\"Will animals like dogs ever be able to talk?\\" broadens the scope initially by mentioning 'animals' in general, but then narrows down to a similar context by specifying 'like dogs'. So, we are still focusing on domestic animals similar to dogs in their potential to convey information through human language. Considering these interpretations, we can confidently denote that both questions touch on the same central theme, hence having the same meaning. However, it's worth pointing out, that the future possibility of animals communicating through human language is currently a speculative conjecture at best. It would require significant cognitive and physiological changes, seeing as the vocal apparatus and brain structures needed for verbal language are complex and specific. To date, dogs and other animals communicate with humans and each other using a blend of vocal sounds, body language, and other nonverbal cues. Certain intelligent animals like apes and parrots have been trained to use simple forms of sign language or mimic human speech, but this does not equate to a full understanding or utilization of human language. These behaviors are learned through rigorous training and do not represent a natural development of such abilities in these species. So, overall, while it's an interesting theory to ponder, the prospect of dogs or similar animals talking as humans do, using abstract concepts and organized grammar, based on our current knowledge and understanding of animal cognition and language capacity, remains in the realm of science fiction and fantasy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A stalactite is a mineral formation that hangs from the ceiling of limestone caves, and it is formed over long periods of time through the process of deposition. Deposition is a geological process wherein dissolved minerals are carried through groundwater and then deposited as solid material. In the case of stalactites, this process involves the gradual accumulation of minerals like calcite over thousands of years, which ultimately forms the beautiful and majestic structures we see in caves today. Given the choices provided, a stalactite is the only viable option that could develop through the consistent deposition of materials in a dark, cavernous area. Let's analyze the other options: (a). Apple juice: Apple juice cannot develop in a cave through the deposition process. It is a liquid produced by pressing apples, and it is not related to the geological or mineral processes that occur in cavernous areas. (c). Road rash: Road rash is a term used to describe an injury sustained from sliding across a hard surface, typically after falling off a moving vehicle like a bicycle or a motorcycle. This type of injury has no connection to the deposition process or the formation of stalactites in caves. (d). Blue jeans: Blue jeans are a type of clothing made from denim fabric. They are manufactured by humans and are unrelated to natural geological processes or the formation of stalactites in cavernous areas. In summary, if things are deposited consistently in dark, cavernous areas, a stalactite (option b) is the most plausible structure that could develop because it is formed by the deposition of minerals carried by groundwater, which is a common occurrence in caves. The other options are unrelated to the geological processes that occur in such environments and are therefore not reasonable answers to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963. When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra. By this time Imogen's performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst's brass band music, held outdoors at Framlingham Castle. A report of the event described an evening of \\"persistent drizzle ... until a diminutive figure in a special scarlet dress took the conductor's baton. The band was transformed, and played Holst's Suite as it has never been played before\\".Britten had been in poor health since undergoing heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died.

The number of white children being born in Washington D.C. has risen by 34 per cent, showing the capital is going through a baby boom. New figures released by the US Census Bureau suggested the number of infants and toddlers under the age of five has grown in the district by five per cent up to 39,000. The statistics also highlighted the number of children aged between five and 13 had risen by seven per cent, but teenagers older than 14 were declining. Baby boom: The number of white infants and toddlers being born in Washington D.C. has risen by 34 per cent. The rise among white infants and toddlers is being attributed to new parents in their 30s and early 40s. Demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution told the Washington Post a similar phenomenon is occurring in urban centres such as Manhattan, where young white professionals have settled and established lives before marriage and children. He said: 'They came for the bright lights of the city, and started dating and mating.' The drop in teenagers was blamed on families leaving the city before their sons or daughters started high school. The District’s baby boom is spiking not only in neighborhoods that have long attracted families, such as the suburban-like Upper Northwest or family-friendly Capitol Hill. Babies and toddlers are often seen on city streets near downtown neighborhoods such as Logan and Dupont circles. Places like Mount Pleasant and Columbia Heights are predominantly filled with young, single adults and have been responsible for most of the capital's growth over the past decade.","completion":"The capital city of the United States, Washington D.C., is experiencing a baby boom, with the number of white children born in the city rising by 34 percent.

She tells him they were in Winterton Flats for a picnic. Quatermass helps push the car back onto the road, when Chris bolts from the car. They wrestle him back into the car. Credits roll. (Note: The British Version is called Quatermass 2, while the American version of this movie was titled Enemy from Space.)At the Rocket project we see a building with a radar antenna mounted on the roof. Two operators are watching the screen. They notice scores of objects coming down slowly. They track the objects to one hundred miles north of their location. As they reset the equipment, Quatermass drives up. He notices the antenna setting and is very annoyed. He scolds Brand (William Franklyn) and Marsh (Bryan Forbes) for what he perceives as unauthorized use of the scanner.He tells Marsh and Brand that tomorrow none of them may have jobs. He gives Marsh the stone fragments and tells him to have them analyzed and classified. He apologizes to Brand and tells him that the moon project is to be cancelled. He outlines the project scope in front of a scale model--to build a colony on the moon.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: They did not stir as artillery shells passed high overhead to slam into Sarja, the village they had fled, even as each distant rumble told of an explosion that might have killed them had they remained at home. “There are eight families here,” said Jaber Zein Aldin, 72, who watched from the school door as red tracers arced through the night sky. “Forty people, escaping the shelling and the aircraft.” In northern Syria, the fighters seeking the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad have created zones in which they and local revolutionary councils are the interim governing force. They have organized basic services, including field hospitals, policing, courts and rubble cleanup. In at least one town, they publish a small newspaper. And here they move openly and prepare for the next fight. But even in this de facto safe area, the Syrian government retains a lethal reach. Unable to pursue the rebels on the ground through the farmland and mountains of Idlib and Aleppo Provinces, Mr. Assad’s forces drop bombs from aircraft and shell villages where rebels are active, endangering civilians. It has also cut off water from much of the countryside and switches electricity on and off, punishing some towns with longer blackouts than others depending on residents’ suspected sentiments. The two sides have entered a duet of attrition, turning life in the Idlib countryside into a wearying grind punctuated, in flashes and roars, by moments of spectacular and often indiscriminate violence. With cooler weather approaching, many crops at risk and fuel in short supply, Syrians assessing the prospects for the second winter since the uprising began say the outlook is grim. “We are afraid of the winter,” said Moyad, a pharmacist and a member of the governing revolutionary council in Kafr Takharim, a city of about 25,000 people. Moyad asked that his surname be withheld to protect his relatives from retaliation. “During these last months we have received fuel only twice, and we have not much flour for bread. This winter will be cruel.” On a strictly military level, the rebellion’s tactical successes have been undeniable. At the start of this year, they were all but in hiding, and government troops moved freely over the ground. Since then the rebels’ campaign of ambushes and roadside bombs has cleared swaths of territory and forced army and militia convoys to avoid most roads. Even the M5 highway, an asphalt ribbon linking many of Syria’s largest cities, has long stretches that are in rebel hands. The rebels’ flag flies over their own border crossings to Turkey, at Bab al-Hawa and at the Syrian side of Kilis, beckoning to areas of the country the rebels call free. Yet Syria’s military and the loyalist militias are far from defeated. They have concentrated forces in cities and retained part of the archipelago of outposts that they occupied in the countryside when the crackdown intensified last year. And they have unleashed an air campaign, dropping free-fall bombs or firing rockets onto rebel territory, an indiscriminate practice documented this month in field research by Amnesty International. Often the ordnance strikes homes. In Ablin — the hometown of Lt. Col. Hussein Harmoush, the first public defector from the Syrian Army — an airstrike destroyed the medical center. With no end to the violence near, Mr. Aldin and his family, sleeping in the classrooms of Ruweiha, have become a drop in a human tide. Some families have crowded into others’ homes, where women and children huddle, sometimes with wounded fighters, listening for the next blasts and wondering where to go. In Kafr Takharim, for instance, Moyad said families had taken in as many as 6,000 civilians displaced by the fighting in Aleppo, where a battle has raged since midsummer. Kawkab Darweesh, who has been displaced for months, said she and her family had been uprooted, forced to survive off the hospitality of friends. She was from the mountain town of Rama, where government troops remain. Both sides are expecting a battle for the town, she said, and she does not know if her home still stands. “We are afraid to go back,” she said. “We don’t know what happened there. They are destroying houses over the owners’ heads.” Other families have moved into the olive groves, where they camp in pump houses, small agricultural buildings or even in archaeological ruins. Many have fled over the nearest border, to Turkey. On one recent night, just short of the border near the Turkish city of Reyhanli, Syrian families mingled with smugglers in the fields, waiting for gaps between the Turkish border patrols and then dashing for the barbed wire and to life as refugees. More than 90,000 Syrians who have fled the fighting are registered in 13 temporary refugee camps along Turkey’s 550-mile-long border with Syria, according to figures released Friday by the Turkish government. Many more have crossed the border illegally and are not in the official tallies. One local Turkish official, who asked not to be named because of his diplomatic status, estimated that at least 60,000 Syrian refugees were living unregistered in Turkey. Aside from the camps, Turkey has set up a temporary shelter by the border gate in Kilis, where another 8,000 Syrians stay and receive daily supplies, the official said. “We see a surge in numbers on days of heavy shelling by the regime around Aleppo and Idlib, but try to contain daily entries around 500,” he said. “There are still thousands of people who have left their homes and live in the fields.” Many people here said they felt abandoned by the world. The rebels are short of weapons, the civilians short of safe shelter and the necessities of life. Jamal Marouf, a prominent rebel commander in the highlands of Jebel al-Zawiya, where much of the army has been driven away, said the rebels were trying to restore services that ended with the withdrawal of the government, but they lacked the means to be fully effective. “All of the institutions are not working any more,” he said.

It literally took me forever to get through it. I read the first 10 pages of this book, then set it down on my bookshelf. That was 3 years ago. I decided to finally finish reading the book this summer (2004). I haven't had to force myself to read a book like that in such a long time. She uses a lot of characters in this novel, so much so that she created a family tree in the inside cover just to keep the readers (and herself) from getting so confused. The story line itself is not as rich as her other plots. I'm a big fan of McMillan and have read all of her novels. However, this book just does not do her writing or story-telling skills any justice. She should have written a caveat emptor in her prologue that read \\"Buyer beware.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: The park had a refuse and littering problem, so they added another what? Possible A: tip, park officer, incinerator, dump, wastebasket Why is \\"wastebasket\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Wastebasket\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense primarily because it directly addresses the issue of refuse and littering in a manner that is both practical and commonly used in public spaces such as parks. In order to delve into the reasoning behind this choice, let's analyze each of the given options: 1. Tip: A tip usually refers to a landfill or waste disposal site. While it technically serves the purpose of waste management, it is not feasible to place a landfill within a park frequently visited by people. It would be counterproductive, unhygienic, and detrimental to the park's overall aesthetics, which in turn may discourage visitors. 2. Park officer: A park officer can help enforce the littering rules and regulations in the park. While this may lead to a decrease in the amount of refuse, it does not directly provide a means for disposing of waste. Visitors would still require a means to dispose of their waste, and park officers may not always be available or able to manage the littering problem across the entire park area. 3. Incinerator: Although incinerators play a role in waste management, they might not be the most appropriate choice for a park. Incinerators typically involve burning waste, which can cause air pollution and release toxic fumes. This would be hazardous to the health of park visitors and the environment. Additionally, building and operating an incinerator in a public park might not be feasible due to its size, cost, and regulatory requirements. 4. Dump: Similar to a tip, a dump refers to a location where waste is disposed of, often in an uncontrolled manner. Placing a dump within a park would be unsightly, unhygienic, and against the purpose of maintaining a clean and pleasant environment for park visitors. Like with the option of a tip, it does not align with human common sense when it comes to solving littering problems in parks. 5. Wastebasket: A wastebasket, or trash can, is a receptacle designed to hold and collect waste. Adding more wastebaskets in a park with a littering problem directly addresses the issue by providing designated areas for visitors to dispose of their waste. Wastebaskets are practical, commonly used solutions in public spaces that aim to maintain cleanliness and orderliness. They are also easily accessible to park visitors and encourage responsible waste disposal without compromising the park's appearance and atmosphere. Therefore, \\"wastebasket\\" is the answer that aligns with human common sense because it is a practical, efficient, and commonly used solution to address the littering problem in parks without causing any additional harm to the environment, visitors' health, or the park's aesthetic value."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Muhammad Ali (; born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.; January 17, 1942 - June 3, 2016) was an American professional boxer and activist. He is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century. From early in his career, Ali was known as an inspiring, controversial, and polarizing figure both inside and outside the ring. Cassius Clay was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, and began training as an amateur boxer when he was 12 years old. Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. () was born on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky. He had a sister and four brothers. He was named for his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. (1912-1990), who himself was named in honor of the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist, Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky. Clay's father's paternal grandparents were John Clay and Sallie Anne Clay; Clay's sister Eva claimed that Sallie was a native of Madagascar. He was a descendant of slaves of the antebellum South, and was predominantly of African descent, with smaller amounts of Irish and English heritage. His father painted billboards and signs, and his mother, Odessa O'Grady Clay (1917-1994), was a domestic helper. Although Cassius Sr. was a Methodist, he allowed Odessa to bring up both Cassius Jr. and his younger brother Rudolph \\"Rudy\\" Clay (later renamed Rahman Ali) as Baptists. Cassius Jr. attended Central High School in Louisville. Clay grew up amid racial segregation. His mother recalled one occasion when he was denied a drink of water at a store--\\"They wouldn't give him one because of his color. That really affected him.\\" He was also affected by the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, which led to young Clay and a friend's taking out their frustration by vandalizing a local railyard. Clay was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E. Martin, who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief's having taken his bicycle. He told the officer he was going to \\"whup\\" the thief. The officer told Clay he had better learn how to box first. Initially, Clay did not take up Martin's offer, but after seeing amateur boxers on a local television boxing program called Tomorrow's Champions, Clay was interested in the prospect of fighting. He then began to work with trainer Fred Stoner, whom he credits with giving him the \\"real training\\", eventually moulding \\"my style, my stamina and my system\\". For the last four years of Clay's amateur career he was trained by boxing cutman Chuck Bodak. Clay made his amateur boxing debut in 1954 against local amateur boxer Ronnie O'Keefe. He won by split decision. He went on to win six Kentucky Golden Gloves titles, two national Golden Gloves titles, an Amateur Athletic Union national title, and the Light Heavyweight gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Clay's amateur record was 100 wins with five losses. Ali said in his 1975 autobiography that shortly after his return from the Rome Olympics, he threw his gold medal into the Ohio River after he and a friend were refused service at a \\"whites-only\\" restaurant and fought with a white gang. The story was later disputed, and several of Ali's friends, including Bundini Brown and photographer Howard Bingham, denied it. Brown told Sports Illustrated writer Mark Kram, \\"Honkies sure bought into that one!\\" Thomas Hauser's biography of Ali stated that Ali was refused service at the diner but that he lost his medal a year after he won it.

They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010, when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy.

In the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, Satan is primarily an accuser and adversary, a decidedly malevolent entity, also called the devil, who possesses abhorrent qualities. Although Satan is generally viewed as having negative characteristics, some groups have very different beliefs. In Theistic Satanism, Satan is considered a deity who is either worshipped or revered. In LaVeyan Satanism, \\"Satan\\" is a symbol of virtuous characteristics and liberty. - Reign in Blood is the third studio album and the major-label debut by American thrash metal band Slayer.

Vishwasrao was born in Supe near Pune. 2. Vishwasrao is the eldest son of Balaji Baji Rao. 3. Supe was the Jagir of Shahaji by Pune. Sentence 2: 1. Balaji Baji Rao was born in Supe near Pune. 2. Balaji Baji Rao is the eldest son of Vishwasrao. 3. Supe was the Jagir of Shahaji in Pune. Now let's compare the information between the sentences. 1. The birthplace of Vishwasrao and Balaji Baji Rao is the same - Supe near Pune. This information is consistent between both sentences. 2. The parent-child relationship is reversed between the two sentences. Sentence 1 states that Vishwasrao is the eldest son of Balaji Baji Rao. Sentence 2 states that Balaji Baji Rao is the eldest son of Vishwasrao. This information contradicts each other in the two sentences. 3. The status of Supe as the Jagir of Shahaji is mentioned in both sentences, but slightly differently. Sentence 1 states it as \\"by Pune\\" while sentence 2 states it as \\"in Pune.\\" This is a minor difference but might convey slightly different meanings, depending on the context.

For Dafoe and his wife it must have been fun working together in a film for the first time, without taking into consideration that people might actually watch it. I felt like it was 90mins wasted as I waited anxiously for a plot to develop, or even begin. Try to fit this film into a genre and you won't, because it lacks a beginning, middle or ending. I've seen 'arty' movies before and this doesn't even come close to being arty, abstract or original, it just seems to me to be completely pointless. I think it speaks for itself when the only persons that rated this film a 10 were the under 18 age group. No doubt for the constant pointless erotic scenes that the film was insistent on throwing at us. That is if you can call it erotic. It certainly didn't have taste. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the film, stating that it feels more like a filming exercise rather than a film meant for public viewing. They mention that it must have been fun for the actors involved, but not for the audience who may watch it, as it was perceived as a waste of 90 minutes. The reviewer also criticizes the film's structure, explaining that it lacks a clear beginning, middle, or end and cannot fit into any specific genre. They argue that the film fails to achieve any sense of artistry or originality, making it seem entirely pointless. Additionally, the reviewer points out that the only audience who seemed to enjoy the film were the under-18 age group, likely due to the numerous and seemingly unnecessary erotic scenes. The reviewer does not find these scenes tasteful or appealing, further emphasizing their negative perception of the film. Ultimately, the sentiment of this review indicates a strong dissatisfaction with the film, arguing that it lacks substance, structure, and taste, ultimately deeming it a waste of time for viewers."},{"prompt":"Q:Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Question: How long did it take the author to fully recover from the surgical mishap?

Prof. Nick Pctfon warned that universities will face additional economic pressures as student numbers increase, which could force them to increase home students' fees. Student tuition is presently upped at #9,000 for British students. Speaking to the lines fligher Education, Prof. Petford, the vice-president of Northampton University,said that some universities with high brand value will be able to charge PS17,000, PS18,000 or PS20,000 in the future. \\"'I am sure of that. The president of the National Union of Students Toni Pearce said: \\"The suggestion that tuition fees should be charged at this level shows just how astonishingly out of touch some university vice-presidents can be.\\" Prof. Petford argued there will be a change in how universities view home students - suggesting they will be treated more like international students. \\"If you look at international students, that's been a market not well-governed since we've been recruiting (tix) overseas students. Universities have always been used to this sort of behaviour.\\" He said. \\"The big step change now is thinking about home students in this way.\\" Presently there is no cap on fees that universities can charge international students. The president of Universities UK, Christopher Snowden, said that his report showed universities needed more money to maintain their current standards. \\"The rise in tuition fees in England did not give all universities extra money - it replaced the cuts in direct government funding , \\" he said. Question: Winat can be inferred from Christopher Snowdon's words? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Tuition fees in England had been raised before.\\"? Answer:","completion":"From Christopher Snowdon's words, it can be inferred that the rise in tuition fees in England served as a replacement for the cuts in direct government funding, rather than providing universities with extra money. This suggests that the decision to increase tuition fees was made in response to financial pressures on universities stemming from decreased government support. As for the answer to the question \\"Tuition fees in England had been raised before\\" - the information provided in the passage indicates that yes, tuition fees have indeed been raised before, as they were increased to £9,000 for British students. Christopher Snowden's statement highlights the context for this increase, explaining that it served to offset the reduction in direct government funding that higher education institutions faced, rather than providing an overall financial gain for universities.

I know that the answer to the question \\"The Barbier reaction is used to produce what organometallic compound?\\" is in \\"There are many important organozinc compounds. Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions. Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester(ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR, the Reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters, the Simmons–Smith reaction in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane, the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds. The Barbier reaction (1899) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two. In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water. On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, are expensive and difficult to handle. Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc, diethylzinc and diphenylzinc. In one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors:\\".

The Barbier reaction is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction, with the major advantage being that it can even take place in water. The reaction involves a nucleophilic addition of an organozinc compound to a carbonyl compound. Like the Grignard reaction, the Barbier reaction results in the formation of an alkoxide ion, which can subsequently be protonated to produce the corresponding alcohol. In summary, the Barbier reaction is used to produce organozinc compounds, which can further react with carbonyl compounds to generate alkoxide ions and ultimately alcohols upon protonation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and revegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. Additionally, irrigation also has a few other uses in crop production, which include protecting plants against frost, suppressing weed growth in grain fields and preventing soil consolidation. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed or dry land farming. - New South Wales (abbreviated as NSW) is a state on the east coast of :Australia. It borders Queensland to the north, Victoria to the south, and South Australia to the west. It has a coast line with the Tasman Sea on its east side.

Plains occur as lowlands along the bottoms of valleys, coastal plains and as plateaus or uplands at high elevations. In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains or cliffs. Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a pass (sometime termed a gap). Plains may have been formed from flowing lava, deposited by water, ice, wind, or formed by erosion by these agents from hills and mountains. - The Riverina is an agricultural region of south-western New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The Riverina is distinguished from other Australian regions by the combination of flat plains, warm to hot climate and an ample supply of water for irrigation. This combination has allowed the Riverina to develop into one of the most productive and agriculturally diverse areas of Australia.

However, if we were to consider an indirect effect, a person experiencing a panic attack could potentially influence human activities that might impact the environment. For example, if their panic attack led to increased awareness about environmental issues and they decided to take action, such as advocating for the protection of natural habitats or reducing pollution, then this could have a ripple effect that might eventually result in better-preserved environments conducive to fossil formation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the next sentence. The teacher asked Ian but not Robert if they were going to organize their notebook because Options are: a). Ian was orderly.; b). Robert was orderly.;","completion":"The teacher asked Ian but not Robert if they were going to organize their notebook because Ian was orderly. This decision was based upon the teacher's observation of the students and their work habits throughout the course of their classes. In contrast to Robert, who always seemed to have his papers and assignments well-organized and easily accessible, Ian often struggled to find important documents and notes in his cluttered notebook. The teacher, noticing this distinct difference in organization skills, felt that it was necessary to address the issue with Ian instead of posing the question to both students. It was not that the teacher dismissed Robert's organization skills or did not value his efforts in keeping his notebook neatly arranged; rather, it was because the teacher recognized that Ian may need some additional guidance and encouragement in this area. This was an important aspect of learning for both students, as being able to maintain an organized notebook played a crucial role in helping them keep track of important information and concepts, ultimately making them more efficient and effective learners. In asking the question specifically to Ian, the teacher hoped to instill a sense of responsibility in him for the organization of his own learning materials. By bringing attention to this issue, the teacher aimed to motivate Ian to be more mindful of his notebook's contents and to be more proactive in maintaining a structured system for his coursework. This approach was intended to be a subtle yet powerful reminder for Ian, who may not have been fully aware of the consequences of his disorganization on his learning process. Additionally, by focusing on Ian's organization skills, the teacher subtly indicated to Robert that his efforts were recognized and appreciated. This affirmation could serve to reinforce his current habits, ensuring that he continued to prioritize keeping his learning materials in order. Furthermore, this situation might also serve as a learning opportunity for Robert, as he could potentially take note of the feedback given to Ian and apply it not just to his own organization skills, but also in offering support and mentorship to his classmates. Ultimately, the teacher's choice to ask Ian but not Robert if they were going to organize their notebook because Ian was orderly, showcased their attentiveness to each individual student's needs and strengths. By addressing what may have appeared to be a minor issue in notebook organization, the teacher was teaching valuable lessons on self-awareness, accountability, and the importance of effective study habits that played a significant role in the students' academic success and personal growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Capitalisation in English, in terms of the general orthographic rules independent of context (e.g. title vs. heading vs. text), is universally standardized for formal writing. (Informal communication, such as texting, instant messaging or a handwritten sticky note, may not bother, but that is because its users usually do not expect it to be formal.) In English, capital letters are used as the first letter of a sentence, a proper noun, or a proper adjective. There are a few pairs of words of different meanings whose only difference is capitalisation of the first letter. The names of the days of the week and the names of the months are also capitalised, as are the first-person pronoun \\"I\\" and the interjection \\"O\\" (although the latter is uncommon in modern usage, with \\"oh\\" being preferred). Other words normally start with a lower-case letter. There are, however, situations where further capitalisation may be used to give added emphasis, for example in headings and titles (see below).

In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

The Brown Eyed Girls (Hangul: beuraun aideu geolseu, Japanese: buraunaidogaruzu), often abbreviated as B.E.G., BG or beuageol (beu-ah-geol) is a South Korean girl group managed by Mystic Entertainment. The group consists of four members: JeA, Miryo, Narsha, and Gain. They debuted as an R&B/Ballad vocal group with \\"Come Closer (dagawaseo)\\" in 2006 and have since challenged themselves with a notable variety of different music genres. They rose to popularity in 2008 with \\"L.O.V.E\\" and their retro-dance number \\"How Come,\\" and cemented their position in the K-pop world in 2009 with \\"Abracadabra\\", with its electronica-based genre, pioneering (albeit controversial) concept, along with its iconic and now globally recognized dance entitled 'The Arrogant Dance (sigeonbangcum)'--successfully ingraining themselves into modern popular culture. The group's leader, Jea, was the one responsible of the group's creation and was actively involved in the selection of the other members, picking out Miryo, who was known as a great female rapper from the hip-hop community having previously worked with other fellow rappers, such as Gil Seong-joon from Leessang, and the main female rapper in well-known hip-hop group Honey Family. Narsha was chosen when Jea remembered her as a \\"talented singer\\" from her high school days, and Ga-in was selected by the three members after she was eliminated from \\"Battle Shin Hwa.\\" According to Ga-in, she was crying in the bathroom after failing the audition, was found by composer Ahn Jung Hoon, and then was chosen through the audition in Brown Eyed Girls' company. Singer Yoari trained with the group until 2006, when it was decided she would be the lead singer for Sprinkler. The four members held several small size concerts, and was actually known as \\"Crescendo\\" before officially debuting as \\"Brown Eyed Girls.\\" After more than 3 years of training in singing and holding several small size concerts, the Brown Eyed Girls released their debut album Your Story in South Korea on March 2, 2006, with the ballad track, \\"Come Closer\\" as their single. Debuting as a \\"faceless group\\" they did not appear on any visual media and chose to not even appear in their own music video. The album was well received by critics but did not do as well as expected commercially. The album was later re-released to include \\"Hold The Line\\" (which samples \\"Push The Button\\" by British girl band Sugababes and \\"Technologic\\" by Daft Punk). This song became a hit, further boosting the band's popularity. \\"Hold the Line\\" was disclosed across the world because it was included in the list of songs from the game Pump it Up. After a short break, the group went back into the studio to work on their second album Leave Ms. Kim (ddeonara miseugim), which included their R&B title track \\"You Got Me Fooled\\" (neoege sogassda). Subsequent singles were \\"Oasis\\" (oasiseu) featuring Lee Jae Hoon and \\"It's Mine\\" (naeggeoya), a collaboration with fellow group SeeYa. During the break between their debut and second albums, the Brown Eyed Girls released their first digital single entitled \\"I Am a Summer\\" (naega yeoreumida), which was later included in their second LP. The first two albums contained typical R&B ballads which had been very popular in the K-pop scene. However, the commercial success was relatively higher in two singles between the first and second albums. Moreover, the second album containing \\"You Got Me Fooled\\" (neoege sogassda) was released at nearly the same time as Wonder Girls' \\"Tell Me\\" which received a nationwide success in Korea.

Lyric Dogs, if she was not mistaken, was an alternative band known for their unique blend of heavy metal and poetic lyrics. It wasn't surprising that she wouldn't follow them closely, as their music could be quite unusual and not catered to everyone's taste. But the song she heard on the radio, with just the singer and one guitar, intrigued her as it seemed to deviate from the band's regular sound. The idea of an acoustic version of their songs could be a fascinating prospect. Stripping down the music to its core and focusing on the lyrics might offer a new perspective on their artistry and could potentially help her appreciate the band in a different light. The absence of heavy metal accompaniment could reveal previously unnoticed nuances in the melody and vocal delivery, making the listening experience fresh and engaging. If Lyric Dogs had indeed released an acoustic album, she should consider giving it a listen with an open mind. Sometimes, bands and artists explore various creative avenues to experiment with their sound, showcase their versatility, or express their emotions in a different way. This often leads to fresh and captivating renditions of familiar songs that could be enjoyable for both long-time fans and casual listeners. To get a hold of the acoustic album, she could start by doing some online research. She could follow the band on their official social media accounts and check major music streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, or Amazon Music. These platforms often provide extensive album collections and feature both popular and lesser-known releases from various artists. Moreover, she could try joining some fan forums or online communities dedicated to Lyric Dogs and similar music genres. Fans in these communities are usually very knowledgeable and willing to help others discover new music or find specific releases. Alternatively, she could visit local music stores or check online retailers such as Amazon or eBay for physical copies of the album. If the band had released a limited edition or a special collector's version of the acoustic album, she might be able to find unique designs, exclusive bonus tracks, or other exclusive extras that accompany these premium releases.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).

Hollywood is a neighborhood in the central region of Los Angeles, California. This ethnically diverse, densely populated neighborhood is notable as the home of the U.S. film industry, including several of its historic studios, and its name has come to be a shorthand reference for the industry and the people in it. Hollywood was a small community in 1870 and was incorporated as a municipality in 1903. It was consolidated with the city of Los Angeles in 1910, and soon thereafter a prominent film industry emerged, eventually becoming the most recognizable film industry in the world. In 1853, one adobe hut stood in Nopalera (Nopal field), named for the Mexican Nopal cactus indigenous to the area. By 1870, an agricultural community flourished. The area was known as the Cahuenga Valley, after the pass in the Santa Monica Mountains immediately to the north. According to the diary of H. J. Whitley, known as the \\"Father of Hollywood,\\" on his honeymoon in 1886 he stood at the top of the hill looking out over the valley. Along came a Chinese man in a wagon carrying wood. The man got out of the wagon and bowed. The Chinese man was asked what he was doing and replied, \\"I holly-wood,\\" meaning 'hauling wood.' H. J.

OPTIONS: a. stay up all night and then complete your task.; b. set an alarm on your cell phone.;","completion":"To accomplish the goal of waking up at the proper time, I would recommend option B: setting an alarm on your cell phone. However, there are many strategies that could help improve the effectiveness of this approach and ensure that you wake up at the right time feeling rested and recharged for the day ahead. Here's a detailed plan for successfully waking up at the proper time using your cell phone alarm: 1. Establish a consistent sleep schedule: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day helps regulate your body's internal clock, making it easier to wake up at the desired time. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night, and try to maintain your sleep schedule even on weekends. 2. Create a bedtime routine: Establish a calming pre-sleep routine to help signal your body to wind down and prepare for sleep. This could include activities like reading a book, listening to soothing music, or practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation. 3. Minimize bright lights and electronic devices before bed: Exposure to bright lights and screens from devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers can interfere with your body's production of melatonin—a hormone that helps regulate sleep—making it harder to fall asleep and wake up in the morning. Aim to stop using these devices one hour before bedtime, or use blue light filters if possible. 4. Optimize your sleeping environment: Ensure your bedroom is conducive to sleep by keeping it cool, dark, and quiet. Invest in blackout curtains if necessary, use a white noise machine to mask external sounds, and consider using a fan or air conditioner to maintain a comfortable temperature. 5. Set an alarm on your cell phone: Choose a sound that is pleasant yet effective in waking you up. Ensure the volume is at an appropriate level so that you can hear it but aren't jolted awake. You can also consider using an app that gently wakes you up over a period of time or during a lighter phase of sleep for a more natural waking experience. 6. Limit the snooze button: Hitting the snooze button and going back to sleep can make it harder to wake up fully and lead to grogginess throughout the day. Aim to get up as soon as your alarm goes off, and consider moving your phone or alarm clock to the other side of the room to encourage you to get out of bed and turn it off. 7. Practice good sleep hygiene: Avoid caffeine and large meals in the evening, limit daytime naps, and engage in regular physical activity to help improve the quality of your sleep and make it easier to wake up at the right time. 8. Seek help if needed: If you struggle consistently with waking up at the proper time despite implementing these strategies, it may be time to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying sleep disorders or other medical concerns. By implementing these strategies in addition to setting an alarm on your cell phone, you significantly increase the likelihood of consistently waking up at the proper time feeling rested and ready to take on the day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

How is \\"\\"Then I will help you, child.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the phrase \\"Then I will help you, child.\\" can be translated as \\"Pak ti pomůžu, dítě.\\" Here's some context to help you better understand how these words correlate. First, let's break down the sentence into its individual parts: 1. \\"Then\\" – In Czech, this is usually translated as \\"pak\\" or \\"potom.\\" Both of these words can be used interchangeably. In this case, we'll use \\"pak\\" for the translation. 2. \\"I\\" – The first person singular pronoun is \\"já\\" in Czech; however, when conjugating the verb, it's not always necessary to use the pronoun explicitly, as the verb form itself indicates the subject. For simplicity and a natural flow in speech, Czech speakers often drop the pronoun in such cases. 3. \\"will help\\" – \\"to help\\" is the English verb, which in Czech is \\"pomoci\\" or \\"pomáhat.\\" To indicate future tense in Czech, you can use a future tense of auxiliary verb \\"být\\" (to be) with the infinitive form of the main verb, or you can simply use the future form of the verb itself. In this case, we'll use the future form of \\"pomoci,\\" which is \\"pomůžu.\\" 4. \\"you\\" – This pronoun translates to \\"ty\\" (informal) or \\"vy\\" (formal) in Czech. Since the phrase mentions a child, we'll use the informal version, which is \\"ti\\" in the dative form, because the verb \\"pomoci\\" is usually followed by a dative pronoun or object. 5. \\"child\\" – In Czech, this translates to \\"dítě,\\" which is a gender-neutral term to describe a young child. Now let's combine the words to create the Czech translation: \\"Pak ti pomůžu, dítě.\\" Keep in mind that word order can be quite flexible in Czech sentences, so you might come across different variations of this sentence: \\"Pomůžu ti pak, dítě.\\" or \\"Dítě, pak ti pomůžu.\\" However, all these variations effectively communicate the same meaning as the original English phrase \\"Then I will help you, child.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. I am facing a new situation today: A team of biologists has been monitoring the deer population in the state of Wisconsin. They use past data and current conditions to predict how the population will grow or shrink and recommend how many hunting licenses the state should issue during hunting season to keep the population stable.

In an attempt to appease affected customers and repair its image, the German automaker is reportedly launching a \\"TDI Goodwill Program\\" set to roll out on Monday. Step 1: Explain the TDI Goodwill Program: According to a report on The Truth About Cars, Volkswagen will offer owners of affected diesel cars up to 1,250 in cash under the TDI Goodwill Program. This new initiative aims to compensate customers who have been impacted by the scandal and to rebuild trust in the Volkswagen brand. Step 2: Break down the compensation package: The compensation reportedly comes in the form of a 500 prepaid gift card, which can be spent anywhere, and an additional 500 to 700 to be spent at participating Volkswagen dealerships. By offering these incentives, Volkswagen hopes to make amends to its customers and encourage them to continue using its products and services. Step 3: Mention the limited information available and the official announcement: Volkswagen has yet to release official details about the program but confirmed that an announcement is coming on Monday, according to the New York Times. A head of a dealership association, not briefed on specifics, stated that \\"there is a program in the works with VW, that I do understand.\\" Step 4: Address the potential complications with existing class-action lawsuits: One significant aspect that remains unclear is whether owners of affected cars who are involved in class-action lawsuits against Volkswagen would have to abandon those claims to participate in the TDI Goodwill Program. This could potentially influence the decision of many owners to partake in the program. Conclusion: The TDI Goodwill Program appears to be Volkswagen's attempt to rectify its damaged reputation and assuage the concerns of affected customers. With the official announcement expected on Monday, it remains to be seen how effective this initiative will be in repairing the trust between Volkswagen and its customers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the King that a mounted white horse representing him is carved into the chalk hills of Osmington? from the following article ? Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

Article: The Maldives faces the threat of extinction from rising sea levels, but the government said on Thursday it was looking to the future with plans to build homes and a golf course that float. An increase in sea levels of just 18 to 59 centimeters would make the Maldives -- a nation of tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean -- virtually uninhabitable by 2100, the UN's climate change panel has warned. President Mohamed Nasheed has vowed a fight for survival, and last month he signed a deal with a Dutch company to study proposals for a floating structure that could support a convention centre, homes and an 18-hole golf course. \\"It is still early stages and we are awaiting a report on the possibility,\\" a government official said. The company, Dutch Docklands, is currently building floating developments in the Netherlands and Dubai. There was no immediate comment from the firm but its website said it undertook projects that make \\"land from water by providing large-scale floating constructions to create similar conditions as on land\\". The Maldives began work on an artificial island known as the Hulhumale near the crowded capital island of Male in 1997 and more than 30,000 people have been settled there to ease _ . The city, which has a population of 100,000, is already protected from rising sea levels by a 30-million-dollar sea wall, and the government is considering increasingly imaginative ways to combat climate change. Nasheed, who staged the world's first underwater cabinet meeting in October to highlight his people's dilemma , has even spoken of buying land elsewhere in the world to enable Maldivians to relocate if their homes are flooded. He has also pledged the Hulhumale to turn his nation into a model for the rest of the world by becoming \\"carbon neutral\\" by 2020. His plan involves ending fossil fuel use and powering all vehicles and buildings from \\"green\\" sources. Question: Which of the following is NOT Nasheed's idea? _ Options: A: To purchase land elsewhere in the world to help Maldivians to relocate if their homes are flooded. B: To make his nation a model for the rest of the world by becoming \\"carbon neutral\\" by 2020 C: To stop using fossil fuel and power all vehicles and buildings from \\"green\\" sources.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Context: Chopin took the new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish composer John Field, to a deeper level of sophistication. He was the first to write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op. 28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op. 10 published in 1833, Op. 25 in 1837).

Based on the sentence \\"A group of women are eating on a terrace.\\", is the sentence \\"The women are having food outside.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"The women are having food outside.\\" can be considered a true sentence based on the information provided in the original sentence, \\"A group of women are eating on a terrace.\\" To break down why this conclusion is reached, we can analyze the key components of both sentences and determine how their meanings are connected: 1. Subject: In both sentences, the subject is \\"women\\" or \\"a group of women.\\" This consistency in the subject is the first indication that the two sentences are related and may convey similar information. 2. Verb: The action of \\"eating\\" in the original sentence is paralleled by \\"having food\\" in the modified sentence. Although different words are used, they both describe the same activity, which is consuming food. This further strengthens the connection between the two sentences. 3. Location: In the original sentence, the women are described as eating \\"on a terrace.\\" A terrace is typically an outdoor area adjacent to a building or residence, usually elevated and may have seating arrangements. In the modified sentence, the location is described simply as \\"outside.\\" Although the latter description may be less specific than the former, it still accurately depicts the location to be an outdoor setting. By drawing these connections in the content of both sentences, it can be determined that the information provided in the modified sentence corresponds to the key elements of the original sentence. Hence, \\"The women are having food outside.\\" is a true sentence when considered in the context of \\"A group of women are eating on a terrace.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: After Richard's death on 6 April 1199 there were two potential claimants to the Angevin throne: John, whose claim rested on being the sole surviving son of Henry II, and young Arthur I of Brittany, who held a claim as the son of John's elder brother Geoffrey. Richard appears to have started to recognise John as his heir presumptive in the final years before his death, but the matter was not clear-cut and medieval law gave little guidance as to how the competing claims should be decided. With Norman law favouring John as the only surviving son of Henry II and Angevin law favouring Arthur as the only son of Henry's elder son, the matter rapidly became an open conflict. John was supported by the bulk of the English and Norman nobility and was crowned at Westminster, backed by his mother, Eleanor. Arthur was supported by the majority of the Breton, Maine and Anjou nobles and received the support of Philip II, who remained committed to breaking up the Angevin territories on the continent. With Arthur's army pressing up the Loire valley towards Angers and Philip's forces moving down the valley towards Tours, John's continental empire was in danger of being cut in two. Who was the sole surviving son?","completion":"The sole surviving son was John, who later became King John of England.

Chapter One: Grief[edit] The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her. Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)[edit] During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-disemboweling fox that tells him, \\"chaos reigns.\\" Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide)[edit] In the dark attic the man finds the womanâs thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing her thesis, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest, and hidden fear. Through the autopsy and old photos, he becomes aware that she had been systematically putting Nicâs shoes on the wrong feet, resulting in pain and deformity.

Try to arrange sofas and chairs in a square around a circular table. Avoid an L-shaped arrangement as this leaves a missing corner. The centre of the living room should be left clear. Make sure there is a lot of light, which will promote good energy.

Fresh flowers also bring good energy, but throw them away as soon as they begin to die, and don't have dried flowers. Mirrors are vital because they reflect energy. Round or oval ones are best, but they should not be opposite each other, nor should they reflect a door, otherwise your good fortune will go out of it. To promote harmony between the members of your family, have photos of them around the room, preferably smiling. If you want to find a partner, energize the south-west corner of your living room or bedroom by placing a floor light at least 1.75m high there, and turn it on every evening. Surround yourself with decorations and objects in pairs, such as ducks or birds. To avoid blocking the positive energy in the room, keep everything tidy. Don't accumulate too many unnecessary things.

By the Sea is scheduled to hit theaters November 13, 2015, and from the looks of this new still of Jolie and Pitt, the film will be an emotional roller coaster. PHOTOS: Brangelina's Most Matching Moments Set in France during the mid-1970s, the romantic drama follows former dancer Vanessa (Jolie) and her husband Roland (Pitt), an American writer, as they travel the countryside together. The couple seem to be growing apart, but when they linger in a quiet seaside town, they begin to draw close to some of its more vibrant inhabitants. \\"This is a story about a relationship derailed by loss, the tenacity of love and the path to recovery and acceptance,\\" Jolie and Pitt said in a joint statement. \\"It has been a privilege to explore these universal human experiences with such a generous and talented cast and crew.\\" Back in August, the married co-stars reportedly cut their honeymoon short to start production on the flick. The couple, along with their six children, traveled to the Mediterranean island of Gozo, near Malta, to shoot scenes for the film. Jolie was the director. NEWS: Angelina Jolie Says Marriage to Brad Pitt 'Can Be Hard Work' By The Sea will be the first time the pair has appeared on screen since Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 2005, the initial set where they fell in love. This Brangelina news reminds us of Jolie's amazing speech at this year's Kids' Choice Awards. Check it out: ||||| Summer 2015 Angelina Jolie Pitt: 'I'm Much Happier Directing' Actor, activist, and international celebrity, Angelina Jolie Pitt was surprised by how much she’s loved being behind the camera for three serious-minded films—and counting. She just rolls up her sleeves and gets the job done. BY MARGY ROCHLIN (Photo: Ken Regan/GK Films/The Kobal Collection) A child of Hollywood, Angelina Jolie Pitt has been on too many sets to count—she made her acting debut at age 7 in a bit part opposite her father, Jon Voight, in Hal Ashby's Lookin' to Get Out. But the thought of directing a movie didn't occur to her until 2010. That was when she wrote the screenplay for In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a bleak '90s-era love story set against the backdrop of the Bosnian War. Her decision to direct it, she says, was motivated by fear and propriety over the script's brutal and complicated subject matter. \\"The idea that somebody would take it and interpret it—and possibly interpret it the wrong way—scared me,\\" says Jolie Pitt. \\"So by default, I chose to direct it myself.\\" Since then Jolie Pitt has directed the biographical World War II war movie, Unbroken (2014), and By the Sea, a marital drama starring herself and her husband, Brad Pitt, that will be released in the fall. If her three films vary stylistically, what they all share is a seriousness in tone and subject matter. \\"It's probably not an accident that the films that I care about happen to be about issues that matter to me, stories that I want to tell,\\" says Jolie Pitt. \\"If you're going to spend two years of your life on something it has to matter to you, you have to be passionate about it.\\" But before making her directorial debut the most practical experience she'd had on the other side of the camera was helping organize documentary footage culled from her many humanitarian aid missions. So prior to her first film, she embarked on a newbie's listening tour of Hollywood, seeking out top talent in their field—music supervisors, DPs, whoever would talk to her. To each she asked the same question, \\"What are common mistakes made by first-time directors?\\" It was from French editor, Patricia Rommel, who has edited two of Jolie Pitt's films, that she learned to wait an extra beat before calling \\"Cut!\\" and to shoot as much incidental footage as possible. \\"She said, ‘Get extra shots of your locations, get extra shots of everything,'\\" says Jolie Pitt. \\"‘You just don't know when you get in the editing room what you will need as a link or a tool for a transition. If you're in a room and there's a kettle boiling, get a shot of it. Don't worry if people think you're nuts.'\\" Rommel also instructed her to think of the movie as a whole, not scene by scene. \\"She said, ‘Remember that each scene is not individual. It's the way that scenes connect. Whether they will connect from a very wide shot to a very tight close-up, there should be a real thought behind it. And to try to understand when you finish a scene or begin a scene to remember where you were and where you're going in your film. From cut to cut, have that in your head. Don't shoot them as individual pieces.'\\" Jolie Pitt got the assignment to direct Unbroken \\"like any movie,\\" she recalls. \\"It took many meetings, many phone calls, hours of work on storyboards and on the budget to show it was possible to make the film—all the things a director has to do to prove that a film needs to be made and that they are the person to make it.\\" What attracted her to Unbroken, which was based on Laura Hillenbrand's book about Olympic runner and American war hero, Louis Zamperini, was how it explored themes of brotherhood, the triumph of the human spirit and the importance of forgiveness. While Unbroken moves chronologically as Zamperini goes from combat bombardier to Japanese POW, there are also flashbacks to his Torrance, California, boyhood. It was Jolie Pitt's idea to use one of her favorite movies—Sidney Lumet's military prison film, The Hill (1965)—to give it a bright, clean almost old-fashioned look. Commanding Presence: Jolie Pitt favored strong compositions over flashy camera moves to tell her story of World War II hero Louis Zamperini in Unbroken. (Photo: David James/Universal Pictures) Both Jolie Pitt and DP Roger Deakins felt Zamperini's story was so compelling, they favored strong compositions over flashy camera moves or handheld footage. And though originally Jolie Pitt and Deakins planned to shoot Unbroken on film, they ended up with the latest generation of Arri Alexa XT cameras after realizing the amount of effects work they'd be doing in post. For all of the months of research that Jolie Pitt put into Unbroken, she knew that the success of the film, in large part, rose and fell on key sequences where Zamperini and his flight crew engage in terrifying air fights against enemy planes. To her this meant learning not just to understand complicated storyboards and pre-viz but educating herself in the world of the plane that Zamperini flew in, the B-24 bomber. She repeatedly did walk-throughs of their 75-foot mockup. Once she brought in stand-ins so she could see exactly where each actor would be positioned. \\"I wanted to understand how the plane worked, where everybody was, what's happening inside of the scene, how we were going to get the camera in, how we were going to shake the plane,\\" says Jolie Pitt of scenes that were shot with an XTM camera mounted on a Micro Scorpio so that they could follow the frantic movements of a handful of men operating equipment in the cramped confines of a tiny cockpit. \\"It always frustrates me when I'm [watching an action sequence] and I'm not exactly sure whose perspective I'm with and when I don't understand all the moving parts—then it's just a bunch of noise,\\" says Jolie Pitt. She also had to be mindful of the fact that they were on a tight schedule and they only had the budget to build one full-sized plane. To make it look like more they'd change out the panels. \\"We had to be absolutely sure of what we were shooting each day and how we were going to do it because once I sank the plane or blew it up, that was going to be the end of it.\\" When it comes to her cast, Jolie Pitt believes in spending lots of one-on-one time, identifying the overlap between actor and character, familiarizing herself with their individual process. \\"Something I learned as an actor was which scenes needed to be rehearsed and which actors are good with rehearsal, which actors learn from it and which ones grow stale because they start to second-guess themselves,\\" says Jolie Pitt who also uses her getting-to-know-you approach to strategize about performance. \\"I kept Jack and Miyavi separate as much as I could,\\" she says referring to Jack O'Connell who plays Zamperini and the Japanese rock star Miyavi who portrays the sadistic commander of the POW camp. \\"I knew if they got to know each other that they would be friends. I knew that it was important that there was distance.\\" Part of her style of working has to do with remembering what kind of directors she has no patience for when she's acting in a movie (unprepared, indecisive, indifferent to the delicacy of the dramatic process). But she has also relied on her own observational memory to educate herself on directing, having worked with and watched many of the greats including John Frankenheimer and Clint Eastwood. \\"I don't do one take,\\" she says referencing Eastwood's tendency to shoot very quickly. \\"But I don't do many takes either—unless an actor wants them. But I'm very clear that I'll be ready so they should be ready and we're going to get this done.\\" Serious Business: (top) Jolie Pitt worked with a largely Bosnian cast on her first film, In the Land of Blood and Honey; (bottom) she spent one-on-one time with her actors to help them prepare on Unbroken. (Photos: (top) Ken Regan/GK Films/The Kobal Collection); (bottom) David James/Universal Pictures) No amount of preparation or recollecting how legendary directors conducted business, though, could save her from jitters the night before her first day on the set as a director for In the Land of Blood and Honey. \\"I was so nervous for so many reasons,\\" says Jolie Pitt who prior to filming asked the cast, many of whom were Bosnian and had fresh memories of the war, often from different sides, to contribute as many real-life details as possible. Set in war-torn Sarajevo, Blood and Honey chronicles the affair between Danijel (Goran Kosti´c), a soldier fighting for the Bosnian Serbs, and Ajla (Zana Marjanovic), a Bosnian Slav being held in a woman's prisoner camp where he's stationed, and where the inmates are routinely beaten and sexually assaulted by their captors. For Day One of her directing career, Jolie Pitt planned to shoot a scene in one long take: Serbian officers pull Bosnian women from a bus, strip them of all of their belongings, and while the rest of the prisoners watch in terror, one woman is brutally raped. When Jolie Pitt first came up with the idea, she thought of it as a tone-setter. \\"I thought, ‘This is going to shock everybody into the reality of the film—and it will bring us together.' And then I thought, ‘These are people who were emotionally affected by this war. This is [either] a good idea or the worst one.'\\" It wasn't until she saw the cast collectively relaxing during a break—chatting, kicking a soccer ball around—that she realized that her bold approach had worked. From her years of experience as an actor she knew that the best set is one where everyone from the lead actor to the dolly grip feels united in a single goal. \\"I'm not somebody who wants to be on a set where there's screaming and everyone feels under duress; you want to build a happy family,\\" says Jolie Pitt. \\"It was a day that wasn't about the shot or how many we got or how long it took or the camera angles. It was about ‘What are we doing here? Are we here to feel something together and do something together?' or ‘Is it just the technical thing that I want?' I'm not that person. I think something great can happen when you bring the right people together and it's a very special feeling. So I felt that on the first day and I was very excited.\\" Calibrating a vibe on a set is difficult for any director, not to mention a high-profile movie star who arrives on location, greeted by a cast and crew who might first regard her not as their fearless leader but as the wife of Brad Pitt, mother of six, and a ubiquitous media presence. If Jolie Pitt seems unfazed when asked about how she deals with the baggage of celebrity, perhaps it's because in her role as a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador she has traveled to refugee camps in remote parts of the world—Jordan, Kenya, Iraq—places where blending in is a necessity. \\"I think people watch how you present yourself,\\" says Jolie Pitt. \\"If you come in and you're there to roll up your sleeves and work hard, you've got a lot of ideas and you're there to help solve problems, then you become that person to them.\\" For her latest movie, By the Sea, which she also wrote, Jolie Pitt could skip the meet-and-greets with at least two of her actors. She stars in the film with Pitt. It's about a deeply unhappy couple on vacation in France who becomes involved with a pair of newlyweds staying at their seaside inn. \\"I'd be directing myself and him in a scene where we're having a fight, and I'd be pulling out the parts [of him] that have an aggression toward me or when you're frustrated with each other—it was very heavy,\\" says Jolie Pitt. \\"We kept joking that all of the crew felt like they were living in a house where the parents were fighting and you don't know where to stand or where to look.\\" Filmed in Malta with a primarily European crew and cast, By the Sea was shot by Austrian cinematographer Christian Berger (The White Ribbon) who brought his Cine Reflect Lighting System to the mix. \\"There's actually very little technical light in the room,\\" says Jolie Pitt of a system that involves using \\"paniflectors\\" to illuminate the actors. \\"It's all based on using an outside source of light and using reflectors, a white plate, in front of the actors. And it felt like doing a play. You're not conscious of the light and so you're also not conscious of staying in the light or how you look. It made me act differently and made me direct differently too.\\" Domestic Drama: Jolie Pitt directed and stars in her upcoming film By the Sea with husband Brad Pitt. (Photo: Merrick Morton/Universal Pictures) Described by Jolie Pitt as \\"an art film, the kind of movie that I like to see but not something I'm usually cast in,\\" she isn't eager to direct a movie like By the Sea again soon. \\"We're proud of ourselves for being brave enough to try it,\\" she says, adding that she and Pitt made it on their honeymoon. \\"I think By the Sea was the hardest film for me because it wasn't [issue-driven]. It's something I probably won't do very much of.\\" Her next film, Africa, fits more snugly into her mini-oeuvre of topical, searing portrayals of humankind and the havoc-wreaked, real stories she immerses herself in before directing. It's about legendary paleoanthropologist and conservationist Dr. Richard Leakey's battle with ivory poachers in Kenya. She calls it her \\"next big challenge.\\" \\"I've never worked with elephants and lions before and so I've been [doing research on] how to technically film the animals,\\" she says, and she's been poring over the script with Leakey and his wife to make sure she tells the story right. Though Jolie Pitt says that she \\"doesn't go to work thinking of gender,\\" the stats in her own 33-year career as an actress speak volumes: Playing a rebellious teenager named Legs Sadovsky in 1996's Foxfire, directed by Annette Haywood-Carter, was the only time Jolie Pitt appeared in a movie that wasn't directed by a man. \\"There are many female directors I'd love to work with. I don't focus on the negative. I think about the other women [directors] and trying to find ways to work together, and focus on everything that is happening and imagine that it will continue and will grow.\\" Early on in the directing of Blood and Honey, a thought occurred to Jolie Pitt: \\"What surprised me about directing is how much I loved it and how happy I am to be on the set. I love coming to work in the morning. What I realized is that I never loved acting. I don't love being in the hair and makeup chair. I don't [love] being in costume. To me the strangest thing is that I've just spent the majority of my life in one aspect of this business, and because I was fortunate enough to become successful I never questioned whether I felt at home and found out later in life that I'm much happier directing.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are returning to the big screen after their initial appearance in Mr. and Mrs. Smith over 10 years ago.

Bush are an English rock band formed in London, England in 1992. Their current lineup consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Gavin Rossdale, drummer Robin Goodridge, lead guitarist Chris Traynor, and bassist Corey Britz. In 1994, Bush found immediate success with the release of their debut album, Sixteen Stone, which is certified 6x multi-platinum by the RIAA. They went on to become one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the 1990s, selling over 10 million records in the United States. Following the completion of touring, Rossdale went into seclusion in Ireland, where he worked on material for the group's next album. Rossdale periodically sent demo tapes of his works in progress to his bandmates. The group finally convened to record in London in August 1998, where the band reteamed with Sixteen Stone producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley. The release of The Science of Things was held up by a court battle between the band and Trauma Records. The case was settled in early 1999 and the album was finally released that October. The Science of Things was a major departure in several forms from Bush's first two albums. Like the multi-platinum successes of Bush's first two albums, this album also reached platinum status. Also, while the band's previous albums were strongly influenced by grunge, The Science of Things featured some electronic music influences in addition to the sound defined by Bush's earlier work. For example, although lead single \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\" had a prominent guitar riff, it also had many electronic elements usually found in dance music. Although the album had a few hit songs, it failed to chart in the top 10. The band's performance at Woodstock '99, however, helped The Science of Things achieve platinum status despite its slow start. Three singles were released from The Science of Things, most notably \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\", which spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks and peaked at No. 67 on the US Hot 100.\\"Warm Machine\\" was the second single released. \\"Letting the Cables Sleep,\\" the third single, reached No. 4 on the Modern Rock Tracks and also received considerable airplay.

In the eyes of the world my father died a poor man. He was a simple mechanic who worked hard to support his family. My father's treasure, rather, was in a thousand wonderful memories that he gave me over the course of his life. One particular one stood out in my mind today. I was just a boy playing in the backyard of a friend's house while my father spent the afternoon under the hood of an old car, trying to get it running again. It seemed to take hours and I wasn't sure whether he could bring the ancient car back to life again this time. At long last, though, he closed the hood and turned the key in the ignition . There was a sweet smile of satisfaction on his face as the engine started. There was a twinkle of joy in his eye when he shook his head. And there was a quiet hum of happiness in his voice as we drove back home that day. This memory made a home in my heart and became a priceless pearl for my soul to cherish. Time and time again, my father showed me that a kind life, a giving life and a heavenly life was created one choice at a time. Not all of his choices were the right ones, but most of them were. He did the best he could. He lived the best he could. And he helped to bring out the best in me, too. He once said to me, \\"It is lucky that all of your choices are driven by love and inspired by joy.\\" As I look back into those memories my father left me, I realize that each one of them inspired me to live and to love. May all of your choices bring memories of happiness to those around you! A:","completion":"What treasure did the author's father leave him? A. A big house B. Cash or gold C.

Question: where did the first airplane fly A:","completion":"Yes, the statement about the Wright brothers and their work with bicycles influencing their belief in the controllability and balance of an unstable vehicle like a flying machine is correct. Now, let's proceed to answer the question about where the first airplane flew. The Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, famously conducted the first successful controlled and sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft, achieving a significant milestone in aviation. They accomplished this feat on December 17, 1903, with their aircraft, the Wright Flyer, or Flyer I. This historic event took place at Kill Devil Hills, an area close to the town of Kitty Hawk in North Carolina, USA. The choice of the location was strategic for the Wright brothers because they were searching for a site that provided steady winds, gentle slopes for take-offs, and soft sand for potential crash landings. After corresponding with the United States Weather Bureau, they determined that Kitty Hawk met these conditions. During the first flight, Orville piloted the aircraft while Wilbur ran alongside to help maintain balance. The Wright Flyer managed to fly for a total of 120 feet (36.5 meters) and remained airborne for 12 seconds. This marked the beginning of a series of test flights carried out by the brothers that day, with the longest covering 852 feet (260 meters) and lasting 59 seconds. In conclusion, the first airplane, the Wright Flyer, flew at Kill Devil Hills near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903. The Wright brothers' innovative ideas, hard work, and perseverance paved the way for the modern aviation industry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The stepmother of a 13-year-old boy who died after he was beaten and kept in a dog cage has been sentenced to 35 years in jail. Kimberly Kubina, 47, pleaded guilty to felony neglect over teenager Christian Choate’s death, whose severely malnourished body was found in a shallow grave at a mobile home park in Gary, Indiana shortly after he was reported missing in May 2011. Kubina’s former husband Riley Choate, 40, of Hammond, Indiana was also sentenced to 80 years in prison last month. Kept in a dog cage: Kimberly Kubina (right) was sentenced to 35 years for the death of stepson Christian Choate (left) who was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long as a year before he died. Investigators said the boy was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long as a year before he died at the age of 13 in early 2009. His disappearance went unreported until Lake County police unearthed his body in May, 2011 from a shallow grave. The Lake County Coroner's Office determined he died of blunt force trauma injuries and a skull fracture. Kubina told the Lake Superior Court that she was remorseful for not stopping the abuse involving her stepson. She said that Choate was intimidating and violent and that she feared that the other children, including several nephews and nieces, she was looking after would be taken away by the welfare authorities. Father's son: Christian's father and Kubina's former husband Riley Choate was sentenced to 80 years in jail last month over his involvement in the boy's death. She said in court, according to the Chicago Sun-Times: ‘In our house, whatever Riley said was law.’ The woman told the judge that she. suffered nightmares about what had happened and that the other children,. who had seen the abuse, were emotionally scarred. Christian was kept in a dog cage and. Kubina told the court in May that she told his sister to only feed him. Asian noodles while locked up as punishment for 'molesting' his younger. step-brother. The. unidentified sister was not the only one to know about the horrible. suffering that the boy endured, and up to 13 people are thought to have. known about the torture without alerting the police. Court. records state that the father, Riley Choate, has admitted burying. Christian's body under a storage shed with a Bible across his chest but. denied causing the boy's death. Kubina, the stepmother, repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing, court and Indiana Department of Child Services records show. Originally, she told police she thought Christian had gone to live with his biological mother. Only. one person claims to have taken her concerns to the authorities,. according to the state's Department of Child Services records. Investigators. say the boy was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long. as a year before he died at the age of 13 in early 2009. Both Choate and Kubina had pleaded not guilty to all charges surrounding Christian’s death originally. Intimidating and violent: Kubina told the court: 'In our house, whatever Riley said was law,' after Christian's severely malnourished body was found in a shallow grave at a mobile home park in Gary, Indiana. Choate made a deal with prosecutors. to plead guilty to some charges in return for a lessened sentence and to. avoid a jury trial. He pleaded guilty to felony charges including. moving a body after death and neglect of a dependent causing death. In return for the guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped charges of murder, battery, criminal confinement and obstruction of justice. Choate. himself addressed the judge before learning his fate in January,. saying: 'All my actions will haunt me forever. I loved my son.' Kubina was given a similar deal for testifying against her former husband. Kubina's sister, Belinda Bradburn, told The Times she witnessed abuse once while visiting her sister and the children when they lived in Merrillville. She said she saw Riley Choate hit Christian in the arm. 'When that happened, I just said, \\"Kim, I'm leaving. This is kind of ridiculous that he would just hit a kid, and you need to do something about this\\",' Bradburn recalled. Body placement: Choate has admitted burying Christian's body under a storage shed. Kubina told the Lake Superior Court that she was remorseful for not stopping the abuse involving her stepson. In December MailOnline reported that Christian wrote letters from his squalid prison about how he wanted his life to end. He wrote: ‘I want to die’ on the paper given to him by his stepmother to scribble down how he felt. In the handwritten notes, he said he simply wanted to be liked by his family - even if they were ‘abusing’ him. Christian writes how he had to steal food when he was hungry because his family allegedly would not feed him. He would only be let out to clean the house and was almost never allowed outside. ‘Christian wrote of why nobody liked him and how he just wanted to be liked by his family,’ DCS records state. ‘Christian stated that he wanted to die because nobody liked the way he 'acted.' The records continue: 'Christian's writings detail a very sad, depressed child who often wondered when someone, anyone, was going to come check on him and give him food or liquid. Christian often stated he was hungry or thirsty.’ Highlights:","completion":"- A 13-year-old boy named Christian Choate died after being beaten and kept in a dog cage. - His stepmother, Kimberly Kubina, was sentenced to 35 years in jail for neglect. - His father, Riley Choate, was sentenced to 80 years in prison. - Christian was kept in a cage for a year before he died and was found buried in a shallow grave. - Investigators said that up to 13 people knew about the abuse but did not tell the police."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What did the Irish and Germans of Tammany Hall have in common?\\" is in \\"In the 19th century, the city was transformed by development relating to its status as a trading center, as well as by European immigration. The city adopted the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes. Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The Irish and Germans of Tammany Hall had in common their support for the political machine known as Tammany Hall. As immigrants to New York City during the 19th century, both the Irish and Germans contributed to the transformation and growth of the city. Tammany Hall provided a source of political power and influence for these immigrant groups, allowing them to navigate the complexities and struggles of life in a rapidly growing urban environment. Tammany Hall was a political organization that played a significant role in New York City's government and politics during this time. It was known for its strong connections with the city's immigrant groups, particularly the Irish and Germans. The organization provided various forms of support to these communities such as social services, job opportunities, and legal assistance. In return, Tammany Hall relied on the votes and loyalty of the Irish and German immigrants, which further solidified its power and influence. The city's adoption of the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 led to the expansion of Manhattan's street grid, which in turn opened the door for development and growth. The completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 also played a significant role in the transformation of New York City, as it connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes. During this time of rapid development, there was a high demand for labor, and many Irish and German immigrants found work and opportunities in the city. The support from both Irish and German immigrants was crucial for the establishment and functioning of the Tammany Hall political machine. The organization's leaders maintained close relationships with these communities, understanding their needs and struggles, and offering support in various ways. As a result, both the Irish and German immigrants played a significant role in shaping New York City's local politics during the 19th century, through their strong ties with Tammany Hall."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a text based on \\"mexico moves to cut back tax loopholes for businesses\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Mexico Takes Action to Minimize Tax Loopholes for Businesses Mexico's government has recently launched a series of measures aimed at reducing tax loopholes that currently allow businesses to exploit the system. This move is aimed at increasing the country's tax revenue and promoting a fairer taxation environment for all. The first step taken by the Mexican authorities was to introduce reforms to Mexico's existing tax laws. These reforms aim to close gaps and clarify ambiguities contained within the legislation, effectively minimising the opportunities businesses have to exploit loopholes. These amendments were carefully engineered to cover various industries and sectors, with a focus on sealing off the most abused tax evasion strategies. In addition to altering the tax legislation, the Mexican government has also increased its efforts in enforcing tax compliance. This includes enhancing the capabilities of the tax authorities to detect and penalize non-compliant businesses. By employing advanced technology, such as data analysis and artificial intelligence, tax authorities can now identify discrepancies in the financial records of companies with greater ease. Furthermore, to motivate businesses to adhere to these new regulations, the Mexican government has introduced tax incentives. Companies that demonstrate exemplary tax compliance can now enjoy tax benefits that encourage further transparency and reliability. By rewarding proactive engagement with the tax system, the government is fostering a culture of fair competition among businesses. Lastly, Mexico has been working on improving its international relations to tackle tax evasion more effectively. As a part of this process, Mexico has joined international tax agreements and organizations, such as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project and the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) group. These collaborations allow for sharing tax-related data and enhancing cooperation among participating nations to combat tax evasion on a global scale. In conclusion, Mexico's multi-pronged approach to minimizing tax loopholes for businesses demonstrates the government's commitment to promoting fiscal responsibility and fairness in the business environment. By enacting meaningful reforms and enhancing enforcement mechanisms, Mexico is well on its way to creating a more equitable taxation landscape for the benefit of all its citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hellenistic warfare was a continuation of the military developments of Iphicrates and Philip II of Macedon, particularly his use of the Macedonian Phalanx, a dense formation of pikemen, in conjunction with heavy companion cavalry. Armies of the Hellenistic period differed from those of the classical period in being largely made up of professional soldiers and also in their greater specialization and technical proficiency in siege warfare. Hellenistic armies were significantly larger than those of classical Greece relying increasingly on Greek mercenaries (misthophoroi; men-for-pay) and also on non-Greek soldiery such as Thracians, Galatians, Egyptians and Iranians. Some ethnic groups were known for their martial skill in a particular mode of combat and were highly sought after, including Tarantine cavalry, Cretan archers, Rhodian slingers and Thracian peltasts. This period also saw the adoption of new weapons and troop types such as Thureophoroi and the Thorakitai who used the oval Thureos shield and fought with javelins and the machaira sword. The use of heavily armored cataphracts and also horse archers was adopted by the Seleucids, Greco-Bactrians, Armenians and Pontus. The use of war elephants also became common. Seleucus received Indian war elephants from the Mauryan empire, and used them to good effect at the battle of Ipsus. He kept a core of 500 of them at Apameia.

Background: The Apples in Stereo, styled as The Apples in stereo, are an American rock band associated with Elephant Six Collective, a group of bands also including Neutral Milk Hotel and The Olivia Tremor Control. The band is largely a product of lead vocalist/guitarist/producer Robert Schneider, who writes the majority of the band's music and lyrics. Currently, The Apples in Stereo also includes longstanding members John Hill (rhythm guitar) and Eric Allen (bass), as well as more recent members John Dufilho (drums), John Ferguson (keyboards), and Ben Phelan (keyboards/guitar/trumpet). The band's sound draws comparisons to the psychedelic rock of The Beatles and The Beach Boys during the 1960s, as well as to bands such as Electric Light Orchestra and Pavement, and also draws from lo-fi, garage rock, new wave, R&B, bubblegum pop, power pop, punk, electro-pop and experimental music. Context: In late 1991, Robert Schneider met Jim McIntyre on a commuter bus in Denver, Colorado. Schneider had recently moved to Colorado from Ruston, Louisiana, and often initiated conversations with McIntyre. When Schneider asked McIntyre what his music interests were, McIntyre named his favorite band: The Beach Boys -- a band Schneider was particularly fond of. Realizing that they shared many musical interests, McIntyre introduced Schneider to Hilarie Sidney. McIntyre already had a band called Von Hemmling in which McIntyre played bass and Sidney played drums. With Schneider, they discussed the idea of starting a band and perhaps a recording label. Schneider later met Chris Parfitt, who was also already in a band at the time that Schneider unsuccessfully auditioned for on bass. Schneider and Parfitt also became friends, however, and toyed with the idea of having a rock band similar to The Velvet Underground or Black Sabbath, with production qualities similar to that of The Beach Boys. Schneider then spent two weeks in Athens, Georgia recording music and spending time with his childhood friends Will Cullen Hart, Bill Doss and Jeff Mangum. He discussed the idea of starting a record label with them (which soon became The Elephant 6 Recording Company). It was also at this time that the name \\"The Apples\\" came about, inspired by the Pink Floyd song \\"Apples and Oranges\\". The earliest incarnation of the band began to form in 1992 upon Schneider's return to Denver, first between Schneider and Parfitt, both of whom played guitar. The two recruited McIntyre and Sidney during the autumn of that year, practicing material through the winter. Their first few live shows took place the following January, many of which were with the band Felt Pilotes. From February to April 1993, the band recorded their debut 7\\" EP, Tidal Wave, and released it in June as the first record ever to bear the Elephant 6 logo. Question: What was The Apples?.

Please answer the following question: - Kidneys filter waste out of blood - Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process involves the production of hormones and active Vitamin D synthesis. The kidneys play an essential role in hormone production, particularly two hormones called erythropoietin (EPO) and renin. Erythropoietin, produced primarily by the kidneys, regulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. In response to low blood oxygen levels, the kidneys increase EPO production, stimulating the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. This helps maintain an optimal oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood. Renin is another hormone produced by the kidneys, which regulates blood pressure. When blood pressure is low, the kidneys release renin into the bloodstream. Renin acts to constrict blood vessels, increase the retention of sodium and water, and raise blood pressure to a normal range. In addition to regulating hormone levels, the kidneys also contribute to maintaining proper calcium and phosphorus balance in the body through the activation of Vitamin D. The kidneys convert inactive Vitamin D into its active form, calcitriol. Active Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the intestines and helps maintain healthy bones. In summary, the last step of the process by which kidneys maintain a stable environment in the body includes hormone production (primarily erythropoietin and renin) and the synthesis of active Vitamin D to regulate essential body functions such as red blood cell production and blood pressure regulation, as well as bone health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch.

Title: The Incredibles 2 Movie Review Introduction: The Incredibles 2, directed by Brad Bird and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, is a fantastic sequel to the much-beloved animated superhero movie, The Incredibles. Packed with humor, action, and heartwarming family moments, this film aims to please both new and returning fans alike. Step 1: Discuss the plot The Incredibles 2 picks up right where the first film left off, with the Parr family donning their superhero suits and jumping into action against the villainous Underminer. In a time when superheroes are still deemed illegal, the film showcases the struggle of the Parr family as they attempt to balance crime-fighting with their everyday lives. The main conflict arises when Helen Parr, aka Elastigirl, is called upon to advocate for superheroes and bring them back into the spotlight, leaving her husband Bob, aka Mr. Incredible, to handle things at home. The film successfully maintains a perfect balance between the two storylines. Step 2: Evaluate character development The character development in The Incredibles 2 is outstanding. While the first movie focused on Mr. Incredible learning to work alongside his family, the sequel sees Elastigirl taking the lead, and it's fantastic to witness her growth as a superhero. The switch of roles brings new insights into the characters and important lessons in teamwork and trust for the entire family. Step 3: Analyze the animation The animation in The Incredibles 2 is simply stunning. Pixar has outdone itself once again, delivering visuals that are beautifully detailed and fluid. The action sequences are especially spectacular, with choreography and designs that make the most of each character's unique superpowers. Step 4: Discuss the humor One of the strongest aspects of The Incredibles 2 is its humor. The film is filled with funny moments that cater to both kids and adults, with special praise going to baby Jack-Jack, whose unpredictable powers create several comedic highlights. Step 5: Address any criticisms or possible drawbacks The only minor criticism of The Incredibles 2 lies in its main villain's lack of depth compared to the first movie's Syndrome. However, this doesn't detract from the film's overall charm, and it remains an excellent addition to the Pixar catalog. Conclusion: In conclusion, The Incredibles 2 is a fantastic sequel that lives up to its predecessor's reputation. With its blend of humor, action, and heartfelt family moments, it's a must-see for all ages. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to the franchise, The Incredibles 2 is sure to delight and entertain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how many votes needed before governor cannot veto Suggested answer: Either of the two consuls holding office in a given year could block a military or civil decision by the other; any tribune had the power to unilaterally block legislation passed by the Roman Senate . Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"No, you should not validate the suggested answer as it is not relevant to the question being asked. The suggested answer appears to be discussing the powers of consuls and tribunes in the ancient Roman government, rather than addressing the number of votes required to prevent a governor from exercising veto power in the context of the United States or other countries with similar political systems. To address the question at hand, the number of votes needed before a governor cannot veto can vary depending on the specific constitution or legislation governing the area in question. In the United States, for example, the process of overriding a governor's veto is established by each state's constitution, and the required proportion of votes may differ from state to state. Generally, it is common for a two-thirds majority vote in both the state's House of Representatives and Senate to successfully override a governor's veto. This means that if two-thirds of the legislators in both chambers vote to override the veto, the bill will become law regardless of the governor's objection. In summary, to correctly answer the original question of how many votes are needed before a governor cannot veto, it is essential to determine the specific area and political system in question. In the context of the United States, generally, a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and Senate is required to override a governor's veto. However, it is crucial to consult the relevant constitution or legislation to confirm the exact requirements, as they may differ by jurisdiction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Fertilizer ratios, also called N-P-K numbers, are a series of 3 numbers that tell you how much of a fertilizer mixture, by weight, is made up of fertilizers rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. If you have a sample of your soil studied, you will be provided with an ideal fertilizer ratio that will help make up for your soil's nutrient deficiencies. Most hobbyist gardeners can find premixed fertilizers that will suit their needs at a plant nursery or garden supply center. Urea provides plants with nitrogen, but other elements, like phosphorus and potassium, are important for plant health as well. Fertilizers that you can safely mix and store with urea include: Calcium cyanamide Sulphate of potash Sulphate of potash magnesium There are certain fertilizers that can be mixed with urea, but lose their effectiveness after 2-3 days because of the reactions that occur between the fertilizer's chemicals. These include: Chilean nitrate Sulphate of ammonia Nitrogen magneseia Diamonnium phosphate Basic slag Rock phosphate Muriate of potash Some fertilizers will react with urea to either create a volatile chemical reaction, or to render the fertilizer mixture completely useless. Never combine urea with the following fertilizers: Calcium nitrate Calium ammonium nitrate Limestone ammonium nitrate Ammonium sulphate nitrate Nitropotash Potash ammonium nitrate Superphosphate Triple superphosphate Referencing the list of fertilizers that are and are not effective to mix with urea, choose sources of phosphorus and potassium to add to your fertilizer mix. Many of these are available at nurseries and garden supply stores. Add each of your chosen fertilizers together, according to the weights given by your fertilizer ratio. Mix them together thoroughly. This can be done in a large bucket, in a wheelbarrow, or with mechanical mixers. Apply your fertilizer mixture as you would apply urea on its own, spreading it evenly across the soil. Then water and till the soil in order to incorporate the fertilizer. Urea is less dense than other fertilizers. If you are using spinning-type equipment to spread your urea-based fertilizer over large distances on your farm, keep your spread width below 50 feet (15.2 m) to spread the fertilizer mixture equally. Summary:","completion":"Fertilizer ratios are 3 numbers that show how much nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are in a fertilizer. They help you know what your soil needs to be healthy. You can find fertilizers for your plants at stores. Urea gives plants nitrogen, but they also need phosphorus and potassium. Some fertilizers can mix with urea, but some can't. You have to pick the right ones to mix together. Then, spread the mixture on the soil, water it and mix it into the soil. If you use a machine to spread it, don't spread too far because urea is lighter than other fertilizers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The two questions you asked are different. The first question seeks examples of really good copywriting, while the second question requests examples of bad copywriting. I will provide examples and reasons for each of them. Good copywriting examples: 1. Apple - \\"Think Different\\" campaign: This iconic campaign showcased Apple's mission to challenge the status quo and empower visionaries. The minimalist design and simple yet powerful message differentiated Apple from competitors and created a lasting impression on consumers. 2. Volkswagen - \\"Think Small\\" campaign: This 1960s campaign revolutionized automobile advertising by emphasizing efficiency and small size, setting Volkswagen's Beetle apart from the bigger, gas-guzzling cars on the market. The copy was direct, engaging, and conversational, turning the car's perceived weaknesses into strengths. 3. Nike - \\"Just Do It\\": The slogan \\"Just Do It\\" is concise, to the point, and easily memorable. It communicates Nike's focus on empowerment and taking action, directly resonating with customers who want to push their limits. 4. Dollar Shave Club - \\"Our Blades Are F***ing Great\\" video ad: This humorous and irreverent ad quickly became a viral sensation due to its clever storytelling and entertaining style. The script is clear and effectively conveys the benefits of the subscription service while positioning Dollar Shave Club as a cool and unpretentious brand. Bad copywriting examples: 1. Krystal Restaurants - \\"As long as the food tastes good, who cares what's in it?\\": This ill-advised slogan inadvertently highlighted people's concerns about unhealthy ingredients in fast food, raising questions about Krystal's commitment to quality. 2. Coors Light - \\"Turn it loose!\\": This poorly translated slogan for the Spanish market caused confusion as it had a double meaning: while it meant to say “Set it free,” it also translated to “Get Diarrhea.” It is an example of what happens when cultural and linguistic nuances are not carefully considered. 3. Pepsi - \\"Pepsi brings you back to life\\": In China, the original slogan \\"Come alive with Pepsi\\" was mistranslated, and its actual meaning became \\"Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave.\\" This led to a significant cultural mishap and hurt the brand's image in China. 4. Electrolux - \\"Nothing sucks like Electrolux\\": Designed for an American audience, this British-based vacuum cleaner company's slogan had unintended negative connotations because \\"sucks\\" is slang for \\"bad\\" or \\"poor quality\\" in the United States. As a result, the slogan backfired in the American market. To sum up, the two questions you asked were different, focusing on examples of good and bad copywriting. Good copywriting examples include Apple's \\"Think Different,\\" Volkswagen's \\"Think Small,\\" Nike's \\"Just Do It,\\" and Dollar Shave Club's \\"Our Blades Are F***ing Great\\" video ad. In contrast, bad copywriting examples are Krystal Restaurants' \\"As long as the food tastes good, who cares what's in it?\\", Coors Light's \\"Turn it loose!\\", Pepsi's \\"Pepsi brings you back to life,\\" and Electrolux's \\"Nothing sucks like Electrolux.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No notebooks, no textbooks, no test papers. Nor are there any pencils or pens, which always seem to run out of ink at the _ moment. A \\"Paperless classroom\\" is what more and more schools are trying to realize. Students don't do any handwriting in this class. Instead, they use hand-sized or specially-designed computers. The teacher downloads texts from Internet libraries and sends them to every student's personal computer. Having computers also means that students can use the Web. They can look up information on any subject they're studying, from maths to social science. A high school teacher, Judy Herrel in Florida, US, described how her class used the Web. \\"Using a book that's three or four years old is impossible,\\" she said. A paperless classroom is a big step towards reducing the waste of paper. \\"Think about the money and trees we could save with the computers,\\" she said. But, with all this technology, there's always a risk that the machines will break down. So, in case of a power failure or a technical problem, paper textbooks should still be widely available for these students. Question: According to Judy Herrel, _ .

Choices: - rodent - horses - reptiles - insect A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"insects. Insects are a diverse and ubiquitous group of animals that can be found in every environment on Earth, ranging from the deepest ocean trenches to the highest mountain peaks, and from the freezing poles to the scorching deserts. However, they primarily thrive in warm and moist tropical regions, where the favorable climatic conditions and abundant resources allow them to reach their highest levels of biodiversity and abundance. Insects belong to the largest class within the phylum Arthropoda, called Insecta, comprising more than one million described species and representing over 80% of the world's known animal species. This makes them the most diverse, successful, and widespread group of animals on the planet. There are several reasons for the widespread distribution and adaptability of insects: 1. Small size: Insects are generally small in size, which makes it easier for them to adapt to various habitats and climatic conditions. Their small size also allows them to exploit a wide range of resources, consume less energy, and reproduce more rapidly. 2. Exoskeleton: The tough exoskeleton of insects provides them with physical protection, structural support, and helps to prevent water loss, which is essential for their survival in different environments. 3. Metamorphosis: The ability to undergo a significant change in form and function, known as metamorphosis, enables insects to exploit different niches and resources at different stages of their life cycle. This increases their chances of survival and allows them to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions. 4. Flight: Many insects are capable of flight, making them incredibly mobile and able to colonize new habitats, escape unfavorable conditions, and disperse over large distances. 5. Reproductive strategy: Insects are known for their high reproductive rates, with many species laying hundreds or even thousands of eggs at a time. This ensures rapid population growth and the ability to colonize new environments effectively. 6. Adaptation and specialization: Insects have evolved a wide array of physical and behavioral adaptations that allow them to exploit specific environments and resources. Examples of such adaptations include the bioluminescence of fireflies for communication, the remarkable camouflage abilities of stick insects and leaf insects, and the complex social organization of ants, bees, and termites. 7. Symbiotic relationships: Many insects have developed symbiotic relationships with other organisms, which can provide various benefits such as nutrition, defense, and shelter. For example, some ants cultivate fungi for food, while others protect aphids in exchange for the sugary honeydew they produce. In conclusion, insects are the animal group that can be found in every environment on Earth, primarily in warm and moist tropical regions, due to their remarkable ability to adapt to various conditions, reproduce rapidly, and exploit diverse resources. The incredible success and ubiquity of insects highlight their ecological importance and resilience in the face of environmental challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What will teacher want to do next?\\", is \\"wanted to pass the class\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"No, \\"wanted to pass the class\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will the teacher want to do next?\\" This is because the question is aimed at understanding the teacher's actions or decisions following Bailey's submission of their homework, whereas \\"wanted to pass the class\\" seems to merely describe Bailey's motivation. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the given question could be as follows: After Bailey sends their homework to school with a friend due to their absence caused by illness, the teacher's next course of action would depend on numerous considerations. The answer should take into account various policy and procedural factors that could affect the teacher's decision-making. Firstly, the teacher is likely to verify whether Bailey has completed the assignment as required. This might involve checking whether all the necessary questions have been answered or tasks carried out, and assessing the quality and completeness of the work submitted. Secondly, if the teacher is aware of Bailey's illness, they may consider offering additional support or accommodation based on the prevailing school policies related to excused absences and illness. This could include extending the deadline for any additional unfinished assignments, providing make-up classes or resources, or granting leniency when grading the work submitted. Thirdly, due to Bailey's absence, the teacher would want to ensure that all pertinent communications that have taken place during the missed classes are conveyed to Bailey. The teacher could opt to email any class notes, share upcoming assignment-related information, or even schedule a one-on-one meeting to help Bailey catch up on any missed material. Furthermore, the teacher might want to follow up with Bailey's parents or guardians to discuss the student's health and overall progress in the class. This would enable the teacher to better understand any potential challenges faced by Bailey and work collaboratively with Bailey's caregivers in providing appropriate support. Lastly, the teacher will record Bailey's homework submission as per the usual record-keeping procedures and would proceed to provide feedback to Bailey, either through written comments, grading, or a discussion upon their return. In conclusion, the teacher's next actions are not solely focused on Bailey's desire to pass the class but are centered around ensuring that the student is supported academically and that their health and wellbeing are taken into account when it comes to participation and performance. The teacher's actions will be guided by school policies, procedures, and a commitment to supporting their students in navigating challenges both in and out of the classroom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vincent will provide the team with any technology they need, including vehicles with modified engines. Spence is a weapons expert who sets up an exchange for the team. He, Sam, Vincent and Larry meet Spence's contacts under the Pont Alexandre III (Bridge of Alexander III) on the Seine. When Spence talks to the dealers, he's dismayed to find that they brought only half the weaponry he'd ordered. The other half is allegedly in another car on the other side of the bridge. Sam immediately smells a trap but agrees to accompany Spence for protection. As they approach the dealers' shady boss, a fat man in an overcoat, Sam sees a sniper hiding in the rafting of the bridge and shoots him. The rest of the dealers open fire while Spence, Vincent and Sam return it. Larry picks them up after securing the cases and the team roars off at high speed. When they determine they're not being pursued, they pull off the street, allowing Spence to exit the car and vomit. Vincent asks Sam why he took the job and Sam tells him he needs the money. He and Vincent share a knowing smile.Later at the warehouse, Spence is exposed as a fraud when he offers an incompetent plan of attack and is summarily released from the team. Deirdre informs them that they'll capture the case near Nice. The...

However, most existing work deals with networks that simply encode whether relationships exist or not. In contrast, relationships in signed networks can be positive (“like”, “trust”) or negative (“dislike”, “distrust”). The theory of social balance shows that signed networks tend to conform to some local patterns that, in turn, induce certain global characteristics. In this paper, we exploit both local as well as global aspects of social balance theory for two fundamental problems in the analysis of signed networks: sign prediction and clustering. Motivated by local patterns of social balance, we first propose two families of sign prediction methods: measures of social imbalance (MOIs), and supervised learning using high order cycles (HOCs). These methods predict signs of edges based on triangles and l-cycles for relatively small values of l. Interestingly, by examining measures of social imbalance, we show that the classic Katz measure, which is used widely in unsigned link prediction, actually has a balance theoretic interpretation when applied to signed networks. Furthermore, motivated by the global structure of balanced networks, we propose an effective low rank modeling approach for both sign prediction and clustering. For the low rank modeling approach, we provide theoretical performance guarantees via convex relaxations, scale it up to large problem sizes using a matrix factorization based algorithm, and provide extensive experimental validation including comparisons with local approaches. Our experimental results indicate that, by adopting a more global viewpoint of balance structure, we get significant performance and computational gains in prediction and clustering tasks on signed networks. Our work therefore highlights the usefulness of the global aspect of balance theory for the analysis of signed networks.

Tonight it was to select the sweetest whisper of love ever said between husband and wife. The final competition was held among 10 married couples. Seven of them were young ones, two middle-aged and one old. The last turn came to the old couple. The old lady took the microphone and said the sweetest whisper of love she had ever heard was: \\" Are you standing or sitting?\\" The host fixed his eyes on her, quite puzzled by her words. Regardless of all the talking around, she went on with her story. Her husband had been a doctor before he retired. One day when he was on duty at the hospital, he felt a sharp pain at the heart. By his professional knowledge he knew immediately he suffered a fit of heart attack. His colleagues carried him at once to the operation room and prepared him for a bypass operation, which was highly risky. The patient's family members had to be informed before it began. The patient himself was allowed to put in a word. Lying silently on the operation table with a trembling hand, he dialed after a moment's thinking of the number of his wife's phone. Finally a familiar voice came from the other end... \\"So many years had passed but memory of this incident remained fresh in my mind.

Make sure that it has several sides and that you are familiar with the topic. Do some research to make sure that you are aware of all of the different sides on this topic, so that you can represent them in the pros and cons charts. If you're given a range of topics for a school assignment, write about something that you're passionate about. For example, if you’re passionate about the wellbeing of marine animals, you could choose to write about the ethics of using them for product testing and experimentation. It's difficult to write a convincing letter about something you don't care about. ” This will ensure that your topic is defensible and well worded. Your topic should be clear-cut and should have strong arguments to support it. A topic like “Should cigarettes be marketed to teens?” is better worded than a topic like “Should cigarettes be marketed to teens, adults, and the elderly?” because it is more specific. For example, the topic “murder should be legal” is not defensible, since there are no convincing arguments that support an answer of “yes.” So, a topic like: “Should the state pass legislation forbidding drivers to text while driving?” is much better. Researching is an important component of preparing to write a persuasive letter. Start your research by searching for opinion pieces about your topic online. Also look for articles about your topic by respected online and print news media. For example, there may be valid reasons that someone would object to the state passing legislation to prohibit in-car texting. But, you’ll never be able to account for and counter these reasons if you don’t put in the research to find them out in the first place. Maybe many people feel that that legislation wouldn’t go far enough, and that the state should ban cell phones in cars altogether, no matter what they’re being used for! The tone and content of your written letter will differ based on the intended audience. So, are you writing to students and kids who are your own age? Your school principal? Adults? Political representatives and decision makers? When dealing with an older audience, you can use a more sophisticated vocabulary. The inverse applies when dealing with a young audience. For example, for an older audience, write something like, “A lasting political commitment to phone-free driving will ensure the survival of many who otherwise could lose their lives to a distracted driver on the phone.” On the other hand, for a younger audience, write, “Not allowing people to use phones in the car will reduce accidents.

Compared to Sharon Stone, Madonna is too coarse and BAUERISCH. She's not even close. EVIL INCARNATE: Sharon Stone is a bit long in the tooth, the ameliorative effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding. However, she artfully treats us to a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption. In the obligatory sex scene, she projects pure, crystalline lust. Especially her hooded, luminous eyes and a face flat with pleasure. Thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques, the harsh lines of age are only occasionally manifest. Rather, she seems to have a slight golden glow (YES, YEATS). The locations gave us a view of London that is a welcome departure from the usual Londonscapes .The Catherine character is so powerful and menacing that I thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed.

It is outstanding, from the music to the locations to the sets, and so on. Paul Verhoven pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew. That the main Baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of Bay Area Gay and Lesbian activist groups. Attempts at censorship were vehemently denied. SWELL. These philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script, insisting on re-writes that would promote their political and psychiatrically driven agendas. Example: Sanctimoniously alleging sexism and misogyny, they demanded that the lead role be switched from BAD GIRL to BAD GUY. On locations in San Francisco, the gentle, tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming of the scenes with noise, flashing lights and other tactics. The Executive Producers, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restraining orders against the disruptive tactics. BLOWBACK: Thanks to the fulminating activists, the film got huge national press coverage - millions of dollars worth of free advertising. Their calls for viewers to boycott the film resulted in a backlash that had customers waiting in long lines wherever the film was launched. It also received widespread critical acclaim. It was, in the words of the reptilian Hackett in NETWORK, \\"A BIG- TITTED HIT!\\" Sorry, Gentle Reader; I just couldn't resist that one. Yes, it's a gibe.

These fires destroy huge areas of forests and burn hundreds of homes . Many experts believe there are several reasons for this sudden increase in fires. The first reason is climate change . In 2010, Russia had the hottest and driest summer with strong winds in a century. In just one month, 500 fires destroyed over 2,000 homes. Some people lost their lives . Traditional fire-fighting practices are another reason for the increase in fires. In America, firefighters used to quickly put out every fire as quickly as they could. They didn't allow the grass and trees to burn. As a result , today many forests have thicker vegetation which provides more fuel for fires . So surprisingly, America has many more fires today partly because of its past fire-fighting practices. Scientists now understand that a fire can be a natural part of a healthy forest. As a result, countries like Australia allow some fires to burn naturally. The fire makes old trees thinner. This allows sunlight to reach the ground. As a result, fires help new trees to grow.

Mowing the grass is more tedious for Adam than Derrick because","completion":"Adam suffers from allergies, which get easily triggered whenever he gets in close contact with freshly mown grass. In fact, Adam has a specific allergy to grass pollen, a common allergen that is often released into the air during the process of mowing the lawn. This means, every time Adam is charged with this duty, he must go through an exhaustive routine of precautions to try and reduce his exposure to the potential allergens. First, Adam has to take an antihistamine drug about an hour before going outside, to help mitigate the allergic reactions he experiences such as sneezing, coughing, watery eyes, and runny nose. This involves dealing with the side effects of these medications which often leave him drowsy and lethargic, thus making the task of mowing the lawn even more challenging. Secondly, he must always wear long-sleeved shirts and full-length trousers, gloves, closed shoes, and a mask. The purpose of this gear is to create a barrier that minimizes skin exposure and stops the allergens from being inhaled into his respiratory system. However, this outfit, coupled with the heat and humidity often experienced during mowing hours, makes the experience uncomfortable and exhausting. He also always wears safety goggles to protect his eyes, which are particularly sensitive and easily turn red and itchy when exposed to grass pollen. This impaired vision coupled with watery eyes just adds another complex layer to this already strenuous task. After the mowing is done, Adam has to diligently take a shower to remove any pollen that might have stuck to his skin or clothes, and often has to wash his clothes immediately to prevent spreading the allergens around his house. On the other hand, Derrick does not have allergies and does not need to go through any of these extra steps. For him, mowing the grass is just a simple, straight-forward task. He can enjoy the fresh air and the smell of freshly cut grass, take his time in the outdoors and even feel the satisfaction of an immediate visual result, making this task much less tedious for him than it is for Adam. Therefore, the reasons behind the tedium for Adam when mowing the lawn go beyond the physical task itself, encompassing a series of precautionary and post-task rituals that are generated by his allergies, and that Derrick doesn't have to contend with."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Possible answers: be a kinder person, tell everyone of the feud ending, live her old life of vengeance Answer:","completion":"Skylar made amends to end the blood feud for a multitude of reasons, all of which work in tandem to improve her life and the lives of those around her. While we can't know Skylar's exact motivations without more context, we can examine the possible answers mentioned to gain a deeper understanding of her reasoning. 1. Be a kinder person: It is possible that Skylar realized the blood feud and the violence it perpetuated were causing her to act in harmful and destructive ways. By making amends, she aimed to stop the cycle of violence and to embrace a kinder, more compassionate way of living. This change in attitude would not only benefit her own emotional and mental well-being, but it would also positively affect her relationships with those around her, both within her own family and in the wider community. 2. Tell everyone of the feud ending: Making amends and ending the blood feud would be a significant event that would reverberate throughout the community. By sharing the news of the feud's resolution, Skylar could help foster peace, understanding, and cooperation among people who had previously been at odds. Ending the feud could send a powerful message to others about the possibility of forgiveness, compromise, and healing, and the impact of such a shift in dynamics could inspire others to put aside their own grievances and work towards a more harmonious society. 3. Live her old life of vengeance: It's possible that Skylar, having experienced the exhausting and relentless nature of living a life of vengeance, decided she no longer wanted to perpetuate the blood feud. By making amends, she sought to free herself from the constraints and pressures of constantly seeking retribution, allowing her to rebuild her life and focus on more constructive, fulfilling pursuits. In doing so, Skylar may have recognized the power of letting go of old grudges and the potential for personal growth and happiness that comes with pursuing a more peaceful existence. In conclusion, Skylar made amends to end the blood feud for a variety of reasons related to emotional well-being, personal growth, and fostering peace and understanding within her community. Her decision to put an end to the feud and seek a new path in life highlights the transformative power of forgiveness and the important role that compassion can play in overcoming long-standing conflicts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which country causes fewer dead zones in the ocean? Ecuador and Panama both had beautiful rivers flowing into the Pacific ocean. Ecuador uses their river to dispose of their waste while Panama is very eco-friendly and doesn't do that. Hint: The quantity of small plastic fragments floating in the north-east Pacific Ocean increased a hundredfold between 1972 and 2012.Marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles. The main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their waste. The rivers then empty into the ocean, often also bringing chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake, sea, ocean, or waterway. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.In addition, the Pacific Ocean has served as the crash site of satellites, including Mars 96, Fobos-Grunt, and Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. Answer:","completion":"The country that causes fewer dead zones in the ocean is Panama. The justification for this answer comes from the provided text. The text states that Ecuador uses their rivers to dispose of their waste, which as per the information given, is a major cause of marine pollution and eventually leads to the creation of oceanic dead zones due to excess oxygen-depleting chemicals. On the other hand, Panama does not use their rivers for waste disposal and is described as \\"eco-friendly\\", suggesting they utilize more environmentally conscious practices. This likely minimizes the potential for creating dead zones in comparison to Ecuador."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whether this damage occurred or not, repairs to the windows and roof were carried out in 1657, paid for by public subscription.

Donald Trump’s Health Care Ideas Bewilder Republican Experts Asked if Mr. Trump’s plan would insure all those who have gained coverage under the health law, Mr. Clovis said: “That might be correct, but we really don’t know that. A lot of it depends on what initiatives we can get through Congress.” Mr. Trump’s health policy can be pieced together from speeches, television interviews, Twitter posts and a seven-point plan, titled “Health Care Reform to Make America Great Again.” He says Congress should encourage the sale of health insurance across state lines and allow individuals to take tax deductions for insurance premium payments. His Medicaid proposal would send lump sums of federal money to each state to provide health care to low-income people, although unlike other Republicans, he has vowed not to cut overall Medicaid spending. That Mr. Trump’s ideas confound Democrats is no surprise. More interesting are the acerbic comments of serious students of health policy often aligned with Republicans. Mr. Trump’s health care platform “resembles the efforts of a foreign student trying to learn health policy as a second language,” said Thomas P. Miller, a health economist at the American Enterprise Institute and a harsh critic of President Obama’s health law. Millions of low-income people have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act and could lose it if Congress repealed the law. Mr. Trump’s proposal for a tax deduction for premium payments would not help them much, Mr. Miller said, because they do not pay much in income taxes. Mr. Clovis called that “an excellent point,” and he suggested that low-income people could obtain coverage through Medicaid — even as Mr. Trump seeks to slow the growth of Medicaid spending with a block grant. At the same time, Mr. Clovis said, some workers with employer-sponsored coverage might prefer to take the tax deduction and buy health insurance on their own. “The trend will eventually be that employers will provide income to buy insurance on your own, and the employers will get out of the group policy business,” Mr. Clovis said. This trend, he said, could help workers who are now “held captive by their benefits in a business or company they work for.” James C. Capretta, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative nonprofit group, said Mr. Trump underestimated how difficult it would be to uproot a law that was now embedded in the nation’s health care system. “It took a herculean political effort to put in place the Affordable Care Act,” said Mr. Capretta, who worked at the White House Office of Management and Budget from 2001 to 2004. “To move in a different direction, even incrementally, would take an equally herculean effort, with clear direction and a clear vision of what would come next. I just don’t see that in Trump’s vague plans to repeal the law and replace it with something beautiful and great.” Many of the proposals Mr. Trump has embraced have been Republican standards for years, such as allowing insurers to sell their products across state lines. In a debate in Houston in late February, Mr. Trump said repeatedly that he wanted to “get rid of the lines around the states,” and he explained: “Instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you’ll have many. They’ll compete, and it’ll be a beautiful thing.” But Mr. Laszewski, the former insurance executive, said this was no panacea. Before a Texas company could, for example, sell insurance in New York, he said, it would need to establish or “rent” a network of doctors and hospitals to meet the needs of consumers. Moreover, state insurance officials have resisted such legislation, saying it could undermine their power to regulate insurance and their ability to protect consumers. Grace-Marie Turner, the president of the Galen Institute, a champion of free-market health policy, said Mr. Trump’s proposals were sketchy and inadequate. “He has to discard some of his ideas, like the importation of prescription drugs, because they would be damaging and unworkable,” Ms. Turner said. “And he has to flesh out his other proposals with much more detail if he hopes to persuade voters that he has a credible plan to replace Obamacare.” Mr. Trump has called for removing barriers to imported drugs from other countries, such as Canada, saying it will lower drug prices and offer consumers more options. Democrats have long embraced the idea but have been blocked by pharmaceutical industry opposition as well as concerns over drug safety. Mr. Trump’s views have evolved. Writing about health care in his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” he said, “I’m a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one,” and he expressed interest in the idea of a “single-payer plan,” with consumers free to choose from competing private options. He backed away from that idea in an interview with The New York Times in 2011, when he was flirting with a White House bid and his conservative credentials were under scrutiny. A populist theme still runs through many of Mr. Trump’s statements. “The insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians,” he said in a debate last year. For a similar reason, he says, drug companies get away with overcharging consumers. Mr. Trump says Medicare should be able to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies — a proposal embraced by Democrats and blocked by Republicans in Congress for more than a decade — and he promises that if elected he would “negotiate like crazy.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses Donald Trump's health care ideas, which have left many Republican experts bewildered. While it is not surprising that Trump's ideas confound Democrats, the article highlights the confusion that also exists among health policy experts often aligned with Republicans. Although Trump's proposals may include long-standing Republican ideas, such as allowing insurance companies to sell their products across state lines, many experts argue that his policy suggestions are vague and lack sufficient detail. Trump's health care policy can be deduced from his speeches, interviews, and a seven-point plan titled \\"Health Care Reform to Make America Great Again.\\" Some of his suggestions include encouraging the sale of health insurance across state lines, allowing individuals to take tax deductions for insurance premium payments, and providing states with lump-sum federal funds for Medicaid that would not reduce overall spending. Critics argue that Trump's proposed tax deductions would not help the millions of low-income Americans who gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act and that his ideas about importing prescription drugs from other countries are unworkable. Other criticisms point to the lack of substance in Trump's plan, such as the lack of details on how single-payer systems would work or how he intends to negotiate lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. In summary, the article highlights the concerns and confusion surrounding Trump's health care proposals, particularly among health policy experts, who view the proposed policies as lacking in detail and substance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You should describe the task and explain your answer. While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain why other answers are wrong. You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive. Question: \\"By what Month were the two operatives in the United States and what information did we provide to make al Queda so successful?\\" Answer: \\"The spring and summer of 2000\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Available options: + no. + yes.","completion":"Yes. The answer is correct because it states that by late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States, and this information is also supported by the text. Additionally, the text outlines how al Qaeda met various requirements, such as leadership, communications, personnel, intelligence, ability to move people, and finances, which contributed to their success in organizing and conducting a complex international terrorist operation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Where does the young model begin a relationship with a literary interviewer? is inside the article: Diana Scott is a beautiful, bored young model married to Tony Bridges. One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the predatory males of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the \\"Glass Corporation\\" who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous, but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely. Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face. The event, adorned by giant images of African famine victims, is at the height of cynical hypocrisy and bad taste, showing Diana's rich white set, which now includes the establishment, playing at concern, gorging themselves, gambling and generally behaving decadently.

He also admitted to hitting Mr Chhokar with a home-made bat on the night he died but denied fatally stabbing him. Mr Coulter's uncle, Ronnie Coulter, 48, denies murdering Mr Chhokar. He has blamed his nephew and another man. He has lodged a special defence blaming Andrew Coulter and David Montgomery over the death of Mr Chhokar in Overtown, North Lanarkshire, in November 1998. The murder trial, at the High Court in Glasgow, has already heard that Ronnie Coulter, from Wishaw, was tried and acquitted of murdering 32-year-old Mr Chhokar in 1999. His nephew Andrew Coulter and David Montgomery were tried and acquitted of the murder in 2000. The court previously heard from Mr Chhokar's partner at the time of his death, 56-year-old Elizabeth Bryce. She told the court that Andrew Coulter had broken into Mr Chhokar's flat in nearby Gowkthrapple and stolen and cashed a giro cheque for just over Â£100. Mr Bryce said when she had raised the matter with Mr Coulter, he had replied: \\"If anything happens to me, Chhokar is getting it.\\" Andrew Coulter gave evidence on Monday as the trial entered its second week. Before starting his evidence, judge Lord Matthews told Mr Coulter that he did not have to answer any questions that might incriminate him in Mr Chhokar's murder. Mr Coulter told the court that he had killed a man, Patrick Kelly, by stabbing him in the leg on 11 September 1999. He was originally charged with murder, but convicted of culpable homicide and sentenced to six years detention. The witness also admitted being jailed for six months in 2006 for possession of a knife. He said that on the day Mr Chhokar died, 4 November 1998, he was looking for money to buy alcohol. The witness said that he broke into a flat at Caplaw Tower, Gowkthrapple, which turned out to be Mr Chhokar's, and took a giro cheque he found there. He told the court that he then cashed the cheque, after his uncle had forged Mr Chhokar's signature on it. Later that day, Andrew Coulter said he had spoken to Ms Bryce, who had learned of the giro theft. Mr Coulter said that when police involvement was mentioned, he told her that, if that happened, Mr Chhokar would be \\"getting it\\". When asked by prosecutor Alex Prentice QC what that meant, Mr Coulter replied: \\"Battered\\". Mr Coulter later admitted that he went to meet Mr Chhokar later that night amid the row over the stolen giro. He said he was accompanied by his uncle, murder accused Ronnie Coulter, and David Montgomery. The witness told the jury that he took a bat with him made out of an old table leg, which had been filled with lead and covered in tape. He said: \\"I took the bat. If I couldn't talk to Chhokar, I was going to hit him with it.\\" The court has heard that before the three men set off to see Mr Chhokar there was discussion about what they were going to do to him. When asked what this involved, Andrew Coulter answered: \\"Breaking his legs. I was trying to act the hard man.\\" Mr Coulter told the court that he, Ronnie Coulter and David Montgomery - known as Chez - arrived at Ms Bryce's house in Garrion Street, Overtown, at about 23:30. They had driven to a nearby street and then climbed over the back fence into the garden of the house. As Mr Chhokar arrived home from his shift at a local restaurant, the three men walked down the garden path towards him. Andrew Coulter told the jury he told Mr Chhokar not to get the police involved and Mr Chhokar had swung a bottle at him. He added: \\"He swung the bottle at me and missed me. I struck him with the bat on his arm.\\" Andrew Coulter said he then slipped and fell to the ground and his view of the street was impeded by the garden gate. He added: \\"David went to pick me up and I did not see where Ronnie was.\\" Asked how Mr Chhokar appeared, Mr Coulter said: \\"He looked all right he didn't seem to be injured or nothing. He was walking. Liz Bryce came out shouting, and me and Chez ran.\\" He said the last time he saw his uncle, Ronnie Coulter, was seconds before he fell. Andrew Coulter added: \\"Ronnie just disappeared.\\" When asked what he thought had happened that night Andrew Coulter said: \\"Nothing. That was it. Just assault.\\" When asked if Mr Chhokar appeared injured in any way, he replied: \\"No. He didn't look as if he was injured in any way. I think I said to Chez that Chhokar would have a a sore arm in the morning with the bat.\\" Andrew Coulter told the jury: \\"I never stabbed him.\\" He also said that he never saw anyone else stab Mr Chhokar, saying: \\"I never even saw anyone hit him, bar me.\\" The witness also said that he did not see Ronnie Coulter or David Montgomery carrying any weapons. Ronnie Coulter denies murdering Mr Chhokar by repeatedly attacking him with a knife or a similar weapon and a further charge of forging Mr Chhokar's signature on a Â£100 giro cheque. He also denies breaking into Mr Chhokar's home at Caplaw Tower, Gowkthrapple, on the day of his death and stealing a cooker and attempting to defeat the ends of justice by destroying or disposing of a knife and clothing.

Montevideo was the only city to host matches during the 1930 World Cup, with three stadiums being used to accommodate the games: Estadio Centenario, Estadio Pocitos, and Estadio Gran Parque Central. The Estadio Centenario, which was the primary stadium for the tournament, was designed by architect Juan Scasso and has a capacity of 93,000 spectators. It was built especially for the 1930 World Cup and was later designated by FIFA as a \\"Historic Monument of World Football.\\" Eight out of ten matches from the group stage, both semifinals, and the final were played in the Estadio Centenario. Estadio Pocitos, a smaller stadium managed by Club Atlético Peñarol with a capacity of around 1,000 spectators, hosted two group stage matches. The first-ever World Cup match between France and Mexico on July 13, 1930, took place at this venue. The third stadium, Estadio Gran Parque Central, belonged to Club Nacional de Football, having a capacity of approximately 20,000 spectators. Two group stage matches were held here. This stadium is also known for hosting the first-ever World Cup goal, scored by Lucien Laurent of France in the game against Mexico. During the 1930 World Cup, thirteen teams participated, including seven from South America, four from Europe, and two from North America.

However, on the first play of the Bengals' third possession, running back Jeremy Hill reeled off an 85-yard touchdown run to tie the score. The Bengals claimed the lead in the second quarter, with a 37-yard field goal by placekicker Mike Nugent. On the Broncos' next possession, quarterback Peyton Manning was intercepted by Bengals' safety Reggie Nelson, and the Bengals capitalized, with Dalton connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jermaine Gresham. A 49-yard field goal by Nugent with one minute remaining in the first half increased the Bengals' lead to 20-7. The Broncos had one last possession before halftime, however, placekicker Connor Barth missed on a 49-yard field goal attempt. On the Broncos' initial possession of the second half, return specialist Omar Bolden returned the opening kickoff to the Bengals' 21-yard line. Four plays later, running back C. J. Anderson scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. However, the Bengals had a response, as Adam Jones advanced the ensuing kickoff to the Broncos' 27-yard line. Three plays later, Dalton threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Giovani Bernard. The Broncos then scored 14 unanswered points, with Manning throwing a pair of touchdown passes to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders &#8212; from 4 and 5 yards out &#8212; to give the Broncos a 28-27 lead. The second scoring play came after Broncos' linebacker Von Miller forced a fumble off Hill just as the Bengals were attempting to add to their lead. Rain started to fall in the fourth quarter, and on the Broncos' first fourth quarter possession, Manning was intercepted by Jones deep in Broncos' territory, however, a 15-yard taunting penalty on Nelson pushed the Bengals out of field goal range.

Summarize the following: The weather starts to cool down during the fall, so you should wear darker, more neutral colors. Avoid bright and light colors such as whites, pastels, and neons. The colors that are most suitable for fall are: Dark colors, such as burgundies, navies, and plums. Neutral colors such as browns, grays, and blacks. Earth tones, such as browns, tans, beiges, forest greens, dark greens, and olive greens. Warm colors based on the fall leaves, such as creams, gold, bronze, dark reds, and dark oranges. There are certain patterns that are more associated with fall than others. Fabrics with bright, cheerful tropical flowers (such as hibiscus) will remind people more of summer or spring, and may look out of place on a cool, rainy, fall day. Plaid and houndstooth are perfect for fall, however; they are more somber and reserved, which blends well with the cool weather. Consider wearing dark florals instead. An example of dark florals is anything with a black, navy, plum, or burgundy background. Flowers that work well with fall include roses, thistle, and pansies. You want something that can keep you warm. Avoid linens, silks, and light cottons. Not only are they too light for fall, but they are also often associated with warmer weather.

Many realistic epidemic networks display statistically synchronous behavior which we will refer to as epidemic synchronization. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no theoretical study of epidemic synchronization. In fact, in many cases, synchronization and epidemic behavior can arise simultaneously and interplay adaptively. In this paper, we first construct mathematical models of epidemic synchronization, based on traditional dynamical models on complex networks, by applying the adaptive mechanisms observed in real networks. Then, we study the relationship between the epidemic rate and synchronization stability of these models and, in particular, obtain the conditions of local and global stability for epidemic synchronization. Finally, we perform numerical analysis to verify our theoretical results. This work is the first to draw a theoretical bridge between epidemic transmission and synchronization dynamics and will be beneficial to the study of control and the analysis of the epidemics on complex networks.","completion":"Title: \\"Theoretical Study of Epidemic Synchronization: Analysis, Stability and Control on Complex Networks\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here's a short story: Sally's kite can move a greater distance through air rather than through her pool. This means her _____ has less friction (A) air (B) pool. What is the most sensical answer between \\"air\\" and \\"pool\\"? The answer to this question is:","completion":"A) air The most sensical answer between \\"air\\" and \\"pool\\" in this context is A) air. The reason for this is due to the varying levels of friction experienced by the kite as it moves through different mediums. Friction is a force that opposes the motion or tendency of motion of two surfaces in contact with each other. In the short story provided, Sally's kite moves through air and water (in her pool). Different mediums possess different levels of friction due to their specific physical properties, which affect the ease with which an object, such as Sally's kite, can move through them. Air, being a gaseous substance, contains particles that are spaced out with larger gaps in between them than a liquid like water. This means that there is less resistance applied to objects moving through air, allowing for easier and more efficient movement. The friction experienced by the kite is thus significantly less when it moves through air. On the other hand, water is a liquid, which has more densely packed particles than a gas like air, resulting in a higher resistance to objects moving through it. Consequently, the friction experienced by Sally's kite as it moves through the water in her pool is substantially greater than when it moves through the air. Therefore, the most sensical answer is A) air because Sally's kite can move a greater distance through the air than it can through her pool, indicating that there is less friction encountered by the kite when it is moving through air as opposed to water. This explanation aligns with the information provided in the short story, which presents air as the medium with less friction for Sally's kite."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Erik Gunhus said. \\"It appeared that he fainted.\\" Read full CNN.com story [Updated at 11:11 a.m.] Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, is doing better after being escorted from a congressional hearing, he told CNN's Dana Bash. \\"I'm going ok. I just got a little dehydrated,\\" Petraeus told Bash after the congressional hearing was adjourned. \\"I ate a couple of bananas and drank some water. I ddn't eat breakfast this morning.\\" Petraeus was smiling, holding what looked like a cup of water. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morell told Bash that Petraeus had looked pale, but after he began to eat and drink the color returned to his face. Petraeus was appearing at a congressional hearing on progress on the war in Afghanistan, but it was adjourned for the day after the incident. [Updated at 10:57 a.m.] Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, was escorted from a congressional hearing room after apparently choking, but later returned to the hearing to applause. The hearing, however, was called off for the day. [Updated at 10:36 a.m.] The commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan was escorted from a congressional hearing room after apparently choking during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday. Sen. Carl Levin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of CENTCOM, appears to be doing “very much better.\\" He is eating and “probably didn’t have enough to drink before coming in here this morning.” \\"We will make a decision hopefully in a few minutes as to whether we're going to proceed this morning or not,\\" Levin said. [Posted at 10:30 a.m.] Opening a hearing on Afghanistan, Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI), the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, questioned the progress and planning for U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. Opening the hearing, Levin, D-Michigan, questioned the ratio of U.S. and NATO troops to Afghan troops, urging for a faster ramping up of Afghan security forces. \\"Progress towards the goal of Afghans taking the lead in operations has been unsatisfactory. Today operations in Afghanistan are excessively dependent on coalition forces,\\" Levin said. Levin said in the coming campaign in Kandahar, there is a plan to have one Afghan service member for every two international troops. He called instead for a one-to-one ratio, with Afghan forces in the lead. His Republican counterpart, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said in his opening remarks that the key trends were going in a \\"bad direction, perhaps even signaling a mounting crisis.\\" \\"Hoping for success on the arbitrary timeline set by the administration is simply unrealistic,\\" McCain said, calling for the president to say the U.S. will stay in Afghanistan until there is success. Prepared remarks from Petraeus said progress is being made even as the security violence has gotten more intense. The surge of U.S. troops into Afghanistan is ahead of schedule, but the situation on the ground will get more difficult before it gets better, he warned. \\"I noted several months ago ... the going was likely to get harder before it got easier. That has already been the case, as we've seen recently,\\" his prepared remarks said. All 30,000 additional U.S. troops ordered by President Obama last year will be in place in Afghanistan by the end of August, according to Petraeus. Troops had originally been scheduled to be in place by September. In the prepared remarks, he told the congressional panel Tuesday that increasing the size and capability of the struggling Afghan National Army and police forces are back on track, but there is more work to be done. Under Secretary of Defense Michele Flournoy also argued that progress has been made. \\"We are regaining the initiative and the insurgency is beginning to lose momentum,\\" she said in her opening statement, but noted outcome is \\"far from determined.\\" ||||| The general who oversees the war in Iraq and Afghanistan slumped at the witness table Tuesday while testifying at a U.S. Senate hearing, and a spokesman said the four-star officer was likely dehydrated and jet-lagged from his travels. Gen. David Petraeus, 57, revived after a few seconds and left the room under his own power. After about 20 minutes he returned to the hearing room but Sen. Carl Levin, the panel chairman, decided to postpone the hearing. \\"It appears he was maybe a little jet-lagged, dehydrated certainly,\\" said Petraeus' spokesman, Col. Erik Gunhus. Petraeus had finished telling Sen. John McCain that he believed the planned 2011 pullout of U.S. troops in Afghanistan remains on track, and McCain was responding when the room fell silent and aides began crowding around the four-star general. Petraeus, who heads the U.S. Central Command, briefly put his head on the table, then rose, appearing dazed. He stood under his own power and was escorted from the room. Petraeus returned to the room briefly and told the senators he \\"was feeling a little bit lightheaded there.\\" \\"It wasn't Sen. McCain's question,\\" the general added. Gunhus said Petraeus had not been ill recently, although he had just returned from a weeklong overseas trip. Gunhus said Petraeus would continue his day as planned. Last year, Petraeus underwent radiation treatment for the early stages of prostate cancer. He later announced the treatment had been successful. In his lengthy appearances before the Senate and House armed services committees in September 2007 to testify on Iraq, Petraeus was reported to have endured great back pain and got through it with the help of Motrin, a pain-relieving drug. . As the most popular and widely known general of his generation, Petraeus is approaching a new juncture in a career that catapulted him to fame when President George W. Bush sent him to Baghdad in early 2007 to carry out a long-shot \\"surge\\" strategy that arguably rescued Iraq from collapse. The general has had a high-profile career, and many believe he is the leading candidate to become the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Gen.

His days were filled with meetings, code reviews, and putting out fires on the production server. However, this Friday, everything at work was surprisingly under control. John's manager noticed this and decided to give him the next day off as a special reward for his dedication and hard work. John was thrilled to have a day off from work and immediately began planning the perfect Saturday. Instead of sleeping in, he woke up early, brewed a fresh pot of coffee, and enjoyed the peaceful morning breeze as he sat on his porch reading a new mystery novel. Feeling the need for some physical activity, John made his way to a nearby hiking trail, backpack and water bottle in hand. The beautiful landscape of rolling hills and lush green forests captivated him as he hiked the moderately challenging trail. The uphill climb proved to be a great workout, but the panoramic views at the top made it all worthwhile. Shortly after, John felt his stomach rumble. He decided to grab lunch at a highly-rated local sandwich shop.

Cloth bags, plastic airtight bags, or hard-covered soft-lined cases are ideal containers in which to store a dizi. Bamboo flutes are susceptible to expanding or contracting depending on temperature and humidity. Do not place in direct sunlight such as on a windowsill, as this will likely lead to cracked bamboo. If you are taking the dizi outside on a cold day, allow the flute to acclimatize before playing it. Since moisture may gather in the dizi, even if you’ve dried it, fungus spores may start to grow. Use food grade hydrogen peroxide to spot clean the flute to eliminate fungus growth. Some flute owners choose to oil their dizis with almond oil 3-4 times per year. It is best to wait until the flute is completely free of moisture (i.e., waiting a day after playing and drying it) before applying oil.

Sediment becomes loose from the rest of the soil: The faster this process occurs, more sediment would be available, but perhaps less time could result in less weathering, lessening the amount of sediment produced. 2. The sediment rolls down the hill towards a river: If less time occurs, sediment could have less time to roll down the hill. As a result, less sediment might reach the river in a given time frame. Considering these factors, less time might lead to less sediment available and influence the second effect mentioned by reducing the rate at which sediment rolls down the hill towards the river.

Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118 and ruled until 1143. John was a pious and dedicated Emperor who was determined to undo the damage to the empire suffered at the Battle of Manzikert, half a century earlier. Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler at a time when cruelty was the norm. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. During his twenty-five-year reign, John made alliances with the Holy Roman Empire in the West and decisively defeated the Pechenegs at the Battle of Beroia. He thwarted Hungarian and Serbian threats during the 1120s, and in 1130 he allied himself with the German emperor Lothair III against the Norman king Roger II of Sicily.In the later part of his reign, John focused his activities on the East, personally leading numerous campaigns against the Turks in Asia Minor. His campaigns fundamentally altered the balance of power in the East, forcing the Turks onto the defensive, while restoring many towns, fortresses, and cities across the peninsula to the Byzantines. He defeated the Danishmend Emirate of Melitene and reconquered all of Cilicia, while forcing Raymond of Poitiers, Prince of Antioch, to recognise Byzantine suzerainty. In an effort to demonstrate the Emperor's role as the leader of the Christian world, John marched into the Holy Land at the head of the combined forces of the Empire and the Crusader states; yet despite his great vigour pressing the campaign, his hopes were disappointed by the treachery of his Crusader allies. In 1142, John returned to press his claims to Antioch, but he died in the spring of 1143 following a hunting accident.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli . and the situation: Gary, a high school student, is supposed to be studying two different cells under a microscope during his biology class. Gary doesn't like biology class at all though and can't find the motivation to look at the cells in detail. In his homework where students are supposed to write what they observed, Gary simply wrote down the first thing he saw under the microscope which was that Cell A is larger than cell B. It won't get him a great grade, but Gary is hoping it will at least get him a pass on the assignment. Answer the following question: Does Cell A or Cell B have more folds across the membrane? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine whether Cell A or Cell B has more folds across the membrane. The size of a cell (larger or smaller) does not guarantee that one cell will have more folds across the membrane than the other. The presence of folds in a cell membrane, such as microvilli, is generally associated with the cell's function and metabolic activity rather than just the size of the cell. Cells that require greater surface area for efficient transport of materials might have more folds, regardless of whether they are larger or smaller cells. For a more accurate conclusion about the presence of folds across the membranes in Cell A and Cell B, Gary would need to closely examine the cell structure and function under the microscope, and take into account the different properties of the cells, such as their shape, function, and any specific adaptations (e.g., microvilli) to perform their roles effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the books of J.R.R. Tolkein, Bilbo Baggins finds a ring that can make him disappear. Of course, there's also poor Harry Potter, who used his invisibility cloak to hide from danger. Now that you've got some ideas, it's time for the hard part: building the cloak. To do that, you have to give up science fiction and turn to real science. An invisibility cloak has to cheat anything or anyone who might be watching. In order to understand how something can be seen, it's important to understand how we see. Human beings can only see objects that reflect light waves. These waves enter the eye and are then processed by the brain. However, if an object doesn't reflect light, then the waves don't enter the eye, and the brain doesn't process. So building an invisibility cloak is building something that doesn't reflect light. Cummer was part of a team of scientists from Duke University, including David Smith and David Schurig, who built the world's first version of an invisibility cloak. They had been inspired by the work of a British physicist, John Pendry. He in May said that an invisibility cloak was possible and Pendry was not the only one thinking about a disappearing act. At the same time, a Scottish physicist, UIf Leonhardt published a paper on building invisibility equipment. \\"It wasn't easy,\\" says Cummer. \\"As often happens in science and research, it didn't work very well the first time.

These fatty acids have a crucial role in the overall functioning and survival of animals. While some of the options provided can be linked to the utilization of energy stored in saturated fatty acids, the most direct answer is energy storage. Let's examine the other options in the list for a comprehensive understanding: 1. Exercise: During exercise, animals utilize the energy stored in fats, including saturated fatty acids, to fuel their muscles and maintain their activity level. However, the primary usage of saturated fatty acids is not for exercise but rather for energy storage, which can, in turn, supports physical activity. 2. Reproducing: Energy is required for reproduction, and the stored energy in the form of saturated fatty acids may be utilized to support reproductive processes. Like with exercise, though, the main purpose of saturated fatty acids remains energy storage. 3. Solid, liquid, gas: This option seems unrelated to the role of saturated fatty acids in animals, as it refers to states of matter and not any biological function. 4. Keeping the dog warm: This statement is partially correct as stored fat, including saturated fatty acids, helps insulate animals, maintaining their body temperature and keeping them warm. Although their primary function is energy storage, they can assist in temperature regulation for some animals. 5. Oxidation reaction: Oxidation reactions in animals involve the breakdown of fatty acids, including saturated fatty acids, for energy production, but it is not the core purpose of saturated fatty acids, which is energy storage. 6. An organism's body: While saturated fatty acids can be stored in the body for energy, the phrase \\"an organism's body\\" is not a direct answer regarding the use of saturated fatty acids. 7. Plants growth: In general, plants produce and store unsaturated fatty acids instead of saturated fatty acids. However, when it comes to animal life, saturated fatty acids are utilized for energy storage. In summary, saturated fatty acids are used for energy storage in animals. This stored energy can then be utilized in various biological processes, such as exercise, reproduction, and temperature regulation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this article and answer this question The heavy French losses at the Battle of Gaouz encouraged an increase in tribal activity across the south-east of Morocco, threatening the French presence at Boudenib. Poeymirau was forced to withdraw garrisons from outlying posts in the Tafilalt, including that at Tighmart, to concentrate his force and reduce the risk of further disasters. Lyautey authorised only a series of limited offensives, such as the razing of villages and gardens, the primary aim of which was to emphasise French military superiority. The French struggled to move troops through the mountain passes from the Moulouya Valley due to heavy snows and attacks on their columns, and Lyautey, to his embarrassment, was forced to request reinforcements from Algeria. By October the situation had stabilised to the extent that Poeymirau was able to withdraw his troops to Meknes, but a large-scale uprising in January 1919 forced his return. Poeymirau defeated n'Ifrutant in battle at Meski on 15 January, but was seriously wounded in the chest by the accidental explosion of an artillery shell and was forced to hand command to Colonel Antoine Huré. Lyautey then received assistance from Thami El Glaoui, a tribal leader who Lyautey had made Pasha of Marrakesh after the uprising of 1912. El Glaoui owed his increasing wealth to corruption and fraud, which the French tolerated in return for his support. Thus committed to Lyautey's cause, El Glaoui led an army of 10,000 men, the largest Moroccan tribal force ever seen, across the Atlas to defeat anti-French tribesmen in the Dadès Gorges and to reinforce the garrison at Boudenib on 29 January.

A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Bexley is an area of south-east London, England and part of the London Borough of Bexley. It is located east-southeast of Charing Cross. It was an ancient parish in the county of Kent. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bexley increased in population, becoming a municipal borough in 1935 and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. - An architect is someone who plans, designs, and reviews the construction of buildings. To \\"practice architecture\\" means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use. Etymologically, \\"architect\\" derives from the Latin \\"architectus\\", which derives from the Greek \\" (\\"arkhi-\\", chief + \\"tekton\\", builder), i.e., chief builder. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - William Morris (24 March 1834 3 October 1896) was an English textile designer, poet, novelist, translator, and socialist activist. Associated with the British Arts and Crafts Movement, he was a major contributor to the revival of traditional British textile arts and methods of production. His literary contributions helped to establish the modern fantasy genre, while he played a significant role in propagating the early socialist movement in Britain. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - The London Plan is the statutory spatial development strategy for the Greater London area in the United Kingdom that is written by the Mayor of London and published by the Greater London Authority.

Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - The Arts and Crafts movement was an international movement in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between 1880 and 1910, emerging in Japan in the 1920s. It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms, and often used medieval, romantic, or folk styles of decoration. It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial. It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s, and its influence continued among craft makers, designers, and town planners long afterwards. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.

She shot to fame as Hugo Taylor's petite model girlfriend on Made In Chelsea and while she was a lot more reserved than the rest of the E4 cast, Natalie Joel is making headlines now. Natalie has designed a brand new swimwear collection called Joel Swimwear - and showcases her incredibly toned body as she models a selection of pieces. The range is described by the professional model and designer as a premium beachwear label dedicated to sexy, elegant and feminine bikinis. Scroll down for video. New range: Natalie Joel, who shot to fame as Hugo Taylor's girlfriend on Made In Chelsea, has unveiled her debut swimwear collection. Speaking to MailOnline about her new range, the petite star said: 'Swimwear has always been a huge part of my life. I have been an avid collector since my early teens and having had a career as a swimwear and lingerie model has given me such a passion and enthusiasm for design in this field. 'I have always enjoyed the feminine form and feel very privileged that I can help women express themselves on the beach and by the pool. I am also very proud to say Joel Swimwear is a British brand. We are very lucky to have our garments produced in England and also having the campaign shot on an English beach.' Natalie, 23, has drawn on her cultural heritage and says that she's infused the glamour and richness of the Mediterranean with her British passion for the highest possible design craft. 'I have countless sources of inspiration: inspiring people, art, architecture, literature, history, travel, London - I try and put as much of that into my work as I can,' she said. 'Joel is about been elegant and sexy. I love the challenge. It is such a tiny piece of fabric that you have to make an impact; creativity is key.' Professional poser: Natalie works as a model, which is obvious from her latest beach-themed bikini shoot. The debut collection, which is priced at around £140 per two-piece, has seven different colourways and she hopes the 'effortlessly sexy' shape of her designs will become iconic. The designer, who knows how to accentuate her assets, has made sure her bikini bottoms have been cut in a Brazilian style to emphasise the female form, she explains. Natalie says her range is all about supporting a healthy and positive feminine mind and body. 'Strong and confident girls run the world now! I love Jennifer Lawrence and Natalie Portman. They are both fearless and inspirational. If you can dream it do it. It's this attitude that I bring to my design and my own life,' she said. Desribing her own style and how it has matured since her Made In Chelsea days, Natalie said: 'I feel that my own style is a combination of elegance and sexiness. I am not afraid to express myself. Having said that I adore comfortable and well made clothes so I am just as happy in a Balmain dress as I am in well fitted jeans and chunky knitwear. 'I am only 5’2 so I must always be careful to dress correctly so suit my proportions. I am more adventurous now. I was so shy when I was filming MIC and I naturally wore a lot of black. Nowadays I love expressing myself as my confidence has grown.' Research: Natalie says that she analysed hundreds of different colour combinations to find the correct balance to suit a wide variety of skin tones ensuring that clients feel 'happy and effortlessly beautiful at all times' Enviable curves: Natalie showcases her honed physique as she reclines on a beach in the steamy shoot. The star showcases an enviably toned physique in the campaign imagery, so what's her secret? 'I love going to work out classes with my girlfriends and cousins,' she revealed. 'We like to act silly and enjoy our workout in a happy way. I think that’s the best way. Funky Bums, Tums and thighs is a personal favourite. Food wise, I try to eat little and often. My diet focuses on fresh and seasonal produce. I am slightly panicking though as I recently discovered Cronuts. Avoiding them is a real show of restraint. If you have ever tried one, girls, you will know what I mean! 'I try not to deprive myself of anything I am craving though, I think it's important to treat yourself on occasion.' Natalie joined the show in series three as 26-year-old Hugo's girlfriend. The pair broke up in June but were seen a few weeks later kissing outside trendy hotspot, The Chiltern Firehouse. Speaking about the Taylor Morris sunglasses designer, she said: 'He adores my range. We have a little bet on to see which will be the best seller. As usual, he always thinks he is correct.' So will the young designer be gracing our screens again any time soon? 'Right now I am so content with life. I have been given a wonderful opportunity to express my creativity and also demonstrate my business skill. 'If MIC came back around I would never say never but having a fashion start up takes a lot of time and focus.'

Question: Where does Thomas wait for death? Movie title: Queen of the Vampires Movie plot: The Rape of the Vampire[edit] Four sisters living in an old chÃ¢teau are convinced that they are vampires. One believes she was raped by the villagers years before, and is blind. Another is afraid of sunlight. They all react violently to crucifixes. The sisters are being manipulated by a sinister old man who alternates between admonishing them to kill newcomers that threaten their exposure, and groping their breasts. The four seem to worship a bestial idol in the forest who speaks to them with a disembodied voice. The newcomers are three Parisians, Thomas (Bernard Letrou), Brigitte (Solange Pradle) and Marc (Marquis Polho), who have come to the countryside to cure the sisters of their so-called illness. They do not believe that the sisters are vampires, and don't believe in vampires at all. Thomas is a psychoanalyist, determined to cure them from their madness. He believes it has been induced by the superstitious villagers, who have driven the confused women insane with their religious symbols and persecution. He tries to convince them that crucifixes and sunlight won't harm them, and that the blind sister can actually see. He takes all of this as proof that their vampirism is all in their minds. When one of the sisters fall for Thomas' charms, the old man orders another sister to kill him, Brigitte and Marc. When this fails, he unleashes the peasants, who brutally murder all the women they can find, which also includes Brigitte. Thomas asks one of the sisters to bite him to prove her wrong, and discovers she is, in fact, a vampire, and that he was misled by his own preconceptions. The two flee to the beach and are gunned down by Marc, who is distraught by Brigitte's death at the hands of the peasants. Queen of the Vampires/The Vampire Woman[edit] The vampire queen (Jacqueline Sieger) is introduced. She briefly arrives by boat to the beach where the dead couple lies. She commands her hooded cohort to grab the old man and pin him down to the slab of rock, then proceeds to sacrifice him, and licks the knife...

Hemophilia results when a gene fails to produce the protein needed for the blood to clot ,or change from a liquid to a solid .The fault gene is passed from parents to children .People with hemophilia suffer uncontrolled bleeding .This can result in pain , tissue swelling and permanent damage to joints and muscles. One in every ten thousand males has the most common kind of hemophilia .It is extremely rare for females to have it. Patients can be treated with the missing clotting substance .They generally can lead normal lives.

Pick the right spot: Decide where you want the hole on your clothing, make sure it's not too close to the seams or edges. 2. Gather tools: Get a pair of sharp scissors that are just the right size for the job, a marker or chalk to mark the spot, and a ruler or a piece of cardboard for measuring. 3. Prepare the clothing: Lay the clothing flat on a clean surface, like a table, and smooth out any wrinkles or folds. 4. Mark the spot: Use the marker or chalk to draw a small circle or oval where you want the hole to be, and make sure it's not too big for what you need. 5. Put a barrier: Place a piece of cardboard or a cutting mat under the spot you want to cut, so you don't damage any other part of the clothing or the surface beneath it. 6. Cut the hole: Using the scissors, carefully and slowly cut along the marked line until you have a hole in your clothing. You can start by making a small snip and then continue cutting along the line. 7. Clean up the edges: If there are any rough or jagged edges after cutting, carefully trim them using the scissors. You can also use a small nail file to smooth out the edges if needed.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: You could get dessert at the same restaurant where you eat, or go to a different place to wind down the night. No matter what type of date you had, it's nice to incorporate something sweet at the end. It is one last thoughtful touch that shows your date you put a lot of thought into planning the evening. Plus, it gives you the opportunity to share a dessert, just like in the movies. Going out for ice cream is a nice way to end a date during the summer. If you're cooking at home, consider serving something with chocolate. It tends to be a favorite. If your date does not have a sweet tooth, you could go to a bar to grab a nightcap instead. Of course, if you or your date do not drink or are underage, this is not a good idea. Sometimes an individual cannot have rich desserts, especially those with diabetes. Or the person may have allergies, food sensitivities, medical conditions, or whatnot. Just be flexible and understanding. The end of a date can be a little awkward if you have not thought about it beforehand. Put some forethought into your plans. Are you going home separately after dinner? Do you plan to drop your date off after you're finished with dessert? Perhaps you may like to invite the person back to your house. Think about the logistics so you avoid that awkward “what now” moment after an otherwise perfect date. Have your house ready in case you end up there. Have it clean and presentable. A kitchen with last night's dishes stacked in the sink and your dirty laundry in a pile on the floor will likely make a negative impression. End the date at a good time. Ending a date on the right note is tricky. In general, end it at a logical moment. For example, after the late movie ends, offer to drive her back to her place. It is generally better to end the date a little on the too early side than too late. Kiss, hug, or more? At the end of a date, especially a first one, generally a gesture will effectively end the date. This is sometimes a very awkward moment. Generally in a heterosexual date, the girl should decide what she is comfortable with offering the guy as a gesture. If something goes awry, remain calm and work towards having a good date anyway. A person who is inflexible, stresses out, and becomes irritable in the face of the unexpected will not be very successful with dates. In fact, dealing with the unexpected in a creative, positive way can make a big impression. Summary:","completion":"Going on a date can be fun, and it's nice to have something sweet at the end, like sharing a dessert or getting ice cream. If your date doesn't like sweets, you can try a different place to finish the night. It's important to think about what you'll do after the date so it's not awkward. Make sure your house is clean if you invite your date over. End the date at a good time, and give a hug or a kiss if you both feel comfortable.

One hundred and fifty-four of these stores earmarked for closure were in the U.S. (150 Walmart U.S. stores, 115 Walmart International stores, and 4Sams Clubs). Ninety-five percent of these U.S. stores were located, on average, 10 miles from another Walmart store. The 269 stores represented less than 1percent of global square footage and revenue for the company. All 102 locations of Walmart Express, which had been in a pilot program since 2011, were included in the closures. Walmart planned to focus on \\"strengthening Supercenters, optimizing Neighborhood Markets, growing the e-commerce business and expanding pickup services for customers\\". In fiscal 2017, the company plans to open between 50 and 60 Supercenters, 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets, 7 to 10 Sams Clubs, and 200 to 240 international locations. At the end of fiscal 2016, Walmart opened 38 Supercenters and relocated, expanded or converted 21 discount stores into Supercenters, for a total of 59 Supercenters, and opened 69 Neighborhood Markets, 8 Sams Clubs, and 173 international locations, and relocated, expanded or converted 4 locations for a total of 177 international locations.

A: Answer:","completion":"(4). tissues Muscles and skin are examples of tissues, consisting of specialized cells. Tissues are a group of similar cells that work together to carry out a specific function within the body. In the case of muscles, the primary function is contraction, which enables movement and the maintenance of posture. Muscle tissue is composed of muscle fibers (specialized cells) that contain the protein filaments actin and myosin. These filaments interact with one another, resulting in the shortening and lengthening of muscle fibers and, subsequently, the contraction and relaxation of the muscles as a whole. Skin, on the other hand, serves as the body's protective barrier, shielding it from external environmental factors, such as physical injury, harmful chemicals, and microorganisms. The skin also plays a crucial role in temperature regulation, sensation, and the synthesis of vitamin D.

The name Montana comes from the Spanish word Montaña, meaning \\"mountain\\", or more broadly, \\"mountainous country\\". Montaña del Norte was the name given by early Spanish explorers to the entire mountainous region of the west. The name Montana was added to a bill by the United States House Committee on Territories, which was chaired at the time by Rep. James Ashley of Ohio, for the territory that would become Idaho Territory. The name was successfully changed by Representatives Henry Wilson (Massachusetts) and Benjamin F. Harding (Oregon), who complained that Montana had \\"no meaning\\". When Ashley presented a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be carved out of Idaho, he again chose Montana Territory. This time Rep. Samuel Cox, also of Ohio, objected to the name. Cox complained that the name was a misnomer given that most of the territory was not mountainous and that a Native American name would be more appropriate than a Spanish one. Other names such as Shoshone were suggested, but it was eventually decided that the Committee on Territories could name it whatever they wanted, so the original name of Montana was adopted.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the character whose next fight is interrupted by a coyote? ? Hector Villa is a young Mexican national and border-crossing migrant and worker with boxing abilities mirroring his late father's. He could perhaps be good if he learned to think along with his pummeling. Despite all of this, Hector is a hard worker on a Texas farm who does what he can to provide for his ailing mother which includes pulling in a few side dollars from small-time, illegal gambling fights. Tito, a \\"coyote\\" (a person who helps smuggle people across the border) spends his days as a snake catcher but at night, helps smuggle immigrants across the border. After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough. Corralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria. It soon becomes known that they grew up together as kids and it also becomes apparent that Hector dislikes her (mostly because of her sarcastic teasing). Tito hands Hector medicine for his mother and the three head back to the farm where they all work. After settling all of the immigrants in, Maria goes into her own suite with Hector and makes herself at home despite Hector being less than welcoming. Hector then goes to his mother Rosa to give her the medicine but it becomes apparent that she is getting worse. Hector begs her to not go out to the fields the next day but she declines stating \\"No work, no pay\\". She scolds Hector for fighting to make money and reminds him that a fighter's lifestyle gave his father nothing. Maria walks in and gets reacquainted with Hector's mother who comments on how much she has grown and how beautiful she has gotten after nine years apart.

I came here after my Hawaiian Dinner and not far away from the Maryland Parkway Plaza. The area is not the greatest being located on Tropicana Ave and Maryland Parkway (east from the Las Vegas Blvd-strip). The cupcake place would do much better near the Las Vegas Blvd-strip.

Question: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.

Unbeknownst to the people in his village, Noah possesses a mysterious power that allows him to communicate with magical creatures, which has sparked curiosity about his origins. The village elders tell tales of a mighty creature known as Eirwen, who once fell into a deep hole and perished, leaving a lingering aura that gifted select individuals with supernatural abilities. Noah, believing his powers are a result of this legacy, sets out to unravel the mystery and understand the true nature of his gift. Accompanied by his loyal friends, Rosa the archer and Emrys the sorcerer, Noah and his companions traverse dangerous lands, encountering various mythical creatures, each with their own unique abilities and stories. During their journey, they learn that Eirwen was a wise and compassionate being, who somewhat resembles Noah in both demeanor and appearance. As the trio delves deeper into the story, they discover the legend of an ancient cavern, known as the Abyss of Shadows, said to house a portal that connects the world of the living to the world of the dead. The group believes that this is where Eirwen met its tragic end, and they dare to venture into the cavern to pay their respects and gain insight into Noah's past. Once inside the cavern, they face a series of life-threatening challenges that test their courage, wits, and determination.

Look for a product advertised as “anti-breakage,” “strengthening,” “restorative,” or “repair.” To apply, wet your hair in the shower and pour a coin-sized amount of shampoo into your palm. Massage it into your scalp and roots, then rinse well under cold water. These shampoos will help to seal your split ends and thicken your hair while keeping it shiny. Make sure that you rinse your hair thoroughly both before and after you apply the shampoo. Look for a conditioner that includes strengthening proteins and that’s specialized for your hair type. Pour a dollop into your palm and smooth it over your strands, from about mid-length to tips. Rinse off with cool water. once a week to renew and repair your hair. While your hair is still wet, rub a quarter-sized amount of deep conditioner between your hands. Gently massage it into your hair from mid-length to tips. Then, pin your hair back and let it soak in for 10-30 minutes. You can place a shower cap over your head to keep the deep conditioner in place. To save time, wash and deep condition your hair at the beginning of your shower. Leave the conditioner in place while you wash your body and rinse it out at the end of your shower using cool water. Look for a deep conditioner that matches your hair type, whether that’s fine, thick, natural, or curly. The usual terry-cloth towels can create friction that damages your hair, causing split ends. Blot your hair dry with a microfiber towel instead, which soaks up excess moisture without leaving your hair too dry. Avoid rubbing your hair with the towel, which can cause breakage as well. Washing your hair with “hard water”—water that contains minerals like chlorine magnesium and calcium—can damage your hair cuticles, which can weaken your hair and cause breakage. Installing a simple filtered showerhead can wash these minerals out, keeping your hair strong, soft, and shiny. You can buy filtered showerheads online and in home stores. They can range in price from 30-100. To find out whether you have hard water in your home, check your filter for a white film. This is left behind by minerals during evaporation, indicating that you have hard water. You can also search local news sources for information on local hard water. Search “[your area] hard water.” Over-washing your hair can strip it of natural oils, leaving it more vulnerable to damage and breakage. Depending on your hair type, try to wash it as little as possible—3 times a week is a good standard to shoot for.

So: -64 + 20 = -22*j - 20 + 20 This simplifies to: -44 = -22*j Now, to isolate j, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -22: (-44) / (-22) = (-22*j) / (-22) This simplifies to: 2 = j So the solution for the equation -55 - 9 = -22*j - 20 is j = 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Authorities have stated that it is not in the 'public interest' for these young boys to remain in the community at-large, much to the dismay of their school and the people who know them. The boys' schoolmates have come together to take a stand, starting a petition – \\"Bring our boys back home\\" – to gather support for their friends. Step 1: Describe the event and the background of the asylum-seeking boys. Two 16-year-old asylum-seekers were unexpectedly removed from their homes at night, causing distress and concern within their local community. The boys had been living in the area as they awaited a decision on their asylum cases, seeking refuge from their precarious past in their home countries. Step 2: Describe why authorities took this action. The authorities have claimed that it was not in the 'public interest' for the two teenagers to reside within the community. However, this decision has sparked uproar among friends, schoolmates, and staff who know these boys personally. Step 3: Discuss the boys' positive attributes, as shared by their principal. The school's principal described the two asylum-seeking students as 'intelligent' and 'incredibly loyal' members of their community. They were known to be diligent in pursuing their education and contributed positively to the life of the school. Step 4: Highlight the community's response to the situation. Outraged by this abrupt action against their friends, the boys' schoolmates have banded together to initiate a petition titled, \\"Bring our boys back home.\\" The petition aims to demonstrate support for the well-being of these young people, urging the relevant authorities to reconsider their decision and return the students to their community. Step 5: Discuss the potential wider implications of this case. This case highlights the ongoing challenges faced by asylum seekers, even in parts of the world where they seek protection and opportunity. The upheaval endured by these two young boys raises pertinent questions about the treatment and rights afforded to vulnerable persons in such situations. Conclusion: The removal of the two 16-year-old asylum seekers from their homes has triggered a wave of support from their community, particularly their schoolmates who have started a petition to advocate for their return. Impassioned by the sense of injustice and concern for the welfare of their friends, the community remains dedicated to ensuring that these boys are not forgotten and that their rights are upheld. The hope is that, through their collective efforts, these young people will be reunited with their supportive community and given the chance to continue pursuing a brighter future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is named for one of the newcomers? , can you please find it? Before settlers moved into the basin, it consisted mainly of upland and wetland forests in which Native Americans fished, hunted, and foraged. Evidence suggests that people lived in the northern Oregon Cascade Range as early as 10,000 years ago. By 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, settlements in the Clackamas River basin, adjacent to the Johnson Creek watershed, had moved to the river's lower floodplain. The area was the home of the Clackamas Indians, a subgroup of the Chinookan speakers who lived in the Columbia River Valley from Celilo Falls to the Pacific Ocean. The Clackamas lands included the lower Willamette River from Willamette Falls at what became Oregon City to its confluence with the Columbia River and reached into the foothills of the Cascades. When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800 people living in 11 villages. Epidemics of smallpox, malaria, and measles reduced this population to 88 by 1851, and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands, including Johnson Creek.By the middle of the 19th century, the European American newcomers had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.","completion":"Johnson Creek, located in the basin that was once the home to the Clackamas Indians, is named after one of the newcomers, William Johnson. William Johnson was a European American settler who arrived in the mid-19th century. Along with others, he began to alter the landscape by removing vegetation, felling trees, filling wetlands, and establishing farms along the creek. He settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland in the year 1846 and ran a water-powered sawmill. Consequently, the creek was named in his honor. This creek and its surrounding developments also served as the foundation for emerging communities like Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley which took form along a transportation line built in the area in 1903."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the two structures built by Dodson? ? Ricketts Glen State Park is in five townships in three counties. After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber.

The organizer of the campaign says singing is a safe, simple and social activity that everyone can enjoy. \\"Singing is linked to long life, stress reduction, and general health protection. It also brings a great amount of happiness. It is impossible to sing well with a long face because it affects your pitch .\\" Professor Graham Welch, who leads the International Music Education Research Centre at the University of London, has spent more than 30 years studying the effects of singing. He says that singing is a form of exercise. It means we're also having a strong aerobic activity when we're singing, which results in increasing the feeling of pleasure while decreasing that of stress. \\"And communal singing--like in a singing group, a church service or even a singsong in the pub--helps improve our sense of self-respect.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who did the tourists regard as curiosities? In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

The wrong Republican to pick a fight with Facebook Thune is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee – which, among other jurisdictions, oversees technology, communications and Internet issues. “If true, these allegations compromise Facebook’s ‘open culture’ and mission ‘to make the world more open and connected,’” Thune wrote Tuesday in a sharply worded letter to Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, demanding that employees responsible for Trending Topics brief the Senate committee by May 24. That’s not a bad line, but given the circumstances, the Senate GOP’s bizarre sense of priorities is the least of the troubles here. Right off the bat, it’s difficult to understand how Congress has any oversight responsibilities towards a private social-media company. I haven’t the foggiest idea if Facebook puts its thumb on the scales to help the left with Trending Topics – the evidence is thin, at best, based on the word of anonymous contractors – but let’s say for the sake of conversation that the allegations are 100% accurate. Then what? How, exactly, would federal lawmakers justify intervening in Facebook’s ideological practices? Indeed, since when does the Senate care about media companies that may or may not have political preferences? John Thune says he’s concerned about Facebook’s “culture” and the integrity of its mission statement, but again, how in the world is that any of his business? Isn’t the Republican model based on the idea that the free market should decide and if online consumers don’t like Facebook’s “culture,” we can take our clicks elsewhere? He added, “Giving power to a few to regulate fairness in the media is a recipe for disaster on the scale that George Orwell so aptly envisioned.” And yet, here we are, watching the exact same senator use his office to demand answers from a media company accused of being insufficiently “fair” towards conservative content. If I were an attorney for Facebook, I’d encourage Thune and the Senate Commerce Committee to go jump in a lake.

Thune, who is the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, demanding that employees responsible for Trending Topics brief the Senate committee by May 24. The author questions the role of Congress in overseeing a private social-media company like Facebook and criticizes Thune's actions as contradictory to the Republican model of free market and non-intervention in private businesses.

What are some of the best street foods?","completion":"No, these two questions do not have the exact same meaning. The first question, \\"What is the best street food in Bogotá?\\" is very specific. This is requesting a singular answer on what might be considered the superior or most preferred street food that one can find in Bogotá, the capital city of Colombia. If you were to answer this question, you would likely highlight a single street food item that is really popular among locals and tourists in Bogotá, perhaps something like an arepa or an empanada which are well-known Colombian street foods. It assumes that there is a definitive 'best' street food in Bogotá that can be objectively determined, which might not always be the case as it can largely depend on individual tastes and preferences. The second question, \\"What are some of the best street foods?\\" is generic in nature and does not specify a location. It asks for a list of top street foods from potentially anywhere in the world. This could include hot dogs from New York, pad thai from Bangkok, falafels from the streets of Jerusalem, tacos from Mexico City, and so on. The question is not specific to Bogotá, Colombia, or any other location. The answer would offer a wider view of culinary delights from different countries and cultures, and might characterize 'best' as widely recognized, popular, or even emblematic street foods from all corners of the world. Both questions are about ranking street food, but the scope and spatial context of each question are quite different. The first question is focused on city-specific street cuisine, while the second question is more open-ended and broader, encompassing multicultural street food options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Waffle House Is Winning the World Cup on Twitter, One Typo at a Time From the moment the first World Cup match kicked off last month, brands have been vying for any and all opportunities to turn the soccer games into a real-time marketing moment. The news that the U.S. team would play Belgium pretty much served that opportunity to Waffle House on a platter. On Monday, the U.S. waffle chain decided to show support for its home country ahead of Tuesday's match against Belgium with a so-called \\"boycott\\" of Belgian waffles. A tweet announcing their war against Belgian waffles has since been retweeted nearly 15,000 times. We don't believe in Belgium waffles — Waffle House (@WaffleHouse) June 30, 2014 Unlike other brands on Twitter, Waffle House didn't dress up its tweet with a photoshopped image, insert ample amounts of branding or link to something on its website. Waffle House didn't even proofread it. (As Twitter users quickly pointed out, it should say \\"Belgian,\\" not \\"Belgium.\\") The mastermind behind that tweet is Meghan Irwin, who joined Waffle House in early 2012 as a communication specialist and maintains its various social media accounts with the help of one other PR representative. Some might call her Waffle House's social media strategist, but as she made perfectly clear, Waffle House doesn't really have a social media strategy. \\"I think we like to keep things very organic,\\" Irwin told Mashable in an interview. \\"I think it takes away from our brand's personality if we try to put too much strategy or too much thought into something.\\" And so it was that Irwin awoke on Monday morning and decided to riff on the many \\"I believe\\" tweets around the games with one saying it does not, in fact, believe in Belgium/Belgian waffles. \\"It was how I was feeling yesterday morning,\\" she says of her thinking for the tweet. In truth, there was a little more to it than that. The idea for the tweet originated from a tweet directed at Waffle House asking its opinion on Belgian waffles after the U.S. officially advanced to play Belgium. We dominate them RT @GBHunting: . @WaffleHouse what's your opinion on Belgian waffles? — Waffle House (@WaffleHouse) June 26, 2014 Heading into the World Cup, Irwin says she simply wanted to use the Waffle House Twitter account to tweet about \\"supporting America\\" and, of course, to raise awareness about Waffle House.

Movie title: On the Other Hand, Death Movie plot: Private Investigator Donald Strachey is under the impression he is tailing an unfaithful housewife for evidence that she is cheating on her husband, but it turns out that the \\"housewife\\" is actually an undercover cop who promptly arrests him. After six hours of questioning the cop, Officer Gina Santer, and Detective 'Bub' Bailey let him go, but instruct him to turn over any information he obtains on the client that claimed Santer was his wife. Most of the info on file at Strachey Investigations about this mystery client is fake. Meanwhile, at the home of Dorothy 'Dot' Fisher and her partner Edith Strong, Dorothy chases out a vandal after he breaks into their home and spray paints homophobic graffiti on their wall. The next day, Andrew McWhirter, close friend of Fisher and Strongâand Timmy Callhan's former boyfriendâintroduce Donald and Timmy to the lesbian couple after a contentious school board meeting at which Dorothy, a guidance counselor at the school, is placed on paid leave due to objections from a homophobic parent whose gay son Derek has been counseled by Fisher. The two are invited by the middle-aged women and houseguest Andrew back to their home in Hollis, but the socialization is interrupted when the returning vandal throws a brick through the window. Strachey chases him back to his car, but the license plate is obscured by mud. The following day, Kenny gives Don pictures he obtained of the mysterious \\"client\\", and his e-mail address, the one piece of info he offered about himself that is at least a marginal lead.

As he delves deeper into the case, he discovers connections between the various incidents and suspects involved. Throughout the movie, Strachey interacts with a variety of characters, but it is during his conversations with Edith Strong that he begins to understand the true motives behind the increasingly dangerous acts of vandalism and threats. Edith, along with her partner, Dorothy \\"Dot\\" Fisher, are being targeted by a shadowy figure attempting to force them to sell their home to a powerful real estate company, Millipond Realty.

Bernard Mathew Leadon III (pronounced led-un; born July 19, 1947) is an American musician and songwriter, best known as a founding member of the Eagles. Prior to the Eagles, he was a member of three pioneering and highly influential country rock bands: Hearts & Flowers, Dillard & Clark, and the Flying Burrito Brothers. He is a multi-instrumentalist (guitar, banjo, mandolin, steel guitar, dobro) coming from a bluegrass background. He introduced elements of this music to a mainstream audience during his tenure with the Eagles. Leadon was born in Minneapolis, one of ten siblings, to Dr. Bernard Leadon Jr. and Ann Teresa (nee Sweetser) Leadon, devout Roman Catholics. His father was an aerospace engineer and nuclear physicist whose career moved the family around the U.S. The family enjoyed music and, at an early age, Bernie developed an interest in folk and bluegrass music. He eventually mastered the 5-string banjo, mandolin and acoustic guitar. As a young teen he moved with his family to San Diego, where he met fellow musicians Ed Douglas and Larry Murray of the local bluegrass outfit, the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers. The Barkers proved a breeding ground for future California country rock talent, including shy, 18-year-old mandolin player Chris Hillman, with whom Leadon maintained a lifelong friendship. Augmented by banjo player (and future Flying Burrito Brother) Kenny Wertz, the Squirrel Barkers eventually asked Leadon to join the group, upon Wertz's joining the Air Force in 1963. His stint in the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers did not last long. In late 1963, his family once again relocated to Gainesville, Florida, when his father accepted a position as Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Florida. Leadon attended Gainesville High School, where he met classmate and future Eagles lead guitarist Don Felder, whose band, the Continentals, had just lost guitarist Stephen Stills. Upon Leadon's joining the group, rechristened Maundy Quintet, they gigged locally, even sharing the bill with future Gainesville legend Tom Petty and his early band the Epics (a band that also included Bernie's brother, musician Tom Leadon). A call from ex-Squirrel Barker Larry Murray in 1967, to join his fledgling psychedelic country-folk group, Hearts & Flowers, was enticing enough for Leadon to return to California, where he soon became involved with the burgeoning L.A. folk/country rock scene. Leadon recorded one album with the band, their second release Of Horses, Kids, and Forgotten Women for Capitol Records. The record was a local hit but failed to make much of a dent on the national album charts. Discouraged, the group disbanded the following year.

A: Choose your answer from: 1). mutations. 2). fertilization. 3). lesions. 4). meiosis. Answer:","completion":"A: When a sperm penetrates the egg, it triggers the egg to complete meiosis. So, the correct answer is 4). meiosis. Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that occurs in sexually reproducing organisms, during the production of sex cells or gametes (sperm and egg cells). It results in the formation of haploid cells that have half the number of chromosomes compared to the diploid cells in the organism's body. In the egg cell, meiosis starts during the female's embryonic development but stops at the Meiosis I stage (specifically the prophase I phase). The egg cell remains in this stage until the female reaches sexual maturity. It is only during ovulation that the egg cell resumes meiosis I, divides, and forms two daughter cells: a larger secondary oocyte and a small polar body. However, the secondary oocyte does not complete meiosis II unless it encounters a sperm cell during fertilization. Upon sperm penetration, it triggers a series of biochemical events that make the egg re-enter the meiotic cell cycle, complete meiosis II, and divide into a mature ovum and another polar body. The successful completion of meiosis due to sperm penetration gives the fertilized egg, now called a zygote, a full set of chromosomes – half from the mother and half from the father. This is essential for proper embryonic development and the formation of a genetically unique offspring. In conclusion, sperm penetration triggers the egg to complete meiosis, which allows the formation of a diploid zygote and the initiation of embryonic development, leading to the birth of a new organism."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Played under cloudy skies, the game was also notable in that the weather conditions heralded the approach of Hurricane Sandy, a storm set to make an unprecedented landfall in nearby New Jersey. In the first quarter, the Falcons drew first blood as Matt Ryan found Drew Davis for a 15-yard pass to make the score 7-0. The team increased their lead with Ryan finding Jason Snelling to make it 14-0. In the 2nd quarter, the Eagles would get on the board with LeSean McCoy's 2-Yard run to make it 14-7. However, the Falcons responded with Ryan's 63-yard TD pass to Julio Jones to make it 21-7. The Falcon would increase their lead before halftime with Matt Bryant's 43-yard field goal to make it 24-7. The Eagles would try to rally in the 3rd quarter with a 33-yard field goal from Alex Henry to shorten the lead to 24-10, but the Falcons pulled away as Bryant would kick a 29-yard field goal to make it 27-10. In the 4th quarter, Bryant increased the Falcons' lead with a 30-yard field goal to make the score 30-10. The Eagles tried to rally as Michael Vick found McCoy to make the score 30-17. However, the Eagles were unable to try to attempt a comeback win as the team dropped to 3-4 on the season.

The beach, naturally. There are hundreds of miles of beaches on the twenty islands of Hawaii. These islands cover 1,600 miles and are about 2,300 miles west of California. Most of them are covered with fine white sand. They are thought to be among the finest beaches in the world. Another wonderful thing about the beaches of Hawaii is the water temperature. The year-round average temperature of the water at the famous Waikiki Beach is 230C! The same is true of air temperature. In fact, there are no real seasons in Hawaii. There is a difference of only two or three degrees between the hottest day of summer and the coldest day of winter. That's why the Hawaiians don't have a word for weather in their language. Perhaps the nicest thing about Hawaiian beaches are the waves. The earliest settlers in Hawaii, the Polynesians, quickly learned how much fun it was to ride the waves. They developed a sport which is now very popular on the islands called body surfing.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 14:17 EST, 13 August 2012. |. UPDATED:. 15:15 EST, 13 August 2012. A bankrupt Pakistani man and his son managed to set up a business and cheat their local community out of almost £50,000 despite being in the UK illegally, a court heard. Siyed Asem, 58, and his son Syed Bukhari, 25, ran a corner shop and operated a Western Union money transfer service offering ‘excellent rates’ on transactions. But more than 20 customers who used the service to send money to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, were left thousands of pounds out of pocket. Father and son partnership: Bankrupt Siyed Asem, left, and his son Syed Bukhari, right, together stole nearly £50,000 from their customers who had requested for the cash to be transferred to India. Jailing father and son for two years. each, Judge Jamie Tabor QC described their offences against their own. Asian community in Gloucester’s Barton area as ‘despicable.’ Judge. Tabor said it was ‘extraordinary’ that the men had been able to run a. shop and set up the money transfer business when they were both illegal. overstayers and Asem was bankrupt. Asem. came to the UK on a visitor’s permit eight years ago and never left. His son was in the UK on a student permit which would not allow him to. work or run a business. Gloucester crown court heard that the service operated legitimately at first but the pair soon started stealing the money - which amounted to a total of £48,206. One of their customers, retired Khadijabbi Mulla, lost £1,000 he requested to be transferred to India to pay for his operation there. Prosecutor Lisa Hennessy said: 'He was told it would take 8 weeks, which would take him close to the date of his operation. 'When he got to India he still had not received the promised PIN number to access his money. 'He. contacted a friend in Gloucester to ask him to complain and the message. he got back was that he would get a refund when he got back. Jailed: Siyed Asem and Syed Bukhari were sentenced to two years in prison at Gloucester Crown Court. 'He has never received a refund - as he puts it he has just had lots of excuses and delays.' Mrs Hennessy said another victim of the con, Fatima Kazi, paid the men £1,500 to be transferred to India to help fund the building of a mosque in her late father’s memory. Mrs Hennessy continued: 'The money never arrived.' She detailed how other customers lost money in similar transactions - Runara Begum and her husband lost almost £5,500 which was supposed to be going to Bangladesh; Rashid Salloo lost £1,000 destined for India; Yusuf Chand transferred £7,000 to India in two transactions but it never arrived. There were other customers who had transferred significant sums and either received nothing or were given very small refunds, she added. Mrs Hennessy said all the offences occurred within a few months between late 2010 and early 2011 after Bukhari applied in October 2010 to become an agent for Finit UK, a Western Union money transfer company. The application was granted and he was approved after ‘various checks had been carried out’. Mrs Hennessy told the court the fact that both men were illegal immigrants didn't appear to 'have come up on the checks'. She added that they also failed to notice that Asem had been made bankrupt in 2008. Fraud: The pair set up a Western Union money transfer service but stole thousands of pounds from customers that was meant to be sent to India. Bukhari admitted 11 offences of fraud - of masking false representations to customers that his money transfer business was in a sound financial position and that money would be transferred at a preferential rate of exchange - between January and March 2011. Asem admitted 12 similar charges. Mrs Hennessy said Bukhari was responsible for £33,688 of the total fraud and Asem £14,518. Sabhia Pathan, defending, said Bukhari had come to Britain legitimately to study to be a chartered accountant but had started working at McDonald’s to earn some money and then had opened the shop with his father. Asem had trusted his son’s business acumen and joined him in the venture but the money transfer service had quickly gone wrong because they were offering such good exchange rates that they made no profit, she said. Ms Pathan said that Western Union had checked only Bukhari’s credit rating before allowing him to set up the service. She added that both men knew they were facing deportation after their sentences and Asem was fearful of going back to Pakistan because he has health problems which are better treated here. Despite his status he has been getting free medication, she said. Jailing the men, Judge Tabor said: 'Over a period of three months you stole just under £50,000 from many members of your local community. 'That money was entrusted to you to transfer abroad for a variety of purposes including allowing people to have operations and to help with a mosque and other charitable tasks. 'People trusted you, especially you, father, because of the seniority that you held. I accept that when you started this business in November you ran it legitimately for a short period of time. 'But by the middle of January you were nothing more or less than confidence tricksters. You have done considerable damage to your community and you know it. 'These were despicable offences.' He told them police will now investigate their finances to see what can be confiscated from them under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Highlights:","completion":"1.

The reviewer suggests that the movie's themes of possessive love, destructiveness, and moral decadence are overshadowed by stylistic choices focused on designer gowns, shots of the Riviera, expensive cars, and music-and-dancing interludes. The reviewer seems to criticize the movie for prioritizing style over substance, mentioning that the dark plot and glitzy style go in opposite directions, which indicates their dissatisfaction with the movie's execution. Additionally, the reviewer questions whether this movie was a model for \\"The Talented Mister Ripley\\" and if there is any affinity between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon. This questioning could indicate that the reviewer is trying to understand the connection between two seemingly unrelated movies, further demonstrating their perplexity at the movie under review.

The article below was originally published at Time.com The price of gas is plummeting like a bungee jumper without a rope. A majority of Americans are paying less than 2 per gallon for gas for the first time since 2009, and the ever-cheapening fuel it helping put more money in consumers’ pockets and bolster the economy. About 6 in 10 U.S. gas stations are selling a gallon of gas for under 2, according to AAA. The average gas price has dropped for a record 120 consecutive days to less than 2.04 a gallon. That’s the cheapest average in nearly six years. American consumers will benefit immensely this year from the drop: The Department of Energy predicted last week that the average American household would spend about 750 less for gasoline in 2015 compared with last year. “It’s crazy,” Michael Noel, an economics professor at Texas Tech University who studies oil and gasoline prices, told the Associated Press of the fuel price drop. “But for consumers it’s very, very good.” Lower fuel prices will also likely help the U.S. economy grow significantly this year. The World Bank expects the American economy to grow 3.2% this year, compared with 2.4% in 2014, and some forecasts are even higher. The downside? Oil drillers and refineries in states like Texas and North Dakota are likely to suffer from lower gas prices. Layoffs of thousands of workers have begun in recent weeks.

Question: Given the background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. and the situation: Matt and his brother Jesse are twins. They look almost identical. If it weren't for the fact that Jesse has a slightly darker skin complexion you wouldn't be able to tell them apart. In fact one year Matt was out in the sun for a long time and picked up a bit of a tan so they actually did look exactly alike. Answer the following question: Which persons melanocytes produce more melanin, Matt or Jesse? Answer:","completion":"Jesse's melanocytes produce more melanin. Justification: From the background information, it's mentioned that \\"the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin\\". So applying this knowledge to the situation, it's known that Jesse has slightly darker skin complexion compared to Matt. It means Jesse's melanocytes produce more melanin than Matt's. The temporary tan Matt got from sun exposure doesn't permanently impact the melanin production, as it's stated that melanin production is largely influenced by heredity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One such company, the iconic British brand Littlewoods, has done just that: it has evolved from its traditional mail-order catalogue origins into a thriving online retail business. The digital transformation has allowed Littlewoods to leave behind \\"the shackles of the catalogue\\" and flourish in the era of e-commerce. One significant contributing factor to the brand's success is the growing trend in mobile shopping. In this article, we will explore how this shift benefits Littlewoods and the broader retail landscape. The Move to Online Shopping For decades, Littlewoods was known for its large mail-order catalogues that allowed customers to browse through endless pages of products from the comfort of their own homes. However, the advent of the internet and the increasing dominance of e-commerce have led to a steady decline in catalogue-based sales. Recognizing the need to adapt, Littlewoods made a strategic decision to focus on online sales and retire their catalogues altogether in 2015. The transition was not without challenges. It required significant investments in technology infrastructure, staff training, and a robust online presence. However, the efforts have paid off: Littlewoods has established itself as a strong player in the world of online retail. The Importance of Mobile Phones in Online Shopping The ever-increasing prevalence of smartphones in our daily lives has undoubtedly been a major driver of Littlewoods' success. The mobile shopping experience has become increasingly smooth and user-friendly, motivating more and more people to shop online using their mobile devices. According to recent studies, mobile commerce (often referred to as m-commerce) is the fastest-growing segment in the retail industry. It has been estimated that mobile sales will comprise more than half of all e-commerce transactions by 2021. This shift means that retailers cannot ignore the importance of mobile devices as a key channel for their online sales. How Littlewoods Benefits from Mobile Shopping Littlewoods has capitalized on the mobile shopping trend by offering a seamless shopping experience across multiple devices. Their mobile e-commerce platform is designed to offer an intuitive interface that makes it easy for customers to browse, search, and complete purchases on the go. In addition to providing a robust website for online shopping, the company has also developed the Littlewoods smartphone app. Available for both iOS and Android devices, the app provides users with access to exclusive offers, personalized recommendations, and real-time order tracking. The app has proven popular among customers, with high engagement and retention rates. Its success demonstrates the benefits of focusing on the mobile aspect of e-commerce for retailers. Conclusion The digital transformation of Littlewoods showcases the potential for traditional retailers to adapt and thrive in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce. The company's focus on mobile shopping has proven to be a key driver of their online success. As mobile commerce continues to grow and reshape the retail landscape, businesses like Littlewoods that embrace these changes and adopt customer-friendly strategies will be well-positioned to maximize their potential in the modern retail environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which Renaissance dramatist co-wrote Anything for a Quiet Life with John Webster? A:","completion":"The Renaissance dramatist who co-wrote \\"Anything for a Quiet Life\\" with John Webster is Thomas Middleton. Thomas Middleton was a prolific English playwright and poet during the Jacobean and Caroline eras, known for his tragicomedies, satires, and city comedies. He collaborated with many other playwrights of the time, including William Rowley and John Webster. \\"Anything for a Quiet Life\\" is classified as a city comedy, which was a popular genre in early 17th century English drama. City comedies typically satirized the lives of the emerging urban middle class, highlighting their social ambitions and moral shortcomings. The themes of such plays often revolved around marriage, social status, and the pursuit of wealth. \\"Anything for a Quiet Life\\" was probably written around 1621, a collaborative work between two important playwrights of the time, Thomas Middleton and John Webster, who both had established reputations in the world of English Renaissance drama. While Middleton was known for his unique wit, dark humor, and keen observations of social and political issues, Webster's plays tended to have a macabre, poetic atmosphere, exemplified in his famous tragedies \\"The Duchess of Malfi\\" and \\"The White Devil.\\" In \\"Anything for a Quiet Life,\\" the plot revolves around the struggles of an aging, miserly citizen and his young wife, who is in love with another man. The play blends the elements of comedy and satire to explore the themes of lust, covetousness, and social intrigues, which were all characteristics of both the city comedy genre and Middleton's and Webster's distinct styles. It's important to note that collaboration between playwrights was common during the English Renaissance era, with many writers coming together to share their skills and ideas. This practice represents not only the collaborative nature of the theater but also the strong presence of a community of artists during the Renaissance period. In the case of Middleton and Webster, their joint work, \\"Anything for a Quiet Life,\\" is an example of two creative minds coming together to produce a unique and entertaining piece of drama that explores the complexities of human relationships and the social issues of their time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president.

The story idea came from smuggling in the 18th century Romney Marsh, where brandy and tobacco were brought in at night by boat from France to avoid high tax. Minor battles were fought, sometimes at night, between gangs of smugglers, such as the Hawkhurst Gang and the Revenue, supported by the army and local militias in the South, Kent and the West, Sussex. - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Arthur Russell Thorndike (6 February 1885, Rochester, Kent 7 November 1972) was a British actor and novelist, best known for the Doctor Syn of Romney Marsh novels. Less well-known than his sister Sybil but equally versatile, Russell Thorndike's first love was writing and, after serving in World War I, he devoted himself to it. - The Hawkhurst Gang was a notorious criminal organisation involved in smuggling throughout southeast England from 1735 until 1749. One of the more infamous gangs of the early 18th century, they extended their influence from Dorset, where they successfully raided the customs house at Poole, to the Kent coast. After they were defeated in a battle with the Goudhurst militia in 1747, two of their leaders, Arthur Gray and Thomas Kingsmill, were executed in 1748 and 1749. - Romney Marsh is a sparsely populated wetland area in the counties of Kent and East Sussex in the south-east of England.

A:","completion":"Others might feel a variety of emotions and reactions upon discovering the situation, depending on their relationships with Jesse and the event that took place last night. Here is a detailed breakdown of how different people might react: 1. Close friends and family members: These individuals might feel hurt or betrayed because they were not informed about the situation by Jesse. They might have expected Jesse to share important events and emotions with them and feel disappointed by the lack of communication. Close friends and family members may also be concerned about Jesse's well-being, wondering if something happened that prompted them to hide information. 2. Acquaintances and coworkers: People who are not close to Jesse but interact with them regularly could have mixed reactions. Some may be indifferent, while others might be curious about the situation, especially if it has repercussions or affects their relationships with each other. Some coworkers may feel slightly offended or left out if they were present during the event or if it directly impacted their job environment. 3. Community members or strangers: These people might not have a personal connection to Jesse, but they might still react to the situation if it somehow affects them or their environments. For example, if the event took place in a public place or had any legal or social implications, community members might feel concerned, upset, or even outraged, depending on how the news spreads. 4. Jesse's rivals or adversaries: Individuals who have a contentious relationship with Jesse or who do not get along with them might react with satisfaction or smugness that they found out about the undisclosed event. They might use this information as leverage, gossip, or a means to tarnish Jesse's reputation. 5. Sympathetic or empathetic individuals: Some people might feel empathy and understanding for Jesse's choice not to share information about the event. They might recognize that Jesse could be going through a difficult time or struggling with personal issues, and choose to be supportive instead of judgmental. In summary, people's reactions and feelings about the situation could vary depending on their relationships with Jesse, their personal values, and the exact nature of the undisclosed event. Their emotions could range from betrayal and disappointment to curiosity, sympathy, and understanding. It would be essential for Jesse to address these issues by opening up about the situation to those they feel comfortable with, apologizing for any hurt caused, and working to rebuild trust among supporters. Simultaneously, Jesse should prepare for potential backlash from rivals and adversaries who may use the situation against them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\", and writing: Some minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling.

Korea Fresh from sinking a South Korean navy ship and taking the lives of 46 mostly young sailors, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il hopped on his private armored train last week for a friendly visit to his enablers in Beijing. Is that a harsh interpretation of events? Yes; nuances and caveats to follow. But it's also an interpretation that best fits the available facts -- and it raises questions about the Obama administration's enduring hope (like the hope of the Bush administration before it) for China's help in constraining not only North Korea but also Iran and other bad actors around the world. The South Korean corvette Cheonan exploded, broke in two and sank off the west coast of Korea in darkness March 26, with 46 of the crew of 104 killed or lost at sea. Officially, the cause of the explosion remains under investigation, and South Korean President Lee Myung Bak has lodged no accusations. But the two pieces of the boat have been salvaged, internal explosions have been ruled out as cause and -- last week -- South Korean newspapers reported that traces of a torpedo had been found. The list of logical suspects extends from A to A. Lee, contending with popular anger among South Koreans, has labored methodically to lay the groundwork for a multilateral response focused on diplomatic or economic sanctions; military retaliation would only risk wider war. To that end, he discussed the sinking with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Shanghai on April 30. South Korean officials hoped that China would help send a message to its ally in Pyongyang that ship-sinking is not an approved sport among civilized nations. Instead, three days later, and without notification to South Korea, China rolled out the red carpet for North Korea's self-titled Dear Leader. The Chinese press was not permitted to report on the four-day visit as it took place or even acknowledge that it was happening. But after Kim was safely home, the Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that Hu had hosted a welcoming banquet in the Dear Leader's honor. \\"Hu said the traditional friendship between China and the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] is the common treasure of the two governments, parties and peoples,\\" Xinhua reported. What to make of this? Analysts who believe that China wields a moderating, useful influence over North Korea found comfort in a five-point proposal that Hu issued. It called, for example, for the two countries \\"to strengthen coordination in international and regional affairs\\"; perhaps that signaled China's discontent that Pyongyang was sinking ships in the neighborhood without warning. According to the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo, Kim unexpectedly departed Beijing before using his coveted ticket to the North Korean version of the Chinese classic opera \\"Dream of the Red Mansion\\"; maybe he left in a huff after Chinese officials had (perhaps) expressed reservations about ship-sinking. On the other hand, Chosun Ilbo also reported that Kim returned home with promises of 100,000 tons of food and 100 million in other aid from China for the crippled North Korean economy. And that reflects China's true role in North Korea. Despite all the time spent in six-party talks in recent years, and all the discussion of China's new role as a \\"responsible stakeholder\\" and a \\"strategic partner,\\" its main accomplishment has been to keep Kim Jong Il's murderous regime sputtering along. It does this by sending North Korean refugees who make it across the Yalu River back to North Korea, often to be executed, which tends to discourage the outward flow that would otherwise take place. And in periods when the United States, South Korea and Japan restrict their aid to North Korea for political reasons, China fills the gap. The regime's nuclear program has not been restrained; it is likely to face no serious consequences for its sinking of the Cheonan. All of this matters greatly to the 24 million or so people who remain imprisoned inside Kim's gulag nation. How much it matters to South Korea and its allies, including America, is debatable, since in one sense South Korea already has won the war. Its economy has grown to about 28,000 per person in purchasing power, according to the CIA World Factbook, not far behind Japan's; the CIA estimates the North Korean economy at 1,900 per person, which seems generous when stacked against accounts of refugees who have escaped. But it may matter more as an indication of how much help President Obama can expect from Hu and his colleagues. For a U.S. government hoping that China would rein in North Korea's nuclear program and back sanctions strong enough to influence Iran's behavior, Hu's post-Cheonan embrace of the Dear Leader must be a little dispiriting. What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the troubling friendship between China and North Korea, specifically in the context of North Korea's alleged sinking of a South Korean navy ship in 2010, which resulted in the death of 46 sailors. Following the incident, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il visited Beijing, where he received a warm welcome from Chinese President Hu Jintao despite the ongoing investigation and South Korea's push for a multilateral response. The article highlights the challenges this relationship poses for the Obama administration, as it hoped for China's assistance in constraining not only North Korea but also Iran and other problematic global actors. While some analysts argue that China wields a moderating influence over North Korea, the facts on the ground, including China sending aid to support the struggling North Korean economy, tell a different story. The article concludes that China's actions may be indicative of the level of help the United States can expect when seeking cooperation on issues related to North Korea, and potentially other regional security matters such as Iran."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Half of the world's population is affected by Asian monsoons , but monsoons are difficult to predict. American researchers have put together a 700-year record of the rainy seasons, which is expected to provide guidance for experts making weather predictions. Every year, damp air masses,known as monsoon,produce large amounts of rainfall in India, East Asia, Northern Australia and East Africa. All this wet air is pulled in by a high pressure area over the Indian Ocean and a low pressure area to the south. According to Edward Cook , a weather expert at Columbia University in New York., the complex nature of the climate systems across Asia makes monsoons hard to predict. In addition, climate records for the area are too recent and not detailed enough to be of much use. Therefore, he and a team of researchers spent more than fifteen years traveling across Asia, looking for trees old enough to provide long-term records. They measured the rings, or circles, inside thousands of ancient trees in more than 300 places. Rainfall has a direct link to the growth and width of rings on some kinds of trees. The researchers developed a document they are calling a Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas. It shows the effect of monsoons over seven centuries, beginning in the 1300s. Professor Cook says the tree-ring records show periods of wet and dry weather. \\"If the monsoon basically fails or is a very weak one, the trees affected by monsoons at that location might put on a very narrow ring. But if the monsoon is very strong, the trees affected by that monsoon might put on a wide ring for that year. So, the wide and narrow ring widths of the chronology that we developed in Asia provide us with a measure of monsoon variability.\\" With all this information, researchers say they can begin to improve computer climate models for predicting the behavior of monsoons. \\"There has been widespread famine and starvation and human dying in the past in large droughts. And on the other hand, if the monsoon is particularly heavy, it can cause extensive...

Use an old horse shoe, place the drink container in the place where your foot enters the shoe and it will help stabilize it.; (b). Use an old shoe, place the drink container in the place where your foot enters the shoe and it will help stabilize it.;...I think the answer is","completion":"(b). Use an old shoe, place the drink container in the place where your foot enters the shoe and it will help stabilize it. When driving an older car without cupholders, finding a safe and secure spot for your beverage can be a challenge. Among the given options, using an old shoe to place your drink container is more reasonable than using a horseshoe. Here is a detailed explanation as to why this option is more practical: 1. Availability of materials: It is more likely that you have an old shoe readily available at home than an old horseshoe. Shoes are common household items, whereas horseshoes are not typically found in most homes, especially if you don't live on a farm or have horses. 2. Stability: An old shoe, with its larger surface area, will provide better support and more stability for your drink container when compared to a horseshoe. The shape and size of a shoe can engulf the container to a larger extent, providing a snug fit and minimizing the risk of spills. 3. Compatibility with various container sizes: Shoes, especially those with larger foot openings, can accommodate different sizes of drink containers, including cups, bottles, and cans. A horseshoe, on the other hand, has a rigid structure and may not be compatible with containers of various sizes. 4. Safety: Placing your drink container in an old shoe reduces the chances of it falling while driving, as the shoe provides cushioning and support around the container. A horseshoe, however, has a hard and potentially sharp structure that may cause damage to your car's interior or even pose a danger to the driver and passengers. 5. Convenience: It is much easier to pick up and set down your drink container from a shoe than from a horseshoe. A shoe provides a convenient and accessible makeshift cupholder, while a horseshoe might require more attention when placing and removing the drink, which can be distracting when driving. In summary, using an old shoe to hold your beverage while driving an older car without built-in cupholders is a more practical and reasonable option than using a horseshoe. This method provides better stability, convenience, and safety for both the driver and the passengers, while ensuring compatibility with various container sizes and making it easy to find an appropriate holder among everyday household items."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. My then-teenage daughter and I went to a new restaurant. It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group.

Question 2: Is there a currently evolving tendency towards nasty, trashy behavior in sports? Possible answers: (A). no. (B). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"The answer to these two questions might not necessarily be the same, as they both tackle different topics and require separate evaluations. Let's analyze each question individually to better understand the issues at hand. Question 1: Is there a tendency to gravitate toward conspiracy theories on RT News? RT News, formerly known as Russia Today, is a Russian state-funded international television network. While it is important to note that not all content on RT News is conspiracy theories or misinformation, there have been instances where the network has promoted or given airtime to conspiracy theories. This has been especially prevalent in the context of global politics, where some argue that RT News spreads disinformation to further political agendas. However, it is essential to recognize that this is a matter of interpretation and individual perception of the viewers. Some may view certain stories on RT News as conspiracy theory promotions, while others might see them as alternative viewpoints that challenge mainstream narratives. Overall, there is a possibility that RT News may lean towards promoting conspiracy theories, albeit not consistently in all their content. Question 2: Is there a currently evolving tendency towards nasty, trashy behavior in sports? Sports-related incidents that involve nasty or trashy behavior have occurred throughout history. Recently, however, the advent of social media and the widespread presence of cameras have led to a higher visibility of such incidents. Consequently, people may perceive an increased tendency of bad behavior in sports. Moreover, the high levels of competition, financial stakes, and public pressure may contribute to athletes or teams occasionally engaging in unsportsmanlike behavior. Additionally, rivalries and long-standing feuds between teams, athletes, or fans can lead to incidents that are not reflective of the majority of sports interactions. In conclusion, while there may be no definitive yes or no answer to these questions, it is likely that RT News does have a tendency to gravitate towards conspiracy theories, whereas the apparent increase in nasty, trashy behavior in sports may be more of a side effect of increased visibility and specific incidents rather than an evolving trend.

A fascinating comparative analysis of Amish and Hutterite farming communities has finally uncovered the specific aspects of farm life that are responsible for this built-in immune protection. In a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers from the University of Chicago Medical Center and the University of Arizona have shown that substances found in house dust in Amish homes have a profound impact on the development of the body’s innate immune system in ways that protect children from asthma. Revealingly, the same could not be said for Hutterites, who share similar ancestry, lifestyles, and cultural values. But it’s the differences between these two farming communities that shed light on the reasons why. “You can’t put a cow in every family’s house, but we may be able to protect children from asthma by finding a way to re-create the time-tested Amish experience.” The American Amish and Hutterite communities were established by immigrants from Central Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. Consequently, they provide an incredible opportunity for scientists to conduct comparative analyses; the Amish and Hutterites not only share genetic ancestry, they also share similar lifestyles and customs, such as a Germanic diet, having large families, breastfeeding, drinking raw milk, not allowing indoor pets, and favoring childhood vaccinations. But these communities differ in one very important way: they engage in different farming practices. The Amish still cling to traditional methods, such as living on single-family dairy farms and relying on horses for fieldwork and transportation. The Hutterites, by contrast, live on large communal farms and use modern, industrialized farm machinery. As a result, Hutterite children aren’t exposed to farm animals to the same degree that Amish children are. Advertisement Over the years, researchers have noticed a disparity in the prevalence of asthma between the two groups. Around five percent of Amish children aged six to 14 have asthma, which is about half of the US average. By contrast, around 21 percent of Hutterite children have asthma. As study co-author Carole Ober put it in a press statement, that’s a “whopping discrepancy.” To figure out what’s going on, the researchers studied 60 Amish and Hutterite children aged seven to 14. In addition to performing genetic analyses, the researchers compared the types of immune cells in their blood, collected dust from their homes, and measured the amount of microbes in the homes of both communities. Advertisement A key discovery was the presence of neutrophils among Amish children—blood cells that are crucial to fighting infections. They also found a lack of eosinophils among the Amish, which promote allergic reactions, such as inflammation. Genetic analysis also showed that Amish children have a more reactive immune system. In a follow-up to these findings, immunologist Donata Vercelli exposed genetically modified mice to house dust extracted from the homes (these mice were engineered to have weakened immune responses). She found that the airways of mice exposed to Amish dust were protected from asthma-like responses to allergens. The same could not be said for mice exposed to Hutterite dust. The dust collected from Amish homes contained more microbes—6.8 times more to be precise. “Neither the Amish nor the Hutterites have dirty homes,” explained Ober. “Both are tidy. The Amish barns, however, are much closer to their homes. Their children run in and out of them, often barefoot, all day long. There’s no obvious dirt in the Amish homes, no lapse of cleanliness. It’s just in the air, and in the dust.” Advertisement This study strongly suggests that early and frequent exposure to farming microbes, particular those that come from livestock, boosts Amish children’s disease-fighting immune system. The authors hope that these findings will point the way towards therapies or medicines that will help to prevent asthma and other allergies. As Ober put it, “You can’t put a cow in every family’s house, but we may be able to protect children from asthma by finding a way to re-create the time-tested Amish experience.” [New England Journal of Medicine] ||||| One way to reduce children's rates of asthma may come from dairy farms, a new study finds. And not just any dairy farms — Amish dairy farms, to be exact. Kids who grow up in Amish communities have much lower rates of asthma than the general population, potentially thanks to their exposure to the communities' dairy farms at an early age, according to the study, published today (Aug. 3) in the New England Journal of Medicine. Indeed, exposure to an \\"Amish-like\\" environment appears to protect kids against asthma, said Carole Ober, a professor of human genetics at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the study. [9 Weirdest Allergies] In the study, the researchers compared two relatively isolated farming communities: an Amish community in Indiana and a Hutterite community in South Dakota. The researchers wanted to compare these communities because the two groups have many similar cultural traditions, Ober said. For example, both groups shun television, radio and the internet; have large families; and breast-feed their children for a long time, she said. The two groups also eat similar diets, she said. However, there's a striking difference in the rate of asthma, which is much higher in Hutterite kids than in Amish children, she said. The researchers looked at blood samples from 30 kids from ages 7 and 14 from the Amish community, and 30 kids of the same age range from the Hutterite community. In addition, the researchers collected a small amount of dust from 10 houses in each community. The blood samples showed that the Amish kids had higher levels of immune cells that play a role in the body's \\"innate immune response.\\" This response is the most ancient part of the immune system, shared by all animals, Ober said. Because the scientists figured out that the innate immune system is likely involved in the differences between these two communities, the researchers can now focus more on figuring out which parts of the innate immune system may reduce a child's risk of asthma, Ober said. The researchers also took the house dust that they collected and exposed mice to it. The animals that were exposed to the Amish house dust did not get asthma when they were later exposed to things that would normally trigger the condition, the researchers found. The Hutterite house-dust, on the other hand, did not have a protective effect. This suggests something in the dust in Amish homes has a protective effect against asthma, Ober told Live Science. Moving forward, the researchers hope to figure out exactly what component of the dust is beneficial, she said. It's likely bacteria or fungi, she added, but it's unclear what types of bacteria or fungi, or what combinations of microbes. The researchers think that the potentially beneficial bacteria or fungi in Amish house dust can probably be traced back to the Amish dairy farms, Ober said. In these communities, the families live much closer to dairy farms than kids in Hutterite communities do, and Amish children often start going into barns at a very young age, she said. This exposes the kids to animals and the microbes that often accompany them, according to the study. These microbes can make their way into house dust. In Hutterite communities, on the other hand, the families live much farther from the farms, and kids don't come into contact with animals at a young age, Ober said. The study illustrates what researchers call the hygiene hypothesis, Ober said. This idea proposes that in the past several decades or so, the environments that people live in have gotten much cleaner, but this cleanliness has had a negative impact on the human immune system, she said. As a result, people are now more susceptible to immune-related diseases such as asthma, she said. One of the biggest changes related to cleanliness is the switch from farming communities to nonfarming communities, Ober said. Indeed, researchers in Germany have found that being exposed to things you would find on a farm — cows, in particular — may have a protective effect against certain diseases, Ober said. (Other research has shown that if families have a pet dog when their child is born, the child has a lower risk of asthma, she added.) [7 Surprising Benefits of Dog Ownership] But for kids who don't grow up on dairy farms, the findings may still be relevant, she said. \\"I keep saying if everyone would just put a cow in their house, no kid would have asthma, but that's not very practical,\\" Ober said. Instead, Ober said that she envisions an air mister that parents could use in a child's bedroom during their first year of life, that would spray the beneficial microbes into the air. The age at which kids are exposed to the microbes is important, too, because the benefits seem to only take effect if a child is exposed as an infant, Ober said. In future studies, she would like to encourage Hutterites to get their babies to be around animals very early, and see if this reduces the children's risk of asthma, she said.

Amish and Hutterite farming communities share similar ancestry and cultural values, however, the latter group uses modern, industrialised farm machinery and therefore has reduced exposure to farm animals. The study discovered that around 5% of Amish children between the ages of six to 14 have asthma, whereas around 21% of Hutterite children suffer from the condition. The research suggests that early exposure to farming microbes from livestock boosts Amish children’s immune systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are two dairy farms in the town of Milkton and both are about the same size. Farm A produces only organic milk. Farm B does not but they are considering switching production to organic milk. Which farm likely has higher milk yields, farm A or B? Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). A:","completion":"To determine which farm is likely to have higher milk yields, let's evaluate the information given and analyze the differences in milk production between these two dairy farms: Farm A: Organic Milk Production 1. Reduces leaching of nitrates and phosphates due to lower fertilizer application rates 2. Increases land use per ton of milk produced due to reduced crop yields per hectare and consequently has lower milk production per cow 3. May have increased methane emissions due to increased roughage and lower milk production per cow Farm B: Conventional Milk Production 1. May have higher fertilizer application rates, resulting in more nitrate and phosphate leaching 2. May have higher crop yields per hectare, resulting in more efficient land use and higher milk production per cow 3. May have lower methane emissions due to higher milk production per cow Given this information, the likely answer would be that Farm B, with conventional milk production, has higher milk yields compared to Farm A, which is an organic dairy farm. This is mainly due to the higher crop yields per hectare and the presumably higher milk production per cow in conventional dairy farms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Possible A: building, canned goods, grocery store, church, department store Why is \\"grocery store\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Grocery store\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is the most contextually relevant and appropriate option among the given choices when considering the question about finding lettuce. Lettuce is a food item, specifically a type of leafy green vegetable that is commonly consumed in salads, sandwiches, and various other culinary preparations. Given its nature as a perishable food product, the most likely place one would find lettuce would be at a grocery store. Grocery stores are establishments that primarily sell food items, including fresh produce such as lettuce, fruits, and other vegetables, along with other essential goods like canned and packaged foods, beverages, and household supplies. The other provided options do not align with human common sense, as they either do not have any direct relationship to food items or are contextually irrelevant. For example: 1. Building - This is a very general term that refers to any type of structure made for human activities. It could include a grocery store but also encompasses numerous other structures that are not related to food shopping, making it too vague and nonspecific. 2. Canned goods - This refers to a category of food items that have been preserved and packaged in cans or jars for long-term storage. While lettuce can be found at a grocery store alongside canned goods, it is not a canned product. Lettuce is sold fresh, which distinguishes it from canned goods. 3. Church - A church is a place of worship for Christians and generally does not function as a marketplace for food items like lettuce. It is an irrelevant option when considering the context of the question. 4. Department store - Although some department stores may have grocery sections, they primarily focus on selling a wide variety of non-food items, including clothing, accessories, home goods, electronics, and more. As such, a department store is not the most appropriate answer when considering where to find lettuce, as they are not specifically designed for selling food items like a grocery store is. Based on these explanations, it is clear that \\"grocery store\\" is the answer most aligned with human common sense because it is the most contextually appropriate and relevant location where a person would logically expect to find lettuce for purchase. This choice takes into account the inherent qualities of lettuce as a food item and understands the nature of grocery stores as specialized establishments for buying food."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the left side, we have 93*k + 1350. Since there are no like terms, there's nothing more to simplify. On the right side, we have -132*k + 90*k. Combine like terms (-132*k and 90*k) by adding them together: -132*k + 90*k = (-132 + 90) * k = -42*k Now the equation looks like this: 93*k + 1350 = -42*k Step 2: Move all terms containing k to the left side of the equation. To do this, we can add 42*k to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -42*k on the right side: 93*k + 42*k + 1350 = -42*k + 42*k Simplifying this equation, we get: (93 + 42) * k + 1350 = 0 135*k + 1350 = 0 Step 3: Solve for k. To isolate k, first subtract 1350 from both sides: 135*k = -1350 Now, divide both sides by 135: k = -1350 / 135 Simplifying the fraction, we get k = -10.

In the 1650s, Burma became entangled in the dynastic changes in China. In 1651, Ming armies fleeing from the Qing forces entered Kengyun , which had paid tribute to both China and Burma. King Pindale sent five regiments to the front in October 1651. But the armies were driven back by the Ming in December 1651. Pindale would not contest again. In 1658, Zhu Youlang, one of the sons of the last Ming emperor, and his 700 followers were given permission to stay at Sagaing.

The first recording of L'incoronazione, with Walter Goehr conducting the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich in a live stage performance, was issued in 1954. This LP version, which won a Grand Prix du Disque in 1954, is the only recording of the opera that predates the revival of the piece that began with the 1962 Glyndebourne Festival production. In 1963 Herbert von Karajan and the Vienna Staatsoper issued a version described by Gramophone as \\"far from authentic\\", while the following year John Pritchard and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra recorded an abridged version using Leppard's Glyndebourne orchestration. Leppard conducted a Sadler's Wells production, which was broadcast by the BBC and recorded on 27 November 1971. This is the only recording of the opera in English.Nikolaus Harnoncourt's 1974 version, the first recording without cuts, used period instruments in an effort to achieve a more authentic sound, although Denis Arnold has criticised Harnoncourt's \\"over-ornamentation\\" of the score, particularly his use of oboe and trumpet flourishes. Arnold showed more enthusiasm for Alan Curtis's 1980 recording, live from La Fenice in Venice. Curtis uses a small band of strings, recorders and continuo, with a trumpets reserved for the final coronation scene. Subsequent recordings have tended to follow the path of authenticity, with versions from baroque specialists including Richard Hickox and the City of London Baroque Sinfonia (1988), René Jacobs and Concerto Vocale (1990), and John Eliot Gardiner with the English Baroque Soloists.

Write a title for this article: Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times Gov. David A. Paterson, shown in June, testified that he did not recall a conversation soon after an alleged domestic assault. The report by Judith S. Kaye, the former chief judge of the New York State Court of Appeals, suggested that there was something of a river of leaks from the governor’s office, through his lawyers, to people who were drawn into the investigation of his role in an aide’s domestic violence case. Indicating embarrassment, Ms. Kaye wrote that her “investigators learned inadvertently” about the disclosures and asked that they stop, the report said. “It is unclear,” her report added, whether the information sharing did stop. The leaks, lawyers and others said, could have allowed witnesses who are subjects of the investigation to coordinate their defense and perhaps align their testimony. Ms. Kaye’s remarks about the administration’s conduct during the investigation drew the interest of lawyers and prosecutors Thursday, in part because they seemed to distract attention from the report’s main conclusion — that the governor did not commit a crime. In its final paragraphs, the report said the governor’s office “did not keep its public commitment to cooperate fully with the investigation,” though the report indicated that the sharing of the information did not violate any laws. The report indicated that Mr. Paterson’s counsel in the governor’s office, Peter J. Kiernan, gave information about the investigation to Theodore V. Wells Jr., Mr. Paterson’s personal criminal lawyer, and that the information then went on to other people. “This conduct raised concerns,” it said. In response to questions on Thursday, Mr. Wells issued a statement saying, “We believe that the governor cooperated fully with Judge Kaye’s investigation.” Mr. Wells’s statement said, “Judge Kaye’s staff has confirmed directly to us that her report did not intend to criticize my conduct.” Mr. Kiernan issued a statement saying there was “a good-faith disagreement between me and the independent counsel regarding the role of counsel’s office in representing the governor.” He said he stood by “the legality and propriety” of the handling of what he said were more than 100,000 documents, including audio tapes and phone logs. A spokeswoman for Mr. Paterson’s lawyers, Brandy Bergman, declined to comment when asked whether the governor had directed that information obtained from the investigators be shared with lawyers and witnesses. Among prosecutors and former prosecutors, the comments in Ms. Kaye’s report seemed to cloud the report’s ability to quiet the controversy surrounding Mr. Paterson’s role in the domestic violence case against his suspended aide, David W. Johnson. “She is at least implicitly, if not explicitly, stating that there is going to be uncertainty about her findings because of the possibility the investigation could have been affected by leaks,” said Daniel C. Richman, a former prosecutor who is a law professor at Columbia. Investigations are often kept confidential for many reasons, lawyers said, but they noted that even witnesses who testify in secret grand jury proceedings are permitted to share information with others about what they said. Information sharing can become illegal obstruction of justice when it is intended to interfere with proceedings. But several lawyers said that by labeling her complaint as one about poor cooperation, Ms. Kaye was indicating that the actions of the governor and his lawyers had not crossed the line into illegality. Still, lawyers said, the comments in the report showed frustration among the investigators. “Prosecutors are always concerned about information sharing,” said Nicolas Bourtin, a former federal prosecutor who is a defense lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell. “It allows people to get their stories straight.” The report indicated that the information disclosed by the governor’s office could have provided clues about the direction of the investigation. It said the information included investigators’ requests for documents from the governor and the documents that were turned over. The information, the report said, also “included not only the governor’s files and communications but also those of staff members.” Much of the investigation focused on what Mr. Paterson knew, whom he talked to and when. The investigation was conducted under a provision requiring that in certain state investigations officials cannot disclose the names of witnesses “or any information obtained.” A violation is a misdemeanor. In its opening pages, Ms. Kaye’s report noted the provision “criminalizing disclosure of investigative information.” But as lawyers studied the provision on Thursday, many of them noted that its language made clear that Mr. Paterson could not have been prosecuted for violating it. The provision says a governor can direct the disclosure of investigative information. Lawyers said the provision was written to permit a governor to request attorney general investigations of possible official wrongdoing and then to use their findings as he chose. Mr. Paterson asked the attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, to investigate the claims concerning his involvement in Mr. Johnson’s case. Mr. Cuomo, a candidate for governor, then asked Ms. Kaye to run the investigation. The law permitting the investigations, several lawyers said, was not drafted with the idea that the governor might be the subject of an inquiry he requested. Lawyers for some of the people involved in the investigation denied that they had received information from the governors’ lawyers or declined to discuss the issue. Mr. Johnson’s lawyer, Oscar Michelen, said he would not confirm or deny that he had received information. But he said the investigators’ implication that information sharing was improper was wrong. “I think,” Mr. Michelen said, “the report shows that they’re not familiar with New York law in a couple of areas.”","completion":"\\"Paterson's Office Leaks Undermine Confidence in Domestic Violence Case Investigation Outcome\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Allow him to make plans for getting together. Note how much of his free time he devotes to you. The more time he wants to spend with you, the more he cares. Allow some leeway if your schedules are busy or conflicting because of work, school, or family functions. But if he has all the free time in the world and only wants to see you once a week, consider that a sign of ambivalence. Note how frequently he calls, emails, or texts you. If he contacts you regularly, consider that a sign that he wants to be part of your life. Give him a little grace period if he’s extremely busy, but also note how much effort he makes to keep in touch in spite of that. On the other hand, watch out if he's calling way too much. If he calls you when he knows you're busy with work, family, or studying and still expects you to drop everything and talk to him, that probably means he cares less about your needs and more about his own. When you aren’t going to see each other anytime soon, ask him what he’ll be up to. Gauge his willingness to answer. If he seems cagey and vague, consider that a sign that he doesn’t care enough about you to share all of his life with you. If he’s forthcoming and lets you know what his plans are at any given hour, take it as a sign of honesty and inclusion. Take him at his word when he tells you what he'll be up to.

Write an article based on this \\"Obtain a long cardboard tube with one end closed. Flatten the tube along one edge. Bait the tube. Place the tube on the edge of a countertop or second story landing. Place a trash can beneath the tube. Check the trap frequently.\\"","completion":"Title: A Simple, Eco-Friendly, DIY Pest Control Solution: How to Create a Cardboard Tube Trap Introduction With advancements in technology, pest control options have become more varied and complicated. Despite this, there are still straightforward, cost-effective, and practical solutions for dealing with unwanted pests. One such solution involves the use of a simple household item: the cardboard tube. Perfect for a more sustainable and ecological approach, the cardboard tube trap can help you eliminate pests with ease. This article will guide you step-by-step on how to build an effective and environmentally-friendly cardboard tube trap. Materials needed: 1. Long cardboard tube (with one end closed) 2. Bait (e.g., peanut butter, scraps of food, or any suitable attractant for the targeted pests) 3. Flattening tool (such as a rolling pin or a heavy book) 4. Countertop or second story landing 5. Trash can or other receptacle 6. Gloves (for safe handling and disposal) Procedure: 1. Obtain a long cardboard tube with one end closed: Cardboard tubes from used toilet paper rolls, paper towel rolls, or even gift wrapping rolls can be used for this purpose. The ideal length of the cardboard tube should be at least 6 inches. Choose a tube that has only one end closed. If both ends are open, simply fold and tape one end to close it. 2. Flatten the tube along one edge: Use a rolling pin, a heavy book, or any suitable flat item to press and flatten one edge of the cardboard tube. The objective is to create an opening that is less than half of the tube's diameter. This will allow pests to enter but not easily escape, thus trapping them inside the tube. 3. Bait the tube: Select a bait that is appropriate for the pests you intend to trap. For rodents like mice and rats, peanut butter or bread crumbs work great. Insects, such as ants, can be lured in with sugar or small bits of fruit. Insert the bait inside the tube, near the closed end, making sure it's secured in place. You can use a small piece of tape or a toothpick to hold the bait in position. 4. Place the tube on the edge of a countertop or second story landing: The ideal location for setting the trap depends on the type of pest you're dealing with. For rodents, position the tube on the edge of a countertop, table, or any elevated surface that these creatures frequent. In the case of insects, placing the tube close to their trails or entry points can be highly effective. 5. Position a trash can beneath the tube: Once the trap is set, place a trash can or any receptacle under the open end of the tube. The purpose of the trash can is to collect the pests that fall from the tube upon being trapped. 6. Check the trap frequently: It's crucial to monitor the trap often to ensure its effectiveness. If a caught pest is not removed promptly, it may attract other predators, or the pest may find a way to escape. Wear gloves when handling the trap and disposing of pests to avoid direct contact with the creatures and any potential pathogens they may carry. Conclusion The cardboard tube trap offers an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative for pest control. This user-friendly method requires minimal resources, making it accessible for anyone looking for a DIY solution. It can be especially helpful for those who wish to avoid using harsh chemicals and poisons in their homes. In addition to its environmental benefits, the cardboard tube trap can also be a fun and educational activity for families to learn about pest behavior and sustainable solutions. Just remember to always handle and dispose of trapped pests humanely, and take necessary precautions to protect yourself from potential harm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1975 he returned to Odibo , and in 1977 to Windhoek .","completion":"These two sentences from Wikipedia convey similar information but do not have the exact same meaning. The differences between the two sentences lie in the verbs used and the implications regarding the subject's relationship with the two places. In the first sentence - \\"In 1975 he moved to Odibo, and in 1977 returned to Windhoek.\\" - the verb \\"moved\\" conveys that the subject relocated to Odibo in 1975. The use of \\"returned\\" in the second part of the sentence indicates that the subject had been to Windhoek before, and in 1977, they went back. By using \\"moved,\\" there isn't necessarily any previous connection implied between the subject and Odibo. In the second sentence - \\"In 1975 he returned to Odibo, and in 1977 to Windhoek.\\" - the verb \\"returned\\" is used in both instances, which implies that the subject had an earlier connection to both places. In 1975, they went back to Odibo, where they had spent time in the past; similarly, in 1977, they returned to Windhoek, another location with which they have a history. In summary, though these two sentences provide similar information about the subject's movement between Odibo and Windhoek, the use of verbs changes the meaning slightly, with the first sentence suggesting that the subject moved to Odibo for the first time while the second sentence implies they had a history in both locations before returning to them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process: - A photovoltaic cell is created with two layers of semiconductor material - The top layer are &#x27;doped&#x27; with impurities to allow a negative charge - The bottom layer are &#x27;doped&#x27; to allow for a positive charge - This produces an electric field that allows electrons to flow from negative to positve - Sunlight enters the cell - Energy from sunlight knocks electrons loose in both fields - This prevents the flow of electrons from negative to positive - Adding an external circuit allows the exchange to continue - Give the cells owner a flow of electricity. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less solar power being generated happens, how will it affect MORE solar power being generated. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis implies that there is a change or disturbance in the solar power generation system, in this case, a reduction in the amount of solar power being generated. This scenario can arise due to various factors such as weather conditions, dust on solar panels, or degradation of the photovoltaic cell's efficiency over time. The effect of this perturbation on generating more solar power can be analyzed through its direct and indirect impacts. Direct Effects: 1. Lower solar power output: A decrease in solar power generation can lead to a lower output of electricity. This means that the solar energy system may not be able to meet the energy requirements of the connected load or applications. 2. Reduced efficiency: The decrease in the performance of the photovoltaic cells directly impacts their efficiency. Lower efficiency reduces the overall productivity of the solar energy system, making it less competitive compared to other power generation methods. Indirect Effects: 1. Financial implications: With less solar power being generated, the return on investment (ROI) will be negatively affected. If electricity generation is significantly lower than expected, it could prolong the payback period and reduce the overall financial returns for the investment. 2. Grid dependency: If the solar power system is unable to generate sufficient electricity, users might have to rely more on the conventional electricity grid. This increased dependence on fossil-fuel-based power sources can contribute to greater greenhouse gas emissions and higher electricity costs. 3. Incentive and policy impacts: The reduction in solar power generation can influence government policies and incentives related to renewable energy. If solar power systems do not perform as expected, it may discourage further investments and installations in this sector, slowing the overall growth of solar energy adoption. To mitigate these effects, it is important to install and maintain solar power systems properly, monitor their performance regularly, and address any issues that could hinder their efficiency and electricity generation. This can help maximize the potential of solar power and contribute to a sustainable and greener future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Dr. Donald Blake, a science professor at Dunsford University, receives delivery of a coelacanth. A student, Jimmy, asks Blake if the fish is really a million years old. Blake replies, \\"It's the species that's old. No change in millions of years. See, the coelacanth is a living fossil, immune to the forces of evolution\\". Blake lectures his students about evolution and devolution, telling them that man is the only creature that can decide whether to move forwards or backwards, and that \\"unless we learn to control the instincts we've inherited from our ape-like ancestors, the race is doomed\\". Inside the lab, Blake scratches himself on its teeth of the Partially-thawed coelacanth, accidentally sticking his bloody hand into the water-filled container which held the fish. Molly Riordan, assistant to Dr. Cole Oliver, is with Blake and offers him a ride home. When they get to Molly's car, Blake says he doesn't feel well and passes out. At Blake's home, Molly is attacked by person or persons unknown. Madeline Howard, Blake's fiancee and daughter of Dr. Gilbert Howard, president of the university, arrives and finds the home in shambles and Blake moaning on the ground. Madeline calls the police after seeing Molly hanging by her hair in a tree, her eyes wide, dead. Detective Lt. Mike Stevens and Detective Sgt. Eddie Daniels find a huge \\"deformed\\" hand print on a window and Blake's tie clasp in Molly's dead hand. They take Blake downtown when he admits that he can't remember anything after getting into Molly's car. Stevens releases Blake after concluding that someone is holding a grudge and trying to implicate Blake in Molly's murder. He assigns Daniels as Blake's bodyguard and tells Blake that Molly's autopsy showed she died of fright. Answer:","completion":"The first names of the people who get to Molly's car, as per the given context, are Donald and Molly. Donald, whose full name is Dr. Donald Blake, is a science professor at Dunsford University and he's a key individual in this narrative. He comes into focus when he receives a delivery of a coelacanth and shares his knowledge on the species with his students. He accidentally injures himself with the teeth of the coelacanth and then begins feeling unwell. Molly, whose full name is Molly Riordan, is an assistant to Dr. Cole Oliver. She is present with Donald during the incident with the coelacanth and offers to take him home when he starts to feel unwell, which is where they assume to make their way to her car. From the situation described, upon reaching Molly's car, Donald falls unconscious due to his unwell state, marking him as one of the individuals who gets to Molly's car. Molly, being the car owner and the one who proposed they travel by it, is undoubtedly the other individual on scene, hence making Donald and Molly the two individuals who get to Molly's car. The narrative continues with Molly's unfortunate demise and subsequent investigation, illustrating a complex crime whose exact circumstances are yet to be uncovered."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The AA said it was an ambitious timetable and that the practical and economic impacts needed to be examined. Clean Air In London said it was a wish list Mr Johnson wants others to do as he would only be mayor until 2016. London is among the worst in Europe for air pollution. Environmental Organisation ClientEarth has warned that in terms of European Union rules, London will have \\"illegal levels of air pollution until 2025\\". A London Assembly report last December found that 9% of deaths in the city were down to air pollution. In a speech to City Hall, Mr Johnson said: \\"Creating the world's first big city ultra low emission zone has the potential to be a game changing moment in the quality of life of our great capital. By Tom EdwardsTransport correspondent, London Poor air quality kills over 4,000 Londoners a year prematurely and many believe it is one of the largest public health crises facing the capital. The mayor has tried to cut pollution with cleaner buses, dust suppressors and green walls but London still breaches European limits. And that means large EU fines loom. There are also court cases ongoing with the government under pressure to show it's cleaning up our air. The authorities here are trying to show they are taking action. The question is will this idea of an ultra low emission zone in 2020 be enough? Legislation is already to an extent cleaning up cars and HGVs. Hauliers have welcomed dropping stricter Euro V limits on HGVs. But campaigners are really angry saying that is a backwards step. What is really striking is the lack of any detail. Transport for London has not even a timeline on a consultation and has not appointed any staff to look at this yet - so this is very early days. Environmental lawyers currently taking the government to court over air quality say this is nothing more than a PR stunt. Without details it's difficult to know. \\"My vision is a central zone where almost all the vehicles running during working hours are either zero or low emission. \\"This would deliver incredible benefits in air quality and stimulate the delivery and mass use of low emission technology.\\" City Hall said the mayor recognised that more work was required and believes his proposal would act as a challenge for vehicle manufacturers to ensure more affordable and low-emission technologies were in place. Simon Birkett from Clean Air In London said the timescale was far too long and that it would only cover the central Congestion Zone. \\"It's the biggest public health risk after smoking and we need bold action - he should have been starting on this in 2008 need bold action in two or three years, not seven or eight,\\" he added. Jenny Jones, the Green Party's London Assembly member, said the scheme was first put to the mayor by the Assembly in 2009. She added that London had been in breach of European guidelines for pollutant nitrogen dioxide since 2010. \\"This is excellent news for Londoners' health, but leaving it as a project for the next mayor to deliver is a way of ducking responsibility for the problems we're facing now,\\" she said. A spokesman for the AA said it was a tight timetable and questioned what impact this would have on police cars, ambulances, fire engines and vehicles used for essential deliveries. He added that decisions made now would be affected by this change such as companies buying a fleet of taxis would need to know if the vehicles would not be allowed in the zone in seven years. The mayor also announced that phase five of the Low Emission Zone would now only apply to TfL buses, which would save Â£350m in costs for businesses. Mr Birkett said this was a backward step, especially as the low emission zone was the mayor's own policy. The mayor also plans to introduce 1,600 hybrid buses by 2016 and a further Â£20m fund to help boroughs tackle local air quality hotspots. Summary:","completion":"London's Mayor Boris Johnson announced plans to implement an ultra low emission zone in central London by 2020, allowing only zero or low-emission vehicles to operate within the area during working hours. The goal of this policy is to address London's issue with air pollution; the city is among the worst in Europe and is expected to have illegal levels of air pollution until 2025 according to European Union rules. Critics, such as the AA, consider this an ambitious timetable and question the practical and economic implications of the policy. Clean Air In London suggested that the plan lacks details and argued for bolder action to tackle the problem sooner. Environmental lawyers currently taking the government to court over air quality view the announcement as a PR stunt.

Marked by vitality , integrity , perseverance , and creativity , Jane 's life and works tell the story of a Royalist woman 's indomitable spirit during the English Civil War and Restoration in England . - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. - Worcester is a city in Worcestershire, England, southwest of Birmingham and north of Gloucester.

Its frontage runs from Chelsea Bridge along the Chelsea Embankment, Cheyne Walk, Lots Road and Chelsea Harbour. Its eastern boundary was once defined by the River Westbourne, which is now in a pipe above Sloane Square tube station. The modern eastern boundary is Chelsea Bridge Road and the lower half of Sloane Street, including Sloane Square. To the north and northwest, the area fades into Knightsbridge and Brompton, but it is considered that the area north of King's Road as far northwest as Fulham Road is part of Chelsea. The football club Chelsea F.C. is based at Stamford Bridge in neighbouring Fulham. - Roundhead was the name given to the supporters of the Parliament of England during the English Civil War. Also known as Parliamentarians, they fought against Charles I of England and his supporters, the Cavaliers or Royalists, who claimed rule by absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings. The goal of the Roundhead party was to give the Parliament supreme control over executive administration. - Viscount Newhaven was a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1681 for Charles Cheyne (or Cheyney), Member of Parliament and Clerk of the Pipe. He was made Lord Cheyne at the same time, also in the Peerage of Scotland.

It was later adopted by the Royalists themselves. Although it referred originally to political and social attitudes and behaviour, of which clothing was a very small part, it has subsequently become strongly identified with the fashionable clothing of the court at the time.

Ruthless killer Steve Michel is known to the public as \\"The Claw\\" for his way of killing his victims with his prosthetic hook. After his accomplices Ryan and Taylor have broken in and stolen furs from the Flawless Furs warehouse, Steve kills the guard with his hook. When the police arrive at the crime scene in the shape of Detective Dick Tracy, he talks to Humphries, who is the owner of the store; Peter Premium, who is a representative for the insurance company; and a man named Cudd, who is the insurance investigator.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"How was vinyl better than shellac when it came to records?\\" Context: \\"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Vinyl offered several advantages over shellac when it came to records. Some of these advantages include: 1. Lighter weight: Vinyl records were significantly lighter than their shellac counterparts. This made them easier to handle, store, and transport. The reduced weight also made a difference when shipping large quantities of records, as it reduced the overall cost and resources needed. 2. Enhanced durability: One of the primary reasons for the development of vinyl records was to address the high fragility of shellac records, which were prone to shattering when dropped or exposed to sudden temperature changes. In contrast, vinyl records were relatively unbreakable and could withstand more rough handling. 3. Improved audio quality: Vinyl records provided lower surface noise compared to shellac, resulting in better sound quality. The vinyl material allowed for a more accurate reproduction of audio signals due to its ability to hold finer groove details. This led to a clearer and more enjoyable listening experience for listeners. 4. Better compatibility with new technologies: After World War II, new record players were introduced with lighter crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or osmium alloy. Vinyl records were better suited for these improved technologies, as they did not wear down as quickly as shellac records under these more delicate components. 5. Greater variety: In addition to the standard black vinyl records, manufacturers started to produce records in a range of colors and special designs, such as RCA Victor's transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings. This allowed for greater visual appeal and collectibility of vinyl records. Despite these advantages, the high cost of vinyl and its vulnerability to damage from heavy pickups and steel needles used in home record players initially made its widespread adoption for 78 rpm records impractical. However, with the introduction of new record player technologies and growing consumer demand for better sound quality, vinyl eventually became the preferred material for both musicians and listeners alike."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The reason may be easy to see: an overloaded tray, a shelf out of reach, a patch of ice on the road. But more often than not there is a chain of events leading up to the misfortune-frustration, tiredness or just bad temper-that show what the accident really is, a sort of attack on oneself. Road accidents, for example, happen frequently after a family quarrel, and we all know people who are _ , so often at odds with themselves and the world that they seem to cause accidents for themselves and others. By definition, an accident is something you cannot predict or avoid, and the idea which used to be current, that the majority of road accidents are caused by a minority of criminally careless drivers, is not supported by insurance statistics. These show that most accidents involve ordinary motorists in a moment of carelessness or thoughtlessness. It is not always clear, either, what sort of conditions make people more likely to have an accident. For instance, the law requires all factories to take safety actions and most companies have safety committees to make sure the regulations are observed, but still, every day in Britain, some fifty thousand men and women are absent from work due to an accident. These accidents are largely the result of human error or misjudgment-noise and fatigue, boredom or worry are possible factors which contribute to this. Doctors who work in factories have found that those who drink too much, usually people who have a high anxiety level, run three times the normal risk of accidents at work.

It could be the most valuable cargo ever sent to the seabed. “I feel very pleased, as a head of state, to inform Colombians that, without any doubt, we have found, the San José galleon 307 years after its sinking,” President Santos said, speaking in Cartagena, the walled city that was a main trading point during colonial times. He had broken the news on Twitter on Friday night, without providing details. “At dawn on Friday, November 27,” he added, “the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History, assisted by the National Navy and foreign scientists, found in the vicinity of Colombia’s Caribbean Coast, an archaeological site that belongs to the Nave Capitana Galeón San José,” the president added. The San José, a crown jewels of shipwrecks, holds a bounty estimated to be worth 4bn-17bn. The vessel is said to have been carrying a cargo of coins and bullion mined and smelted in Peru to Spain’s King Philip V, for his campaign in the war of Spanish succession*. In a video posted on the presidency’s website, Ernesto Montenegro, head of the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History, described the finding as a “major triumph.” The archaeological site holds part of the original galleon’s structure, ballast and bronze cannons. Little else has yet been identified, but the government believes the wreck is untouched. Mr Santos has said all information related to this, is sealed under law as this is a “state affair.” Evidence found of Stone Age wheat trade in UK Investigation of a submerged Stone Age site off Bouldnor Cliff shows that people living there around 6,000BC were consuming a primitive form of wheat. Colombia had been involved in a lengthy legal battle with the Seattle-based commercial salvage company Sea Search Armada, or SSA, over breach of contract and ownership of the bounty. In 1980 a company now owned by SSA located the shipwreck’s area. According to a 2013 statement by the company, “in 1984, the Colombian Parliament enacted a law eliminating SSA’s claims to its property.” In 2011 a US court ruled the ship was the property of the Colombian state. “That treasure lying in its bed of coral,” as Gabriel García Márquez penned in Love in the Time of Cholera, may soon lie somewhere else. Under Colombian law, the treasure is cultural heritage belonging to the nation. The state can claim up to 50 per cent of the value of anything not classified as heritage. *This story has been amended to correct a reference to the war of Spanish succession. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption President Juan Manuel Santos described the find as \\"one of the greatest in history\\" The wreck of a Spanish ship laden with treasure that was sunk by the British more than 300 years ago has been found off the Colombian coast, says President Juan Manuel Santos. \\"Great news! We have found the San Jose galleon,\\" the president tweeted. The wreck was discovered near the port city of Cartagena. It has been described as the holy grail of shipwrecks, as the ship was carrying one of the largest amounts of valuables ever to have been lost at sea. Mr Santos said the cargo was worth at least 1bn (£662m). The San Jose was carrying gold, silver, gems and jewellery collected in the South American colonies to be shipped to Spain's king to help finance his war of succession against the British when it was sunk in June 1708. The vessel was attacked by a British warship just outside Cartagena. Colombian officials would not reveal the precise location of the wreck, but Mr Santos said the find \\"constitutes one of the greatest - if not the biggest, as some say - discoveries of submerged patrimony in the history of mankind\\". He said that a museum would be built in Cartagena to house the ship's treasures. Image copyright AFP Image caption The wreck was discovered last week Image copyright National Maritime Museum Image caption The San Jose was sunk during heavy fighting with the British in 1708 off the coast of Cartagena Ownership of the wreck has been the subject of a long-running legal row. The Colombian government did not mention its long-running quarrel with US-based salvage company Sea Search Armada (SSA) over claims to the treasure. A group now owned by SSA said in 1981 that it had located the area in which the ship sank.

Conflict in this theatre began when the Empire of Japan invaded French Indochina in September 1940 and rose to a new level following the Raid on Pearl Harbor, and simultaneous attacks on Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Malaya on 7/8 December 1941. The main landing at Singora (now Songkhla) on the east side of the Isthmus of Kra preceded the bombing of Pearl Harbor by several hours. Action in the theatre officially ended on 9 September 1945. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known. - The Indian National Army (INA; \\"Azad Hind Fauj\\"); (\\"Lit\\": Free-Indian Army) was an armed force formed by Indian nationalists in 1942 in Southeast Asia during World War II. Its aim was to secure Indian independence from British rule. It formed an alliance with Imperial Japan in the latter's campaign in the Southeast Asian theatre of WWII. The army was first formed in 1942 under Mohan Singh, by Indian PoWs of the British-Indian Army captured by Japan in the Malayan campaign and at Singapore. This first INA collapsed and was disbanded in December that year after differences between the INA leadership and the Japanese military over its role in Japan's war in Asia. It was revived under the leadership of Subhas Chandra Bose after his arrival in Southeast Asia in 1943. The army was declared to be the army of Bose's \\"Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind\\" (the Provisional Government of Free India). Under Bose's leadership, the INA drew ex-prisoners and thousands of civilian volunteers from the Indian expatriate population in Malaya (present-day Malaysia) and Burma. This second INA fought along with the Imperial Japanese Army against the British and Commonwealth forces in the campaigns in Burma, in Imphal and at Kohima, and later against the successful Burma Campaign of the Allies. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census. - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories. - Pueblo is a Home Rule Municipality that is the county seat and the most populous city of Pueblo County, Colorado, United States. The population was 106,595 in 2010 census, making it the 267th most populous city in the United States and the 9th largest in Colorado. Pueblo is the heart of the Pueblo Metropolitan Statistical Area totaling over 160,000 people and an important part of the Front Range Urban Corridor. As of 2014, Pueblo is the primary city of the Pueblo-Cañon City combined statistical area (CSA) totaling approximately 208,000 people, making it the 134th largest in the nation. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The was the historical Japanese nation-state and great power that existed from the Meiji Restoration in 1868 to the enactment of the 1947 constitution of modern Japan. - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - The Burma Campaign in the South-East Asian theatre of World War II was fought in the British colony of Burma primarily between the forces of the British Empire and China, with support from the United States, against the invading forces of the Empire of Japan, Thailand, and the Indian National Army. British Empire forces peaked at around 1,000,000 land, naval and air forces, and were drawn primarily from British India, with British Army forces (equivalent to 8 regular infantry divisions and 6 tank regiments), 100,000 East and West African colonial troops, and smaller numbers of land and air forces from several other Dominions and Colonies. The Burmese Independence Army (known to the legitimate Burmese government and the Allies as the \\"Burmese Traitor Army\\" - BTA) was trained by the Japanese and spearheaded the initial attacks against British Empire forces. - Frank Dow Merrill (December 4, 1903 in Hopkinton, Massachusetts December 11, 1955 in Fernandina Beach, Florida) was a United States Army general and is best remembered for his command of Merrill's Marauders, officially the 5307th Composite Unit (provisional), in the Burma Campaign of World War II. Merrill's Marauders came under General Joseph Stilwell's Northern Combat Area Command. It was a special forces unit modelled on the Chindits' long range penetration groups trained to operate from bases deep behind Japanese lines. - The Cheyenne are one of the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains and their language is of the Algonquian language family. The Cheyenne comprise two Native American tribes, the Só'taeo'o or Só'taétaneo'o (more commonly spelled as Suhtai or Sutaio) and the Tsétsêhéstâhese (also spelled Tsitsistas). These tribes merged in the early 19th century.

Alfred Alder, a famous psychiatrist, had an interesting experience. When he was a small boy he got off to a poor start in arithmetic. His teacher got the idea that he had no ability in arithmetic, and told his parents what she thought in order that they would not expect too much of him. In this way, they too developed the idea, \\"Isn't it too bad that Alfred can't do arithmetic?\\" He accepted their mistaken estimate of his ability, feeling that it was useless to try, and that he was very poor at arithmetic, just as they expected. One day he became very angry at the teacher and the other students because they laughed when he said he saw how to do a problem which none of the other students had been able to solve. Adler succeeded in solving the problem. This gave him confidence. He rejected the idea that he couldn't do arithmetic and was determined to show them that he could. His anger and his new found confidence stimulated him to go at arithmetic problems with a new spirit. He now worked with interest, determination, and purpose, and he soon became extraordinarily good at arithmetic. He not only proved that he could do arithmetic, but he learned early in life from his own experience that, if a person goes at a job with determination and purpose, he may astonish himself as well as others by his ability. This experience made him realize that many people have more ability than they think they have, and that lack of success is as often the result of lack of knowledge of how to apply one's ability, lack of confidence, and lack of determination as it is the result of lack of ability.

Article: Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected mastermind behind the Paris attacks, died during a major police raid in a northern suburb of the French capital. Officials confirmed Abaaoud was the target of the operation that developed into a siege in St Denis on Wednesday, as more details emerged about the man thought to have arranged the shootings which killed 129 people on Friday night. Now a prominent member of Isis, Abaaoud first travelled to Syria last year - but seemingly not out of any great religious motivation. \\"He did not even go to the mosque,” his older sister Yasmina told the New York Times earlier this year. Like many who travel to the so-called “Islamic State”, his actions appear to have been motivated more by a thirst for power, violence and unaccountability. Who was Abdelhamid Abaaoud, mastermind of the Paris attacks? Abaaoud, in his late 20s, was born in Belgium and grew up in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek, which has become a key focus for investigators in recent days. He briefly studied at an exclusive Catholic school, before either dropping out or getting expelled and drifting into a life of thievery and drugs. Abdelhamid Abaaoud boasted of his escape from authorities in Belgium following a failed terrorist attack in an interview published in Isis' propaganda magazine in February According to his family, the young man showed much more interest in petty crime than Islam, and they were shocked when he took his 13-year-old brother Younes with him to travel to Syria in January 2014. After he was trained and further radicalised in Syria, Abaaoud was able to return to Europe via Athens. He was picked up by European security services and reportedly even stopped by police but let go, after which he disappeared. Officials identified the suspected mastermind as Abaaoud, a Belgian of Moroccan origin in his late twenties In February, he gave an interview to the Islamic State English-language magazine Dabiq which suggested he was in Syria. In the interview he claimed he had travelled to Belgium to \\"terrorise the crusaders waging war against the Muslims\\". He also claimed a police officer who stopped him had failed to recognise him even after his picture had been sold to the media.

He said: “I was able to leave and come to Sham (Syria) despite being chased by so many intelligence agencies. “All this proves that a Muslim should not fear the bloated image of the crusader intelligence. My name and picture were all over the news yet I was able to stay in their homeland, plan operations against them, and leave safely when doing so became necessary.” Abaaoud is believed to have had links to previous foiled terror attacks in France, including one on a Paris-bound high-speed train that was thwarted when passengers overpowered a gunman in August. He was thought to have been involved in the attack remotely from Syria – a theory thrown into doubt by this week’s developments. ||||| At about the time Mr. Abaaoud began his return journey to Europe, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, a leader with the Islamic State — he now has a 5 million bounty on his head, offered by the United States — made an impassioned plea for the killings of disbelievers. “If you can kill a disbelieving American or European, especially the spiteful and filthy French, then rely on Allah and kill him in any manner or way however it may be,” Mr. Adnani said in a recorded message. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Western intelligence agencies, worried that the Islamic State was planning to widen its carnage from the Middle East to Europe, tried to track a slow but steady trickle of fighters in Syria as they headed home to the Continent. A Belgian television station reported Monday that security services had been alerted to Mr. Abaaoud’s return to Europe by a telephone call he made from Greece to an inmate, the brother of a known jihadist, in Belgium. The realization among security officials that Mr. Abaaoud was back in Europe led to a major operation to intercept him. A safe house for militants he had helped set up in eastern Belgium was raided in January. There, two of his comrades, including the brother of the inmate he had called, were killed. The Belgian authorities trumpeted the raid as having thwarted “a major terrorist operation.” But it missed its principal target, Mr. Abaaoud, who then somehow made his way back to Syria, which Islamic State refers to by its historical Muslim name, “Sham.” “Allah blinded their vision and I was able to leave and come to Sham despite being chased by so many intelligence agencies,” he later told Dabiq, a slickly produced magazine published by the Islamic State. It is not known whether Mr. Abaaoud had any direct contact in Syria with Mr. Adnani, the architect of what the C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan, on Monday called the Islamic State’s “external operations agenda.” As a low-level fighter, Mr. Abaaoud was unlikely to have mixed with senior figures in the militant group’s hierarchy, experts in Belgium said. But the two men shared a passion for propaganda, with Mr. Adnani serving as the Islamic State’s official spokesman and Mr. Abaaoud featured in various recruitment campaigns. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Abaaoud also had an invaluable asset for Islamic State leaders eager to take their battle to Europe — a pool of friends and contacts back home willing to carry out attacks. Like many of the jihadists who have carried out attacks in Europe, including the brothers who attacked the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January, Mr. Abaaoud showed far more interest in thievery and drugs when he was a young man than in Islam, particularly the highly disciplined, self-sacrificing Salafi strain favored by many militants. Nor was his family impoverished. His father, Omar, owned a clothing store off the market square in Molenbeek, a borough of Brussels, and the family lived nearby in a spacious if shabby corner home on Rue de l’Avenir — Future Street — near the local police station. Despite his subsequent denunciations of the mistreatment suffered by Muslims in Europe, he enjoyed privileges available to few immigrants, including admission to an exclusive Catholic school, Collège Saint-Pierre d’Uccle, in an upscale residential district of Brussels.

An assistant to Saint-Pierre’s director, who declined to give her name, said he had apparently flunked out. Others say he was dismissed for poor behavior. He then drifted into a group of friends in Molenbeek who engaged in various petty crimes. Among his friends were Ibrahim and Salah Abdeslam, two brothers who, like Mr. Abaaoud, lived just a few blocks away and are now at the center of the investigation into the Paris attacks. Ibrahim Abdeslam was one of the suicide bombers on Friday, and Salah Abdeslam, who rented a car in Brussels that was used to transport some of the gunmen in the attacks on Paris, is the target of an extensive manhunt. Mr. Abaaoud was arrested for petty crime in 2010 and spent time in the same prison in Brussels where Ibrahim Abdeslam was being held, according to the spokesman for Belgium’s federal prosecutor and Ibrahim’s former lawyer. It is not known if they were in touch while in the prison, but they did not stay long. After their release, they returned to Molenbeek, often hanging out at a dingy bar known as a hangout for drug dealers. To the dismay of his family, which had not seen him show any religious zeal, Mr. Abaaoud suddenly moved to Syria in the beginning of 2014, according to jihadi experts tracking Belgian militants. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Soon after his arrival in Syria, where he stayed for a time in a grand villa in Aleppo used to house French-speaking jihadists, he explained his choice in a video: “All my life I have seen the blood of Muslims flow. I pray that God breaks the backs of those who oppose him” and “that he exterminates them,” he said. Early this year, the French magazine Paris Match found a film that showed Mr. Abaaoud grinning and making jokes as he dragged corpses with a pickup truck. “I suddenly saw my picture all over the media,” he told Dabiq. He added that “thanks to Allah, the infidels were blinded by Allah” and did not spot him when he returned to Europe at the end of last year. He also somehow persuaded his younger brother, Younes, who was still in Molenbeek and only 13, to join him in Syria. The boy left Belgium for Syria on his own without raising any suspicion from the authorities. Mr. Abaaoud’s father joined a state prosecutor’s case against his son in May for having recruited Younes. “I can’t take it anymore,” Omar Abaaoud told local reporters at the time. “I am on medication,” he said, adding that his son had dishonored the family. “He destroyed our families. I don’t ever want to see him again.” His father is now living in Morocco and wants to put the property on Future Street up for sale, a family friend said. Now, Mr. Abaaoud is suspected of being a leader of a branch of the Islamic State in Syria called Katibat al-Battar al Libi, which has its origins in Libya. This particular branch has attracted many Belgian fighters because of language and cultural ties, said Pieter van Ostaeyen, who tracks Belgian militants. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many Belgian Muslims are of Moroccan origin, he said, and speak a dialect found in eastern Morocco that is similar to a Libyan dialect. Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, who studies jihadi groups at the Middle East Forum, a research center in Washington, said there was no evidence yet that the Paris attacks had been ordered by Mr. Adnani or the Islamic State’s overall leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. But he added that the soldiers at the Libyan branch that includes Mr. Abaaoud had played a prominent role in exporting violence. One of their tasks, he said, has been to organize plots that “involved foreign fighters, sleeper cells in Europe that were connected with an operative inside of Syria and Iraq, usually in a lower to midlevel position.” About 520 Belgian fighters have gone to Syria or Iraq to fight, making Belgium the biggest suspected source, per capita, of foreign fighters for ISIS. According to posts on Twitter and other social media accounts, the two men who were killed during the raid in Verviers, Belgium, in January were members of Katibat al-Battar. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected mastermind behind the deadly Paris attacks in 2015, was a Belgian national of Moroccan origin who grew up in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek. Born in his late 20s, Abaaoud came from a privileged background and briefly attended an exclusive Catholic school before becoming embroiled in a life of petty crime and drug dealing. In 2014, he went to Syria, having shown no prior significant interest in religion, taking his 13-year-old brother with him. Further radicalized after receiving training in Syria, Abaaoud remained undetected by European authorities in his return to Europe via Athens.

The future of global shipping FORTUNE — Not since 1956, when a North Carolina truck driver named Malcom McLean created a standard-size container for cargo, has global shipping seen such radical change. Carriers are bigger than ever, ports are becoming automated, and routes are shifting. The volume of goods that move between ports in Asia now accounts for 13% of all seaborne trade, up nearly a third from a decade ago. Routes through the ice-free far north now beckon. While global shipping volumes rose 6.2% in 2011 and port operators were profitable, owners of container ships were hit hard by overcapacity and falling cargo rates.

Minor Milestones Add Up for Knicks “That’s crazy,” said Eddy Curry, whose emergence has made such progress possible. “It kind of shows you how bad it was last year, being that we really haven’t played great basketball here this year.” Curry called the 23-59 season under Coach Larry Brown “a distant memory,” though it is one that still haunts the franchise. It also is the baseline for measuring improvement, which allows the Knicks to take a curious pride in their sub.-500 record. “It’s not over for us yet,” Curry said. “Everybody here is looking at the big picture, and that’s trying to make the playoffs.” To get there, the Knicks will need more nights like last night, when they showed the right combination of defense and composure to hold off a good opponent. They trailed by 10 points at halftime but took control with a 24-4 run to open the third quarter. With Stephon Marbury (15 points) attacking the basket, the Knicks put the Clippers (24-24) on their heels. Los Angeles made 4 of 19 shots in the third, scored 11 points and never got closer than 3 the rest of the game. “The third quarter was really an impressive quarter for us defensively,” Coach Isiah Thomas said. Given the way the season started, with Thomas bemoaning the Knicks’ lack of a home-court advantage, the .500 home record was no less noteworthy. “I never thought we would see .500 at home,” Thomas said. The Knicks benefited from a huge disparity in free throws, making 36 of 44 shots, compared with the Clippers, who made 14 of 20. Elton Brand led the Clippers with 22 points and 13 rebounds, but he never dominated the game. The Knicks also held Cuttino Mobley, the Clippers’ streaky shooting guard, scoreless. Mobley was guarded by the former Clipper Quentin Richardson and went 0 for 5. Curry again paced the Knicks, with 23 points and 8 rebounds. Jamal Crawford also had 23 points, 8 of them in a late burst that held off the Clippers down the stretch. “We pretty much had the game and we pretty much let it go in the second half,” said Tim Thomas, a former Knick. Thomas, who was sent to Chicago in the Curry trade 16 months ago, made his first return to the Garden and scored 22 points. The Bulls sent Thomas home early last season, and he later signed with Phoenix after the Suns had already played here. Thomas joined the Clippers last summer. The fans booed him, but Thomas, a native of Paterson, N.J., seemed to enjoy his return. He made two 3-pointers and two powerful dunks when the Clippers raced to a 12-point lead in the first half. Thomas dunked hard on David Lee, leaving Lee with a black eye. It was still swollen after the game. “I didn’t even notice it,” said Lee, who finished with 16 points and 10 rebounds. “I was running down court and my eye started to close up. I was more surprised than anything.” Steve Francis is practicing without restrictions and said he hopes to play sometime during the Knicks’ upcoming three-game road trip. “It’s a strong possibility,” said Francis, who has been rehabilitating a sore right knee for the past two months. The Knicks play road games at Utah, the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State before heading into the All-Star Game break. ... Francis was a starter for the first five weeks of the season, but he will probably serve as a backup to Stephon Marbury. The Knicks do not have another natural point guard on the roster. “It gives you some veteran savvy in the backcourt when Marbury goes out and/or goes down,” Coach Isiah Thomas said. “At least you got someone savvy back there, who understands the position.” ... With two weeks left until the trading deadline, Thomas said he is “not looking to make any changes.” He dodged a question about whether he considered any player untouchable in trade talks, saying, “They’re all untouchable right now.” ... The Knicks lost two potential trading chips when they waived Mo Taylor and Jalen Rose — each of whom had an expiring contract — last fall. Their contracts could have been valuable to a team looking to shed payroll. Thomas said he did not regret the moves. “We’re pretty healthy as a franchise,” he said. “I think right now we’re in a place where we’re young enough and we’re good enough that we don’t necessarily need to go spend a lot more money.” However, Thomas refuted the notion that he no longer has the latitude to add payroll. “That is very inaccurate,” he said. ... Jared Jeffries returned after missing one game because of a bruised lower back. He played six minutes and did not score. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The New York Knicks manage to hold off the Los Angeles Clippers with a 24-4 run in the third quarter, showcasing strong defense and composure.

Translate to Romanian: The Ohrid Framework Agreement, which came into force in 2001, brought peace, better co-operation among ethnic communities and more minority rights to Macedonia. Romanian:","completion":"Acordul-cadru de la Ohrid, care a intrat în vigoare în 2001, a adus pacea, o colaborare mai bună între comunitățile etnice și mai multe drepturi pentru minoritățile din Macedonia. Înainte de a analiza mai profund, discutăm cum a apărut Acordul-cadru de la Ohrid. În anul 2001, Republica Macedonia s-a confruntat cu tensiuni etnice între majoritatea slavă și minoritatea albaneză, care reprezenta aproximativ un sfert din populație. În cursul acelui an, un conflict armat a izbucnit între forțele guvernamentale macedonene și grupurile insurgente etnice albaneze, ceea ce a dus la temeri că acesta ar putea escalada într-un război civil. Acordul-cadru de la Ohrid a fost semnat la data de 13 august 2001 de către reprezentanții guvernului macedonean, rebelii albanezi, precum și membri ai comunității internaționale, inclusiv Uniunea Europeană și Statele Unite. Acest acord a pus capăt conflictului armat și a stabilit un nou temei pentru coexistența interetnică și drepturile minorităților în Macedonia. Unele dintre aspectele cheie ale Acordului-cadru de la Ohrid au fost: 1. Asigurarea reprezentării adecvate a etniilor la toate nivelurile guvernamentale, inclusiv atât în ​​administrarea centrală, cât și locală, precum și în instituțiile publice și în justiție. 2. Extinderea limbii albaneze ca limbă oficială în zonele în care aceasta este vorbită de cel puțin 20% din populație și recunoașterea ei ca limbă oficială la nivel național în cazul comunicării oficiale. 3. Reformarea educației pentru a asigura respectarea diversității și drepturilor culturale ale minorităților, inclusiv învățământul în limba albaneză la toate nivelurile și diversificarea curriculelor pentru a reflecta identitatea și cultura comunității albaneze. 4. Adoptarea unor măsuri de integrare a rebelilor albanezi dezarmați în forțele armate și în poliție, precum și punerea în practică a unui program de dezarmare și demobilizare în vederea prevenirii viitoarelor conflicte armate. Acordul-cadru de la Ohrid a fost important pentru stabilitatea și dezvoltarea Macedoniei, deoarece a adus pacea și a asigurat condițiile pentru o colaborare mai bună între diferitele comunități etnice. De asemenea, a permis oportunități sporite pentru minoritatea albaneză în domeniile social, politic și economic.

Question: Information: - Demon in My View is a vampire novel written by Amelia Atwater - Rhodes , and published on May 9 , 2000 . Originally entitled Bitter Life , it was published when the author was 16 . It is the follow - up to In the Forests of the Night , which she wrote at the age of 13 . The title refers Edgar Allan Poe 's poem \`\` Alone '' , which appears in the beginning of the book . The novel was an ALA Quick Pick . The Bulletin of the Center for Children 's Books remarked that it is \`\` A fast - paced vampire novel '' , while Publishers Weekly has said that \`\` readers will drain ... in one big gulp \`\` . The Bulletin calls it '' a fast - paced vampire novel with an anti-Buffy heroine and a studly vampire who are n't going to let a little thing like death stand between them . \`\` - The vrykolakas (Greek , pronounced ), variant vorvolakas or vourdoulakas, is a harmful undead creature in Greek folklore. It has similarities to many different legendary creatures, but is generally equated with the vampire of the folklore of the neighbouring Slavic countries. While the two are very similar, blood-drinking is only marginally associated with the \\"vrykolakas\\". - Shroud usually refers to an item, such as a cloth, that covers or protects some other object. The term is most often used in reference to \\"burial sheets\\", mound shroud, grave clothes, winding-cloths or winding-sheets, such as the famous Shroud of Turin or \\"Tachrichim\\" (burial shrouds) that Jews are dressed in for burial. Traditionally, mound shrouds are made of white cotton, wool or linen, though any material can be used so long as it is made of natural fibre. Intermixture of two or more such fibres is forbidden, a proscription that ultimately derives from the Torah, \\"viz.\\", Deut. 22:11. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder. - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. - A vampire is a being from folklore who subsists by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Although vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures, the term \\"vampire\\" was not popularized in the West until the early 18th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, although local variants were also known by different names, such as \\"shtriga\\" in Albania, \\"vrykolakas\\" in Greece and \\"strigoi\\" in Romania. This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to mass hysteria and in some cases resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism. - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU. - Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. - Amelia Holt Atwater-Rhodes (born April 16, 1984), known professionally as Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, is an American author of fantasy and young adult literature. - In the Forests of the Night is a vampire novel written by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and published in 1999. Originally entitled White Wine, she wrote it at the age of thirteen. The book was published on May 11, 1999, about a month after she turned fifteen. It is the first novel in the Den of Shadows. It tells the story of a three-hundred-year-old vampire named Risika and her struggles throughout her life, both before and after she was transformed. The novel is told in first-person narrative by the protagonist, Risika. It was well received by critics. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - The undead are beings in mythology, legend, or fiction that are deceased but behave as if alive. A common example of an undead being is a corpse re-animated by supernatural forces, by the application of the deceased's own life force, or that of another being (such as a demon). The undead may be incorporeal like ghosts, or corporeal like vampires and zombies. The undead are featured in the belief systems of most cultures, and appear in many works of fantasy and horror fiction. The term is also occasionally used for putative non-supernatural cases of re-animation, from early experiments like Robert E. Cornish's to future sciences such as cryonics and chemical brain preservation. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'series' with 'den of shadows'.

After the September 11 attacks, it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the US government gave 245 million dollars to the new evildoers du jour. Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001. Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies. Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords, it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid -- the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage. Never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal. Never mind that this is all documented on Michael Moore's website about the film. Gun homicides. Statistics are Moore's weakest point, and it is surprising that his critics don't dwell on them longer. That's because they know all too well that Moore is correct: The United States have a far greater homicide rate (both gun- and non-gun) than most other first world countries.

In what would be his first screenplay, based on his own short story \\"Turn About,\\" William Faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty, sacrifice, and really strange relationships. The story originally was about only the Tone, Young, and Cooper characters, but MGM needed to put Joan Crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract, and Faulkner obliged by creating a female role. Crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her co-stars' Young and Tone, leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraph-like shorthand that sounds like a Monty Python sketch (\\"Wuthering Heights\\" performed in semaphore). Seriously, the almost entirely pronoun-less sentences make Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James. The film also reflects some familiar Faulkner themes, with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister (as may be found in his \\"Sanctuary,\\" and elsewhere). When Young proposes to Crawford, in Tone's presence, in lieu of an engagement ring ALL THREE exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another. The closeness of Tone and Young is also noticeable, especially as they go off to their Thelma & Louise fate. Frankly, it's creepy. Not as creepy to this New Yorker, however, as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach, Wellington, which Crawford cheerfully catches (and which is shown gamboling over her hands--I had to turn away!) and Young turns into a gladiator. Blech. That being said, there are some nice performances. Young is particularly engaging in a scene where he's taken up in Cooper's fighter plane, and Roscoe Karns is delightful as Cooper's flying buddy. Tone, despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue, has a nice moment, dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy Young's fate. Crawford, stripped of meaningful dialogue as well, mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic, which is quite a balancing act for one role. The battle scenes--not surprisingly, for a Howard Hawks film--are the most exciting part of the entire picture. But not enough.

The first question, \\"Why can flat maps never be as accurate as a globe?\\" is related to cartography (map-making) and is seeking an explanation for the limitation of representing a three-dimensional globe accurately on a two-dimensional flat surface. It is exploring the fundamental challenges involved in mapping the Earth's surface on a flat plane. The limitation exists because Earth is a sphere, and a flat map is a two-dimensional representation. Cartographers must employ mathematical projections to convert geographical coordinates from a spherical Earth onto a flat map. This process results in inevitable distortions in distance, direction, scale, or area. The areas near the poles usually appear larger than they actually are, while the countries along the equator may look smaller. So, in order to create a flat map, cartographers must choose which inaccuracies to prioritize and which properties to preserve. A globe, on the other hand, is a three-dimensional representation of the Earth that allows for far more accurate scaling and positioning. Distortions that occur on flat maps are minimized, as a globe maintains the correct relative size and shape of continents and oceans. The second question, \\"Which shadow mapping technique is fast and accurate?\\" is related to computer graphics. Shadow mapping is a technique used in 3D photo-realistic rendering, where shadows are added to objects to give the scene a more realistic look. The question seeks suggestions for the most efficient shadow mapping methods that offer both speed and accuracy. Several widely used shadow mapping techniques are available, each with its own pros and cons. Some techniques include: 1. Standard Shadow Mapping: A basic technique that renders the scene from the light source's point of view and checks if each pixel is in shadow or not, based on depth information. 2. Percentage-Closer Filtering (PCF): An extension to standard shadow mapping that takes a percentage of the pixels in the shadow to improve the appearance and reduce aliasing artifacts. 3. Variance Shadow Mapping (VSM): Stores depth variance information to enable smoother shadow transitions while also reducing light-bleeding artifacts. Different techniques may be faster or more accurate depending on the specific scene and requirements. It is essential to consider factors such as the complexity and size of the scene, the desired visual quality, and hardware limitations when choosing the most appropriate technique for a given scenario. In conclusion, these two questions address different subjects - one is about cartography and the other about computer graphics - and, therefore, they do not have the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about Liebe des Totes (the love of the dead) or something similar. This of course awoke my curiosity so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (The Death King). The Nekromantik movies are Ok, even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject Necrophilia (even if they obviously are horror-opera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind, they are actually quite funny.) TODESKING, on the other hand is, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. It consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a reliever, Death as the very fysical decomposition of the body. The film is a metaphor over life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. It reduces its viewers to the childs they (we) actually are. The fact that we cannot really understand the nature of Death, and hence neither the process of dying, is the core message of the film. This is a most realistic film. Never does Buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever. No matter what moral standards you set up, death is unevitable, and will sooner or later be not a fiction but YOUR reality. This applies to YOU, Dear Reader, like it applies to the viewers of the film. Some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this, which is fully excused, since they of course will live forever... This is no exploitation movie. Why? Because death does not exploit us humans. It harvests us. We grow for seven days, then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of pre-birth, that is Death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales. Whether you choose to regard it as \\"optimistic\\" or \\"pessimistic\\" is up to you. At first glance it may seem very dark. Consider though, that in order for something to live, something else must die. \\"Who wants to live forever?\\" I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body, that are being consumed by maggots, he shows not only decomposition, but GENERATION of new life. Is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil, than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre? When you realize this, you see Der Todesking it its right context. Sieben Tage hat die Woche, siebenmal letzte Stunden. Seven are the days of week (weak, mortal !), seven times the last hour. Dont fear the Reaper, Buttgereit tells us, because the Reaper takes only what is ripe. And apples that are not plucked for food will rot! Have a good life, fellow IMDB'ers !

A team of doctors from the Mayo Clinic declared Friday that there appears to be no physical reason why Sen. John McCain, the 71-year-old presumed Republican presidential candidate, could not carry out the duties of the office. \\"Sen. McCain enjoys excellent health and displays extraordinary energy, and, while it is impossible to predict any person's future health, I and my colleagues can find no medical reason or problem that would preclude Sen. McCain from fulfilling all of the duties or obligations of the president of the United States,\\" said Dr. John D. Eckstein, an internist who has been overseeing McCain's treatment for 16 years at the famed research center's campus in Scottsdale, Arizona. McCain has been undergoing periodic examinations there since the 1990s and annual examinations since 2000, Eckstein said. His most recent comprehensive examination took place in March, with follow-up tests this month. The doctors described a number of health issues faced by McCain, many of them typical for a man of his age but at least one of them potentially serious. McCain has had four malignant melanomas removed. Three of them -- on his left shoulder, left arm and left nasal wall -- were limited to the top skin layer and were not invasive. They were removed in 1993, 2000 and 2002, and all were declared Stage 0, of little long-term concern. But a fourth melanoma proved to be invasive and was removed from his left lower temple in 2000, Eckstein said. The surgery on McCain's temple was carried out in August 2000 by Dr. Michael Hinni, who described the melanoma as 2.2 mm thick at the thickest point and 2 cm across. Hinni said that, in order to leave a 2 cm margin that would minimize the risk of leaving some of the cancer intact, he had to remove a patch of skin roughly 6 cm in diameter, as well as an underlying carotid salivary gland from McCain's face. Dissection of dozens of lymph nodes showed no evidence that the cancer had spread, he said. According to the American Cancer Society, such a melanoma would be classified as Stage IIA, which is associated with a five-year survival rate of about 78 percent and a 10-year survival rate of about 66 percent. The wound required major reconstruction and has left the senator with a mass of scar tissue on his face. His left jaw appears prominent because because there was an absence of soft tissue on the face in front of his ear, Hinni said. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who reviewed McCain's medical records, found previously unreported details about the operation. Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta on McCain's health records ». McCain developed swelling beneath the skin and had to be taken back for a second operation. One in 58 Americans will develop malignant melanoma in their lifetime, said Dr. Suzanne Connolly, McCain's dermatologist. This year, an estimated 116,500 cases will be diagnosed in the United States, with more than 62,000 of them invasive, she said. McCain has many of the risk factors associated with the cancer: light skin, light-colored eyes and a history of excessive sun exposure, she said. Though there is no sign of recurrence, McCain monitors his skin carefully, is examined by his dermatologist every three to four months and \\"practices good habits of sun safety,\\" she said. Connolly described the candidate's prognosis as good. \\"There is no way to predict with certainty the percentage, but the percentage would be thought to be in the single-digit area,\\" she said. McCain has also been treated for other less serious skin cancers, but Eckstein did not specify how many. McCain has had a number of more routine interactions with his doctors, not unusual for a man of his age. He has had four small kidney stones in his right kidney and a number of small benign cysts in both kidneys, but his kidney function is normal, Eckstein said. In August 2001, McCain noticed blood in his urine, and doctors found stones in his bladder that they used lasers to break apart. At the same time, they surgically removed enlarged prostate tissue, which was the cause of the bleeding, Eckstein said. Since then, McCain's urination has been normal, Eckstein said. McCain's prostate has showed no signs of cancer, and his prostate-specific antigen test -- which can indicate prostate cancer risk -- was also normal, Eckstein said. He said McCain takes the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide to prevent the formation of kidney stones. He takes the diuretic in a 25 mg dose, which is also the standard for treating high blood pressure. Eckstein said that, though McCain's systolic rate -- the top number in a blood pressure reading -- had sometimes been slightly high, the drug was being prescribed solely for kidney stone prevention. He added that he has encouraged McCain to reduce his salt intake, another method of lowering blood pressure. McCain first had an adenomatous colon polyp removed in the 1990s. Though the next two tests -- performed years apart -- proved negative, the most recent test carried out last month revealed six of the polyps, all of which were removed, Eckstein said. Though the polyps were all of the type that are potentially precancerous, they were found so early that they pose little threat, he said. McCain will continue to have periodic colonoscopies, the doctor said. McCain has displayed no evidence of heart disease or other cardiovascular disease, Eckstein said. \\"Indeed, he walked the Grand Canyon rim to rim in August 2006\\" and hikes whenever his schedule permits, he said. A stress echocardiogram carried out in March was \\"entirely normal,\\" he said. McCain has also been treated for high lipid levels. Eckstein said he originally prescribed Vytorin, but a recent study raised questions about its efficacy, and he recently switched the Republican candidate to simvastatin. McCain has had orthopedic problems in the past, many of them traced to October 1967, when the Navy flier's plane was shot down over Vietnam. He broke both arms and a leg when he ejected and spent the next 5½ years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi. During that time, he was beaten and tortured repeatedly, suffering fractures of both shoulders. Because he received no treatment for his fractures, they healed improperly, leaving him with reduced range of motion for his shoulders, arms and right knee, Eckstein said. McCain takes a daily aspirin to prevent formation of blood clots; an occasional Zyrtec, an antihistamine used for nasal allergies; and the sleep agent Ambien CR for treatment of insomnia when he travels. He also takes a multi-vitamin tablet. Some reporters, including CNN's, were allowed to examine McCain's medical records. In one, McCain's fasting blood sugar value was described as \\"impaired.\\" Asked to elaborate, Eckstein said he thought that the note referred to a 111 mg/dl blood sugar, with normals \\"in most labs\\" being between 70 mg/dl and 100 mg/dl. Eckstein said he followed that test result with another that he did not identify, \\"which was completely normal.\\" McCain, a two-pack-a-day smoker for 25 years, quit in 1980. He recently had a CT scan of his chest performed, and it proved normal, Eckstein said. The former pilot also sometimes experiences occasional dizziness when he stands, a benign condition called positional vertigo, Eckstein said. \\"When he and many other people arise from sitting or lying down, they get a sudden whirling sensation which may last two to five seconds and then disappears,\\" he said. \\"It does not indicate any vascular problem to the brain, and it is not a precursor to stroke.\\" McCain's father died of a stroke at age 70, but his 96-year-old mother is in good health and has appeared on the campaign trail with him. McCain released his medical records voluntarily. He did the same when he ran for president in 2000. The two Democrats competing for their party's nomination, Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton, have not released their doctors' files. Obama's campaign said it will release a summary of his medical condition next week, composed by his primary care physician.

This Week 12 showdown between the Colts and Eagles was originally scheduled for 1:00 ET, but due to the NFL's \\"flexible-scheduling\\" system this year, the NFL moved the game to Sunday night at 8:15 ET. This was the Colts' third primetime game this year on NBC, and the Eagles' first. There were 10 scores in this game, 5 each half. The first three scores of the game were by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai. He had a 15-yard TD run, a 10-yard TD run, and another 15-yard TD run after that. His fourth rushing touchdown of the game came in the second half. The Eagles' first score came with about a minute to go in the half. Quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to L.J. Smith on that drive. On the Colts' next drive, combined with a couple passes and a 13-yard run by Dominic Rhodes, the Colts put K Adam Vinatieri in field goal range to get some more points before the end of the half. At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24-7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31-7. On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a 3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game. Joseph Addai tied the NFL record for most touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with 4 touchdowns in this game.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others?

The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Is there a difference in meaning between \\"It's too late to telephone. Mary is asleep now.\\" and \\"It's too late to telephone. Mary will be asleep now.\\"? Yes. The difference is in the reason given for it being too late to telephone. In the first sentence \\"Mary is asleep now\\", the speaker is stating a fact. In the second sentence \\"Mary will be asleep now\\", the speaker is saying what Mary usually does. In fact, it's possible that Mary isn't asleep, but she is usually asleep at this time. So let's take two situations. In the first case, imagine Mary's mother answers the telephone. You: \\"May I speak to Mary, please?\\" Mother: \\"No. It's too late. Mary is asleep now.\\" You: \\"Are you sure? It's only 10 0'clock.\\" Mother: \\"Yes. I went to her room and she was asleep.\\" The mother knows that Mary is asleep because she went into her room and saw her. Here is another case. Two friends decide to telephone Mary. Jack: \\"Let's telephone Mary. It's 10 0'clock.\\" Jill: \\"No. It's too late. She will be asleep now.\\" Jill knows that Mary always goes to bed before 10 o'clock, so now she'll probably be asleep. But it is also possible that she is staying up late. In which situation do you think the word \\"will\\" is used in the same way Jill uses it? A) Will you please lend me a hand? B) It's too heavy, I think. I'll help you. C) Don't get into his office. He will be angry now. D) You won't have to come to my office. I will send it to you. Answer:","completion":"The word \\"will\\" is used in the same way Jill uses it in option C) Don't get into his office. He will be angry now. In this situation, the speaker is making an assumption or prediction about the person's emotional state based on their knowledge of that person's habits or typical reactions. Just like in Jill's example, where she assumes Mary will be asleep based on her usual bedtime, the speaker in this option is assuming that the person in the office will be angry at the moment, possibly due to their regular temper or behavior in certain situations. In the other options, the usage of \\"will\\" is different: A) Will you please lend me a hand? - Here, \\"will\\" is being used to make a polite request instead of expressing an assumption or prediction. B) It's too heavy, I think. I'll help you. - In this example, \\"will\\" is used to express a future intention or decision made at the moment of speaking. D) You won't have to come to my office. I will send it to you. - In this case, \\"will\\" is used to make a future promise or assurance to the listener. In summary, the difference between \\"It's too late to telephone. Mary is asleep now.\\" and \\"It's too late to telephone. Mary will be asleep now.\\" lies in the speaker's level of certainty and the basis of their claim. In the first sentence, the speaker is sure that Mary is asleep, while in the second sentence, the speaker assumes Mary will be asleep based on her usual habits without necessarily confirming whether she is actually asleep or not. Option C best demonstrates the same usage of \\"will\\" as in the second sentence, where the speaker expresses an assumption or prediction regarding another person's behavior or emotional state without direct evidence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sides disregarded the laws of war, committing human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial executions and revenge attacks. On 26 February the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1970, suspending Libya from the UN Human Rights Council, implementing sanctions and calling for an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the killing of unarmed civilians.

Question: Information: - The Arabian Peninsula, simplified Arabia (\\"\\", « Arabian island ») is a peninsula of Western Asia situated northeast of Africa on the Arabian plate. From a geological perspective, it is considered a subcontinent of Asia. - Yemen ('), officially known as the Republic of Yemen ('), is an Arab country in Western Asia, occupying South Arabia, the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula. Yemen is the second-largest country in the peninsula, occupying 527,970 km (203,850 sq mi). The coastline stretches for about 2,000 km (1,200 mi). It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, and Oman to the east-northeast. Although Yemen's constitutionally stated capital is the city of Sana'a, the city has been under rebel control since February 2015. Because of this, Yemen's capital has been temporarily relocated to the port city of Aden, on the southern coast. Yemen's territory includes more than 200 islands; the largest of these is Socotra. - Socotra ('), also spelled Soqotra, is an island and a small archipelago of four islands in the Arabian Sea. The territory is part of Yemen, and had long been a subdivision of the Aden Governorate. In 2004, it became attached to the Hadhramaut Governorate, which is much closer to the island than Aden (although the nearest governorate was the Al Mahrah Governorate). In 2013, the archipelago became its own governorate, the Soqatra Governorate. - Sana'a (also spelled Sanaa or Sana; \\"\\" ) is the largest city in Yemen and the centre of Sana'a Governorate. The city is not part of the Governorate, but forms the separate administrative district of \\"Amanat Al-Asemah\\". Under the Yemeni constitution, Sana'a is the capital of the country, although the seat of the internationally recognised government moved to Aden in the aftermath of the 201415 Yemeni coup d'état. Aden was declared as the temporary capital by President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi in March 2015. - Ash - Shihr ( Arabic : ) ( transliteration al - Shir ) is a coastal town in Hadhramaut , southern Yemen . It is located at around 14 ° 45 39 \`\` N 49 ° 36 25 '' E. It was a part of the Qu'aiti Sultanate before the unified Yemen was formed . Ash Shihr was involved in the export of frankincense in ancient times , to places as far as China . - The Red Sea (also the Erythraean Sea) is a seawater inlet of the Indian Ocean, lying between Africa and Asia. The connection to the ocean is in the south through the Bab el Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden. To the north lie the Sinai Peninsula, the Gulf of Aqaba, and the Gulf of Suez (leading to the Suez Canal). The Red Sea is a Global 200 ecoregion. The sea is underlain by the Red Sea Rift which is part of the Great Rift Valley. - The Gulf of Aden (\\"\\") is a gulf located in the Arabian Sea between Yemen, on the south coast of the Arabian Peninsula, and Somalia in the Horn of Africa. In the northwest, it connects with the Red Sea through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, which is more than 20 miles wide. It shares its name with the port city of Aden in Yemen, which forms the northern shore of the gulf. Historically, the Gulf of Aden was known as \\"The Gulf of Berbera\\", named after the ancient Somali port city of Berbera on the south side of the gulf. However, as the city of Aden grew during the colonial era, the name of \\"Gulf of Aden\\" was popularised. - The Arabian Sea is a region of the northern Indian Ocean bounded on the north by Pakistan and Iran, on the west by northeastern Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula, and on the east by India. Historically the sea has been known by other names including the Erythraean Sea and the Persian Sea. Its total area is and its maximum depth is . The Gulf of Aden is in the southwest, connecting the Arabian Sea to the Red Sea through the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Oman is in the northwest, connecting it to the Persian Gulf. - Oman (; ' ), officially the Sultanate of Oman, is an Arab country on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. Holding a strategically important position at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, the nation is bordered by the United Arab Emirates to the northwest, Saudi Arabia to the west, and Yemen to the southwest, and shares marine borders with Iran and Pakistan. The coast is formed by the Arabian Sea on the southeast and the Gulf of Oman on the northeast. The Madha and Musandam exclaves are surrounded by the UAE on their land borders, with the Strait of Hormuz (which it shares with Iran) and Gulf of Oman forming Musandam's coastal boundaries. - Aden (, ; \\"\\" ) is a port city in Yemen, located by the eastern approach to the Red Sea (the Gulf of Aden), some east of Bab-el-Mandeb. Its population is approximately 800,000 people. Aden's ancient, natural harbour lies in the crater of a dormant volcano which now forms a peninsula, joined to the mainland by a low isthmus. This harbour, Front Bay, was first used by the ancient Kingdom of Awsan between the 5th and 7th centuries BC. The modern harbour is on the other side of the peninsula. Aden gives its name to the Gulf of Aden. - Western Asia, West Asia, Southwestern Asia or Southwest Asia is the westernmost subregion of Asia. The concept is in limited use, as it significantly overlaps with the Middle East (or Near East), the main difference being the exclusion of Egypt (which would be counted as part of North Africa). The term is sometimes used for the purposes of grouping countries in statistics. - Saudi Arabia, officially known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), is an Arab sovereign state in Western Asia constituting the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula. With a land area of approximately , Saudi Arabia is geographically the fifth-largest state in Asia and second-largest state in the Arab world after Algeria. Saudi Arabia is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north, Kuwait to the northeast, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates to the east, Oman to the southeast, and Yemen to the south. It is separated from Israel and Egypt by the Gulf of Aqaba. It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert or barren landforms. - South Arabia is a historical region that consists of the southern region of the Arabian Peninsula, mainly centered in what is now the Republic of Yemen, yet it has historically also included Najran, Jizan, and 'Asir, which are presently in Saudi Arabia, and the Dhofar of present-day Oman.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". where is the maximum possible exposure that does not lead to a clipped or bloomed camera output. Typically, the lower limit of the saturation speed is determined by the sensor itself, but with the gain of the amplifier between the sensor and the analog-to-digital converter, the saturation speed can be increased. The factor 78 is chosen such that exposure settings based on a standard light meter and an 18-percent reflective surface will result in an image with a grey level of 18%/√2 = 12.7% of saturation. The factor √2 indicates that there is half a stop of headroom to deal with specular reflections that would appear brighter than a 100% reflecting white surface. What can too much exposure lead to?","completion":"Too much exposure can lead to a clipped or bloomed camera output. Clipping occurs when the camera sensor is exposed to more light than it can handle, causing the highlights in the image to become overexposed and lose detail. This results in a loss of information in the overexposed areas, which usually appear as completely white or blown-out spots in the image. Blooming is a similar effect in which an overexposed area spills over into adjacent pixels, causing a spreading or smearing of bright regions in the image. Both clipping and blooming can negatively impact the overall image quality, reducing the dynamic range and making it difficult to recover details in post-processing or editing."},{"prompt":"Q: You are given a sentence in Japanese.

The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: This is a general estimate of the minimum amount of space needed if you plan to let your cattle rely primarily on field roughage (grass) for food all year round. This estimate takes into account the fact that grass production slows in the winter months. More space is even better since it gives you a safety net in the event of any grass problems or drought. If you are working with a small farm space, it simply means that you’ll need to provide food supplementation in the form of cattle feed. Talk with your livestock vet about exactly how much grain your herd will require throughout the year, as it will vary by season. You can buy cattle feed at your local feed store or even online via bulk suppliers. Cattle feed is usually a blend of grains, such as barley or wheat. There is no exact formula to figure out how to size paddocks or how to divide cattle into them. Take inventory of the animals that you own and think about natural divisions, such as keeping cows/calves separate from bulls. You’ll also want to balance out your herd, so that it will be easier to rotate between paddocks. As a general rule, the smaller your paddocks are, the more often you’ll need to rotate your cattle to keep them from depleting the area’s resources. Once you know the rough size and number of your paddocks, look at an overhead map of your land. Separate your land into square-shaped paddocks with alleys in between them. When mapping everything out, try to divide up natural water features. Also, consider the location of any watering holes or stations. Ideally, you want your animals to avoid trekking up and down rough or uneven terrain to get to water. Segmenting shaded spaces into separate paddocks can also help minimize grass damage. As cows gather in shaded areas they tend to ruin the surrounding grass, so it’s best to isolate this activity to keep your grass healthy. Because there is always a bit of guesswork involved in paddock design, installing temporary polywire or polytape fencing lets you make adjustments as necessary without a major hassle. Use fiberglass or industrial plastic posts and attach the poly fencing in between at the height of a cow’s head. Electrifying the fence can provide an added level of security, too. Your alleys should be somewhere between 16 to 20 feet (4.9 to 6.1 m) wide. This makes it easier to mow or move machinery in between paddocks. Placing a fine layer of gravel on your alleys will keep them from getting too muddy. Place your gates in the corners and design them with the rotation of animals between paddocks in mind. Make the transition to permanent fencing by using a rail and board or steel post design. If you plan to plant fresh grass in your paddock, do so at least 6 weeks before introducing your cattle. Kentucky bluegrass, alfalfa, orchard grass, and white clover are all good sources of nutrients for cattle. If you place your entire herd into a single paddock, they will eat away at the grasses and ruin the space. Instead, move your herd once or twice a day to different paddock spaces. Round up your cattle, open the connecting gates between paddocks, and drive your cattle into the new paddock space. For example, you’ll need to protect paddocks with less productive grasses, such as Kentucky bluegrass. You may need to rotate your cattle out of this space more frequently. Adjust how frequently you rotate your cattle according to the specific season. In the spring and summer, you’ll need to move them more frequently to keep up with the grass growth. If extreme weather hits, you need to be able to move your cattle to a paddock with high ground, so that they can ride out the rain or flooding without injuries. Alternatively, you can build a barn or fenced in area with roof coverage for your cattle, but this is a luxury that many cattle owners do not create. If you choose to keep your cattle in a contained area, muck out the manure regularly to avoid the spread of diseases. Check that the flooring of any housing is slip-resistant. This will reduce the possibility of injury to the animals, especially in wet conditions. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article discusses the importance of proper paddock management and rotation for cattle that primarily rely on field roughage (grass) for food all year round. It emphasizes the need for spacing, supplementation with cattle feed, and balancing herds for efficient rotation. The article also provides guidelines for designing paddocks, including the use of temporary fencing, alley width, gate placement, and dividing natural resources like water and shade. Furthermore, the article suggests optimal grass species for cattle nutrition, different rotation frequencies based on grass productivity and seasons, and the consideration of extreme weather conditions.

New Orleans narcotics detective Anthony Stowe is a heroin addict who is teetering on the edge of oblivion, and he could not care less. At the moment, he is trying to bring down his former partner Gabriel Callahan, who has become a drug kingpin. Callahan is trying to, and slowly succeeding at, taking over the New Orleans underworld. Stowe botches a sting operation against Callahan, resulting in the death of fellow cop Maria Ronson, whose fiancée, fellow cop Van Huffel, nearly comes to blows with him over it. Chief Mac Baylor has a very blunt chat with Stowe, who is dismissive. Stowe is approached by fellow cop Walter Curry to help his nephew beat a drug-dealing charge; he instead turns Curry over to Baylor, who fires him. After barricading himself in the station bathroom, Walter confronts an unrepentant Stowe and condemns him for betraying his fellow officers. That night Stowe meets with his estranged wife, Valerie, who tells him that she's pregnant, but that he's not the father. Valerie, whose marriage with Stowe is close to collapse, has been seeing a man named Mark Rossini, the gym teacher at the school she is principal of. But he may not be the father either. Stowe brashly accuses Valerie of being impregnated by Callahan, and she tells him she never wants to see him again. The only thing keeping Stowe from total collapse is his dogged pursuit of Callahan. But he drunkenly stumbles into an ambush masterminded by Callahan, and is shot in the head by Callahan's right-hand man Jimmy. Stowe undergoes emergency surgery, and ends up in a coma. Months later, he recovers to the point that he opens his eyes, and is transported to his and Valerie's house to recover properly. Answer:","completion":"Jimmy"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Graeme Obree (born 11 September 1965), nicknamed The Flying Scotsman, is a Scottish racing cyclist who twice broke the world hour record, in July 1993 and April 1994, and was the individual pursuit world champion in 1993 and 1995. He was known for his unusual riding positions and for the Old Faithful bicycle he built which included parts from a washing machine. He joined a professional team in France but was fired before his first race. Obree has created some radical innovations in bicycle design and cycling position but has had problems with the cycling authorities banning the riding positions his designs required. Obree had built frames for his bike shop and made another for his record attempt. Instead of traditional dropped handlebars it had straight bars like those of a mountain bike. He placed them closer to the saddle than usual and rode with the bars under his chest, his elbows bent and tucked into his sides like those of a skier. Watching a washing machine spin at 1,200rpm led him to take the bearings, which he assumed must be of superior quality, and fit them to his bike. Obree later regretted admitting to the bearings experiment, because journalists referred to that before his achievements and other innovations. Obree called his bike \\"Old Faithful\\". It has a narrow bottom bracket, around which the cranks revolve, to bring his legs closer together, as he thought this is the \\"natural\\" position. As shown in the film, he thought a tread of \\"one banana\\" would be ideal. The bike has no top tube, so that his knees did not hit the frame. The chainstays are not horizontal to the ground. Thus the cranks can pass with a narrow bottom bracket. The fork had only one blade, carefully shaped to be as narrow as possible. A French writer who tried it said the narrow handlebars made it hard to accelerate the machine in a straight line but, once it was at speed, he could hold the bars and get into Obree's tucked style. At a high enough speed, [I could] tuck in my arms. And, above all, get in a very forward position on the bike, on the peak of the saddle. The Obree position isn't advantageous simply aerodynamically, it also allows, by pushing the point of pedalling towards the rear, to benefit from greater pressure while remaining in the saddle. You soon get an impression of speed, all the greater because you've got practically nothing [deux fois rien] between your hands. Two other things I noticed after a few hundred metres: I certainly didn't have the impression of turning 53 x 13, and the Obree position is no obstruction to breathing. But I wasn't pedalling at 55kmh, 100 turns of the pedals a minute, yet my arms already hurt.

With the average CEO tenure in the United States lasting just 8.4 years (as reported by Equilar), it is truly remarkable when a CEO can not only maintain their position, but also successfully steer a company through turbulence and transform its business practices to thrive in market evolutions. This article highlights some of the most prominent long-serving CEOs in America, who have been at the helm of their organizations for more than half a century, combining leadership experience, adaptability, and vision that has ensured long-term success. 1. Warren Buffett: Berkshire Hathaway (52 Years) Warren Buffet, commonly known as the Oracle of Omaha, is perhaps one of the most widely recognized CEOs across the globe. With a net worth of over 84 billion, Buffett has cemented his position as a legendary investor and business magnate. He became Berkshire Hathaway's CEO in 1965 and has since grown the small textile conglomerate into a formidable multinational holding company. Under Buffet's leadership, Berkshire Hathaway has held diverse interests from insurance and banking to retail and transportation, consistently delivering above-average returns for its shareholders. Buffett is known for his long-term approach to investing and his knack for identifying undervalued assets. His wisdom and thought leadership are sought by prominent investors, politicians, and global leaders, and his \\"value investing\\" strategy has become the cornerstone of many investment portfolios. 2. Leslie H. Wexner: L Brands (58 Years) As the founder and former CEO of L Brands, formerly known as Limited Brands, Leslie H. Wexner has led the retail fashion empire for more than five decades. He started Limited in 1963 with a single store in Columbus, Ohio, and grew the enterprise into a multibillion-dollar retail conglomerate which includes acclaimed brands such as Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, and formerly, The Limited and Express. Wexner's innovative marketing strategies and ability to anticipate customer preferences helped propel L Brands to become a leading name in fashion retail. His management style has been marked by risk-taking and a keen focus on growing brands to their full potential. 3. Roger Penske: Penske Corporation (51 Years) An icon of the automotive world, Roger Penske took over as CEO of the Penske Corporation in 1969. With activities in transportation, logistics, and professional motorsports, the Penske Corporation has shown remarkable success under Roger's guidance. One of the secrets to his long-term success in this role is his eye for sponsorship opportunities that have helped the company remain financially secure and relevant in the ever-evolving auto industry. Through strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and expansions, he has developed a diverse portfolio of businesses that tap into various aspects of the automotive trade. Conclusion In a time where the average CEO's tenure continues to shrink, the long-lasting tenures of Warren Buffet, Leslie H. Wexner, and Roger Penske are testaments to their stalwart leadership and ability to adapt to changing landscapes. Beyond their tenure, the impact these CEOs have had on their respective industries is undeniable. By blazing trails in their fields and remaining agile in the face of market transformations, these leaders paint an inspiring picture of resilience, adaptability, and unwavering determination that has propelled their companies through decades of sustained success."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles upon it. Besides transportation, rivers give food, water to drink, water for crops , and chances for fun and entertainment for the people who live along their banks. In order to increase the supply of crops, engineers sometimes build a dam across a river and let a lake from behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located upon rivers often make problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals and other materials. People are learning the importance, however, of doing more to keep their rivers clean if they want to enjoy the benefits of this natural resource. Answer:","completion":"Which of the following statements about rivers is true according to the article? A) Rivers have no significance in transportation. B) All great rivers are primarily used for irrigation purposes. C) Rivers provide important resources such as food, water, and opportunities for recreation and transportation. D) The world's largest cities are not located near rivers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Information: - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost. - Gun Fight, known as Western Gun in Japan and Europe, is a 1975 arcade shooter game designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, and released by Taito in Japan and Europe and by Midway in North America. It was the first video game to depict human-to-human combat, while the Midway version was also the first video game to use a microprocessor. Following its November 1975 release in North America, it went on to sell over 8,000 arcade cabinets in the United States. It was ported to the Bally Astrocade video game console as a built-in game in 1977 as well as several home computer platforms. - The Astrocade is a second generation home video game console and simple computer system designed by a team at Midway, at that time the videogame division of Bally. It was marketed only for a limited time before Bally decided to exit the market. The rights were later picked up by a third-party company, who re-released it and sold it until around 1984. The Astrocade is particularly notable for its very powerful graphics capabilities for the time of release, and for the difficulty in accessing those capabilities. - Shooter games are a subgenre of action game, which often test the player's speed and reaction time. It includes many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar using some sort of weapon. Usually this weapon is a gun, or some other long-range weapon. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition. Most commonly, the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying. A shooting game is a genre of video game where the player has limited spatial control of his or her character, and the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character's enemies using long-range weaponry. - Redemption games are typically arcade games of skill that reward the player proportionally to their score in the game. The reward most often comes in the form of tickets, with more tickets being awarded for higher scores. These tickets can then be redeemed (hence the name) at a central location for prizes. The most inexpensive prizes (candy, small plastic or rubber toys) may only require a small number of tickets to acquire, while the most expensive ones (skateboards, low end electronics) may require several thousand. In general, the amount of money spent to win enough tickets for a given prize will exceed the value of the prize itself. Some redemption games such as Flamin' Finger involve elements of chance, which can be set by the operator. - Pinball is a type of arcade game, in which points are scored by a player manipulating one or more steel balls on a play field inside a glass-covered cabinet called a pinball machine (or pinball table). The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Many modern pinball machines include a story line where the player must complete certain objectives in a certain fashion to complete the story, usually earning high scores for different methods of completing the game. Points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the play field. A drain is situated at the bottom of the play field, partially protected by player-controlled plastic bats called flippers. A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain a certain number of times. Secondary objectives are to maximize the time spent playing (by earning \\"extra balls\\" and keeping the ball in play as long as possible) and to earn bonus games (known as \\"replays\\"). - The original console in the series was the first video game console to ship 100 million units, 9 years and 6 months after its initial launch. Its successor, the PlayStation 2, was released in 2000. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling home console to date, having reached over 155 million units sold as of December 28, 2012. Sony's next console, the PlayStation 3, was released in 2006 and has sold over 80 million consoles worldwide as of November 2013. Sony's latest console, the PlayStation 4, was released in 2013, selling 1 million consoles in its first 24 hours on sale, becoming the fastest selling console in history. - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. - A merchandiser is an arcade gaming device, which features a machine that contains a display of merchandise, which can be won by playing the game. In the trade, such games are described as Skill With Prizes (SWP) games, and are a hybrid of games of skill and games of chance, with the preponderance of skill or chance differing between devices and often able to be set by the operator. - Outlaw is a single - player arcade game by Atari Inc. , originally released in 1976 . It simulates an Old West fast draw duel between the player and the computer . Outlaw was a response to Gun Fight , released by Midway in North America the year before . - The golden age of arcade video games was the era of greatest popularity and technological innovation for arcade video games. The exact time period is a matter of debate, but key moments include the release of \\"Space Invaders\\" in 1978 and the introduction of vector display technology in 1979. The golden age lasted until the late 1980s, when home video game consoles like the NES were introduced. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Early career. Nishikado graduated with an engineering degree from Tokyo Denki University in 1968. He joined Pacific Industries Ltd in 1969, a subsidiary of the Taito Trading Company. After working on mechanical games, in 1972, he developed \\"Elepong\\" (similar to \\"Pong\\"), one of Japan's earliest locally produced video arcade games, released in 1973. He produced over 10 video games before \\"Space Invaders\\" was released in 1978. He left Taito in 1996 to found his own company, Dreams. As of 2013, he is no longer with Dreams, and presently works for Taito as a technical advisor. - A ball is a round object (usually spherical but sometimes ovoid) with various uses. It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, marbles and juggling. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles. - An amusement arcade (often referred to as \\"video arcade\\" or simply \\"arcade\\") is a venue where people play arcade games such as video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games, merchandisers (such as claw cranes), or coin-operated billiards or air hockey tables. In some countries, some types of arcades are also legally permitted to provide gambling machines such as slot machines or \\"pachinko\\" machines. Games are usually housed in cabinets. The term used for ancestors of these venues in the beginning of 20th century was penny arcades. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play. What is the relationship between 'outlaw ' and 'shooter game'? A:","completion":"The relationship between \\"Outlaw\\" and \\"shooter game\\" is that Outlaw is an example of an early shooter game. Released in 1976, Outlaw is a single-player arcade game developed by Atari Inc. that simulates an Old West fast draw duel between the player and the computer. The player's objective is to shoot opponents using long-range weaponry, a common feature in shooter games. The game tests the player's speed and reaction time, which are also key elements in the broader genre of shooter games. Outlaw was developed in response to Gun Fight, another arcade shooter game released by Midway in North America in 1975. Thus, Outlaw represents an early entry and contribution to the development of the shooter game genre."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Following the round of touring for Vitalogy, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up, No Code. Vedder said, \\"Making No Code was all about gaining perspective.\\" Released in 1996, No Code was seen as a deliberate break from the band's sound since Ten, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that \\"No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.\\" The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination, with Ament stating, \\"In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up.\\" Although the album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the singles \\"Who You Are\\" (sample ), \\"Hail, Hail\\", and \\"Off He Goes\\". As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A European tour took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was \\"a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time\\" and that \\"it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band.\\" Following the short tour for No Code, the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The sessions for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort between all members of the group, with Ament stating that \\"everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band.\\" On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has \\"turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations.

More recently, he decided to stop using the word \\"Muslim\\" as he called for halting immigration from countries with high rates of terrorism, although he has yet to say which countries that would include. At a rally in Portland, Maine, on Thursday afternoon, Trump provided a lengthy explanation of why he thinks the United States needs to be skeptical of immigrants from many countries, even if they follow the legal process. Reading from notes, Trump listed nearly a dozen examples of immigrants, refugees or students who came to the United States legally -- often applying for and receiving citizenship -- and then plotted to kill Americans, sometimes successfully doing so. The countries that he referenced in these examples: Somalia, Morocco, Uzbekistan (he asked the crowd where it was located), Syria, Afghanistan, the Philippines, Iraq, Pakistan and Yemen (which he pronounced \\"yay-men\\"). Trump's staff has yet to confirm if there are countries from which the nominee wants to limit immigration. \\"We're letting people come in from terrorist nations that shouldn't be allowed because you can't vet them,\\" Trump said. \\"There's no way of vetting them. You have no idea who they are. This could be the great Trojan horse of all time.\\" At another point in the rally, Trump said: \\"Hillary Clinton wants to have them come in by the hundreds of thousands, just remember. This has nothing to do with politics, folks. This is a whole different level. This has to do with pure, raw stupidity. Okay?\\" Trump has long called for a crackdown on illegal immigration, which he has framed as a national security concern. In his announcement speech last year, Trump described illegal Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals. At numerous rallies, mothers and fathers whose children have been killed by illegal immigrants have shared their heartbreaking stories. Trump has said that building a wall along the border with Mexico will not only keep out illegal immigrants but also criminals, drug traffickers and terrorists. And he has proposed deporting the millions of immigrants illegally living here, starting with those who have committed crimes. For more than 10 months, Trump has opposed allowing any Syrian refugees into the country because they could be terrorists, and he has promised to kick out all Syrian refugees currently in the country. In December, Trump called for \\"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\\" Last month Trump said that his position on banning Muslims has \\"gotten bigger,\\" as he's now focusing on territories with terrorism problems. Last week Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity: \\"People don’t want me to say 'Muslim.' I guess I prefer not saying it, frankly, myself. So we’re talking about territories.\\" But he has yet to say which territories he would target. [Inside Donald Trump's strategic decision to target Muslims] About 13 percent of 318.9 million people living in the United States in 2014 were immigrants, according to the Migration Policy Institute, which is a massive increase from 1970, when the rate was less than 5 percent. Mexico is the most common home-nation of these immigrants, followed by India, China and the Philippines. Within minutes of taking the stage in Maine on Thursday afternoon, Trump warned the crowd of outsiders \\"pouring into our country,\\" and he promised to build a wall along the border. He was interrupted by protesters who held up pocket-sized copies of the Constitution. The crowd booed and then chanted: \\"USA! USA! USA!\\" As the protesters were led away, Trump resumed: \\"A Trump rally is the safest place in our country to be. Believe me. Believe me. Right? It is safe. But if we keep going the way it is, our whole country is becoming different.\\" Trump warned the crowd that \\"radical Islamic terrorism\\" is the \\"most important issues facing civilization right now\\" and that the United States has to be more careful in allowing foreigners to visit or move here. \\"We've just seen many, many crimes getting worse all the time, and as Maine knows -- a major destination for Somali refugees. Right? Am I right?\\" Trump said, as the crowd affirmed what he had said. \\"Well, they're all talking about it: Maine. Somali. Refugees. We admit hundreds of thousands, you admit into Maine, and to other places in the United States. Hundreds of thousands of refugees, and they're coming from among the most dangerous territories and countries anywhere in the world -- right? -- a practice which has to stop. It has to stop... This is a practice that has to stop.\\" [Northern Virginia teen admits running pro-Islamic State Twitter account] To back up this point, Trump rattled through a list of cautionary examples -- nearly all of which appear on a list of 26 examples released in November by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee who chairs an immigration subcommittee. Sessions has closely advised Trump for months and one of his former aides, Stephen Miller, is now a senior policy adviser to Trump and often speaks at Trump's rallies about the dangers of immigration. In nearly each example, Trump noted that the suspect in question came to the United States legally and was granted citizenship. \\"They're the ones we know about. There are so many that we don't know about. You're going to have problems like you've never seen,\\" Trump said. \\"We don't know where these people are. You know when the government puts them around... for the most part, very few people know where they even are. We don't even know where they are located. I'm telling you, I've said it before: This could be the great Trojan horse of all time. They're coming in. They're coming in.\\" Here are the examples Trump gave: Write a title for it.","completion":"Donald Trump Shifts Focus from Banning Muslims to Targeting Immigration from Countries with High Terrorism Rates"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The passage is primarily about a rugby match that took place at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff where England emerged victorious. The tone of the narrative suggests that it's about the English rugby team. 2. Stuart Lancaster is associated with the English rugby team and served as the Head Coach of England's national rugby union team. 3. The option accurately continues the context of the match and its implications. It discusses internal team matters (significant here being the selection of team members) following the match. 4. The other options include names of players, journalists, or non-person entities (like 'Millennium Stadium', 'RBS 6 Nations', and 'Swing Low') being the subject of the sentence. Given the context, the choice of a former coach capping players fits more succinctly. 5. The use of the pronoun 'his' indicates that the person named in the sentence has an authoritative position, someone responsible for capping players for the team, which fits the role of the coach. By analyzing the context and clues in the passage and the options, I conclude that the ending featuring Stuart Lancaster would be the most fitting."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bird island had few reptiles on it, but had various birds inhabiting it. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island was inhabited by fewer turtles? Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

House takes action against Confederate flag, a symbol of treason One of the more notable things about congressional action to restrict the display of Confederate flags at Department of Veterans Affairs cemeteries was the debate before last week’s vote. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) offered an amendment that would ban the flying of the flags on VA cemetery flagpoles, and no one said a word against it. Yet, many did vote no. Although their silence shows that it is increasingly unpopular to be associated with Confederate symbols, 159 House members, all Republicans but one, said no to Huffman’s amendment. Those Confederate symbols have become increasingly toxic since last year’s Charleston, S.C., massacre of nine black churchgoers. The alleged gunman, Dylann Roof, had posed with the Confederate battle flag. Another photo shows him burning an American flag. While he might have been driven by hatred and racism, those attributes are not all that the Confederate flag represents. That flag stands for treason. Confederates attacked the nation and killed U.S. government soldiers. Huffman also plans to propose House action against the display of Confederate flags in National Park Service cemeteries and the sale of Confederate memorabilia in park stores. Confederate flags currently are permitted on flagpoles in VA cemeteries on Memorial Day and the Confederate Memorial Day. Huffman’s amendment still must be approved by the Senate, so Monday, Memorial Day, might be the last time that rebel sympathizers can fly their stars and bars from flagpoles over VA graveyards. Huffman’s amendment does not prohibit small Confederate flags on individual graves. “Let’s stop pretending the Confederate flag isn’t a symbol of racism,” said Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a sponsor of the bill. “The Confederate flag represents hate and intolerance and is a painful reminder of a terrible time in our history. VA cemeteries should be a place where we honor and pay tribute to American war heroes — not a place where we preserve the symbols of slavery and Jim Crow.” True. But the issue with the flag goes even beyond white supremacy. Although the Confederates were not tried for treason after the Civil War, their actions match the constitutional definition of the crime: “Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.” That description certainly fits those who wore the Confederate gray or those who gave them aid and comfort. “The Confederate battle flag is also a symbol of treason,” said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), another sponsor of the bill. Of Union soldiers, Ellison said, we “owe these brave Americans a solemn debt. We should ensure that the flag that their enemies carried so proudly does not fly above their graves.” Confederate symbols represent “opposition to the United States of America,” Huffman said, adding, “Even General Robert E. Lee recognized that symbols of the Confederacy are symbols of treason.” It is not only black people and liberal Democrats who have reason to oppose Confederate symbols — veterans do, too. Ironically, the lone Democrat who voted against the measure is a black man and an Army veteran, Rep. Sanford D. Bishop Jr. of Georgia. “While as a descendant of slaves I find the Confederate flag and the history it represents deeply offensive,” Bishop said in a statement, “I believe that the descendants of Confederate veterans should not be denied the privilege of honoring their dead ancestors two days of the year on a flagpole where their beloved are buried in mass graves.” None of the Republicans contacted would comment on their votes. But my colleague Amber Phillips published a message from an aide to Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.) to other congressional offices that linked opponents of the Confederate flag to the Islamic State terrorist group, also known as ISIS and ISIL. “You know who else supports destroying history so that they can advance their own agenda? ISIL,” wrote Pete Sanborn, Westmoreland’s legislative director, before the vote. “Don’t be like ISIL. I urge you to vote NO.” Westmoreland did vote no. But at least he was smart enough to distance himself from Sanborn, who Westmoreland said was reprimanded. But will he and the many other Republicans who voted against the amendment distance themselves from Confederate symbols when they next have the chance? “It is shameful that two-thirds of the House Republican Caucus voted against” the bill, Huffman said. “Why would anyone in Congress — let alone a majority of the governing party — still condone displays of this hateful symbol on our sacred national cemeteries?” Good question. There is no good answer. [The march against the Confederate flag continued Thursday — this time in Congress] [The Confederate flag isn’t just offensive.

Thus, in less than twenty years, Rome had destroyed the power of one of the successor states, crippled another, and firmly entrenched its influence over Greece. This was primarily a result of the over-ambition of the Macedonian kings, and their unintended provocation of Rome; though Rome was quick to exploit the situation. In another twenty years, the Macedonian kingdom was no more. Seeking to re-assert Macedonian power and Greek independence, Philip V's son Perseus incurred the wrath of the Romans, resulting in the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC). Victorious, the Romans abolished the Macedonian kingdom, replacing it with four puppet republics; these lasted a further twenty years before Macedon was formally annexed as a Roman province (146 BC) after yet another rebellion under Andriscus. Rome now demanded that the Achaean League, the last stronghold of Greek independence, be dissolved. The Achaeans refused and declared war on Rome. Most of the Greek cities rallied to the Achaeans' side, even slaves were freed to fight for Greek independence. The Roman consul Lucius Mummius advanced from Macedonia and defeated the Greeks at Corinth, which was razed to the ground. In 146 BC, the Greek peninsula, though not the islands, became a Roman protectorate.

I’m here in Dubrovnik, Croatia for a team meetup. Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave. So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them. If you look closely in a few shots, you’ll see a stone pier, which is just between the Pile Gate (pronounced “peel-ay”) at the city walls and the fort.

Fungal meningitis has sickened 91 people across nine states, killing seven, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday. The outbreak seems to be growing by the day: The CDC on Saturday had reported 64 sickened. Fungal meningitis cannot be passed from person to person, unlike some other types of the disease. Researchers have linked the outbreak to steroid spinal injections from three lots of methylprednisolone acetate sent to clinics in 23 states, which have since been recalled. (See a list of those clinics here.) The injections were intended to relieve back pain. The exact source of the contamination has not yet been pinpointed. Tennessee has reported the most outbreak cases, with 32; Michigan has seen 20 and Virginia, 18. The CDC said several patients injected with the contaminated steroids have had strokes. “In addition to typical meningitis symptoms, like headache, fever, nausea, and stiffness of the neck, people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion, dizziness, and discomfort from bright lights,” the CDC says. “Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms.” The steroid injections are not the same as those given to women during childbirth, according to the CDC. On Sunday, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) asked for stronger government oversight of so-called compounding pharmacies like the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Mass., which is thought to have produced the contaminated steroids, according to the Associated Press. Also Sunday, the pharmacy issued a voluntary recall for all its products, the news service reported. ALSO: Pushing for a ban on trade of polar bear parts 'No-bama' hanging chair -- is it a symbolic lynching? Court says paralyzed woman, 28, can choose death over her parents' wishes ||||| The Centers for Disease Control said Monday that the number of people infected with meningitis related to steroid injections has gone from 91 to 105. The death toll has risen from seven to eight. Patients in nine states contracted the deadly fungal meningitis after being injected in their spine with a preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate that was contaminated by a fungus. The steroid is used to treat pain and inflammation. What is meningitis? The New England Compounding Center (NECC), the Massachusetts-based pharmacy that made the contaminated injections, voluntarily recalled three lots of the injected steroid last week. ||||| NASHVILLE, Tennessee U.S. health officials on Sunday reported an additional 27 cases in a fungal meningitis outbreak linked to steroid injections that has killed seven people and now infected 91 in nine states. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the new total of 91 cases in an update on its website, up from 64 on Saturday. Most of the new cases were reported in Michigan, where the total increased to 20 from eight. Virginia's total increased to 18 from 11. The widening outbreak has alarmed U.S. health officials and focused attention on regulations of pharmaceutical compounding companies like the one that produced the drugs, the New England Compounding Center Inc in Framingham, Massachusetts. The company shipped 17,676 vials of the steroid methylprednisolone acetate to 76 facilities in 23 states from July through September, the Massachusetts Health Department said. The steroid is used as a painkiller, usually for the back, and could have been injected in thousands of patients, authorities have said. Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, and affected patients started showing a variety of symptoms from one to four weeks after their injections. The company, which was previously the subject of complaints, has suspended its operations while an investigation proceeds and earlier recalled the three lots of the drug. It expanded its recall on Saturday to all products compounded and distributed at its Framingham facility. According to an announcement on its website, the company issued the broader recall out of \\"an abundance of caution\\" because of the \\"potential risk of contamination.\\" A compounding pharmacy takes medications from pharmaceuticals manufacturers and makes them into specific dosages and strengths for use by doctors. Complaints against the company in 2002 and 2003 about the processing of medication resulted in an agreement with government agencies in 2006 to correct deficiencies, the Massachusetts Health Department said. LIMITED FDA AUTHORITY In 2011, there was another inspection of the facility and no deficiencies were found. In March 2012, another complaint was made about the potency of a product used in eye surgery procedures. That investigation is continuing, the state health department said. The U.S. Food and Drug administration has limited authority over the day-to-day operations of compounding pharmacies, which are regulated primarily by state boards that oversee the practices, licensing and certification of pharmacies and pharmacists. Compounded products do not have to win FDA approval before they are sold, and the agency has no jurisdiction over how the products are manufactured or labeled for use. Instead, the FDA investigates cases of adulterated drugs in cooperation with state regulators. The FDA has tried to exert greater authority over compounded drug products under a section of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that covers new drugs. But those efforts led to federal court challenges that resulted in two separate and conflicting rulings at the appellate level. The nine states where fungal meningitis cases have been reported are Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia. Tennessee, where the outbreak was first detected, accounted for most of the cases, with 32, including three deaths. Many patients there remain hospitalized, some in critical condition. Michigan had 20 cases and two deaths. One person died in Maryland and another in Virginia, the CDC said. Reuters had reported 65 cases on Saturday, including one additional case after the CDC published its total. Fungal meningitis is not contagious, the CDC said. Symptoms include fever, headache, nausea and neurological problems that would be consistent with deep brain stroke. The steroid was sent to California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia, the CDC said.

In 1938 Egypt, a team of archaeologists discover the tomb of pharaoh Ahkmenrah, including a young Cecil Fredericks, finding the magical Tablet of Ahkmenrah. The locals warn the group that removing the tablet will end its magic. In present-day New York City, Larry Daley remains the night guard of the American Museum of Natural History. He, Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, Jedediah, Octavius, Rexy the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton and Dexter the capuchin monkey help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. A new wax Neanderthal resembling Larry named Laaa is introduced, identifying Larry as his father. Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet is corroding, which later causes the exhibits to act erratically, causing mayhem at the planetarium's reopening. Afterwards, Larry catches his son Nick, who plans on taking a gap year to sort out his life, throwing a house party. Larry reunites with Cecil, now in retirement, who realizes the end of the tablet's magic will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil explains that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power but that they are located in the British Museum.

Unfortunately I diverge in opinion not agreeing that Miss Detmers as the lead is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter.

If you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something they believe in and be impressively entertained give Hanna's War with Maruschka Detmers a try. My hat is off also to Ellen Burstyn as Hanna's mother a much well known and famous actress who could have made effort to walk off with the film.
