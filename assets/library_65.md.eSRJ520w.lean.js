Two friends had different diseases. Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection. Hint: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. A:","completion":"Manny received fewer antiretroviral drugs. In the provided paragraph, it is mentioned that Nigel was infected with the HIV virus, and Manny contracted a bacterial infection. Antiretroviral drugs, as described in the paragraph, are specifically developed to treat viral diseases, and their development has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. Since HIV is a virus and Nigel is the one infected with it, he would be the one receiving antiretroviral drugs as part of his treatment. On the other hand, Manny's infection is bacterial, and the treatment for such infections involves antibiotics rather than antiviral or antiretroviral drugs. Therefore, Manny would not be receiving any antiretroviral drugs to treat his bacterial infection.

Mark Buckley, 34, agreed to pay a paltry fine of £110 instead of serving the rest of his sentence. His lawyer Kieran Henry cited the case of Argentina striker Tevez, who last month paid a £3,000 fine to avoid the rest of his 250-hour community service order for motoring offences so that he could leave Manchester City and join Italian club Juventus. It is thought OPTIONS: - Argentina’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order. - Carlos Tevez’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order. - Greece’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order. - Italian’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order. - Juventus’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order. - Kieran Henry’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order. - Manchester City’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order. - Mark Buckley’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order. - Nazia Parveen’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order. - Tevez’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order.","completion":"Correct answer(s): - Carlos Tevez’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order. - Tevez’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order. In the context provided, both answers refer to the same individual – Carlos Tevez. The other choices are wrong. It's like saying the cat barked. The cat didn't bark because it wasn't the cat, it was the dog. In this case, only Carlos Tevez's legal team would argue about him, not Argentina’s, Italy’s, Juventus’s, Manchester City’s, Mark Buckley’s, Nazia Parveen’s or Kieran Henry’s legal teams.

A: careless B: ignorant C: meticulous Answer:","completion":"Based on the given context, Robin can be best described as meticulously attentive to her responsibilities as a horse trainer. This assessment comes from the fact that Robin takes the time to feel the oats that she feeds to the horses under her care. Feeling the oats is an indication that Robin wants to ensure the quality of the food that her horses consume. This could be to check for any potential impurities or undesirable elements within the oats that may compromise the health or performance of the horses. By taking such extra measures in her role as a horse trainer, Robin demonstrates a level of foresight and care for the welfare of the animals. Out of the given options, the correct answer would be: C: Meticulous This is because the terms \\"careless\\" and \\"ignorant\\" do not accurately describe someone who takes precautions and actively ensures the well-being of the animals under their care.

This transparency already gives merit to the opinion shared. In the review, the author mentions that the season \\"obviously strove to wrap things up in a way which would exemplify the character of the series.\\" This implies that the series' resolution maintains the essence of the show, staying true to its characters and overarching themes. It shows that the creators went the extra mile to give the series a meaningful ending and tie up any loose ends. Moreover, the review states that the creators succeeded in this goal, as evidenced by the \\"potpourri of episodes followed by the inevitable climax.\\" A potpourri signifies a mix or assortment of episodes, illustrating the show's diversity and the creative risks they took. This highlights the effort put in to make the season memorable and engaging, providing a range of scenarios and stories for the audience. The reviewer emphasizes that the show is \\"cutting edge\\" and took chances. This can be interpreted as a testament to the series' unique and innovative approach in the entertainment landscape. Such a daring and inventive nature reflects positively on the series, as it breaks norms and contributes to the evolution of television. Additionally, the review mentions that the show maintained \\"a bite to it,\\" which implies that it never lost sight of its wit and humor, preserving the comedy aspect for its viewers throughout the entire season.

The context highlights various aspects where committee members put in efforts to address important tasks. There is mention of putting aside partisanship to focus on essential issues such as building an excellent health care system, developing a strong research and development program, and dealing with equity issues relating to debt reduction. These tasks require careful thought, evaluation, and collaboration, which in turn implies substantial work being conducted by these committees. Furthermore, the context uses the phrase \\"enormous amount of work\\" to describe the efforts of committee members. This statement counters the hypothesis that committees do very little work. Instead, it supports the notion that committees are actively engaged in handling complex issues and are putting in considerable work to find solutions and make improvements in the mentioned areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

OPT: *unacceptable. *acceptable....I think the answer is","completion":"*unacceptable. A linguist would rate this sentence to be unacceptable linguistically, due to the ambiguity and improper use of prepositions, which make the meaning unclear. Let's break down the issues with the sentence to understand why it is considered unacceptable. 1. Ambiguity: The sentence is ambiguous, as it isn't clear whether Cheryl is the one standing while passing the books or if she is making the books stand in a specific order. In either case, the word \\"stand\\" is likely an inappropriate choice of verb to convey the intended action. 2. Improper prepositions: The preposition \\"from\\" is used here to indicate the relationship between Edna and the books. However, it is unclear as to whether this means that the books belong(ed) to Edna, or if Edna previously had possession of the books. If the intention is to indicate that Cheryl is giving the books to Sarah, then a more appropriate preposition would be \\"to\\" (e.g., \\"Cheryl passed the books to Sarah\\"). If the intention is to communicate that the action of standing the books is being done in order to create a specific arrangement, then we might see a sentence like \\"Cheryl stood the books from Edna's collection next to Sarah's.\\" To revise this sentence and make it linguistically acceptable, we should first clarify its intended meaning. If the intention is to convey the act of Cheryl passing the books from Edna to Sarah, the sentence could be rewritten as: - \\"Cheryl passed the books from Edna to Sarah.\\" If the intention is to convey the act of Cheryl arranging the books in a specific order, the sentence could be rewritten as: - \\"Cheryl arranged the books from Edna's collection next to Sarah's.\\" In either case, by rephrasing the sentence to better clarify the intended meaning and by using appropriate verb and preposition choices, we can create a sentence that a linguist would rate as acceptable linguistically."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force.

The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Wesleyan University (or ) is a private liberal arts college in Middletown, Connecticut, founded in 1831.

Given the question: If blood volume in the body decreases, blood pressure decreases. When there is more fluid in a tube the pressure in the tube increases or decreases? The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: the pressure in the tube increases. Step-by-step logic: 1. Initially, we establish the fact that if blood volume in the body decreases, blood pressure decreases. This implies a direct correlation between volume and pressure. 2. Applying this concept to the tube scenario, we would assume that the fluid in the tube represents the 'blood volume' in the initial statement, and the pressure in the tube stands for 'blood pressure'. 3. Therefore, going by the first statement, if the volume (in this case, the amount of fluid in the tube) increases, the pressure (in this case, the pressure in the tube) should also increase. 4. Therefore, the answer is that when there is more fluid in a tube, the pressure in the tube increases. This is a basic idea common in areas such as fluid dynamics and health sciences, and it is partially rooted in Boyle's law from physics which states that the pressure and volume of a gas have an inverse relationship when temperature is held constant. However, in real life situations, these principles may not always directly apply due to various other influencing factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In other words, the first sentence states that Dudley Moore is responsible for narrating the events. Now, if we examine the second sentence, it directly contradicts the first by claiming that Dudley Moore did not narrate the situation.

I have shopped at this store for 25 years - jewelry, hats, children's gifts, Dia de Los Muertos items, glass wear, serapes and baskets for parties, and putting together Southwest food baskets for Holiday gifts every year. I have brought visiting family members here for everything from t-shirts to expensive jewelry items. The staff is helpful and friendly. The owner, \\"Hong\\", however - is not. She has a major attitude and has been rude and insulting on more than one occasion. I have had her follow me around like a suspected shoplifter when needing to try on a \\"Double D Ranchwear\\" t-shirt. It isn't my fault the only dressing room is in another area of the store, and \\"Lucita\\" already knew who I was/what I was trying on. Further, if a store owner is following a customer - the proper approach is to offer service: \\"How are you doing? Can I get you a different style or size?\\" Hong does not offer service if her subordinates are present. Hong has also insulted the jewelry I was wearing at the time - a 500 item. Her insult was in response to the fact I asked the source of the turquoise on an item in her case. My grandfather was Native American and I have an extensive collection and have worked with turquoise, so I do know the characteristics between the turquoise produced by the domestic mines and how it differs from Mexican and Chinese turquoise. I have truly made an effort to practice more graciousness than she clearly possesses by NOT observing that I could easily identify types of turquoise decades before she married into the Bischoff family. Further, I have heard her misrepresent some of her products to tourists. (Native Americans will usually identify their jewelry by the terms \\"Native American\\", \\"Zuni\\", \\"Navajo,\\" etc - not \\"Indian Made.\\") Further, a majority of her earrings - particularly the Repousse- can be found on eBay.....identical product - 60% less. If one purchases here, I would definitely ask for proof of authenticity. (and they do have some real works of art, but their inventory is a mix). There's another issue: pricing. She clearly counts on the naive \\"one-purchase tourists\\" as her priority clients, because she has clothing hanging in her (unbelievably disorganized) clothing area that is nearly 3 years old (2012 Double D Ranchwear t-shirt, \\"The Wild Ones\\" for example). So, from a local who shopped often at this store: I've decided that I can find any of these items elsewhere at any number of businesses that value my patronage. And my sincere apologies to the friendly and helpful staff that have to work under her. It's taken me a long time to write this review, and I kept going back and just avoiding her. In that time, I've discovered her attitude is already widely known around town. Choose the sentiment of this review? Available options: i. negative. ii. positive.","completion":"i. negative. This review is decidedly negative. While at first it seems like it might be positive because the writer describes shopping at the store for many years and highlights some of the products they've bought, it quickly descends into a litany of complaints. The reviewer has major issues with the owner's demeanour and the way she interacts with customers, feeling like she was treated like a suspect and insulted, and criticizes the quality and authenticity of some items. The reviewer also accuses the owner of preying on naive tourists and keeping old stock, while also treating her workers poorly. They even state they've decided to take their business elsewhere where it'll be valued, which indicates dissatisfaction with the overall service at the store. The mention of friendly and helpful staff isn't enough to tilt the overall sentiment of the review towards positive. This is because the positive remarks are not only few, but they are also vastly outweighed by the multiple negative statements about the owner's behaviour, identification authenticity of products, pricing methods, and shop organization.

The answer to the question: What are the two names of the work that was well received in Gothenburg in 1860? is inside the article: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech..., can you guess it ?

To do this, you want to get rid of the -42 on the right side of the equation. Since it's a subtraction, you should add 42 to both sides of the equation to maintain the equality: -72 + 42 = 6*p - 42 + 42 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation. -72 + 42 = -30, and -42 + 42 equals 0, so the equation becomes: -30 = 6*p Step 3: Solve for p. To find the value of p, you need to isolate it by eliminating the coefficient, which is 6 in this case. Since 6 is being multiplied by p, you should divide both sides of the equation by 6: -30 / 6 = 6*p / 6 Step 4: Simplify both sides of the equation. -30 / 6 = -5, and 6*p / 6 equals p, so the equation becomes: -5 = p Now you have found the value of p: p = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But we should have realized the quickest way to get a teenage boy to do something is to tell him not to do it. That’s why it doesn’t surprise us that the Biebs has been all about this look lately, wearing the questionable style nonstop over the past two weeks. He’s strutted around in them while shopping, making appearances, out at a club — and it even appears that a pair of tight-at-the-calves, loose-at-the-crotch white pants are part of the singer’s official tour uniform. (He’s worn them to all his concerts in the U.K. so far.) And while Bieber is loyal to this one silhouette, he’s not picky about the color, print or style, sporting a blue canvas pair one day, a purple cheetah pair the next, then continuing the streak with a leather design he’s clearly quite taken with. The more he wears the pants, the more confused we become. Bieber can’t possibly like the way the pants look, right? So he must be putting them on for some other reason. Here are some explanations we came up with: •One of the last outfits Selena Gomez saw him in before the two split included a pair of these perplexing pants. This is his way of reminding her that despite all the stories, he’s still the same guy she used to be in love with. •Being the fashion-forward dude that he is, he’s noticed that a skinnier leg is en vogue with men, but the allover supertight style isn’t compatible with his dance moves. So he had to find a type of pant that combined flexibility with fashion. Et voilá: the drop-crotch pant. •He’s trying to become a spokesperson for the Association of People With Long Torsos and Short Legs. Tell us: What do you think of Justin Bieber’s drop-crotch pants? Can you think of any other reasons why he might be wearing them? –Zoë Ruderman PHOTOS: VOTE ON MORE CONTROVERSIAL STAR STYLES HERE! ||||| Justin Bieber's current tour may be remembered for the debacle at London's O2, where weeping fans and furious parents endured a two-hour wait for his eventual appearance, but the defining image of his UK visit appeared in the press last week. In a carpark outside a venue, a shirtless Bieber poses on a Segway, the vehicle of choice for only the most discerning pop pranny. He's wearing driving gloves, of course; one is raised so that he can show two fingers to the photographer. More tellingly, behind him, ignored by a star preoccupied with having his photograph taken and kept at a safe distance by steel security gates, a pack of fans struggles to make contact. But while a dismissive attitude to fans is one thing, is there more to Bieber's troubles? 1. The drugs After Bieber was photographed at a Lil Twist soiree holding what looked like a spliff, he declared that he was \\"trying to be better\\". He certainly seems to have got better, if only at making sure he is not photographed with things that look like drugs. everyday growing and learning. trying to be better. u get knocked down, u get up. — Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) January 5, 2013 2.

The bad birthday \\"Big night ahead,\\" Justin tweeted over the weekend, on the evening of his birthday. All went quiet for a few hours, leaving 35 million Twitter followers to imagine the high-spirited celebration LOLs being executed by Bieber and friends. With exquisite comic timing, Bieber's next tweet, the following morning, was a simple two-word message: \\"Worst birthday\\". It turned out that some of Bieber's friends had been turned away from the club he wanted to visit for being underage. Heartbreaking. Worst birthday — Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) March 2, 2013 5. And he was like tardy, tardy, tardy oh Nobody who has subjected themselves to the endless stream of portentous selfies on Bieber's Instagram account will be remotely surprised that the formidably self-obsessed teen didn't bother apologising to fans until the next day, when a PR disaster was threatening to affect his career, and even then only with phrases such as \\"I'm not OK with things being exaggerated\\" thrown into his statement. i never have any intent to upset or let anyone down. and Im not okay with things being exaggerated. once again sorry for anyone upset. — Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) March 5, 2013 Despite all this, let's not get ahead of ourselves. \\"Weed is not necessarily a problem,\\" one fan recently noted. \\"He should just enjoy his life; nothing's wrong, he's not doing anything bad or anything.\\" Admittedly the fan in question was Mike Tyson, but if a stand-up guy like Mike reckons there's nothing wrong, there's nothing wrong, right?

PHOTOS: Selena Gomez Wears Sexy Suit To Berlin Premiere “Selena is looking to date an older man this time,” a pal of the 20-year-old singer and Spring Breakers actress exclusively told Radar. “She finally realized how toxic it was to date a toddler like Justin.” According to the friend, Selena has been focused sharply on her career and isn’t worrying so much about matters of the heart. PHOTOS: Selena Gomez In Her Bikini “Selena is doing really well and feels like a weight has been lifted off her shoulders now that Justin is out of the picture,” the source said. “She finds Justin to be embarrassing since their breakup. He’s turned into exactly the kind of person she’d never want to be with.” PHOTOS: Selena Gomez Strips Down Into A Striped Bikini As RadarOnline.com exclusively reported last month, the Canadian pop star has been on a dangerous downward spiral since December with one source saying his reputation has been “drastically tarnished in a really short time span simply because of the company he’s keeping.” Aside from recently being booed by British fans for arriving two hours late to his concert, a paparazzo was hit and killed while following Justin’s white Ferrari (driven by pal Lil Twist), photos leaked online of Justin smoking what appeared to be marijuana while surrounded by a group of friends, he embarked on a steamy sex romp with a nursing student named Milyn “Mimi” Jensen according to Star magazine, and his Ferrari was once again pulled over by police, twice in two days — both times with his pal Lil Za at the wheel without a valid driver’s license — and a photo of Justin allegedly groping a fan’s breast was published. PHOTOS: Selena Gomez – Sexy & Single At Magazine Cover Party “For now Selena isn’t concerned one bit with Justin’s boyish antics.

Or, in the case of Justin Bieber, a very, very bad week. The uber-famous star has been dealing with criticisms, disappointed fans and more ever since his 19th birthday party went horribly wrong last Friday in London. In fact, it’s already gone down as the worst trip Across the Pond since that time Mitt Romney came to town and everyone got upset. So what the heck happened to poor ol’ Biebs? And, more importantly, when is the bleeding going to stop? Check out the timeline of events, below, then share your condolences in the comments. It all started with a tweet. And everyone thought it was about Lil Twist getting pulled over in Bieber’s car. But then reports circulated that his party at London’s Cirque du Soir ended in five minutes. And then his fans got all sad and defensive, thinking the paparazzi was to blame again. And then Cirque du Soir got all mad, alleging that Bieber tried to get underage people like Jaden Smith, 14, into the club. And then Bieber got mad. Really mad. And then Jaden went from Bieber to Kylie Jenner, because, why not? And his fans went from sad and defensive to mad and impatient, because Bieber showed up late to his concert. And then Bieber got kind of sad. And now we’re kind of sad, too. Cheer up, Biebs! There’s nowhere to go but up. We still love you Biebs. Yours, Celebuzz. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Justin Bieber has faced a series of challenges recently, including turning 19, having a rough birthday, being criticized by Olivia Wilde for going shirtless, and attracting backlash for arriving late to a London gig. The pop star took to Twitter to address these issues and share his side of the story, saying that he is focusing on the positive things in life and dismissing false rumors. Bieber also stated that being judged is part of his job as a pop star, but he wishes people would judge him based on facts and his music. As for his late arrival to a concert, Bieber later said that he never intended to upset or disappoint his fans and expressed apologies for anyone affected. Despite his recent difficulties, sources say that Selena Gomez is not planning on getting back together with Bieber and is looking to date an older man, having found Bieber's behavior to be embarrassing since their breakup."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: The last two Republican presidential primary contests have followed the same script: A conservative candidate wins in Iowa, a relative moderate wins in New Hampshire, and the latter — with broader appeal and all of the establishment’s resources — outlasts the former in a protracted fight for the nomination. But so far this cycle, New Hampshire’s voters aren’t playing along. Donald Trump has led every poll in New Hampshire since June. Candidates like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush have struggled to get out of the single digits. The weakness of mainstream candidates in New Hampshire poses a big challenge for the party’s beleaguered establishment. If a candidate acceptable to the party can’t win New Hampshire or Iowa, the G.O.P. will face a bleak choice: undertake the daunting and expensive task of mounting a come-from-behind effort, or grudgingly acquiesce to a candidate it really doesn’t want, like Ted Cruz, but who may be better than someone it can never accept, like Mr. Trump. The extent of the weakness of the establishment in New Hampshire is a striking departure from recent contests. In the polling data that The Upshot has collected from the last three Republican primaries, no one other than Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, John McCain and George W. Bush led even a single New Hampshire Republican poll in the year ahead of the contest. Not only did surging conservatives like Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich never lead, but they also didn’t usually come close. After all, this is a state where Jon Huntsman won 17 percent of the vote in 2012. The traditional strength of the establishment in New Hampshire is underpinned by all of the state’s demographic characteristics. Self-identified moderate voters made up approximately half of the electorate in the last three contests, according to exit polls, compared with about a third nationally. Evangelical Christians, who represent a majority of Republican voters in the South and Iowa, represent around one-fifth of G.O.P. voters in New Hampshire. How is Mr. Trump doing so well? He’s drawing on many moderate and secular voters who haven’t supported the anti-establishment but usually religious candidates who have fared well in Iowa. The same pattern emerges in national polls, which often show Mr. Trump faring best among self-described moderates. The strength of a populist candidate like Mr. Trump, who opposes free trade and immigration, isn’t without precedent in New Hampshire. In 1992, Pat Buchanan, another anti-trade and anti-immigration candidate, won 38 percent of the vote against the incumbent president, George H.W. Bush. Four years later, Mr. Buchanan actually won the state, narrowly beating the eventual nominee, Bob Dole. But the G.O.P. establishment then was not in anywhere near the danger it is now. This year, the “outsider” candidates, like Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruz and Ben Carson, possess as much organizational, financial and personal strength as the establishment candidates, or maybe more. This year’s schedule affords the party few opportunities to make a comeback: The contests after Iowa and New Hampshire — the Nevada caucuses, South Carolina and the predominantly Southern states on Super Tuesday — are all relatively favorable to conservatives. This year’s establishment candidates have shown far less strength, by any measure, than Mr. Dole or George H.W. Bush, who had the resources, name recognition and party backing to survive early setbacks. Mr. Trump is generally polling in the mid-20s in New Hampshire surveys. The large number of moderate, establishment-friendly candidates competing in New Hampshire might split the mainstream vote, preventing any one candidate from consolidating enough support to win. Many of these candidates have little chance to win the nomination, and some, like Chris Christie and John Kasich, barely register in national polls. But over all, Mr. Christie, Mr. Kasich, Jeb Bush, Mr. Rubio and Carly Fiorina combine for nearly 40 percent of the vote in New Hampshire polls, compared with around 25 percent in national surveys. There’s no guarantee that these voters, if their favorite exited, would coalesce behind any one of the other candidates in that group, but surely the establishment would be in a better position if there were not so many viable candidates competing for support in New Hampshire. Right now, there’s no good reason for any of them to leave. All of this creates a lot of danger for the party’s establishment. Its worst-case outcome is what the polls are already showing: a clear win for an unacceptable candidate, and the other candidates so evenly split and so far behind that the contest fails to clarify which candidate the establishment should coalesce behind. But there are other dangers, too, like the possibility that a relatively moderate candidate, like Mr. Kasich, could finish above mainstream candidates who are more acceptable to the establishment. The best case for the establishment, of course, would be if a mainstream candidate won the state and became the clear favorite of party elites in the process, but a strong second-place showing by an acceptable candidate would probably suffice. A strong second place for a candidate acceptable to the party would winnow the moderate wing of the field and position that candidate to ultimately consolidate party support and take a lead later in the primary season. There is a lot of time left until the February primary and just as much precedent for late movement. In 2008, Mr. McCain overcame a 15-point deficit over the final month of the race to defeat Mr. Romney by a comfortable margin. In the last cycle, Rick Santorum was polling in the single digits at this point in Iowa, but he ultimately surged in the final weeks to defeat Mr. Romney. There is enough time for Mr. Trump to fade, even if just by a little, allowing someone else to win. There is enough time for an establishment candidate to break out. There is even enough time for momentum and tactical voting to cause voters to consolidate behind a single candidate. So far, though, none of this has happened. Until it does, the establishment’s path to victory will look much longer than it has in any recent contest. The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what causes causes thermal expansion?\\" is \\"kinetic energy\\", given that molecules moving causes thermal expansion? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the right answer to the question \\"what causes thermal expansion?\\" can indeed be attributed to \\"kinetic energy\\" as one of the key factors, given that the movement of molecules plays a significant role in this phenomenon. However, to provide a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of thermal expansion, it is important to delve deeper into the underlying concepts and mechanisms at work. Thermal expansion is the process by which matter (such as solids, liquids, or gases) expands or contracts when their temperature changes. When a substance is heated, its constituent particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) gain kinetic energy, which results in an increase in their average speed and motion. These particles have a natural tendency to vibrate, rotate, or move due to the intrinsic energy they possess. As the kinetic energy of these particles increases with temperature, they start to occupy more space due to the greater average distance between them, leading to an increase in the volume of the substance. In the case of solids, thermal expansion is mainly caused by the increase in vibrational motion of the constituent atoms or molecules. When heated, these particles vibrate more vigorously, causing the average distance between them to increase. In turn, this leads to the expansion of the solid's lattice structure, subsequently resulting in a macroscopic increase in size. For liquids, the mechanism of thermal expansion is similar, yet slightly different. As the molecules in a liquid gain kinetic energy upon heating, they move faster and spread out, overcoming some of the intermolecular forces that hold them together. This increased molecular motion leads to an increase in the average distance between the liquid's molecules, causing the liquid's volume to expand. Gases, on the other hand, exhibit a more noticeable thermal expansion compared to solids and liquids. Gas molecules, when heated, not only vibrate more intensely but also move at much higher speeds. This increased molecular motion overcomes the weak intermolecular forces acting on the gas particles, thereby causing the gas to expand considerably as the temperature increases. In conclusion, one can consider kinetic energy as an appropriate answer for the cause of thermal expansion, given that the increased motion of particles due to the increase in their kinetic energy leads to the observed expansion in the macroscopic scale. However, it is important to consider the details and underlying mechanisms at play, such as vibrational motion in solids and the overcoming of intermolecular forces in liquids and gases, to have a well-rounded understanding of thermal expansion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The video begins with the squirrel gingerly making his way up to the food which is laid out invitingly on some stones in front of the camera. Dinner time: The squirrel gets closer and appears more confident as he begins to eat the seeds and nuts.

Joyfully macabre. 4. ...the film is still a crowd pleaser, its dusky shadows, turn-of-the-century setting, menacing villain, and bizarre museum as creepy as ever. 5. One of the great horror classics. 6. A more conventional and not as absorbing remake of Mystery of the Wax Museum... 7. The plot is pure hokum from beginning to end, but throw the silver-tongued Vincent Price into any film as a tormented villain and you've already won half the battle. 8. The first 3-D feature in WarnerColor and with Warner-Phonic sound is a magnificently macabre thriller and far superior to the earlier 3-D efforts. 9. Unlike many 3D films from the original push in the 1950s, House of Wax stands on its own without the gimmick. 10. It's a heckuva lot of fun. What was the overall consensus about the movie?","completion":"To determine the overall consensus about the movie, let's analyze the given reviews step-by-step. 1.

What happened to Greek, Roman & Norse gods?","completion":"No, these two questions have different meanings and ask for distinct information on Greek, Roman, and Norse gods. Let's look at both questions separately: 1. What are the last names of Greek, Roman, and Norse gods? This question is asking for the last names or surnames associated with deities from three different mythological pantheons: Greek, Roman, and Norse. However, it is important to clarify that gods and goddesses in ancient mythologies generally did not have last names like we do today. For context, here is a brief overview of some major gods and goddesses from each pantheon: Greek mythology: - Zeus: King of the gods and god of the sky, lightning, and thunder - Hera: Queen of the gods and goddess of marriage, family, and childbirth - Poseidon: God of the sea, earthquakes, and horses Roman mythology: - Jupiter: King of the gods and god of the sky, thunder, and lightning - Juno: Queen of the gods and goddess of marriage, childbirth, and family - Neptune: God of the sea, earthquakes, and horses Norse mythology: - Odin: The All-Father, chief of the Aesir, and god of wisdom, war, and poetry - Thor: God of thunder, lightning, storms, and strength - Freyja: Goddess of love, beauty, fertility, and war In mythology, one might argue that gods and goddesses have epithets rather than last names. Epithets are descriptive phrases or terms given to deities to describe their attributes, actions, or roles within their mythology and religion. For example, Zeus is referred to as \\"Zeus Olympios\\" (Zeus of Olympus) or \\"Zeus Xenios\\" (Zeus of hospitality). These epithets provide a form of identification and characteristics, but they are not last names. 2. What happened to Greek, Roman, and Norse gods? This question is seeking information about the historical and cultural development of these three mythological pantheons as well as their influence and transformation over time. Greek gods: The Greek gods were widely worshipped and followed by the ancient Greeks. As time passed and Christianity spread, the influence of Greek gods began to fade. During the Roman Empire, Greek gods were often incorporated into Roman culture and adopted new identities and characteristics. Ultimately, as Roman polytheism declined and Christianity gained prominence, worship and belief in Greek gods diminished further. Roman gods: Initially, the Romans had their gods and followed the traditional beliefs of their ancestors. As the Roman Empire expanded and came into contact with Greek civilization, they adopted many of the Greek deities, attributing Roman names and identities to them. The rise of Christianity and the eventual adoption of Christianity as the state religion by Emperor Constantine I in the early 4th century AD led to the decline of Roman polytheism. Norse gods: The Norse gods were integral to the religious practices and beliefs of the ancient Norse people. As various Northern European regions, such as Scandinavia and other regions inhabited by Germanic tribes, came into contact with Christianity, conversion began to take place. By the end of the Viking Age (around 11th century AD) and the continued spread of Christianity, Norse polytheism saw a decline, and worship and belief in Norse gods dissipated and became part of folklore, legends, and stories. In summary, while the two questions are related to Greek, Roman, and Norse deities, they are indeed asking for different information. The first question focuses on identifying the last names of these gods, whereas the second question seeks historical context on the evolution and decline of these mythological pantheons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two continents had different histories. Asia was inhabited by many humans which destroyed most natural habitats through their activities. America was protective towards its environment and therefore thrived. But I can use this background: Habitat destruction has played a key role in extinctions, especially in relation to tropical forest destruction. Factors contributing to habitat loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land use change, deforestation, pollution (air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination) and global warming or climate change.Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area. Conversion to \\"trivial\\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity – through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and \\"pests\\", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\" What is an answer for this question: Which continent caused less tropical forest destruction?

Choices: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","completion":"The Invisible Man is a novel by H.G. Wells that is a standard part of the 12th CBSE English Literature syllabus. In order to get full marks on Invisible Man-related answers in your exam, it is crucial to prepare well by understanding the important questions and their corresponding answers, as well as learning how to structure your answers effectively. For the multiple-choice problem, the answer would be [b]. yes, as both questions aim to prepare a student to achieve the maximum marks in their CBSE English exam. Here are some of the essential questions and answers from The Invisible Man that may help you in your preparation: 1. Q: Describe the central theme of The Invisible Man. A: The central theme of The Invisible Man explores the consequences of unchecked scientific ambition and the dangers of attempting to play God. The character of Griffin, a brilliant scientist, discovers a method to become invisible. However, his inability to reverse the process and the resultant isolation, coupled with power and lack of moral responsibility, results in a tragic and destructive downward spiral. 2. Q: Explain the significance of the title 'The Invisible Man.' A: The title 'The Invisible Man' refers to the protagonist Griffin, who becomes invisible due to an experiment gone awry. The title symbolizes not only Griffin's physical invisibility but also the psychological and emotional invisibility he experiences as a result of his condition. It highlights the theme of isolation and alienation, underscoring the idea that invisible forces within our society and psyche can often have a powerful, unintended impact on our lives. 3. Q: Elaborate on the character of Dr. Kemp in The Invisible Man. A: Dr. Kemp is a scientist and former acquaintance of Griffin. He is rational, level-headed, and empathetic. When Griffin seeks Kemp's help in executing his plans of terror, Kemp refuses and instead tries to apprehend Griffin. His character serves as a foil to Griffin, showing the reader how a responsible scientist should behave. Kemp embodies moral responsibility and the humanist perspective on scientific progress. 4. Q: Discuss the role of setting in The Invisible Man. A: The setting of The Invisible Man, primarily taking place in a rural English village called Iping, plays a critical role in the novel. The remote, somewhat isolated location allows Griffin to conduct his experiments away from prying eyes while also allowing the villagers to witness strange phenomena without understanding the technology behind it. This setting emphasizes the theme of science versus superstition and highlights Griffin's transformation from a solely scientific pursuit into a much darker and menacing force. To write comprehensive answers to ensure full marks, consider following this structure: 1. Introduction: Begin with a brief introduction of the topic, presenting the context, theme, or character you will be discussing. 2. Body: Divide the body of your answer into clear, well-organized paragraphs. Provide textual evidence and examples to support your ideas. Analyze the significance of these examples and demonstrate how they relate to the overall theme or character development. 3. Conclusion: Sum up your main points and offer a final insight into how the aspect you have discussed contributes to the understanding of the novel as a whole. By studying the important questions, answers, and structuring your responses as per the suggested format, you will increase your chances of performing well and achieving full marks in the CBSE English exam."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope. When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas, depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just that portion of the envelope. An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064. Light loss is due to filament evaporation and bulb blackening. Study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of the Edison effect, thermionic emission and invention of the vacuum tube.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the wife of the man Sue is involved with? ? Sue Fleming's suitcase opens by accident, dropping her clothes from a double-decker bus onto Norman Winthrop. She retrieves her belongings and enters the New York City bus terminal. Intrigued, he follows her and returns a garter belt she overlooked. Steve Borden, the man she is involved with, calls her on the phone (though he is also in the terminal) and tells her to buy a ticket to San Francisco. Afterward, she sees him with another woman. They board the bus too. Norman, who is supposed to go to San Francisco by train, decides to travel by bus instead. Murphy has orders from Norman's father to keep him away from women. To Murphy's satisfaction, Sue rebuffs Norman's initial attempts to become better acquainted. May gives all her money to a friend, but manages to charm the bus driver, various relief drivers and Willy, a talkative, know-it-all passenger, into letting her ride for free. When the bus stops in Poughkeepsie, Steve and Nita Borden prove to be con artists, selling bibles at inflated prices to those who have lost loved ones recently, claiming they were specially ordered by the deceased. Nita, suspecting what is going on, later chats with Sue and introduces her husband, Steve. A disgusted Sue breaks up with Steve. She then makes a date with the persistent Norman at Niagara Falls. While Norman is getting ready, Murphy steals his clothes, but Norman goes with Sue to see the Falls wearing a raincoat provided by the tour company. When a tour employee demands the raincoat, Norman is shown to have only a bath towel on underneath. Norman arranges a candle-lit dinner for two in Chicago, but Murphy invites all the other passengers. When the bus later has engine trouble, the passengers go to a nearby carnival, where Norman challenges Sue to a bow and arrow contest; the prize, if he wins, is a kiss, but she proves to be a much better shot.

Despite his relative popularity at school, easy friendships with other players, and smart and sassy girlfriend, Jules Harbor (Amy Smart), Mox is dissatisfied with his life. He wants to leave Texas to go to school at Brown University. He also dislikes his football-obsessed father (Thomas F. Duffy) and dreads playing football under legendary coach Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight). Kilmer is a verbally abusive control freak whose philosophy can be summed up as \\"win at all costs\\". He has a strong track record as coach, remarking in a speech that \\"in my thirty years of coaching football at West Caanan, I have brought two state titles, and 22 district championships!\\" Kilmer's philosophy finally takes its toll on Coyotes' quarterback, Lance Harbor (Paul Walker). It is revealed that Lance, who is Mox's best friend, had been manipulated into taking cortisone shots into an injured knee that finally gave out on a huge sack. Lance is rushed to the hospital, where doctors are appalled at the massive amount of scar tissue found under his knee.Mox, who has accompanied Lance to the hospital, is shocked when Kilmer tells the doctor that he knew nothing at all about Lance's knee problems, when in fact Kilmer ordered the trainer to inject the shots. In need of a new quarterback, Kilmer reluctantly names Mox to replace Lance as captain and starting quarterback. The move brings unexpected dividends for Mox, one of them being Darcy Sears (Ali Larter), Lance's beautiful blonde cheerleader girlfriend, who is interested in marrying a football player in order to escape small-town life. Darcy even goes so far as to attempt to seduce Moxon, sporting a bikini made of whipped cream over her otherwise naked body, but he rebuffs her as gently as he can.Becoming fed up with Kilmer and not feeling a strong need to win, Mox starts calling his own plays on the field without Kilmer's approval.

Article: WASHINGTON Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein has hired high-profile Washington defense attorney Reid Weingarten, according to a government source, as the Justice Department continues to investigate the bank. Blankfein, 56, is in his sixth year at the helm of the largest U.S. investment bank, which has spent two years fending off accusations of conflicts of interest and fraud. The move to retain Weingarten comes as investigations of Goldman and its role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis continue. The news spooked already jittery investors. Goldman shares fell sharply in the final minutes of regular trading after Reuters reporting the hiring, finishing down 4.7 percent at 106.51, their lowest level since March 2009. They slipped further in after-hours trade to 105.45. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) in April released a scathing report that criticized Goldman for \\"exploiting\\" clients by unloading subprime loan exposure onto unsuspecting clients in 2006 and 2007, and concluded that its top executives misled Congress during testimony in 2010. Goldman has said it disagreed with many of the report's conclusions, but took seriously the issues addressed. The Justice Department launched its investigation in late April. On Monday, Goldman said: \\"As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection with the Justice Department's inquiry into certain matters raised in the PSI report hired counsel at the outset.\\" Blankfein has not been charged in any civil or criminal case. \\"Why do you bring in someone like that?\\" said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, about Weingarten. \\"It says one thing: that they're taking it seriously.\\" Robert Hillman, law professor at the University of California at Davis, said the move showed that the CEO \\"has some concern over action that is likely to be taken, presumably by the Justice Department.\\" But he added, \\"It does not signify that he is guilty, or that any action is definitely going to be taken.\\" Weingarten, whose past clients include a former Enron accounting officer, was in a federal court in New York on Monday for the sentencing of another client, Anthony Cuti, the former CEO of the Duane Reade chain of drugstores, who was convicted of accounting fraud last year. Cuti was sentenced to three years in prison and a 5 million fine. Weingarten did not respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment. \\"This was the last thing that Goldman Sachs or any institutions in the sector needed,\\" said Peter Kenny, managing director of Knight Capital in Jersey City, NJ. \\"There is zero tolerance for risk or perceived risk right now.\\" HIGH-PROFILE CLIENTS A partner with Steptoe & Johnson LLP, Weingarten has represented a wide array of clients in criminal cases. They include former WorldCom Inc chief Bernard Ebbers, who was later convicted, and former Enron accounting officer Richard Causey, who pleaded guilty in exchange for a 5 to 7-year prison term. In May, his client, former GlaxoSmithKline lawyer Lauren Stevens, was acquitted of charges of lying and obstructing a probe into the company's marketing practices. \\"I'm used to these monstrously difficult cases where everybody hates my clients,\\" Weingarten told AmericanLawyer.com in May, although he described Stevens as a \\"beloved figure.\\" Controversy has continued to swirl around Goldman Sachs and Blankfein in the aftermath of the credit crisis in which Goldman was accused of favoring some clients over others, and of sometimes trading against the interest of clients. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission scored a 550 million settlement against the bank in a fraud lawsuit in July 2010, but other investigations continue. In June, New York prosecutors subpoenaed the bank to explain its actions in the run-up to the financial crisis. In addition to the Justice Department, the New York Attorney General and the Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating. It was not immediately clear what charges, if any, Blankfein could face personally. One former federal prosecutor, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Blankfein may have hired outside counsel after receiving a request from investigators for documents or other information. The Senate report raised questions about inconsistencies between testimony from Blankfein and other Goldman executives to Congress and emails unearthed in the Senate investigation. The subcommittee's chairman, Senator Carl Levin, has said the question of whether Blankfein and others committed perjury is up to the relevant federal agencies. The former prosecutor cautioned that perjury cases were difficult to prove, adding that prosecutors would not bring charges unless they had a \\"rock solid case.\\" Goldman earlier in August lowered its estimate for future legal costs to 2 billion from its 2.7 billion estimate three months earlier. It said it expects such costs to remain high for the foreseeable future. (Reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa; Additional reporting by Carlyn Kolker, Andrew Longstreth and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Tim Dobbyn) ||||| Michael Stravato for The New York Times Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Goldman Sachs’s actions during the financial crisis returned to haunt it with a fury on Monday afternoon. In late trading, shares of Goldman tumbled nearly 5 percent, knocking 2.7 billion off the firm’s market value, after a report that the firm’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, had hired a prominent criminal defense lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten. Goldman, when confirming the hiring, portrayed it as routine, given the several government investigations faced by the firm. But the sharp reaction in the stock price showed the fragile nerves of investors, who are worried that potential legal liability could damage the firm and its earnings power. A spokesman for Goldman said executives at the firm were expected to be interviewed by the Justice Department. The agency is conducting an inquiry that stems from a 650-page report produced earlier this year by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. That report said that Goldman had misled clients about its practices related to mortgage-linked securities. “As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection with the Justice Department’s inquiry into certain matters raised in the P.S.I. report hired counsel at the outset,” Goldman Sachs said in a statement. While investors apparently feared the worst on Monday, a person close to the matter said that Mr. Blankfein had not been subpoenaed and that no Goldman executive had received an individual subpoena. Goldman is cooperating with the Justice Department investigation. Still, Monday’s stock fall underscored just how vulnerable Goldman’s stock would continue to be until the Justice Department and other authorities finished their investigations. “Until Goldman resolves its legal issues, the company and the stock are vulnerable to all sorts of perceptions, real or perceived,” said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Crédit Agricole Securities. With about 20 minutes left in the trading day, Reuters, citing an unidentified government source, reported that Mr. Blankfein had hired Mr. Weingarten. Mr. Weingarten has defended Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, and Mike Espy, a former agriculture secretary. Goldman’s stock price quickly tumbled, falling to its lowest level since March 2009. Its shares closed at 106.51. The stock move also reflected the support Goldman shareholders had for Mr. Blankfein despite the problems the firm’s problems under his stewardship. At Goldman’s stakeholder meeting in May, shareholders voted 97 percent in favor of his leadership. Any suggestion that Mr. Blankfein’s legal woes were mounting, or that he might leave the firm, would be seen as a negative for the stock. Goldman investors have been on a roller-coaster ride since April 2010, when the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman of duping clients by selling mortgage securities that were secretly created by a hedge fund firm to cash in on the housing market’s collapse. Since then, it has been dogged by investigations and speculation about investigations, all of which have taken its toll on stock. Goldman shares were trading near 180 a share before the S.E.C. filed its lawsuit. Goldman settled that suit a few months later, but its troubles were far from over. This year came the Senate report, which led to a Justice Department inquiry. And in June, Goldman received a subpoena from the office of the Manhattan district attorney, which is also investigating Goldman’s role in the financial crisis. Mr. Blankfein’s decision to hire his own lawyer is not unusual. Legal experts say that it is now common for a company’s chief executive to retain separate counsel from the corporation. It has become rare for a lawyer or law firm to represent both a company and its executives in a government investigation. Mr. Weingarten, 61, is considered a skilled trial lawyer, having won acquittals for Mr. Espy, the former agriculture secretary, and Mark A. Belnick, the former general counsel at Tyco. He has also suffered his share of courtroom defeats. Mr. Ebbers, the head of WorldCom, was found guilty and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. On Monday, Mr. Weingarten was in the Federal District Court in Manhattan with his client Anthony Cuti, the former chief executive of Duane Reade, the drugstore chain. A judge sentenced Mr. Cuti to three years in prison for a scheme to falsely inflate the income and reduce the expense that the company reported. A jury convicted Mr. Cuti in June 2010. Mr. Weingarten did not respond to request for comment on Monday. A spokeswoman for his law firm, Steptoe & Johnson, declined to comment. Steptoe is not the firm most closely associated with Goldman. The bank’s primary outside law firm is Sullivan & Cromwell, a prominent and old-line New York law firm. Sullivan represented the firm in its 550 million settlement with the S.E.C. Also, when Mr. Blankfein testified as a witness earlier this year in the insider trading trial of Raj Rajaratnam, the former hedge fund manager, lawyers from Sullivan coached him on his testimony and accompanied him to court. A native of Newark, Mr. Weingarten is a graduate of Cornell and the Dickinson School of Law at Penn State. Before becoming a criminal defense lawyer, he spent several years as a deputy district attorney in Pennsylvania and then joined the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section. While at the Justice Department, he spent years bringing cases against corrupt politicians and worked with another young prosecutor, Eric H. Holder. Mr. Holder, now the attorney general of the United States, remains one of Mr. Weingarten’s closest friends. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has hired high-profile Washington defense attorney Reid Weingarten as the Justice Department continues to investigate the bank and its role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Just weeks before Christmas, the firm has decided to close its British call centres. The move was condemned by the GMB and Unison unions, who called for a public inquiry into the way Npower is being run. Npower has decided to close its British call centres, axing almost 2,000 staff just weeks before Christmas. It is understood that sites at Peterlee in County Durham, Thornaby in North Yorkshire, and Stoke will be closed, with the transfer of 1,400 jobs to India, while 570 customer service jobs will go to another company in Britain. Npower is owned by RWE of Germany, which earlier this week dumped a project to build a vast wind farm in the Bristol Channel. Colin Smith, of the GMB, said: ‘This is about cost of living, bad management and naked greed.. ‘At this time of the year, when the Christmas lights are being turned on for most people, Npower workers their families and communities have no Yuletide greetings. ‘They have only fear from a company only interested in their fat-cat salaries and what they can get out of consumers who are paying ever higher energy prices so corporate bureaucrats can get fatter as their reward for failure. 'It is an absolute scandal that a company like Npower can operate as a cartel player in a captive market, while jobs are placed offshore.’ Npower is to move all UK call centres to India. Matthew Lay, Unison national officer, said: ‘Npower have consistently let their customers and staff down by not investing enough in the workforce, technology or the latest customer-service techniques. ‘This has led to a huge number of complaints which the company seems to think they can deal with by shifting the responsibility to somewhere else, including India. ‘If the company goes ahead with this disastrous plan, it will backfire badly, damaging their already tarnished reputation for service.’ Its poor record on complaints, a punishing 10.2 per cent price rise and its failure to pay tax have angered many customers of Britain’s most expensive energy firm. But chief executive Paul Massara, who earns £600,000, has rejected calls to give up a bonus of £150,000 awarded for hitting targets for employee and customer satisfaction. Just last week, Npower was named and shamed as the nation’s worst performer for customer service. The company receives 202.5 complaints for every 100,000 customers – five times more than the best energy supplier. Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at official customer watchdog Consumer Futures, said Npower’s performance was ‘unacceptable’ and it was unclear how moving call centre services to outside firms would improve the situation. She added: ‘Energy companies have repeatedly said they want to rebuild consumer trust. Good customer service and complaints handling are key ingredients to achieving this and suppliers still have a long way to go.’ The firm is also about to hit customers with a 10.2 per cent rise in the cost of heat and light, which will take average bills up by £139 to just under £1,500 a year. Npower said: ‘Npower has been undertaking a major review of sites, operations and people across the UK to improve customer service and keep costs down, at a time of external pressures on customers’ bills.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Npower, a big energy company, decided to remove a lot of people from their jobs in the UK and move these jobs to a far away place called India. This is because it costs less money for the company to have people working there. Many people are upset because it is happening close to a special holiday called Christmas, and those people who lost their jobs will have a harder time enjoying the holiday.

Researchers said the mummy was one of two females found in 1903 in a small tomb believed to be that of Hatshepsut's nurse, Sitre In.

The decisive truth-telling fact was a tooth in a wooden box marked with the queen's name, Hawass said. The box was found in 1881 in a hiding place of royal mummies collected and hidden away at the Deir al-Bahari temple about 1,000 metres away from the tomb. Checking all the mummies which might be Hatshepsut's, Yehya Zakariya, a medicine professor, found that the tooth was a perfect fit in a hole in the upper jaw of one of the two females, a fat woman believed to have suffered from cancer and diabetes. \\"The recognition of the tooth with the jaw can show this is Hatshepsut,\\" Hawass said. \\"A tooth is like a fingerprint.\\" Another researcher Elizabeth Thomas _ many years ago that one of the mummies was Hatshepsut's because how the right arm was put over the woman's chest suggested royalty . It was guessed that the mummy might have been hidden in the tomb for safekeeping because her stepson and successor , Tuthmosis III, tried to wipe out her memory.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Old and Middle Kingdoms Does it follow that \\"The Left and Young Kingdoms.\\"? Select from: a. yes. b. it is not possible to tell. c. no.","completion":"c. no. The terms \\"Old Kingdom\\" and \\"Middle Kingdom\\" relate to specific periods in the historical timeline of Ancient Egypt, while \\"The Left and Young Kingdoms\\" doesn't correspond to any particular eras in history. Furthermore, \\"left\\" and \\"young\\" are not chronological or historical terms. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of these periods, it is crucial to look at them separately. 1. The Old Kingdom (2686 - 2181 BCE): The Old Kingdom is usually regarded as the first of three golden eras of Ancient Egypt, followed by the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom. The Old Kingdom period is marked by some of Egypt's most well-known accomplishments, primarily in art and architecture. The Old Kingdom era is sometimes referred to as the \\"Age of Pyramids,\\" due to the construction of the most famous Egyptian pyramids during this time. The Step Pyramid of Djoser, the first pyramid of Egypt, built by the architect Imhotep, is a notable example. Other renowned pyramids constructed during this period include the Great Pyramid of Giza, which was built for the Pharaoh Khufu, as well as the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure. During the Old Kingdom, pharaohs and their administrations achieved remarkable political stability and organization. The central government was highly active, and civil service was introduced. The artistic achievements of this period are also significant, as art became more formalized and idealized, setting the standards for later periods. The Old Kingdom finally came to an end because of increasing political instability, regional rivalries, and droughts. This led to a period of decline known as the First Intermediate Period. 2. The Middle Kingdom (2055 - 1650 BCE): The Middle Kingdom is characterized by a period of reunification and stability after the chaos and disarray that marked the First Intermediate Period. The Pharaohs Mentuhotep II and Amenemhat I are credited with reuniting Egypt during this time. This period is known for its significant advancements in various forms of art, literature, and architecture. The Middle Kingdom produced the first known pieces of Egyptian literature, such as the 'Tale of Sinuhe' and the 'Instructions of Amenemhat.' The art of this period exhibits more realism and portrays people in more personal and individual ways, as opposed to the Old Kingdom's formalized style. The Middle Kingdom also saw developments in architectural techniques. The period featured a shift from pyramids to rock-cut tombs. Osiride columns and papyrus capitals were also introduced during this era. The decline of the Middle Kingdom can be attributed to various factors, including weak pharaohs, internal strife, and the invasion of the Hyksos, a group from Western Asia. This decline led to the Second Intermediate Period, which eventually gave way to the New Kingdom, the third major era of Ancient Egypt. In conclusion, \\"The Left and Young Kingdoms\\" does not follow the historical context or timeline of Ancient Egypt. It is important to recognize the specific concepts, achievements, and events of the Old and Middle Kingdoms to better understand their place in the grand narrative of ancient Egyptian civilization."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In this context, the word conveys a sense of excitement and admiration for the pop entertainment mentioned. 2. \\"Pop entertainment\\" is a genre often seen as enjoyable and easily accessible, making it a popular form of entertainment. The reference to pop entertainment within the phrase suggests that the content discussed is widely appealing and engaging, which would generally be perceived as a positive attribute. 3.

This presentation further emphasizes the positive nature of the phrase. In conclusion, the phrase \\"in the form of dazzling pop entertainment\\" can be considered positive due to the use of an adjective with a favorable connotation (dazzling), the reference to a genre deemed pleasurable and engaging (pop entertainment), and how the elements are brought together in a way that highlights the subject's positive traits."},{"prompt":"In this task, you're given a review from Amazon.

Given the question: Question: What do you see for entertainment on a screen? Options: - movie - casino - theatre - show - comedy The answer is \\"movie\\" because The answer is:","completion":"\\"movie\\" because movies are a popular form of visual entertainment that are specifically created to be viewed on a screen. They are a versatile and engaging medium that caters to various tastes and preferences, offering a wide range of genres, themes, and narratives to capture the imagination and provide a compelling viewing experience. Movies are an ideal choice for entertainment on a screen because they cater to an individual's or group's specific interests, mood, and desired level of engagement. A movie, also known as a film or motion picture, is a form of storytelling that uses moving images to tell a fictional or non-fictional narrative. These moving images are created by capturing a series of still images with photographic equipment and then projecting them in rapid succession onto a screen, creating the appearance of continuous motion. The process of creating movies typically involves a combination of various elements, such as cinematography, sound design, editing, and direction, to craft a cohesive and engaging story that is both visually and emotionally captivating. The other options provided - casino, theatre, show, and comedy - may also offer entertainment on a screen, but not in the same way or to the same extent as movies. Casinos are primarily associated with gambling and gaming, with screen-based entertainment often being a secondary consideration. Casino screens usually display information related to games, such as roulette wheels or slot machines, rather than conveying a comprehensive narrative or evoking an emotional response. Theatre refers to the art of live performance and typically takes place on a stage, not on a screen. Although recorded theatrical performances can be enjoyed on a screen, the primary medium for theatre is still a live, in-person experience. A \\"show\\" is a more general term that can encompass various forms of entertainment, from live performances to television series. In some cases, a show may be an appropriate answer when referring to screen-based entertainment, such as when watching a TV series. However, the term is not as specific or definitive as \\"movie\\" when addressing entertainment on a screen. \\"Comedy\\" is a genre of entertainment rather than a specific format. While it is true that comedy can be enjoyed on a screen in the form of comedic movies or TV shows, the term itself does not directly indicate a screen-based form of entertainment. In summary, the answer \\"movie\\" is the most fitting of the provided options because movies are specifically produced for the purpose of providing visual entertainment on a screen. They encompass a vast array of narrative styles, genres, and themes, making them appealing and engaging to diverse audiences. While the other options may offer varying levels of screen-based entertainment, none of them are as focused, versatile, or universally enjoyable as movies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the absence of suitable plate culture techniques, some microbes require culture within live animals. Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals, although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary. Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals. Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs. Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent. Chagas disease is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis. In this case, xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi, an uninfected triatomine bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected. The bug is later inspected for growth of T. cruzi within its gut.

Given the following context: On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed Konzertmeister (concert master) of the Weimar Hofkapelle (court chapel) of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. The position was created for him, possibly on his demand, giving him \\"a newly defined rank order\\" according to Christoph Wolff.From 1695, an arrangement shared the responsibility for church music at the Schlosskirche (court church) between the Kapellmeister Samuel Drese and the Vize-Kapellmeister Georg Christoph Strattner, who took care of one Sunday per month while the Kapellmeister served on three Sundays. The pattern probably continued from 1704, when Strattner was succeeded by Drese's son Johann Wilhelm. When Konzertmeister Bach also assumed the principal responsibility for one cantata a month, the Kapellmeister's workload was further reduced to two Sundays per month.The performance venue on the third tier of the court church, in German called Himmelsburg (Heaven's Castle), has been described by Wolff as \\"congenial and intimate\\", calling for a small ensemble of singers and players. Performers of the cantatas were mainly the core group of the Hofkapelle, formed by seven singers, three leaders and five other instrumentalists. Additional players of the military band were available when needed, and also town musicians and singers of the gymnasium. Bach as the concertmaster probably led the performances as the first violinist, while the organ part was played by Bach's students such as Johann Martin Schubart and Johann Caspar Vogler. Even in settings like chamber music, Bach requested a strong continuo section with cello, bassoon and violone in addition to the keyboard instrument. answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who was succeeded by Drese's son Johann Wilhelm?

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad.

Background: Ralph Waldo Emerson (May 25, 1803 - April 27, 1882) was an American essayist, lecturer, philosopher and poet who led the transcendentalist movement of the mid-19th century. He was seen as a champion of individualism and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, and he disseminated his thoughts through dozens of published essays and more than 1,500 public lectures across the United States. Emerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of transcendentalism in his 1836 essay \\"Nature\\". Following this work, he gave a speech entitled \\"The American Scholar\\" in 1837, which Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. considered to be America's \\"intellectual Declaration of Independence\\". Context: Emerson was staunchly opposed to slavery, but he did not appreciate being in the public limelight and was hesitant about lecturing on the subject. He did, however, give a number of lectures during the pre-Civil War years, beginning as early as November, 1837. A number of his friends and family members were more active abolitionists than he, at first, but from 1844 on, he took a more active role in opposing slavery. He gave a number of speeches and lectures, and notably welcomed John Brown to his home during Brown's visits to Concord. He voted for Abraham Lincoln in 1860, but Emerson was disappointed that Lincoln was more concerned about preserving the Union than eliminating slavery outright. Once the American Civil War broke out, Emerson made it clear that he believed in immediate emancipation of the slaves. Around this time, in 1860, Emerson published The Conduct of Life, his seventh collection of essays. In this book, Emerson \\"grappled with some of the thorniest issues of the moment,\\" and \\"his experience in the abolition ranks is a telling influence in his conclusions.\\" In these essays Emerson strongly embraced the idea of war as a means of national rebirth: \\"Civil war, national bankruptcy, or revolution, [are] more rich in the central tones than languid years of prosperity.\\" Emerson visited Washington, D.C, at the end of January 1862. He gave a public lecture at the Smithsonian on January 31, 1862, and declared:, \\"The South calls slavery an institution... I call it destitution... Emancipation is the demand of civilization\\". The next day, February 1, his friend Charles Sumner took him to meet Lincoln at the White House. Lincoln was familiar with Emerson's work, having previously seen him lecture. Emerson's misgivings about Lincoln began to soften after this meeting. In 1865, he spoke at a memorial service held for Lincoln in Concord: \\"Old as history is, and manifold as are its tragedies, I doubt if any death has caused so much pain as this has caused, or will have caused, on its announcement.\\" Emerson also met a number of high-ranking government officials, including Salmon P. Chase, the secretary of the treasury; Edward Bates, the attorney general; Edwin M. Stanton, the secretary of war; Gideon Welles, the secretary of the navy; and William Seward, the secretary of state. On May 6, 1862, Emerson's protege Henry David Thoreau died of tuberculosis at the age of 44. Emerson delivered his eulogy. He often referred to Thoreau as his best friend, despite a falling-out that began in 1849 after Thoreau published A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers. Another friend, Nathaniel Hawthorne, died two years after Thoreau, in 1864. Emerson served as a pallbearer when Hawthorne was buried in Concord, as Emerson wrote, \\"in a pomp of sunshine and verdure\\". He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1864. Question: Did he continue to meet high ranking government officials? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Ralph Waldo Emerson continued to meet high-ranking government officials. He met people like Salmon P. Chase, the secretary of the treasury; Edward Bates, the attorney general; Edwin M. Stanton, the secretary of war; Gideon Welles, the secretary of the navy; and William Seward, the secretary of state. These meetings showed that Emerson was an important person and his ideas were valued by important leaders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

Write an article with the title: \\"Entrepreneurial UK: 10 things Britain has given the world\\"","completion":"Title: Entrepreneurial UK: 10 Things Britain Has Given the World Introduction The United Kingdom has long been a hub of innovation and entrepreneurship. Throughout history, British inventors and entrepreneurs have made remarkable contributions to the world, impacting various industries and enhancing the lives of people around the globe. In this article, we will explore 10 remarkable things that Britain has given to the world, serving as a testament to the creativity and ingenuity that has been the hallmark of entrepreneurial UK. 1. The World Wide Web One of the most transformative inventions in recent history, the World Wide Web, was the brainchild of British computer scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee. In 1989, while working at CERN, Berners-Lee proposed a global hypermedia project that allowed people to access information available on the internet through a graphical interface. His creation revolutionized communication and has significantly influenced the modern world. 2. The Steam Engine Developed by British inventor Thomas Newcomen in the early 18th century, the steam engine represented a monumental leap forward in industrial technology. The efficient conversion of heat energy into mechanical energy enabled the booming of the textile industry and laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution. The steam engine also facilitated advancements in transport, including the invention of steam-powered locomotives and steamships. 3. The Telephone Although Alexander Graham Bell, the man credited with inventing the telephone, was Scottish-born, he conducted much of his work on this vital communication tool in the UK. Bell successfully invented the first practical telephone in 1876, transforming global communication and connecting people like never before. 4. The Smallpox Vaccine Physician Edward Jenner’s development of the smallpox vaccine in 1796 marked the beginning of modern vaccination as we know it. Jenner’s vaccine significantly reduced the global prevalence of smallpox, and by 1980, the World Health Organization declared the deadly disease officially eradicated. As a result, millions of lives have been saved, and vaccination has become an essential element of public health. 5. The Jet Engine British engineer Sir Frank Whittle is widely considered the father of the modern jet engine. Whittle’s innovative design, based on a gas turbine, revolutionized aviation in the 20th century. Jet engines made air transport more accessible, faster, and efficient, greatly expanding the possibilities for international travel and trade. 6. The Sewing Machine In 1845, English inventor Elias Howe perfected the sewing machine design, enabling British manufacturing to lead the way in textile production. The sewing machine enormously increased the efficiency of garment production, giving rise to modern clothing industries and fostering the development of global fashion trends. 7. The Lightbulb Although Thomas Edison is typically associated with the invention of the lightbulb, the concept was pioneered in Britain. Sir Hiram Maxim and Sir Joseph Wilson Swan were among the early inventors who worked on prototypes of the incandescent bulb during the late 19th century. Edison refined these British innovations, resulting in the lightbulb as we know it today. 8. Penicillin The game-changing discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Scottish biologist Sir Alexander Fleming ushered in the era of antibiotics. Fleming's serendipitous finding led to the development of drugs that have saved countless lives by combating bacterial infections. Penicillin stands as one of the most significant medical discoveries in history. 9. The Television Scottish engineer and inventor John Logie Baird made history in 1925 when he successfully demonstrated the world's first working television system. Although it was initially seen as a curious novelty, television rapidly became a pervasive and vital component of society, entertainment, and telecommunication systems. 10. The Electric Motor Michael Faraday, an English scientist, developed the foundation of the electric motor in the early 19th century. Faraday's groundbreaking work in electromagnetism led to the development of the first primitive electric motor, which ultimately paved the way for innovations such as electric vehicles and various household appliances. Conclusion These are just a few of the myriad of innovations and advancements that the entrepreneurial spirit of the United Kingdom has brought forth. From communication and transport to healthcare and entertainment, the country’s rich history of invention has had a lasting and profound impact on the world. Though these ten items represent only a fraction of British accomplishments, they serve as a reminder of the potential for exceptional creativity and ingenuity that lies within us all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: A World Series Game 1 that felt as if it carried the weight of something more KANSAS CITY, Mo. — In theory, Game 1 of the World Series is supposed to be a kind of introduction to the drama, a feeling-out between two exceptional teams that might compete seven times in nine days. In reality, sometimes it’s the swing game, the contest both teams know they could have won, but only one did. And that game can hang over the rest of the Series, especially since 23 of the past 27 World Series have been won by the team that captured Game 1. Tom Boswell is a Washington Post sports columnist. Few teams have pulled out a more inspirational win, on more levels, than the Kansas City Royals did in 14 innings here Tuesday night, 5-4, over the New York Mets, who must wonder what hit them, from how many angles and what remarkable deeds, and strokes of luck, the Royals required to beat them in a marathon of will. [The wild game that ended with a Royals win] Royals starting pitcher Edinson Volquez worked six strong innings, in large part because his family and his team both kept it a secret that his father had died earlier in the day. Much of the world knew. The man on the mound didn’t. When he left the game, he got the news and left the park, his good work done. “The family said, ‘Let Eddie pitch,’ ” Royals Manager Ned Yost said. “He didn’t know. . . . We had a plan if he found out. It’d almost be impossible to do that before Game 1 of the World Series. We went to [veteran] Chris Young and told him to be ready — in case. He also lost his father [this year]. He understood.” The Royals’ potential goat, Eric Hosmer, whose error at first base prevented a nine-inning K.C. win, was provided an opportunity to atone in the 14th — and did with a walk-off sacrifice fly. Instead of being a poor-man’s Kansas City version of Bill Buckner, he was mobbed like a hero by teammates as a crowd of 40,320, which stood for at least two of the final three hours of this 5:09 game, roared its praise and (almost) forgot he had ever sinned. Hosmer’s buddy, left fielder Alex Gordon, provided him with that chance at redemption with a game-tying, one-out home run off Mets stellar closer Jeurys Familia with one out in the bottom of the ninth. Familia has been lights-out, door-closed, go-home-you’re-done, all season. The Royals have the deeper, better bullpen. But Familia can match almost any K.C. fireman. But not on this night. “Baseball is about adversity and overcoming it,” said Gordon, who claimed that Hosmer owed him no eternal debt of gratitude and had said nothing, though cameras caught Hosmer hugging and thanking Gordon profusely and profanely when he returned to the dugout. “Tough hop. He usually makes that play.” Gordon was far more focused on Familia. “He tried to quick-pitch me, and he left it right over there [down the middle], and I hit it,” said Gordon, whose ball traveled about 440 feet, his maximum down-range limit, dead to center field. “It’s part of the game now,” Gordon said of the despised but entirely permitted hurry-up delivery, often used against hiters with deliberate rituals at the plate. “A lot of guys do it now. We’ve got one: [Johnny] Cueto. I wouldn’t have known, but I saw him do it to [the previous hitter] Salvi [Perez]. I got ready for it.” You can hardly top all that for inspiration, even in a game that ends at 1:18 a.m. Eastern time and equals, in innings, the longest World Series game ever played. Except that the Royals did top it. Their winning pitcher — 10 up, nine down, working deep into extra innings — was a 6-foot-10 right-hander. Long ago, he graduated from Princeton. Once, he was a star. In recent years, he has been washed up three times, including a brief out-of-respect tryout with the Nats. At 34, he went back to the minors, yes, for love of the game. Finally, in this Game 1, Chris Young, razor-sharp and dealing to every hitter at age 36, had the postseason moment — a World Series moment — for which he’d waited all his life. Eight times he punched the radar gun above 90 mph, something he hadn’t done in this decade. “Yeah, World Series adrenaline,” Yost said, grinning. This coin has two sides, a bright and shinning one and a dismal dark one for the Mets who have a day to recover and retaliate or fall behind by two games, which seals the fate of almost all Series teams that also must face potential Games 6 and 7 on the road. Few teams have taken a gut punch on more levels than the Mets, who misplayed a fly ball into an inside-the-park home run on the first pitch of the first inning. “Michael [Conforto] in left field thought he heard [center fielder Yoenis] Cespedes call for it. He wasn’t sure,” Mets Manager Terry Collins said. “But he gave way. Cespedes didn’t catch it.” In fact, the ball almost hit Cespedes in the hip pocket, then ricocheted off his foot far away as swift Alcides Escobar circled the bases and scored standing. “It should have been caught,”Collins said, not accusingly. “It was a little bit stunning on the first [defensive] pitch of the game.” Watching your star closer blow a lead on a titanic bomb in the ninth can be a little stunning. So can finding out that the other guys are successfully keeping a parent’s death a secret from their starting pitcher. “We had our opportunities,” Collins said. In Game 1 of a World Series, those can be a heavy weight, even with so much time still to play. Those were the same thoughts as Tony La Russa after his 105-win Cardinals lost a complex, tormenting 11-9 game to the Red Sox to start the ’04 Series. Such games, those that obviously could have and probably should have been won, don’t have to remain a haunt to the losing team. But they can. An extremely high-quality St. Louis team never seemed to recover and was swept. The Mets have a prime chance in Game 2 with superb Jacob deGrom working against Cueto, a star for years, but frequently abysmal in recent starts, including allowing eight runs in two innings in his last start. The Game 2 drama, and the sense of near-exhaustion in both teams after the final pitch, likely won’t approach this night with tens of thousands of blue-clad fans standing and cheering by the hour. “There are two things you don’t want to do in the first game of the World Series,” Yost said. “One: play 14 innings. Two: lose.” Only one team had to bear that weight. Now they must respond. For more by Thomas Boswell, visit washingtonpost.com/boswell.

With which type of transport is James Brindley associated What is the answer?","completion":"James Brindley is most notably associated with the development and construction of canals in 18th-century Britain. Born in 1716 in the Tunstead, Derbyshire, England, Brindley became a pioneer of the British canal system during the Industrial Revolution, contributing significantly to the transformation of the transportation landscape at the time. Brindley started his career as a millwright, acquiring exceptional skills in mechanical engineering. His talent was discovered by the prominent industrialist and engineer, the Duke of Bridgewater, who hired Brindley to assist in the construction of his underground canal to transport coal from his mines at Worsley to Manchester. This project led to the creation of the Bridgewater Canal, a monumental achievement in its time, as it significantly reduced transportation costs and provided a more efficient means to move goods between inland locations and ports. Following the success of the Bridgewater Canal, Brindley began to develop his expertise in canal technology further. He was instrumental in the design and construction of several other crucial canal projects, such as the Birmingham Canal, Grand Trunk Canal, Trent and Mersey Canal, and the Coventry Canal. These waterways linked major industrial towns and cities, enabling efficient transportation of goods and resources like coal, iron, and pottery, which were critical to the burgeoning industrial economy. One of Brindley's most notable and enduring innovations was the development of water- and canal-lock technology. This allowed canal boats to navigate inclines and differences in water levels, helping integrate canals into the British landscape. Brindley's locks enabled a vast network of navigable waterways to take shape across the country, fostering industrial growth and the expansion of commerce. Brindley's advancements in canal technology also had a significant impact on the design and engineering of canal boats themselves. The narrowboats, as they came to be known, were specifically designed to efficiently navigate the tight passageways and low clearances of the canals that Brindley built. These boats played a crucial role in the British transport system for many decades before railroads started to take over. In summary, James Brindley is best known for his groundbreaking contributions to the development of canals in 18th-century Britain, serving as a vital catalyst for economic growth during the early years of the Industrial Revolution. While the canal system has since been eclipsed by other forms of transportation, Brindley's innovations in canal engineering and boat design laid the groundwork for modern transportation infrastructure and remain an important legacy of Britain's industrial past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - The organism must die to begin the process - The soft tissue decomposes - The bones are left behind - Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil - This makes discovery of the fossil possible. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Choking starts to occurs happens, how will it affect MORE fossils forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The choking perturbation, in this context, refers to an obstruction or hindrance in the process that might affect fossil formation. If choking occurs, it may have both direct and indirect effects on fossil formation. Here's a detailed analysis of how this perturbation might affect the fossilization process: 1. Direct effects: a. If choking occurs during the decomposition of the organisms, it might slow down or alter the rate of decomposition and burial. This can lead to less optimal conditions for preservation and fossilization of the remains. b. Choking may prevent or alter the scattering and burial of bones, which is essential for fossil formation. If bones are not properly buried and protected from external factors, they are less likely to fossilize. 2. Indirect effects: a. Choking can alter the environmental conditions, such as reduced oxygen levels, that are favorable for fossilization. This can decrease the likelihood of remains turning into fossils. b. As a result of the altered conditions, there may be changes in the balance of the ecosystem, such as shifts in scavenger populations and their feeding behaviors. This can further affect the dispersion and burial of bones. c. Choking may also influence weather patterns and the rate of erosion, which could either expose fossils prematurely or keep them buried for longer periods. This would affect the discovery and study of fossils. In conclusion, the choking perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the fossil formation process. Depending on the severity and persistence of this perturbation, it can potentially hinder or alter the conditions necessary for fossil formation, thereby affecting the number of fossils formed and our ability to discover and study them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: Celtic fans were outraged their rivals had seemingly gained an unfair sporting advantage by winning titles with players they otherwise could not have afforded without this dubious tax wheeze. Rangers fans were angry because the name of their club was being dragged through the mud - through no fault of theirs. Sir David Murray made a criminal complaint against the BBC for broadcasting the data, which he said was \\"private and confidential\\". Now, according to today's judgment, the \\"true nature\\" of the EBT scheme, of which Sir David was the single biggest recipient, has been laid bare. In what appears to be a thinly disguised critique of the original First-tier Tribunal decision, Lord Drummond Young said it was \\"common sense\\" that \\"if income is derived from an employee's services…it is ..earnings\\". And so, tax should have been paid. Using our \\"data room\\" in the BBC Scotland programme Rangers: The Men Who Sold The Jerseys, we revealed how 87 EBT sub-trusts had been set up for Rangers players or staff, with up to £47m paid. Recipients included former captain Barry Ferguson (£2.5m), goalkeeper Stefan Klos (£2.5m) and even a curious £30,000 payment to former manager Graeme Souness 10 years after he left the club. Between 2001 and 2010, 40% of Rangers players benefited from the scheme. Thirteen trophies were won during this period. Sir David Murray was the biggest recipient, receiving £6.3m of tax-free cash. He always claimed it was legitimate. But the scheme - brought to the club by struck-off lawyer and pornographer Paul Baxendale-Walker - was a high-risk strategy, which even if today's judgement had gone the other way, was so close to the wire that it was always going to attract heat from the tax man. The club had used the scheme heavily, meaning that if it ever came unstuck, the liability could be too great to absorb. This potential liability had made the club unsellable to any serious bidder. The only man interested was Craig Whyte, from whom Sir David took £1 to walk away. Sir David Murray's old empire lies in tatters. His company which owned Rangers is in liquidation. HMRC may now enter the scrap for the cash liquidators have managed to salvage, along with the dozens of small businesses which were left out of pocket by the collapse of Rangers. Today's decision may be appealed against by the liquidators, and the saga could continue. But ultimately, who has paid for this disaster? The fans, of course.","completion":"Celtic fans were upset over rivals Rangers gaining an unfair advantage through a tax scheme, which allowed them to afford players they might not have been able to otherwise. The tax scheme, called the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) scheme, has been under scrutiny, with Rangers fans angered by their club's name being smeared. Sir David Murray, the biggest recipient of the EBT scheme, filed a criminal complaint against the BBC for broadcasting confidential information about it. However, a recent judgment has revealed the truth about the scheme, which should have been taxed due to being considered earnings. The club used the scheme heavily, bringing on high-risk liability and resulting in financial difficulties that left it unsellable. Consequently, the fans have paid the highest price for this disaster."},{"prompt":"You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews.

Title: The Mummy's Ghost Movie plot: In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The recovery in Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s (005930.KS) mobile business suffered a blow on Thursday as reports of exploding batteries forced the firm to delay shipments of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, and knocked 7 billion off its market value. A model demonstrates iris recognition function of Galaxy Note 7 new smartphone during its launching ceremony in Seoul, South Korea, August 11, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo Investors drove the stock to two-week lows after the global smartphone leader told Reuters late on Wednesday the shipments had been delayed for quality control testing, and that shipments to South Korea’s top three mobile carriers had been halted. Faults with the new premium flagship device could deal a major blow to the South Korean giant, which was counting on the Galaxy Note 7 to maintain its strong mobile earnings momentum against Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) new iPhones expected to be unveiled next week. “This is some major buzz-kill for Samsung, especially given all of the hard-earned excitement that products like the Note 7 have been garnering lately,” IDC analyst Bryan Ma said. “The pending Apple launch puts all the more pressure for them to contain this quickly. The timing of this couldn’t have been worse.” Samsung did not comment on what problem it was trying to address or whether other markets were affected besides South Korea. Sister company Samsung SDI Co Ltd (006400.KS) said that while it was a supplier of Galaxy Note 7 batteries, it had received no information to suggest the batteries were faulty. Several people posted images and videos of charred Galaxy Note 7s online and said their phones had caught on fire. “Be careful out there, everyone rocking the new Note 7, might catch fire y’all,” one user said in a YouTube clip showing a burnt Note phone. It was not immediately possible to confirm the veracity of the clip. Related Coverage Samsung Electronics shares open down as firm flags Galaxy Note problem Samsung's shares, which hit a record high of 1.694 million won last week, fell 2 percent, and Samsung SDI tumbled 6.1 percent, versus a 0.1 percent fall for the broader market .KS11. Several South Korean media reports, without citing direct sources, said Samsung will soon announce a plan to recall affected Note 7 phones and replace their batteries as opposed to giving the users a new device. A Samsung spokesman declined to comment on the reports. DAMAGE CONTROL Last year, production problems for the curved displays for the Galaxy S6 edge model resulted in disappointing sales, and Samsung risks a repeat this year if it cannot address the Galaxy Note 7 problems quickly. Its mobile profit is on track to post annual growth for the first time in three years, thanks to robust sales of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge devices that it launched in March to critical acclaim. The Galaxy Note 7 received similar praise, raising expectations for strong sales in the second half. Samsung said in August demand for the new handset, priced at 988,900 won (882) in South Korea, was far exceeding supply, pushing the firm to delay the launch in some markets. HDC Asset Management fund manager Park Jung-hoon said it now appeared inevitable that Samsung’s smartphone average selling price and profits would miss lofty second-half expectations. “Apple is supposed to show off the iPhone 7 next week and this issue has emerged, so the current state of things do not look good,” he said. Though a components pick-up will buttress overall profits, Park said mobile operating profit might decline by up to 200 billion won for July-September. Slideshow (2 Images) The mobile division accounted for about 54 percent of Samsung Electronics’ January-June operating profit of 14.8 trillion won. Hyundai Securities said in a report that the Galaxy Note 7’s problems should be resolved within a “few weeks”. The brokerage retained its third-quarter operating profit forecast of 8.5 trillion won. ||||| Last week we brought word that a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 had exploded while charging. Given that the handset is practically brand new, it is rather disturbing news. However it seems that things are getting worse. According to another report, it seems that yet another Galaxy Note 7 has exploded while being charged. Now we should note that both times might not necessarily have been Samsung’s fault. The first time was apparently due to a third-party micro USB to USB-C cable, and now from what we hear, it might have been a similar issue in this case. According to the report from Business Korea, they quoted the friend of the owner of the exploded Note 7. The quote reads, “There was another explosion of the Galaxy Note 7. It was my friend’s phone. A Samsung employee checked the site and he is currently in talks over the compensation with Samsung. You should use its original charger just in case and leave the phone far away from where you are while charging.” So like we said, it sounds like the person might have been using an unofficial charger or cable. If that is the case, it shouldn’t be surprising. There have been reports of USB-C cables that aren’t compliant with the standard, and just recently Anker has issued a recall on some of their cables due to the potential dangers behind it. In any case the device in question is apparently now being looked at by Samsung, but in the meantime just stick to the official charge and cable just to be safe. Filed in .

The delay is in response to a flurry of reports on South Korea social media showing destroyed phones as a result of an \\"explosion\\" from the battery. The Samsung statement to Reuters on the matter is terse, saying only that \\"shipments of the Galaxy Note 7 are being delayed due to additional tests being conducted for product quality.\\"Not known is what markets are affected by the delay, or how long the shipment hold will last. The U.S. and international models have slightly different hardware configurations, but identical batteries.Initial reports on South Korea social media may point to non-Samsung USB 3 type-C cabling as the culprit. Apple has seen similar problems with faulty third-party charging accessories in the past , and a Google engineer has spent a great deal of time exposing bad USB-C products for similar reasons The Galaxy Note 7 was announced on Aug. 2 and started shipping to U.S. customers on Aug. 19. AT&T is currently listing short delays for the device, with a unit ordered on Aug. 31 shipping between Sept. 6 and Sept. 8. T-Mobile has similar shipment windows. Amazon is showing no hold-ups in shipping, but a similar customer receipt window.The battery failures aren't the first issues identified by users of the Galaxy Note 7. Reviewers and YouTube examiners have noted that the Gorilla Glass 5 used for the screen of the device is significantly more susceptible to screen scratches than other smartphones, iPhone 6 included.Gorilla Glass manufacturer Corning disagreed with the scratch test results, and called screen damage induced by testers making an effectively permanent \\"material transfer\\" from the testing apparatus to the screen.The earlier Galaxy S6 edge phone with a curved display had significant production problems, leading to lower than expected sales. Any quality problem, even one resolved quickly, with the Galaxy Note 7 is likely to have impacts on sales, especially with the \\"iPhone 7\\" unveil event imminent AppleInsider has reached out to Samsung for further comment on the matter, as well for details on impacted markets and expected resumption of shipments. ||||| Samsung will recall Galaxy Note 7 handsets already sold to consumers in South Korea following incidents of the phone's battery exploding, local media is reporting. According to Chosun Ilbo, the South Korean tech giant plans to recall around 400,000 Note 7 units sold in South Korea. It halted shipments to local telcos on Wednesday following multiple reports of the exploding batteries in both Korea and abroad. Samsung previously confirmed it was doing more quality testing for the phones. A source familiar with the matter told ZDNet that the firm will post a notice for consumers soon and that it has not been decided whether it will recall all Note 7 handsets sold or only the ones it deems affected by the defective parts. Reports claimed that Samsung will return the recalled phones with new batteries. Consumers won't be offered a refund or a brand new phone, Chosun Ilbo said, but Note 7 users will be able to visit service centers nearby and will be offered the new parts for free. For consumers abroad, including the US, the company will offer new batteries only to the phones that used the defective batteries. If the recall proceeds, it will be first time ever for a handset in South Korea. A Samsung spokesman said \\"it was discussing the issue of Note 7 internally\\" and will make an announcement soon. The South Korean tech giant posted its highest profit in two years backed by strong Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge sales in the second quarter. Success of the Galaxy Note 7 is crucial for it to continue momentum through the third and fourth quarters. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Samsung Electronics is facing a potential crisis following reports of exploding batteries in its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones which have forced the company to delay shipments and led to over 7bn being wiped off its market value.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Following their 2004 reunion, the Pixies felt that recording a new song would \\"break the ice\\" between band members after their acrimonious split in 1993. As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour, DreamWorks contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of Shrek 2. The band agreed, and frontman Black Francis and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children. Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while, and since her band The Breeders were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies. The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a \\"poppier, more kid-friendly thing,\\" and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two—in the previous two Pixies studio albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991), Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split. However, the two appeared at the time to have resolved their differences: Francis praised \\"Bam Thwok,\\" as \\"a really good song.\\" despite joking in interviews about how he planned to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a hypothetical new album. However, Deal eventually left the band in June 2013, before the release of the band's next album, Indie Cindy. Guess a valid title for it!

The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests placing the ingredients into a hot dog bun and eating it plain, which contradicts the original statement. The premise highlights a meal that takes inspiration from Tex-Mex cuisine, which is a fusion of American and Mexican culinary traditions.

Q:Information: - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\". - Middelburg is a municipality and a city in the south-western Netherlands and the capital of the province of Zeeland. Situated on the central peninsula of the Zeeland province, \\"Midden-Zeeland\\" (consisting of former islands Walcheren, Noord-Beveland and Zuid-Beveland), it has a population of about 48,000. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - For the Edwardian Grand Prix racing driver - see Albert Clément Arie Albertus ( Albert ) Clement ( born 9 August 1962 , Middelburg ) is professor of musicology at the University College Roosevelt , a small liberal arts college in Middelburg , the Netherlands .

In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - Musicology is the scholarly analysis and research-based study of music. Musicology is part of the humanities. A scholar who participates in musical research is a musicologist. - Humanities are academic disciplines that study aspects of human culture. In the Middle Ages, the term contrasted with divinity and referred to what is now called classics, the main area of secular study in universities at the time. Today, the humanities are more frequently contrasted with natural and sometimes social sciences as well as professional training.

The model couldn't be used in comparison to the actual ship because the OPTIONS: -- model was proportionate. -- ship was proportionate.","completion":"The model couldn't be used in comparison to the actual ship because the model was proportionate. Step 1: Understand the task The task is to continue the given text while choosing one of the given options. In this case, I need to decide whether to use \\"model was proportionate\\" or \\"ship was proportionate\\" and justify why. Step 2: Analyze the options First, I need to analyze what each option would imply: a) \\"model was proportionate\\" - This implies that the model is an accurate representation of the ship in terms of scale, but there might be another reason that prevents it from being used for comparison. b) \\"ship was proportionate\\" - This implies that there is nothing wrong with the ship's proportions, which doesn't provide a clear reason for not using the model in comparison. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate option Based on the analyses, I will choose option a) \\"model was proportionate\\" as it has a more logical connection to not being able to use the model for comparison and proceed with my response. Step 4: Continue the text with the chosen option The model couldn't be used in comparison to the actual ship because the model was proportionate. Although the model's size and dimensions were scaled down accurately, it was not designed to account for the complex, dynamic conditions experienced by the ship at sea. As a result, the model's behavior under real-world environmental factors, such as wind, waves, and currents, could be significantly different from how the actual ship would react. Moreover, the materials used in constructing the model may not be entirely representative of those utilized in the actual ship. For example, the model might have been made with lighter materials to save costs, whereas the ship's hull is built with robust and heavy materials to ensure durability and strength. Furthermore, the model might lack vital elements, such as machinery and electronic systems, that could greatly influence the ship's performance. It is also important to consider the interaction between the ship's crew and its systems, which may impact the ship's response to various scenarios and conditions. In conclusion, although the model was proportionate, it could not be used for a direct comparison with the actual ship due to the numerous differences and limitations inherent in a scaled model. A more thorough and detailed examination of both the model and the actual ship would be essential to make accurate comparisons and evaluations of their performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Labour strategists believe the election campaign will give voters a chance to see Mr Corbyn in a different light, a decent man who is passionate about social justice, rather than the caricature of him in the right wing press as an out-of-touch left wing ideologue. Mr McDonnell is also being pushed to the front of the campaign, talking about his working class roots and his plans for the economy. The Conservatives have also put Mr Corbyn at the centre of their campaign, constantly claiming that he would be a \\"shambolic\\" and \\"chaotic\\" leader not up to the job of PM.

After all it was the Attlee government which set it up in 1948, and it remains widely seen as Labour's crowning achievement. The party will be keen to move the focus of the campaign away from Brexit, and on to domestic issues, such as the NHS, which has come under intense pressure in recent months. Labour also believes it can score big with voters who feel the economic system is \\"rigged\\" against them, with one law for super rich tax avoiders and another for ordinary working people.

Only these doughnuts are all vegan. Donut Farm, which opened its first Los Angeles location late last year — there are outlets in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley — is making more than 15 kinds of vegan doughnuts. The company started as a hobby for San Francisco resident Josh Levine in 2007. He eventually started a vegan doughnut wholesale business, then opened his first vegan doughnut shop in Oakland in 2010. All of his doughnuts are vegan and 100% organic, which is an important thing to keep in mind when you take a bite of the plain glazed. Because if someone hands you this doughnut and doesn’t tell you it’s vegan, good luck figuring it out. The doughnut may not have the eggs, milk and butter that give a typical yeast doughnut its light, airy texture, but the glazed doughnut at Donut Farm is a dead ringer for the original. Chewy and almost weightless, the doughnuts get a full coating of the familiar sugary glaze. The fritters, both apple and banana, are equally deceptive. As is the jelly doughnut, covered in powdered sugar and full of raspberry jam. The cake doughnuts are on the heavier side, with a dense, stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth texture. And each is served under a blanket of flavored glaze, including salted caramel (tastes more like butterscotch), coffee (made with Philz coffee), Meyer lemon, chocolate or blueberry, just to name a few.

Co-owner Nate Snell indicated that any such dietary restrictions would hinder quality control as the individual would be unable to taste and accurately represent their products. Critics voiced their displeasure via email and social media, however, Snell mentioned that these criticisms further solidified his stance. He reasoned that his interest is to run a lawful business which aligns with his own rights and decisions, and wouldn’t be swayed by any form of intimidation or bullying. Some critics suggested that such a requirement could potentially violate federal anti-discrimination law. However, dietary preference is not technically protected under such laws. One of the critics, Dave Hobson, expressed his concerns, indicating that his religious beliefs necessitate him to consume a kosher diet, and this job criterion may leave him feeling discriminated against. Some highlighted the unfairness of excluding potential employees for their dietary choices. Defending the decision, Snell invited those who are vegetarian or vegan to apply by sending a respectful email explaining how they can still work and contribute to the shop despite their dietary preferences, while suggesting some possible workarounds. He mentioned that they had employees in the past who made drastic changes to their diets that eventually led to health safety issues and compromised product integrity. Nate Snell later sent a formal statement stating that they serve dishes containing common food allergens like meat, gluten, soy, dairy, and nuts and it’s a requisite for potential employees to taste their offerings. For those with voluntary, non-medical and non-religious dietary restrictions, employment at their shop could affect their ability to maintain food quality and uphold the health standards for both their customers and employees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a sentence that justifies which noun phrase the pronoun refers to. Correct reasons do not need to use all the knowledge from the sentence. The resolution of the pronoun coreference relations typically involve one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. You should answer 'Correct' if the reasoning made sense, otherwise, you should answer 'Wrong'.

In the provided example, the sentence is \\"Jim yelled at Kevin because he was so upset\\", and the reason given is \\"The 'he' refers to Jim because Kevin is the one in need of comfort.\\" The reasoning here seems to be based on an interpretation of the situation: the one who gives comfort is not typically the one who is upset. However, this particular interpretation is not clearly supported by the sentence itself. The sentence suggests that 'he' was upset, and so yelled at Kevin, which would imply that 'he' refers to Jim. However, the reason given assumes a situation (of Kevin needing comfort) that isn't clearly stated in the sentence.

Now, we need to get \\"k\\" all by itself. To do that, let's divide both sides of the equation by 41.

The band originally called themselves All Night Garage Sale but changed their name to Screeching Weasel, a variation of a name a friend had suggested, Screaming Otter, which was a reference to a T-shirt that read, \\"I'VE GOT A SCREAMING OTTER IN MY PANTS!\\". Shortly after their formation, Weasel decided that it was too difficult to play bass and sing at the same time, so Vince Vogel, who took the stage name \\"Vinnie Bovine\\" joined as the band's bassist. The band recorded their debut album, Screeching Weasel, in one night for 200 and released it on Chicago label Underdog Records in 1987. In 1988, Bovine was fired from the band and was replaced with Warren Fischer, better known as Fish, and former member of the band Ozzfish. The band recorded their second studio album, Boogadaboogadaboogada!, which featured Weasel playing second guitar (he would later state that he only played on about a quarter of the songs) and made a name for themselves by opening a show for Operation Ivy at 924 Gilman Street. Steve Cheese was fired from the band shortly after the recording due to his unwillingness to tour outside of Chicago. He was replaced by Aaron Cometbus for two shows who then was replaced by Brian Vermin. Boogadaboogadaboogada! was released in late 1988 on Roadkill Records, a label formed by investor David Best and managed by Ben Weasel following an introduction of the two by producer Mass Giorgini. After what Weasel described as a \\"disastrous\\" tour, Fish left the group and was replaced by Dan Schafer, originally nicknamed \\"Sewercap\\" and later renamed Danny Vapid. The new band members recorded an extended play entitled Punkhouse for Limited Potential Records soon after that. The band ended up recording four more songs in 1989 that were featured on compilations, featuring a second guitarist Doug Ward, who also joined the band for several live performances. Screeching Weasel disbanded when Vermin and Vapid stated that they wanted to leave the band to concentrate on their side project, Sludgeworth.","completion":"This text is about Screeching Weasel, an American punk rock band from the Chicago suburb of Prospect Heights, Illinois.

An Indian official has mocked questions over the gang rape and murder of two teenage girls telling journalists 'What's it to you?' Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav made the comments as police announced they had made a fifth arrest in the case, which saw the two girls attacked and then hanged from a tree in the state. It has also been revealed that two police officers have also been fired for failing to investigate when one of the girl's fathers reported them as missing. Scroll down for video. The mother of one of the gang-rape and murder victims in India mourns her daughter. The distraught father of one of the victims covers his face in despair after his daughter was raped and then hanged from a tree. Police escort one of the girls' mothers to the scene where the victims were discovered in Katra in Uttar Pradesh state. Sheer horror: Two teenage girls were found hanging from a tree in Katra village in Uttar Pradesh after they were allegedly raped and killed by a gang of men - including at least one police officer. 'Then why are you worried? What's it to you?' he added. Officers Malik says the fifth arrest in the case came early today with police facing growing criticism for a series of rapes in Uttar Pradesh state, which has a long reputation for lawlessness. The three other men arrested are cousins in their 20s from an extended family, and face murder and rape charges, they added. But in a country with a long history of tolerance for sexual violence, the firings yesterday and the minister's comments were not a surprise to many in India. People in New Delhi march in protest against the government of Uttar Pradesh, where the two girls were found hanged after being gang raped. Protesters carried placards demanding the immediate arrest of all of those accused in the gang rape case. Untouchables: The family belongs to the Dalit community, also called 'untouchables' and considered the lowest rung in India's age-old caste system. Last month Mr Yadav's father, a former chief minister and head of the state's ruling party also told an election rally that the party opposed a law calling for gang rapists to be executed. 'Boys will be boys,' Mulayam Singh Yadav said. 'They make mistakes.' Kavita Krishnan, a women's rights activist, said such comments make clear to police that rape isn't taken seriously by officials. She called the chief minister' comments 'a trivialisation of rape.' The gang rape, with video of the girls' corpses hanging from a mango tree and swaying gently in a breeze, was the top story Friday on India's relentless 24-hour news stations. Official statistics say about 25,000. rapes are committed every year in India, a nation of 1.2 billion people. But activists say that number is very low, since women are often. pressed by family or police to stay quiet about sexual assaults. Indian. police and politicians, who for decades had done little about sexual. violence, have faced growing public anger since the December 2012. gang-rape and murder of a young woman on a moving New Delhi bus, an. attack that sparked national outrage over the treatment of women.

Hours. later, the chief minister ordered that suspects in the attack be tried. in special \\"fast track\\" courts, to get around India's notoriously slow. judicial system. The girls, who were 14 and 15, were raped in the tiny village of Katra, about 180 miles from Lucknow. Police say they disappeared Tuesday night after going into fields since their house has no toilet. The father of one girl went to police that night to report them missing, but he said they refused to help. When. the bodies were discovered the next day, angry villagers silently. protested the police inaction by refusing to allow the bodies to be cut. down from the tree. The villagers allowed authorities to take down the corpses after the first arrests were made on Wednesday. The girls were Dalits, from the community once known as \\"untouchables\\" in India's ancient caste system. While. sexual assaults are reported across India, there have been a string of. high-profile attacks in just the past few days in Uttar Pradesh. On Thursday, police arrested three men for brutally attacking the mother of a rape victim after she refused to withdraw her complaint. The attack, in the town of Etawah, followed the May 11 rape of the woman's teenage daughter. A local man was arrested after the mother filed a complaint with authorities. Five men - including the father, a brother and a cousin of the man accused in the rape - followed the victim's mother away from her house on Monday and beat her relentlessly, demanding she drop the accusation, he said. Dinesh Kumar, the town's police superintendent. The mother was in critical condition in a hospital, with numerous broken bones and internal injuries.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: It is important that you follow your doctor's discontinuation plan faithfully and exactly. Even slight deviations from your doctor's plan could have negative implications for your well-being and safe discontinuation from psychiatric drugs. To help keep you on track, create a schedule for yourself in your calendar that lists exactly what you need to do and when. Ask a trusted family member or friend to remind you to check your calendar and to stay on track in following your discontinuation plan. Ask your doctor what steps you should take if you ever accidentally deviate from your discontinuation plan. Prepare yourself to suffer some type of symptoms or side effects from the weaning process including flu-like symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, headache, vomiting, fatigue and chills. Sleep-related and emotional side effects may plague you for anywhere from 1 to 7 weeks, including insomnia, vivid dreams, impaired concentration, irritability and sometimes suicidal thoughts. Other physical symptoms or side effects could include muscle pain, dizziness, sweating, blurred vision, tingling or electric shock sensations. Be sure to ask your doctor what withdrawal symptoms are most likely based on your diagnosis and psychiatric drug you are getting off of. Do not assume your prescribing physician is an expert on psychiatric drugs and the discontinuation process. General physicians are qualified to prescribe medications, to be sure, however, they may not be experts in the intricacies of psychiatric drugs and their discontinuation processes, as much as psychiatrists are. There are several questions you can ask your doctor. For example, you can ask your doctor whether she is familiar with the different treatment options for getting off the drug you are on. You can ask your doctor how much experience she has in treating the disorder you were diagnosed with and how much experience she has with the discontinuation process for the drug you are on. Your mental and physical health are at stake here. Do not be shy when you ask questions. If your doctor is any good, she will be understanding of your situation and will appreciate or tolerate your questions as a part of her job in making sure patients are treated properly and treated well. If your doctor dismisses your questions or immediately agrees to take you off of your drug, consider getting a second opinion from a different psychiatrist. The cost of getting a second opinion is probably smaller than the cost of taking bad advice regarding your getting off of psychiatric drugs, so if you are worried about the advice you are getting, try for a second opinion. Sometimes withdrawal symptoms can take weeks or even months to appear so if you are getting off of a psychiatric drug, you should check in regularly with the doctor getting you off of that drug. Tell your doctor you are concerned about withdrawal symptoms and follow their guidance for how often they think you should check in with them. They may also be able to give you specific symptoms to watch out for based on your particular diagnosis and psychiatric drug.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Man volunteered to be infected with Ebola virus in vaccine trial A man in the US has voluntarily been injected with the Ebola virus as part of a clinical trial to develop a vaccine against the deadly disease. Peter Hubbard revealed he was taking a small risk with his own life in the hope it will minimise the impact of future outbreaks of the disease that has already killed around 5000 people — mostly in West Africa. The 35-year-old market consultant is one of 20 people taking part in the clinical trial being run by the US National Institutes of Health and the pharmaceutical corporation GlaxoSmithKlien. \\"I get a lot of satisfaction out of the fact that this could potentially develop into a viable vaccine that prevents another outbreak,\\" Mr Hubbard told the Mirror. \\"It might not help out with the current outbreak but it could prevent a future one, so that's a real plus in my book.\\" If the trial is successful, GSK plans to stockpile up to 10,000 doses of the vaccine. Speaking from his home in Virginia, Mr Hubbard said that despite being injected with the virus on September 9 he is in good health and even took part in a marathon. \\"I feel great, yeah. In fact, I couldn't tell where the injection site was thirty minutes after it. I ran a marathon on Sunday. I'm alive and kicking.\\" The vaccine being trialled was built using the common cold virus, known as an adenovirus, engineered to carry two harmless Ebola virus genes. Animal testing has shown that when the adenovirus infects cells the Ebola genes create proteins which stimulate the immune system to produce anti-bodies against the virus. It is the fifth vaccine trial Mr Hubbard has participated in, having previously tested HIV, malaria, H1N1 (swine flu) and the chikungunya virus. \\"I do have a joke that, that with all of these vaccine trials that I've done, that if plague and pestilence were to sweep throughout the land, I'd be the last man standing,\\" Mr Hubbard said, adding he was not afraid of the current Ebola outbreak because he understands there is a \\"very low risk\\" of infection. Around 5000 people have been killed by the current Ebola this year as it spread throughout Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The disease spreads through direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected people and can have an incubation period of up to 21 days.

Investigations are under way into the cause of the \\"chemical haze\\", which is currently unknown, Sussex Police say. Beaches in the area are expected to be open as normal on Monday, although the situation will be monitored. Police say the believe it came in from the sea - previous incidents have involved something coming over from an industrial unit in France - but this has yet to be confirmed. A police spokesman said the first report came in from Birling Gap just before 17:00 BST where \\"up to 50 people had been affected by irritation to eyes and throats\\". The plume of gas moved eastwards along the coast as far as Bexhill, police said. Coastguard rescue teams from Birling Gap, Eastbourne, Bexhill and Newhaven raced to help clear the busy beaches as visitors feared they had been struck by a chlorine leak. As of Sunday night, 133 patients were being \\"decontaminated\\" at Eastbourne District General Hospital, according to East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust. The police said the effects, while uncomfortable, were not serious, and East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said it was \\"extremely unlikely\\" the substance involved was chlorine. Kyle Crickmore, who was at the Birling Gap beach with his family, said it emptied in 10 minutes after people began to feel unwell. He described how a \\"foggy haze rolled in out of nowhere\\" and there was a \\"strong smell of chlorine in the air\\". \\"It was definitely out of the ordinary considering it was a nice clear sunny day 10 minutes beforehand,\\" he said. \\"It was stupidly busy and it was a boiling hot day. \\"It emptied in about 10 minutes, which was quite staggering considering the amount of people who were there.\\" Members of the public alerted emergency services, which triggered call-outs to the UK Coastguard, Sussex Police, South Eastern Ambulance Service and East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, who said they were treating it as a \\"chemical incident\\". The RNLI said that \\"possibly some kind of gaseous fumes\\" had drifted over and a significant number of people on cliff tops had been struck down with symptoms including irritation, sore eyes and vomiting. Dan Sankey wrote on Twitter: \\"Beautiful afternoon at Birling Gap cut short by some weird mist, burning everyone's eyes which led to the beach and cliff being evacuated.\\" The beachfront is a popular hot spot for tourists and locals on bank holidays. People living along the coast have been advised to keep windows and doors shut since the incident. Thousands of people are expected to head to the coast again on Bank Holiday Monday.

Her bus had inched along through heavy morning traffic, making her a few minutes late for her very first job. She decided to start out half an hour earlier the next day Once inside the lobby, she had to stand at the elevators and wait several minutes before she could get on one going to the sixth floor. When she finally reached the office marked \\"King Enterprises\\", she knocked at the door nervously and waited. There was no answer. She tapped on the door again, but still, there was no reply. From inside the next office, she could hear the sound of voices, so she opened the door and went in. Although she was sure it was the same office she had been in two weeks before when she had had the interview with Mr King, it looked quite different now. In fact, it hardly looked like an office at all. The employees were just standing around chatting and smoking. At the far end of the room, somebody must have just told a good joke, she thought, because there was a loud burst of laughter as she came in. For a moment she had thought they were laughing at her. Then one of the men looked at his watch, clapped his hands and said something to the others. Quickly they all went to their desks and, in a matter of seconds, everyone was hard at work. No one paid any attention to Marie. Finally she went up to the man who was sitting at the desk nearest to the door and explained that this was her first day in the office. Hardly looking up from his work, he told her to have a seat and wait for Mr King, who would arrive at any moment. Then Marie realised that the day's work in the office began just before Mr King arrived. Later she found out that he lived in Connecticut and came into Manhattan on the same train every morning, arriving in the office at 9:35, so that his staff knew exactly when to start working.

I read this background article the other day: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] I am facing a new situation today: Greg's grandma is a culinary expert. She is also very eager to teach others how to make great foods. One day she taught Greg how to make candied fruit. Greg was so excited about it that he bought two baskets of fruits, basket A and basket B, to make some candied fruits. He used the basket A fruits to make some candied fruits, but was too lazy to use the basket B fruits. He just kept the basket B fruits on his kitchen top. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fruits' moisture would not be absorbed from within, basket A fruits or basket B fruits? Answer:","completion":"The moisture would not be absorbed from within the fruits in basket B. To justify my answer, let's go step-by-step through the information provided: 1. Candied fruit is made by placing fruit in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and preserves it. 2. Greg's grandma taught him how to make candied fruit. 3. Greg used basket A fruits to make candied fruits, meaning they underwent the process of being placed in heated sugar syrup for moisture absorption and preservation. 4. Greg was too lazy to use the basket B fruits and just left them on his kitchen top, not exposing them to the heated sugar syrup process. Since the fruits in basket B were never exposed to the heated sugar syrup process, their moisture would not be absorbed from within. The fruits in basket A, however, would have their moisture absorbed from within due to the candying process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: When was Arsenal originally formed? A: In 1886, Woolwich munitions workers founded the club as Dial Square. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"Yes, the answer correctly answers the question, providing the formation year and origin of Arsenal. Let me give you a more detailed account of the club's early history. Arsenal Football Club was originally formed in 1886 by a group of workers employed at the Royal Arsenal, an armaments factory in Woolwich, South East London. These workers, mainly from various parts of the United Kingdom, established the club as Dial Square, a reference to the sundial atop the entrance to the Royal Arsenal workshop, where many of them worked. On December 11, 1886, the team played its first match under the Dial Square name, defeating Eastern Wanderers 6-0 on the Isle of Dogs. Shortly thereafter, in January 1887, the club's founders agreed on the name \\"Royal Arsenal,\\" reflecting both the munitions factory and the team's growing ambitions. In 1891, following the end of their amateur status, the team rebranded as Woolwich Arsenal and joined the Football League in 1893. Plagued by financial difficulties and poor attendances due to its remote location in London, Woolwich Arsenal ultimately decided to move across the city. In 1913, the club chose to relocate to a location in Highbury, North London, and dropped the 'Woolwich' from their name, finally settling on the title \\"Arsenal Football Club.\\" This move contributed substantially to Arsenal's future successes and helped establish them as one of England's most famous and successful football clubs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"The natural snowfall is often augmented by snow-making equipment to ensure adequate powder.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Only natural snow is used there.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"The natural snowfall is often augmented by snow-making equipment to ensure adequate powder,\\" we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Only natural snow is used there\\" is true. In fact, the premise contradicts the hypothesis and suggests that both natural snow and artificial snow are used to maintain sufficient snow coverage. The premise states that the natural snowfall is often not sufficient in quantity or quality, necessitating the use of snow-making machines to supplement the snow conditions. Snow-making equipment produces artificial snow by spraying water droplets into the cold air, where the droplets freeze into snow-like crystals. This artificial snow is used alongside natural snow to create the ideal skiing or snowboarding conditions, maintain the snowpack, and extend the winter sports season. To properly analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, let's break it down into several aspects: 1. Natural snowfall: The premise acknowledges the presence of natural snowfall, but implies that it is not always adequate to meet the desired level of snow coverage in certain ski resorts or winter sports locations. This could be attributed to factors such as climate change, geographic location, and seasonal variations, which impact the amount and consistency of snow received in these areas. 2. Snow-making equipment: Due to the inadequacy of natural snowfall in meeting the desired snow levels, resorts and winter sports locations turn to artificial snow produced by snow-making machines. This implies that the location must ensure that a combination of both natural and artificial snow is present to maintain optimal conditions for winter sports and recreation. 3. Adequate powder: The purpose of augmenting natural snowfall with artificial snow is to achieve what is deemed as \\"adequate powder.\\" This term refers to the desired snow quality and quantity that provides the best experience for winter sports enthusiasts and ensures the longevity of the snow-covered terrain throughout the season. In summary, the premise and the hypothesis do not align with each other. The premise strongly indicates that a combination of both natural and artificial snow is used to ensure adequate and consistent snow coverage in places where natural snowfall alone is insufficient. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"Only natural snow is used there\\" cannot be considered true based on the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"rust of iron in rocks is a direct result of \\" is \\"high speed fall from space\\", given that chemical weathering of iron in rock causes rust? A:","completion":"I do not think that \\"high speed fall from space\\" is the right answer to the question \\"rust of iron in rocks is a direct result of\\" when considering that chemical weathering of iron in rock causes rust. The process of rust formation in rocks is a result of several chemical and environmental factors involving the exposure of iron-containing minerals to oxygen and water. To understand the formation of rust in rocks, we should first examine what rust is and how it forms. Rust, scientifically known as iron oxide, is a reddish-brown compound that occurs when iron reacts with oxygen and water. This process is known as oxidation, which is a type of chemical weathering. There are two main types of iron oxides formed through this process: ferrous oxide (FeO) and ferric oxide (Fe2O3). Both can contribute to the reddish-brown color of rust. The rusting of iron in rocks is primarily caused by the exposure of iron-bearing minerals to water and oxygen. The iron within these minerals reacts with oxygen present in the water, forming a hydrated iron oxide (rust). This process is called hydrolysis, a type of chemical weathering that affects the surface of rocks. The hydrolysis process involves the gradual breakdown of minerals as they come into contact with water molecules, causing them to change their structure and properties. The formation of rust in rocks can be influenced by various factors such as the mineral composition, pH levels, temperature, humidity, and the amount of oxygen and water present in the environment. Acidic environments with low pH promote the oxidation of iron, while neutral or basic environments tend to hinder the process. Additionally, high temperatures and humidity can accelerate the process of rust formation. Over time, these environmental factors contribute to the rusting of iron-containing rocks, leading to a change in the appearance and integrity of the rock. Meteorites, which experience high velocity falls through Earth's atmosphere from space, can also contain iron and often rust when exposed to Earth's oxygen and water-rich environment. However, rusting of iron in meteorites is also a result of oxidation, similar to the process in terrestrial rocks, making \\"high-speed fall from space\\" an inaccurate direct cause of rust in rocks. Considering these factors, the right answer to the question \\"rust of iron in rocks is a direct result of\\" should be \\"exposure to oxygen and water,\\" not \\"high-speed fall from space.\\" The rust of iron in rocks is mainly due to the process of chemical weathering, which occurs as a result of the interaction of iron-bearing minerals with oxygen and water found in the surrounding environment, rather than the effects of falling from space at high speeds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are eager to take one last run down the mountain before they go home; however, the ski resort decides to close early because a storm is moving in. The friends convince the ski lift attendant to let them on one last time. Before the group gets all the way to the top, the attendant is called into the boss's office and is replaced by a co-worker. As he leaves, he tells the co-worker that there are only three skiers left. Another set of three skiers comes down the mountain. When he sees them, he shuts down the ski lift, stranding the three friends in their ski lift chair far above the ground. They take it as a joke, but the ski resort's lights are then turned off, leaving the three friends in fear and shock. Parker knows the ski slopes have closed for the week. Dan feels he has no choice but to jump from the ski lift chair and get help, as they will not survive up there in the bitter cold until Friday. After discussing the danger, Dan decides to jump off the lift. Upon hitting the ground, he suffers a compound fracture on both of his legs. Soon, his screams and the scent of blood attracts a pack of wolves. Joe, now fearing for Dan's safety, decides to try to get to the ground by traversing the suspension cable between the lifts and steel support tower. However, as wolves close in on Dan, he returns to the chair and holds Parker as Dan is brutally torn apart by the wolves.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Diversity report card: TV finally got it sorta right in 2015 Editor's note: The volume of conversation around diversity in popular culture hit fever pitch in 2015 — but besides more talk, what was really accomplished this year? One in Mashable's five-part series examining strides made in 2015 in movies, television, online video, gaming and sports.___ While it's true that 2015 saw more TV offerings than ever before, this could also go down as the year that diversity was not only discussed but actually seen onscreen. In fact, a glance at the TV slate as we near the end of 2015 paints a fairly sunny picture of how networks have expanded their definition of what it means to properly represent their audience. SEE ALSO: The Hollywood Diversity Report: How movies, online video, gaming and sports did in 2015 While Latino men and women have fought hard for decades to find roles that don't perpetuate harmful stereotypes, TV will soon see three Latina women in starring roles — Eva Longoria on Telenovela, America Ferrera on Superstore and, Jennifer Lopez on Shades of Blue — on NBC alone. Over at the CW, Golden Globe winner Gina Rodriguez on Jane the Virgin has become something of a Latina icon. Jane the Virgin's Gina Rodriguez won Best Actress in a TV Comedy at the Golden Globes. More than three years after Kerry Washington broke a shameful streak to became the first black woman to lead a network drama in more than 40 years, we now have Taraji P. Henson on Empire, Emmy winner Viola Davis on How to Get Away with Murder, Nicole Beharie on Sleepy Hollow, Tracee Ellis Ross on Blackish and many more at the top of call sheets across television. A little more than two years after Seth McFarlane's one-season-then-done comedy Dads presented one of the most bafflingly offensive Asian characters we'd seen in a long time, we now have ABC's charming and relatable Fresh off the Boat. Then there's Aziz Ansari. And Priyanka Chopra. And, thanks to Hulu, we still have Mindy Kaling. In fact, it's been a banner year for South Asians on TV across the board. Guys, 2015 was pretty darn great. NoÃ«l Wells and Aziz Ansari on 'Master of None.' But it was also far from perfect. There's still work to do — more than this praise-inducing portrait may imply. That's because true diversity doesn't just mean race. It's sexuality. It's gender. And it's the quality of the stories being told about these populations. No one has tracked diversity of all kinds more closely than GLADD, whose annual Where We Are on TV Report chronicles the ups and downs very throughly. This year's results — calculated based on the 2015-16 season — were a mixed bag. On one hand, the report indicated that the amount of regular LGBT characters on cable increased, from 64 to 84. On the other? Racially diverse LGBT characters are still hard to come by. Good news: there were two trans characters in series lead roles this year. The bad: There were no transgender characters counted on primetime broadcast programming, and only three recurring trans characters on cable. Jeffrey Tambor plays Maura on Amazon's 'Transparent,' which recently released its second season. And just plain bad news: For the first time in two years, there are fewer regular characters with disabilities on broadcast, down to 0.9% (or 8 characters) from an already measly 1.4%. A cynic could argue that there's no pleasing everyone, and that there's no way to represent every possible population on television. But any TV writer doing it right will tell you that's not an excuse not to try at all. Pete Nowalk, creator of ABC's How to Get Away With Murder is someone who's doing it right. When speaking to Mashable earlier this year for a story about Shondaland, the production company overseen by Shonda Rhimes (herself a longtime advocate for the \\"normalizing\\" of TV), Nowalk explained that the desire to tell stories about people from all walks of life stems largely from his own experience as a gay child without a relatable face on the TV to turn to. \\"Knowing how much that could have changed my life — just seeing more gay people on TV and feeling like there was a place for me in the world — I think every writer in Shondaland is always checking themselves,\\" he told us. Shondaland produce Betsy Beers, 'How to Get Away With Murder' star Viola Davis, and creator Pete Nowalk appear at an event honoring the ABC hit in May 2015. Nowalk's show got multiple mentions in GLADD's study — for everything from its cast to being the sole show on broadcast or cable to depict a character living with HIV. \\"Everyone should have a seat at the table,\\" he said. Back in October, a Vanity Fair photoshoot highlighted a major problem with late-night TV that had long been discussed but never quite as starkly presented: it's very male and largely white. Samantha Bee, who aims to inject a female voice into that field of \\"titans\\" with her upcoming late night show on TBS in 2016, certainly took notice, tweeting a hilarious photo in response, and later telling the Daily Beast that her exclusion was \\"a big fuck you.\\" (This came after the magazine tried but failed to explain its approach to the photoshoot.) This lack of female representation is not exclusive to late-night, however. Back in May, Salon pointed out that Sunday morning television is suffering from a major lack of diversity, especially following the replacement of Candy Crowley with Jake Tapper over on CNN's State of the Union. All five major Sunday shows are now led by white men. The issue extends to the three major evening newscasts on NBC, ABC and CBS, where men currently occupy every anchor seat. This includes Lester Holt, who in June became the first black anchor of a network nightly newscast. (It's worth noting that Holt recently won in total viewer ratings against his competition — David Muir and Scott Pelley — for the 26th week in a row.) Lester Holt, playing with his \\"serious journalist\\" image. These oversights don't tend to receive as much ink as TV's late night problem. Maybe we should call Samantha Bee? Diversity, of course, doesn't just mean what you're seeing on screen; it's also about what's happening behind the scenes. That's where much of the opportunity for progress truly lies. The problem? That's also TV's biggest hurdle. That's right: In a time when a larger variety of faces are being seen onscreen, writers' rooms are more male and white than ever, according to a widely covered study from the WGA from earlier this year. The stats represented writers' rooms from about two years ago, but showed a startling truth nonetheless: Women were underrepresented by a factor of nearly 3 to 1. Minorities? Underrepresented 11 to 1. This very subject came up during THR's annual meeting of power showrunners earlier this year. In that interview, the showrunners — including Homeland's Alex Gansa, Damon Lindelof of The Leftovers and Empire creator Lee Daniels — traded jabs about the diversity of their rooms. Lee Daniels attends an 'Empire' panel event in California on Jan. 17. Daniels, who staffs an incredibly varied room, was quick to pose the straightforward question to his fellow showrunners: \\"Are there any African-American writers on your show?\\" Not everyone — particularly House of Cards EP Beau Willimon, whose writers' room of six had no African Americans at the time — took the perceived criticism well. Willimon retaliated by asking Daniels if he staffed any Asian Americans. Daniels did not. The entire conversation was fascinating and telling, as it made clear that this issue is a hot-button one from every angle. Does every story require every voice? Can only a certain kind of person write a certain kind of story? Are writers' room hiring practices hindered by those who are choosing the 40-or-so scripts that are sent to the decision makers?

That slow and steady progress will eventually transform into a new normal. \\"I think this is a movement toward that,\\" Amaury Nolasco, star of Telenovela, told Mashable earlier this year as he and the rest of the cast were kicking off his show's launch in New York. \\"I'm proud to be part of a show that's changing the face of TV.\\" TV had a pretty good year, but our expectations of television are higher than ever. Have something to say about this story? Share it in the comments.","completion":"In 2015, TV shows became more diverse, with more roles for people of different races and backgrounds. There were Latina women in lead roles, like Eva Longoria in Telenovela, and more South Asians on TV, like Aziz Ansari in Master of None. But there is still work to be done. True diversity includes race, sexuality, gender, and the quality of stories being told. For example, there are fewer characters with disabilities on television now, and not enough racially diverse LGBT characters. Also, TV writers' rooms have more white men than ever before, according to a study. So, while 2015 had some improvements in TV diversity, there is still a lot of progress to be made."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The first Laughter Club was started in Mumbai, India, in 1995, by Dr Madan Kataria. \\"Children laugh about 300 times a day. Adults laugh between 7 and 15 times a day,\\" says Dr Kataria. \\"Everyone's naturally good at laughing -- it's the universal language.\\" There are now more than 500 Laughter Clubs in India and over 1,300 worldwide. Many doctors are also interested in the effects of laughter on our health. According to a 5-year study at the UCLS School of Medicine in California, with laughing there is less stress in the body. Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%. So what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to the nearest club in the south of London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class. I had no interest in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking stupid . Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands and say \\"ho ho ho, ha ha ha\\" while looking at each other. Although we couldn't tell the differences between _ laughter and real laughter, they still produced the same healthy effects. Surprisingly, it worked! After ten minutes, everybody there was laughing for real and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class I was shocked by how relaxed and comfortable I felt.

Article: Anna Riviere was one of the most admired of 19th-century English sopranos . She was also one of the most adventuresome. She was born in London on January 9th, 1810. She entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of 14. Seven years later, just after her first show, Anna married Sir Henry Bishop, who was 24 years her senior. Her reputation as a singer grew rapidly, based largely on her tours with Sir Henry and harpist Nicholas Bochsa. After a tour of Dublin, Edinburgh, and London, Anna Bishop deserted her husband and three children and ran away with Bochsa. From then on, Madame Bishop--as she continued to be known--traveled and sang as if her life depended on it. Between 1839 and 1843 she traveled to every major town in Europe, where she sang in 260 concerts. In the course of two years in Naples, she performed in 20 operas. In 1855 she and Bochsa sailed for Sydney, Australia. He died there the following year, and Anna went on to tour South America before returning to New York, where she married a diamond merchant. Then she began what proved her most dangerous adventure. After another American tour in 1866, she and her husband set sail across the Pacific. They were shipwrecked on a small coral reef, and for more than a month they drifted in a small boat before they finally reaching Guam. She had lost her music, her wardrobe, and her jewelry, but Madame Bishop was not to be stopped. She went on to Manila and began a concert tour that led to Hong Kong, Singapore, and India before she went back to England. After another two-year world tour she returned eventually to New York, where she gave her last public performance in 1883--at age 73. Meanwhile the husband she left behind, Sir Henry, had become famous for writing the music to lyrics that might eventually have been meaningful to Anna Bishop--\\"Home, Sweet Home.\\" Question: The best title for this passage is _ . - The English soprano - The soprano toured around the world - A soprano and her husband - The adventuresome soprano A:","completion":"The adventuresome soprano"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: A futuristic weapon originally designed for use by NASA and the US Navy is now a frightening, trimmed down portable unit able to wreak terrifying damage on the battlefield. General Atomics, the company behind the Rail Gun, which fires projectiles that travel six times faster than a speeding bullet, unveiled the latest truck-mounted cannon over the weekend, Next Big Future reports. Five test projectiles were successfully fired at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, with high spec camera kit tracking missiles moving at a velocity of 9600 km/h. A standard artillery shell flies through the air at 3200 km/h, which easily eclipses the speed of sound (1235 km/h) and makes the iconic Tomahawk missile (885 km/h) look like an antiquated tortoise. The rail gun is essentially an electric circuit, with its main components being a pair of parallel rails and a power supply. A current flows through one rail and back through the other, which generates a magnetic field. This ultimately triggers an electromagnetic force that launches the projectile at such ground-breaking speeds. The US navy unveiled the Rail Gun almost two years ago.

Sentence 2: It changed purposes throughout its life. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Select from: (A). yes; (B). it is not possible to tell; (C). no;","completion":"(A). Yes. The answer to your question is (A), yes, because if we carefully look into the meanings imparted by both sentences, we can see that they do not conflict with each other. Rather, they maintain a sort of internal consistency. In Sentence 1, \\"However, it began life with a totally different purpose,\\" it is mentioned that the object, person, or concept in question (referred to as \\"it\\") started out serving a totally different purpose than what it might serve right now or at a later point in time. The \\"totally different purpose\\" means that there has been a change from the original intention or use. Now, moving to Sentence 2, \\"It changed purposes throughout its life,\\" this statement is also talking about a change in purpose. The phrase \\"changed purposes throughout its life\\" means that the initial purpose it had was modified, altered, or changed, possibly more than once. Hence, if the premise stated in Sentence 1 is correct - that it began life with a totally different purpose - then Sentence 2, which posits that it changed purposes throughout its life, could be equally true. It's logical to conclude that if something started with a different purpose, then there must have been some point at which a change, or changes, occurred for it to have a different purpose now. Considering these points, it's reasonable to suggest that if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is either most likely or definitely true. However, one important factor to consider in determining the truth of the second sentence is the number of times it changed purposes. If 'it' only changed its purpose once, then, while Sentence 2 could still be technically correct, it might not convey the full reality of the situation - the phrase 'changed purposes throughout its life' could be interpreted to mean multiple changes. But even this potential nuance does not change the answer, as the second sentence still holds potential to be true, and thus the best answer remains as (A).

Background: De Benneville \\"Bert\\" Bell (February 25, 1895 - October 11, 1959) was the National Football League (NFL) commissioner from 1945 until his death in 1959. As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to improve the league's commercial viability and promote its popularity, and he helped make the NFL the most financially sound sports enterprise and preeminent sports attraction in the United States (US). He was posthumously inducted into the charter class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Bell played football at the University of Pennsylvania, where as quarterback, he led his team to an appearance in the 1917 Rose Bowl. Context: By early 1933, Bell's opinion on the NFL had changed, and he wanted to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia. After being advised by the NFL that a prerequisite to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the Pennsylvania Blue Laws would have to be mollified, he was the force majeure in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated. He borrowed funds from Frances Upton, partnered with Wray, and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia which he christened as the Philadelphia Eagles. After the inaugural 1933 Philadelphia Eagles season, Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia. Days later, his suggestion to bestow the winner of the NFL championship game with the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy was affirmed. In 1934, the Eagles finished with a 4-7 record, The Eagles' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets, and his failure to sign a talented college prospect led him to adduce that the only way to bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players. In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted, and in February 1936, the first draft kicked off, at which he acted as Master of Ceremonies. Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born. In the Eagles' first three years, the partners exhausted 85,000 (presently, 1,499,017), and at a public auction, Bell became sole owner of the Eagles with a bid of 4,500 (presently, 79,360). Austerity measures forced him to supplant Wray as head coach of the Eagles, wherein Bell led the Eagles to a 1-11 finish, their worst record ever. In December, an application for a franchise in Los Angeles was obstructed by Bell and Pittsburgh Steelers owner Rooney as they deemed it too far of a distance to travel for games. During the Eagles' 2-8-1 1937 season, his second child, John \\"Upton\\", was born. In the Eagles' first profitable season, 1938, they posted a 5-6 record. The Eagles finished 1-9-1 in 1939 and 1-10 in 1940. Question: Did they win any games?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, the Philadelphia Eagles, the team owned by Bert Bell, won several games according to the passage.

He was suspended in the air for around four minutes before he was released, according to eyewitness accounts of the accident. Attempts were made to revive him for about eight minutes before he was taken to a hospital in Annecy, France, suffering from a severe brain injury. Kieran was later taken to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, where he died in March 2011. Mrs Brookes said: \\"We couldn't bury Kieran for six months because of the police investigation. \\"We also couldn't donate his organs which was something that would have given us some comfort.\\" The family's lawyer Mark Montaldo, of Slater and Gordon, said: \\"It has been heart-breaking for Kieran's family to hear details of the very serious safety failings which led to this tragedy. \\"From the outset, Mr and Mrs Brookes have been determined that lessons are learned from this incident. \\"They hope that this verdict and sentence will send a powerful message throughout the industry that safety must be paramount.\\" The French charge of indirect manslaughter is roughly equivalent to involuntary manslaughter in England and Wales. Summary:","completion":"14-year-old Kieran Brookes from Devon was strangled when his backpack got entangled in a ski lift near Geneva. Richard Cettour, who was supervising the lift, received a six-month suspended sentence. Kieran's parents expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome, stating that they believe the tragedy highlighted serious industry failings. The firm operating the lift, SAEM Sports et Tourisme a Châtel, was accused of indirect manslaughter but was cleared of the charge. Kieran later died in March 2011 from severe brain injuries sustained during the incident."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

B61 thermonuclear devices are held in air base, left over from Cold War. FOUR times stronger than ones dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Lubbers: 'Those silly things are an absolutely pointless part of a tradition' Article:","completion":"Title: Exposing the Dutch Nuclear Secret: Revealing the Controversial Existence of B61 Bombs Introduction The world has long speculated over what lies hidden behind-the-scenes when it comes to matters of national security. One of such secrets has recently been exposed by former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, effectively breaking the political omertà on an extremely sensitive matter. The startling revelation concerns the existence of B61 thermonuclear devices in the Netherlands, which have been left behind within an air base from the dark period of the Cold War. As per Lubbers, these bombs are an astonishing four times stronger than the atom bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The former Prime Minister expresses his discontent with the situation, referring to the highly destructive weapons as \\"silly things\\" and \\"an absolutely pointless part of a tradition.\\" The Unmasking of a Nuclear Secret: Lubbers' Brave Act Ruud Lubbers, who held the position of Dutch Prime Minister from 1982 to 1994, boldly decrypted the classified information on the presence of these dangerous thermonuclear devices in the Netherlands. By doing so, he broke the political omertà – an unwritten rule preserving the secrecy of sensitive matters pertaining to national security. This noteworthy act of defiance has cast a spotlight on the previously unknown power and potential impact of these thermonuclear devices on global politics and international affairs. The B61 Bombs: A Legacy of the Cold War Era The B61 thermonuclear devices have remained in a discreet airbase, a relic of a bygone era characterized by fear and the ever-present threat of potential nuclear fallout. These bombs were designed in the early 1960s and have been used in several nuclear deterrence strategies around the globe. Despite not being used in actual combat, the weapons possess a colossal destructive potential. The B61 bombs – each one estimated to be four times stronger than the atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – have been rendered obsolete in the post-Cold War era. The continued existence of these devices raises justifiable questions concerning the current importance of these thermonuclear weapons within the context of geopolitical relations and national security. Lubbers' Take on the Situation: Discontent with the Destructive Legacy The former Prime Minister, Ruud Lubbers, has been candid in expressing his dissatisfaction with the continued existence of these immensely powerful weapons. He refers to them as \\"silly things\\" and characterizes their existence as part of an outdated and pointless tradition that no longer aligns with the needs and priorities of the 21st century. This mirrors the sentiment of several critics who recognize that these weapons no longer have a justifiable place in contemporary global politics. Conclusion Ruud Lubbers' act of exposing this long-held secret in the Netherlands has opened a gateway for a larger discussion on updating international security measures and reconsidering how nations approach their weaponry and defense strategies. The existence of the B61 thermonuclear devices on Dutch soil as a vestige of the Cold War era demands transparency and open dialogue regarding the broader implications of weapons with such massive destructive capabilities. Ultimately, the revelation of the hidden thermonuclear arsenal serves as a stepping stone toward redefining and reassessing global security strategies in the contemporary world, seeking to leave behind the fears of the past and embrace a more modern and cooperative global order."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Transparenz spielt eine wichtige Rolle in demokratischen Institutionen wie dem Europäischen Parlament, da sie sicherstellt, dass die Entscheidungsträger und das Publikum zusammenarbeiten und auf dem Laufenden gehalten werden. In Bezug auf die finanzielle Transparenz bedeutet dies, dass das Europäische Parlament klare und verständliche Informationen über seine festen Ausgaben im Haushaltsplan offenlegen muss. Diese Informationen sollten für alle Bürger leicht zugänglich sein, um ihr Vertrauen in die Institution zu stärken und eine größere Rechenschaftspflicht zu gewährleisten. Feste Ausgaben beziehen sich auf Kosten, die unabhängig von der Aktivität oder Produktion der Institution anfallen. Im Kontext des Europäischen Parlaments können diese Ausgaben die Gehälter der Abgeordneten und des Personals, Bürokosten, Kommunikations- und IT-Dienstleistungen, Gebäudeunterhalt und andere Ausgaben umfassen, die für den ordnungsgemäßen Betrieb der Institution erforderlich sind. Da diese Ausgaben einen erheblichen Teil des Haushaltsplans des Parlaments ausmachen, sollten sie öffentlich und transparent bekannt gemacht werden, damit die europäische Öffentlichkeit ein besseres Verständnis der Verwendung öffentlicher Gelder hat. Es ist auch wichtig, die Transparenz der festen Ausgaben durch regelmäßige Finanzberichte, Audits und Bewertungen des Haushaltsplans sicherzustellen.

Movie title: Veronica Guerin Movie plot: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the album release that Chris Richards called \\"rock-and-roll as dystopian junk mail\\"?, using the article: Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost.

He states that he goes to bed around 11:30 pm after a day of work and wakes up early the next day to work out. For him, sleeping in his office on a cot makes him more efficient and allows him to focus on work, asserting that he plans to continue this practice. Regarding immigration reform, Ryan finds the idea of working on it with President Obama to be \\"ridiculous,\\" due to the lack of trust between them and the President's attempt to bypass the legislative process with executive orders. Ryan is clear that working on this issue with the President is \\"not in the cards.\\" When asked about the funding of Planned Parenthood, Ryan believes that the organization should not receive any taxpayer money. However, he emphasizes the importance of oversight in determining the end result. He feels that without controlling the process, the outcome may be unfavorable. Ryan also addressed concerns about the lingering smell of John Boehner's cigarette smoke in the Speaker's office, mentioning the possibility of using ozone machines to help detoxify the environment and replace the carpeting. Lastly, Ryan dismissed any aspirations for running for president, stating that if he wanted to run, he would have done so already.

Options: - swallow - headaches - hydration - hunger - vomiting The answer is:","completion":"hydration. The purpose of drinking water is primarily for hydration. Water is essential to life and is required by our bodies to perform various functions that help maintain our overall health and well-being. Keeping the body adequately hydrated is important as it ensures the proper functionality of all our organs, tissues, and cells. Drinking water serves several vital roles within the body, some of which include: 1. Temperature regulation: Water helps the body maintain a stable internal temperature by dissipating heat through sweating and respiration. This is especially important in hot weather or during periods of intense physical activity. 2. Nutrient transport: Our circulatory system relies on water to transport oxygen, nutrients, and essential vitamins and minerals to cells throughout the body, while also aiding in the removal of waste products and toxins. 3. Digestion and absorption: Adequate water intake is necessary for the proper digestion and absorption of food. It aids in the breakdown of food components in the stomach and intestines, which further supports nutrient absorption. 4. Lubrication of joints and tissues: Water helps reduce friction between joints, acting as a cushion and promoting ease of movement. It also keeps tissues, such as the eyes and mouth, moist and lubricated. 5. Elimination of waste products: Drinking water supports the removal of waste products and harmful toxins from the body through urine, sweat, and bowel movements. While the other options mentioned may have some association with water intake, they do not accurately represent the primary purpose of drinking water. Swallowing is a mechanism of consuming water but not the ultimate purpose of doing so. Headaches and vomiting can be symptoms of dehydration or overhydration, respectively, while hunger might be temporarily alleviated by drinking water, but the main goal remains hydration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In their search for answers, they also stumble upon a rising artist named Jasper, who shows an eerie and obsessive interest in Tillie's work and life. This sparks Maddie's suspicion, and she becomes convinced that Jasper may possess sinister intentions.

In time, however, Maddie showcases her psychic gift, gaining Raelyn's trust and assistance in their quest to account for Tillie's fate. The trio uncovers a web of dark secrets, hidden motives, and artistic sabotage, all of which threaten Tillie's life. Moreover, they come to discover that the key to preventing her vision from becoming a reality may lie in exposing a rival artist's obsession and deceit.

Input: Interleukin-17A is a proinflammatory cytokine known to play a role in host defense and pathologic inflammation in murine models of lung injury. The relationship between interleukin-17A and inflammation in human lung injury is unknown. Our primary objective was to determine whether interleukin-17A levels are associated with alveolar measures of inflammation and injury in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Our secondary objective was to test whether interleukin-17A levels are associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome-related outcomes.', 'Observational study.', 'Six North American medical centers.', 'We studied two groups of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: 1) patients previously enrolled in a placebo-controlled clinical trial of omega-3 fatty acids performed at five North American medical centers (n = 86, acute respiratory distress syndrome 1), and 2) patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome admitted to an ICU who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 140, acute respiratory distress syndrome 2).

Please answer the following question: This article: In Guazacapán, now a municipality in Santa Rosa, Pedro de Alvardo described his encounter with people who were neither Maya nor Pipil, speaking a different language altogether; these people were probably Xinca. At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec. Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque, usually considered to be in the Taxisco area. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population. Alvarado's army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Tacuilula feigned a peaceful reception only to unsuccessfully raise arms against the conquistadors within an hour of their arrival. Taxisco and Nancintla fell soon afterwards. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses. This was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army. Jorge de Alvarado led the first attempt with thirty to forty cavalry and although they routed the enemy they were unable to retrieve any of the lost baggage, much of which had been destroyed by the Xinca for use as trophies. Pedro de Portocarrero led the second attempt with a large infantry detachment but was unable to engage with the enemy due to the difficult mountain terrain, so returned to Nancintla. Alvarado sent out Xinca messengers to make contact with the... contains an answer for the question: What three things did the Xinca use to fight the conquistadors?, what is it ? A:","completion":"The three things that the Xinca used to fight the conquistadors, as described in the article, were: 1. Spears: These were long, pointed weapons used for thrusting or throwing, often made of wood and fitted with a sharp metal or stone tip. Spears were a common weapon among indigenous cultures and were used effectively for both offense and defense in hand-to-hand combat. 2. Stakes: Stakes could refer to wooden poles or sharpened logs that were used similarly to spears. They could be employed as improvised weapons, barriers, or traps. The Xinca likely used stakes to defend their positions and hinder the advancement of the Spanish forces. 3. Poisoned arrows: Arrows were projectile weapons that were shot using a bow. The Xinca's use of poisoned arrows indicates their resourcefulness and advanced knowledge of toxic substances. By poison-tipping their arrows, they could greatly enhance the effectiveness of their attacks, as even a non-fatal shot could lead to severe illness or death due to the toxins introduced into the wound. In summary, the Xinca people employed spears, stakes, and poisoned arrows in their fight against the conquistadors, demonstrating their resiliency and adaptability in the face of a superior force."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rick Perry told a child questioner in New Hampshire today that Texas public schools teach creationism alongside evolution — a statement that state education experts are refuting in varying degrees. “No, it is not true,\\" said Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, an interest group that has lobbied the State Board of Education to keep religion out of public schools. \\"Texas science standards do not call for teaching creationism in the classroom.\\" David Bradley, a social conservative member of the State Board of Education, said he hadn't heard the governor's comments. But when asked if Texas schools teach creationism alongside evolution, Bradley responded, \\"Not specifically.\\" Still, Bradley said that in Texas nothing prevents a teacher from discussing creationism, or a student from bringing it up in the classroom. \\"It is not specifically in the Texas curriculum,\\" Bradley said. But \\"in Texas, the students are directed to investigate and evaluate all theories.\\" Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for the governor's office, also said creationism could be discussed in the classroom as students are taught about evolution. \\"It is required that students evaluate and analyze the theory of evolution, and creationism very likely comes up in that process,\\" she said. \\"Teachers are also permitted to discuss it with students in that context. Schools are also allowed to teach biblical history as an elective and creationism is part of that teaching, too.\\" At a campaign stop in Portsmouth this afternoon, a child — goaded by his mother — first asked Perry how old he thought the Earth was. Perry said he didn't know, but that he expects it's \\"pretty old.\\" \\"Ask him about evolution,\\" the boy's mother can be heard saying. “It’s a theory that’s out there. It’s got some gaps in it,\\" Perry responded. \\"In Texas, we teach both creationism and evolution in our public schools. Because I figure you’re smart enough to figure out which one is right.” In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that teaching creationism in public schools was unconstitutional. In the case Edwards v. Aguillard, the court ruled that teaching creationism in Louisiana public schools was the equivalent of teaching religion — and violated the Constitution because it advanced a particular religion. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, another contender for the GOP presidential nomination, took to Twitter almost instantly, seeming to mock Perry for the creationism comment, as well as for his recent statements on climate change: “To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy.\\" Watch the video from abcnews.com below. ||||| During a stop in New Hampshire on Thursday, Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry raised skepticism about the theory of evolution. \\"How old do I think the earth is? You know what, I don't have any idea,\\" said the Texas governor when asked about his position on the issue by a woman and her son. \\"I know it's pretty old so it goes back a long long way. I'm not sure anybody actually knows completely and absolutely how long, how old the earth is.\\" Perry regarded evolution as \\"a theory that's out there\\" and one that's \\"got some gaps in it.\\" He added that in the Lone Star State both creationism and evolution are taught to students in public schools. He explained, \\"I figure you're smart enough to figure out which one is right.\\" The Texas Tribune reports that some in Texas dispute the governor's claim about whether creationism is taught in the classroom in the state. The Tribune notes: In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that teaching creationism in public schools was unconstitutional. In the case Edwards v. Aguillard, the court ruled that teaching creationism in Louisiana public schools was the equivalent of teaching religion — and violated the Constitution because it advanced a particular religion. Earlier this summer, GOP presidential candidate Michele Bachmann expressed doubt about the theory of evolution. \\"I support intelligent design,\\" she said after speaking at this year's Republican Leadership Conference in New Orleans. \\"What I support is putting all science on the table and then letting students decide. I don't think it's a good idea for government to come down on one side of scientific issue or another, when there is reasonable doubt on both sides.\\" In 2006, Bachmann suggested that some within the scientific community discredit the theory of evolution. \\"There are hundreds and hundreds of scientists, many of them holding Nobel Prizes, who believe in intelligent design,\\" she said. Meanwhile, GOP presidential contender Jon Huntsman signaled a different stance on the issue on Thursday. In a tweet he wrote, \\"To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"So, this is a bit like a big conversation about what kids should learn in school, especially in Texas. It's about two different explanations for how life, people, and animals came to be. One explanation is called \\"evolution,\\" which is a theory that scientists have that says life has changed and developed over a super long time. The other one is known as \\"creationism\\" which is a belief that a higher power, like God, created the world and all the life in it. This guy named Rick Perry, who used to be the governor of Texas and tried to become the president, told a kid that in Texas, schools teach both evolution and creationism. But some other people, like a lady named Kathy Miller who is the president of a group that tries to keep religious views from being taught in school, said no, Texas schools are not teaching creationism. And then there's another man named David Bradley, who also works for the school board in Texas, and he kinda said both things. He said that creationism isn't specifically taught in Texas, but also that nothing stops a teacher from talking about it if they want to or if a student asks about it. On top of all this, back in 1987, the big, big court of the whole country, the U.S. Supreme Court, said that teaching creationism in public schools was not okay because it's like teaching religion, and that's not allowed in public schools. Then there's this other man, Jon Huntsman, who also wanted to be president, and he said on Twitter (which is like sending a note to everyone) that he thinks evolution is true and he believes what scientists say about the world getting warmer. So, it seems like people have very different ideas about these two different explanations, just like how some people prefer apples and others like oranges more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: Except for their color, there are two identical inflatable chairs in a grade school classroom that the children can use during free time. Today, Patrick and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, are allowed to use the chairs. Patrick chooses to sit on the red chair, and Mark sits on the green chair. The boys have fun reading books while they sit on their comfortable inflatable chairs. and a hint : What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop. Please answer this question : Which chair has a higher air pressure? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The green chair has a higher air pressure. This is due to Boyle's law, which states that at a constant temperature, the pressure of a gas increases if the volume decreases. Since Mark weighs more than Patrick, he will cause the volume of the green chair to decrease more than Patrick will for the red chair. This decrease in volume will cause the pressure in the inflatable chair to increase, similar to how pressing bubble wrap increases the pressure leading to the bubbles popping. So, Mark's weight pressed onto the green chair would lead to a higher pressure in that chair compared to the red one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

One observation to explain this occurrence might be, “When I eat breakfast before class, I am better able to pay attention. ” The student could then design an experiment with a control to test this hypothesis. In hypothesis-based science, specific results are predicted from a general premise. This type of reasoning is called deductive reasoning: deduction proceeds from the general to the particular. But the reverse of the process is also possible: sometimes, scientists reach a general conclusion from a number of specific observations. This type of reasoning is called inductive reasoning, and it proceeds from the particular to the general.

Plot title: The House on Sorority Row Movie plot: Seven sorority sisters pull a prank on their strict house mother, Mrs. Slater, who is known for carrying a sharp walking cane. Their plan is to put her cane out in their dirty pool and force her at gunpoint to retrieve it. The prank goes awry when Vicki, believing the gun to be loaded with blanks, shoots Slater who collapses and appears to be dead. The girls agree to hide the body in the pool until their graduation party is finished. As the party begins, a guest wanders around the pool and an unidentified figure stabs him through the throat with Slater's cane. When other guests attempt to throw Jeanie in the pool, they are stopped by the sorority sisters. The girls realize that if the pool lights get switched on they will reveal Slater's body, so Stevie goes into the power room to disable them. While doing so, she is brutally stabbed to death by the same cane-wielding figure. Later, the pool lights do come on, but Slater's body is no longer in the pool. The girls speculate about what could have happened to both Stevie and the body. Deciding that Slater must still be alive, Vicki orders the girls to search for her. Morgan enters Slater's room where Slater's trussed-up body falls on her from the attic. She is joined by the sisters, and Vickie suggests hiding the body in the old cemetery.

Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog.

Speakeasy today premieres an alternate version of the song: a deep cut of a deep cut, from the latest entry in Dylanâs ongoing âBootlegâ series. The second of six takes recorded on June 15, 1965, during sessions for âHighway 61 Revisited,â the alternate version isnât radically different from the one Dylan included on âThe Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased)â in 1991. Like that version of “Sitting on a Barbed Wire Fence,” this one is built around swells of Hammond organ from Al Kooper, but the rhythm bed is a little funkier. Spiky stabs of guitar from Mike Bloomfield are more prominent, especially at the start, and Dylan plays a raw, bluesy harmonica part that is absent from the version released in 1991. The alternate version of âSitting on a Barbed Wire Fenceâ comes from âThe Cutting Edge 1965-1966: The Bootleg Series Volume 12.â The latest installment will be available in two-CD and six-CD configurations, along with limited-edition 18-CD box set packed with 379 songs: âevery note recorded by Bob Dylan in the studio in 1965/1966,â claims the press material.

In fact, the information provided suggests quite the opposite. To dissect this further, let's examine each part of the original statement: 1. \\"Johnny took a pretty bad crease\\": The word \\"took\\" means that Johnny received or experienced something. In this case, it is a \\"pretty bad crease.\\" The phrase \\"pretty bad\\" implies that the crease is severe or at least moderately problematic. This already contrasts with the hypothesis that Johnny was not hurt, as it suggests he has experienced an injury of some sort. 2. \\"'longside his skull\\": This part of the statement tells us where the injury took place - near or on Johnny's skull. The skull is a vital part of the body, as it houses and protects the brain, which controls various essential functions. An injury to the skull, especially when described as \\"pretty bad,\\" would generally be considered a cause for concern. 3. Considering both parts of the statement, it seems that Johnny has experienced a somewhat severe injury near or on his skull. This directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"Johnny was not hurt.\\" Our understanding of most injuries, particularly those involving important parts of the body, suggests that they generally cause some degree of pain or discomfort. Based on these points and the analysis of the premise, it would be more logical to conclude that Johnny was indeed hurt in some capacity rather than not hurt.

It ran from 1985 to 1989 for fifteen issues. Each takes the form of a series of short stories featuring different sets of characters, although some issues feature full-length stories relating to just one set of characters. The series was Bagge's first one-man comics anthology. Described by Dez Skinn in \\"Comix: The Underground Revolution\\" as the work which \\"threw Peter Bagge into the limelight\\", Bagge soon retired the title in preference of continuing the Bradley characters' story in \\"Hate. - Hate is a comic book by writer - artist Peter Bagge . First published by Fantagraphics in 1990 it ran for 30 issues , and was one of the best - selling alternative comics of the 1990s , at its height selling 30,000 copies an issue . In 2000 Bagge revived the series in Hate Annual , a yearly comic which continues the story after Hate in short stories , in addition to Bagge 's writings on Libertarianism and culture and topical cartoons . Hate follows the life of Buddy Bradley , in a continuation of events from Bagge 's strip \`\` The Bradleys '' from former publications Neat Stuff . It is set for the first half in Seattle and later in suburban New Jersey . Buddy has to deal with the end of adolescence , reluctantly growing up , his relationships with a host of unpleasant acquaintances he has to class as friends , working in dead - end jobs and having no direction in life . Bagge used memories of events from his own life as material . Hate has been referenced by many commentators as an important example of Generation X comic culture and grunge culture in general . Bagge tends to see the parallels with the grunge lifestyle as largely coincidental , as he was referencing events that had happened to him ten years previous . The comic was also released in Europe in the mid 90s as Spanish , Italian and German language editions , the Spanish Odio proving particularly popular . - Underground comix are small press or self-published comic books which are often socially relevant or satirical in nature. They differ from mainstream comics in depicting content forbidden to mainstream publications by the Comics Code Authority, including explicit drug use, sexuality and violence.

Combine like terms on both sides of the equation: On the left side of the equation, we have the terms -48*t and 90*t. (-48 + 90)*t = (42)*t So the equation becomes: 42*t = -126*t + 5376 2. Now, we need to move all the terms involving the variable t to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side. To do that, we can add 126*t to both sides of the equation: 42*t + 126*t = -126*t + 5376 + 126*t This simplifies to: (42 + 126)*t = 5376 168*t = 5376 3. Now, to isolate the variable t, we can divide both sides of the equation by 168: 168*t/(-168) = 5376/168 t = 5376/168 Now, we can simplify the fraction: t = 32 So, the solution to the equation -48*t + 90*t = -126*t + 5376 is t = 32."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If the dishes are placed inside the dishwasher without being rinsed first, it may have more effect on the dishwasher's cleaning efficiency. Here's a step-by-step explanation: 1. Dishes are not rinsed: Since the dishes are not rinsed, there will be more food particles and debris remaining on the dishes. 2. Dishes are placed in the dishwasher: The additional food particles and debris can end up clogging the dishwasher's spray arms or filter, reducing their effectiveness in cleaning all the dishes properly. 3. Detergent is added: While the detergent will still help to break down food particles, the extra debris might require more detergent for optimum cleaning. Additionally, the detergent will have to work harder to break down the larger food particles. 4. Dishwasher is closed and turned on: As the dishwasher operates, the extra food particles may cause the dishwasher to work harder, using more water and energy to clean the dishes. The already clogged spray arms and filter may also affect the dishwasher's overall performance and may result in some dishes being not cleaned properly.

Benjamin helped Robert prepare for the upcoming tests because Select from: - Benjamin was still learning about managing time. - Robert was still learning about managing time.","completion":"Robert was still learning about managing time. As the semester progressed and the intensity of the coursework increased, Benjamin noticed that his friend Robert was struggling. He could see the effects of poor time management on his friend's face - the bags under his eyes, the stress building up, and the constant anxiety. Robert seemed to be drowning in assignments and was fighting to keep himself afloat as the finals approached. Benjamin, being a top-notch student, the kind who never misses a class and jovially greets professors by their first names, decided to take the initiative and help Robert. To be fair, Benjamin knew that sharing a bit of his wisdom with a friend in need would not only benefit Robert but also potentially strengthen their bond and possibly even improve his own understanding of the coursework. Together they went on a journey toward mastering the art of time management. They began by creating a clear and structured study plan, prioritizing each subject based on the weight of the finals, the difficulty of the course materials, and Robert's current level of understanding. They factored in additional resources like supportive materials, tutoring sessions, and peer study groups to supplement their studies. Benjamin ensured that Robert felt comfortable with the plan and that he could confidently follow through with it, knowing that a plan could only be effective if one genuinely buys into it. Next, they sought to break old habits and open Robert's mind to the possibility of forming new, efficient study strategies. Benjamin invited Robert to join group study sessions and shared tips on how to maintain the balance between being fully absorbed in the material and taking breaks from the intensity. \\"Pomodoro technique!\\" Benjamin excitedly proclaimed, explaining the concept of studying for a set time - say, 25 minutes - and taking a short break, around 5 minutes, to de-stress and recharge his brain. Understanding the importance of motivation, Benjamin and Robert engaged in friendly competition, taking on challenges within their study sessions that tested their understanding and retention of the material. Each study session left Robert feeling accomplished and more motivated to continue his academic journey. As they delved into time management strategies, Benjamin showed Robert various methods, such as making task lists and organizing schedules by level of priority. They explored different techniques to find out which method suited Robert most comfortably. They analyzed how to make the most of the study sessions, how to align assignments with other deadlines, and how to create breathing room in the chaotic academic hurricanes. Robert was amazed to see what was possible with a little time management guidance and the steadfast support of a knowledgeable and caring friend. Gradually, he started to experience a sense of accomplishment, as his stress levels decreased and his confidence grew. By the time finals arrived, Robert felt ready and prepared - a far cry from the overwhelmed and panicked student he had been just a few weeks earlier. As their last act of solidarity, Benjamin and Robert made it a point to reward themselves with some much-needed fun and relaxation after the final exams were over. They could now look back and appreciate the journey they had taken together, knowing that they had both emerged from the experience stronger, smarter, and more capable of tackling life's challenges. In helping Robert master the art of time management, Benjamin not only left a positive impact on his friend's academic life but also helped him gain essential life skills that would continue to shape their characters as they faced challenges together in the years to come."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. 200 Years After Waterloo, Napoleon Still Wins by Losing LIGNY, Belgium — Napoleon Bonaparte, also known as Frank Samson, a pudgy Paris lawyer who likes wearing gold braided uniforms and a black bicorne hat, won his last battle on Sunday in southern Belgium. Feting the “glorious performance” of French troops in a field of thigh-high wheat, rented for the day from a farmer for a mock showdown between the armies of France and Prussia, he predicted that whatever the outcome of a coming confrontation with the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo this week, he had already won the war. “In terms of glory and of history, it is Napoleon who stays in people’s minds, not Wellington,” said Mr. Samson, relishing cries of “Long Live the Emperor” as he dismounted from his white horse after a restaging of Napoleon’s triumphant last day in the sun on June 16, 1815. The re-enactment of the Battle of Ligny, a picturesque French-speaking village south of Brussels, opened a weeklong series of events to commemorate Napoleon’s ultimate defeat at Waterloo on June 18, 1815. But while Britain and its victorious allies remember Waterloo as a decisive triumph that reshaped Europe in their favor, Mr. Samson and other, mostly French, fans of the defeated emperor instead celebrate the enduring celebrity and allure of their routed hero. In the case of Napoleon, losers, not victors, have managed to write much of the history. “Napoleon, without a shadow of doubt, won the postwar publicity and PR campaign,” said Alasdair White, a British expert on the period and author of books on the 1815 struggle between France and a British-led alliance. “This was where Wellington fell flat on his face.” In Ligny over the weekend, stalls set up near the battlefield were filled with tributes to Napoleon — statues, busts, books and death masks, as well as T-shirts, posters and knickknacks all bearing his image. Wellington was nowhere to be seen. A Franco-Belgian company hawked a book titled “The French Victory at Waterloo,” a study of a little known battle fought in 1794. That battle had nothing to do with Napoleon but still cheers the spirits of fans for whom Waterloo is a place usually associated with French ignominy. Eager to revive memories of how, for a time, it looked as if France could win in 1815, Mr. Samson rode off the battlefield here on Sunday and declared that defeating Wellington would be a “picnic” after the slaughter at Ligny, a gruesome battle that left around 20,000 French and Prussian soldiers dead or wounded. In reality, the Battle of Ligny, re-enacted by Mr. Samson and around 1,500 other history enthusiasts dressed in period costumes, was the final spasm of French military pride before a catastrophic fall at Waterloo that put an end to all French hopes of hegemony in Europe and led to Napoleon’s banishment to St. Helena, an island in the South Atlantic. For a day, however, a 47-year-old lawyer dressed up as Napoleon — and bearing a striking resemblance to the real thing — and fans of the Corsican-born soldier who declared himself emperor and turned France into the superpower of his day savored their hero’s final day of glory. “We won today, and we are going to win again,” Mr. Samson said in his role as Napoleon. Speaking as himself, after hours racing across a wheat field on a horse in the sun, he said: “What I really want now is a cold beer.” With a touch of melancholy, he added that he would not try to rewrite history and would accept whatever fate awaited him at Waterloo. There, he and more than 5,000 war re-enactors and 300 horses will, on Friday and Saturday, restage the climactic battle, an event billed as the biggest re-enactment ever held in Europe. The defeat at Waterloo on June 18, 1815, was so calamitous for France’s ambitions to implant the goals of the 1789 French Revolution across Europe that the 19th-century writer Victor Hugo said it “wasn’t a battle.” “It was a change of direction in the universe,” he wrote. Hugo blamed God, or at least the heavens, for Napoleon’s defeat, complaining that heavy rain the night before made it difficult for Napoleon to maneuver his artillery and tilted the conflict unfairly Wellington’s way. Other Frenchmen have insisted that Napoleon actually won. “This defeat shimmers with an aura of victory,” former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin wrote in an admiring book about Napoleon. Claudine Coulon, a resident of Ligny, once part of Napoleon’s empire but part of Belgium for nearly 200 years, hoisted a French flag outside her home to show whose side her family was on during the mock battle taking place on the wheat field across the road. “I am so happy,” she said. “This is a big win for Napoleon.” She also put out pots planted with what she had hoped would be flowers in the colors of France — blue, white and red — but which turned out to be purple, white and brown. Napoleon, she said, should have stayed put in Ligny, where he defeated a Prussian Army under Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, instead of marching north to confront Wellington at Waterloo. “It would have turned out better if he had just stayed here,” Ms. Coulon said. The French government has shown no interest in the events this week to mark the 200th anniversary of Napoleon’s defeat. While Britain and the Netherlands, two of the principal victors in 1815, are sending members of their royal families to Belgium for the Waterloo commemorations, France is sending only its ambassador in Brussels. Germany, heir to Prussia’s share of the Waterloo victory honors, is also staying away aside from its ambassador, wary of celebrating a Prussian military tradition that post-Nazi Germany has worked hard to forget. “The French are not keen on celebrating Waterloo for obvious reasons,” Robert Tombs, a history professor at the University of Cambridge, said. “It ended a whole phase of European history, one of French predominance which had lasted more than a century, and started a period of British and Russian predominance.” Many of Napoleon’s fans, past and present, have sought to recast the debacle as a moral triumph or found ways to exculpate the emperor, claiming that he suffered from a painful bout of hemorrhoids that knocked him off his winning stride, and from treachery within his own command. Mr. Samson said after his victory on Sunday that he was feeling well but did “have some bother in the posterior.” Mr. White, the British expert on the Battle of Waterloo, dismissed the hemorrhoid story as “an absolute myth” invented by French supporters of Napoleon who “cannot believe that the great man lost, so there must have been something wrong with him.” The real reason for his defeat, Mr. White said, was that Napoleon was far past his prime and “was no longer the great military leader he had been in 1805,” when he routed far bigger Russian and Austrian forces at Austerlitz. He had “not won a major battle since 1812,” he said. “He was tired and made too many mistakes.” Once the battle was over, however, Napoleon quickly got the upper hand in rewriting history. While Wellington went into politics, becoming a deeply conservative and highly unpopular prime minister in London, Napoleon used his exile on St. Helena to work on his memoir with a French historian, a vast self-serving work that became an international best seller. It cemented Napoleon’s status, presenting him as a servant to the ideals, but not the brutality, of the French Revolution and blaming his failures on disloyal subordinates and plain bad luck. “His version of events is fundamentally wrong, but it became the version of events,” Mr. White said. Mr. Samson, who has been playing Napoleon for more than 10 years in battle re-enactments around Europe, said he planned to retire from his role as emperor after Waterloo. “I am much better known than Wellington,” Mr. Samson said, speaking for Napoleon. “Wellington won the battle.

Article: Climate change will increase U.S wildfires, and the smoky air will cause terrible problems in areas far beyond those burned, reports an environmental group Thursday. Two-thirds of Americans, or nearly 212 million, lived in states suffering from wildfire smoke three years ago, according to the report by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). These areas, which had smoke for at least a week, were nearly 50 times greater than those burned directly by fire. \\" It affects a much wider area of the United States than people have realized, \\" says author Kim Knowlton, a Columbia University health professor, adding the smoke can move up to hundreds of miles. She says the smoke contains air pollution and can cause several kinds of disease. Texas was hit hardest in 2011, when smoke stayed for at least a week in areas that are home to 25 million people, according to NRDC's report. Illinois, which recorded no wildfires within its borders( ) ,ranked ( ) second with nearly 12 million people affected by smoke that moved in from elsewhere. The other eight states with the most people exposed ( ) to smoky air were, in descending ( ) order: Florida, Missouri, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Alabama, Oklahoma and Iowa. Nearly two dozen states had no wildfires within their borders in 2011, but eight of them still had at least one week of smoky air: Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Indiana, Wisconsin and Ohio. Only 18 states and the District of Columbia had no people exposed to at least a week of smoke that year, although five of them----Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah---had a large area burned by wildfires. The problem will only get worse, Knowlton say. Scientific research shows climate is causing higher temperatures and health problems.

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been... Why is the Cuban economy weaker than in 1985?

In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form).

His therapist, Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher), does his best to convince him to keep taking his medication, as a repeat of his violent outbursts might send him back to the clinic. But Pat tells him that he has a new outlook on life: he attempts to see the good, or silver linings, in all that he experiences. At dinner with his friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) and his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles), Pat meets Veronica's sister Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow with depression and relationship problems. Sparks fly between Pat and Tiffany and she tries to connect by offering casual sex, but Pat keeps focusing on getting Nikki back.

The overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi has had a messy and often confused aftermath, as rival groups jostle for a stake in the new Libya after four decades of dictatorship. But while the realities of Libya's new order remain murky, for the country's Berber minority, the task ahead is clear. The removal of the old regime has cleared the way for a renaissance of their ancient language and culture that were brutally suppressed under Gadhafi's hardline rule. Known in their native tongue as Amazigh, or \\"free man,\\" the Berbers are the indigenous inhabitants of North Africa, whose culture predominated in the region prior to the 7th century Arab invasion. Berbers were unable to publicly speak or publish books in their language, Tamazight, or display symbols such as the","completion":"Amazigh flag during Gadhafi's rule. The threat of arrest and imprisonment loomed over those who dared to promote their cultural identity. Now, however, with the fall of the dictatorship, there appears to be a newfound sense of hope and determination among the Berber community to reclaim their linguistic and cultural heritage. The Libyan government, as part of its efforts to establish a more inclusive and pluralistic society, has recognized the Amazigh language as an official language alongside Arabic and has promised to incorporate it into the educational curriculum. The Berber community has seized this opportunity to revive their language and culture by organizing language courses, cultural festivals, and events that showcase traditional Amazigh music, dance, and art. Still, challenges remain for the Berber community in their quest for cultural revitalization. Old biases and prejudices persist in some quarters of Libyan society, and Berbers continue to face discrimination in various forms. Moreover, the ongoing political instability and power struggles among rival factions in the country have limited the government's ability to fully implement policies promoting the Berber language and culture. Despite these obstacles, the Berber community remains undaunted in their quest to restore and preserve their ancient heritage. Aided by international support and increased visibility on global platforms, they are committed to rebuilding a cultural legacy that was once all but erased from history. The reemergence of the Amazigh identity in Libya is not only a testament to the resilience of the Berber people, but a crucial step towards forging a diverse and harmonious future for the nation as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is \\"ρ\\" (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter \\"D\\" can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume: where \\"ρ\\" is the density, \\"m\\" is the mass, and \\"V\\" is the volume. In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume, although this is scientifically inaccurate – this quantity is more specifically called specific weight. For a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its mass concentration. Different materials usually have different densities, and density may be relevant to buoyancy, purity and packaging. Osmium and iridium are the densest known elements at standard conditions for temperature and pressure but certain chemical compounds may be denser. To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity \\"relative density\\" or \\"specific gravity\\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water. 1. Are they densities of everything the same? 2. What is the densest elements at regular conditions? 3.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: The two basic things you have to do to have a successful weight-loss journey is consume fewer calories (eat less) and exercise more. It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success. Add a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine A simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities – the things you are going to do anyway. For example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster. As you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories. When it’s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can – stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal. When you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song – make those tiles shine. Play fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum. Work for longer periods of time – 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism. These are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you. So, start throwing in an abundant amount of gusto for extra calorie burning and body shaping. Question: Why does the author recommend sweeping and mopping at a brisk pace? Answer: Choose your answer from: 1). More calories will be burned 2). So there is more time in the day to exercise, since you will be done with chores faster 3). Stretching your arms will make you more flexible 4). not enough information The answer is:","completion":"1).

This equation means that you need to remove a certain amount of jellies to have an empty jar. Let's combine the two jelly groups you have: -22 jellies and -2 jellies. When you add them together, you get -24 jellies. Now, the equation looks like this: 0 = -24*g.

But Lindsey was too short to reach the blender on the countertop, so she asked her best friend, Jessica, for help. Jessica was very kind, and she loved to help her friends. She came over to Lindsey's house, so they could make the banana milkshake together. Jessica was taller than Lindsey, so she could reach the blender and brought it down to the table. Lindsey smiled and thanked Jessica. With the blender now on the table, it was time to start making the milkshake. Lindsey explained to Jessica how to make the milkshake, so they could do it together. First, they peeled the bananas and broke them into smaller pieces. Then, they put the banana pieces into the blender. Next, they scooped the ice cream. Lindsey told Jessica they needed three big scoops to make the milkshake extra thick and creamy. They added the three scoops of ice cream to the blender with the bananas. After that, they poured in some milk. Lindsey said that they only needed a little bit of milk, just enough to help the blender mix everything up. She poured the milk into the blender, filling it about halfway up the bananas and ice cream. Lindsey and Jessica closed the lid on the blender, making sure it was on tight, so nothing would spill out. Jessica helped Lindsey press the button on the blender to start mixing everything together. The blender roared to life, and the bananas, ice cream, and milk whirled and swirled around inside. Once everything was all mixed up, it was time to pour the milkshake into cups. Jessica held the cups while Lindsey poured the banana milkshake into each one. They filled two cups for themselves and some extra ones for their family to enjoy, too. With their cups filled, Lindsey and Jessica grabbed some colorful straws and put them into their milkshakes. They took their first sips and grinned as they tasted the creamy and delicious banana milkshake they had made together.

Generally, this expression of thoughts and feelings has been in the form of oral speech. When there is a spoken language problem, communication can be carried out through sign language, in which gestures stand for letters, words, and ideas. Tourists and people unable to hear or speak have often had to turn to this form of expression. When gestures describe words or ideas, they can often be used internationally. When used for spelling words however, where each gesture stands for a single letter, people must share the same written language. Body language sends ideas or thoughts by certain actions, either meaningfully or not. A wink can be a way of showing that the person is only joking. A nod means agreement, while shaking the head indicates disagreement. Other forms of language can be found in Braille (a reading system of raised dots read with the fingertips used by the blind), signal flags, Morse code, and smoke signals. Road maps and picture signs also guide and warn people. While language is the most common form of communication, other systems and techniques also express human thoughts and feelings.

Answer:","completion":"Carbohydrates, as a large class of biological molecules, are primarily composed of three fundamental elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Let's delve deeper into the roles these elements play in the structure and functionality of carbohydrates. 1. Carbon (C): Carbon is a crucial component of carbohydrates and manifests in all known life. It's the central atom in carbohydrate molecules due to its ability to form four covalent bonds, allowing for the creation of complex and diverse structures that form the fundamental building blocks of life. Carbon atoms in carbohydrates form the skeletal framework of the molecule, providing structural integrity and contributing to the formation of functional groups. 2. Hydrogen (H): The second crucial element in carbohydrates is Hydrogen. It is a part of every carbohydrate molecule, forming covalent bonds with carbon. Hydrogen is essential in the creation of hydroxyl groups (-OH), that are characteristic features of most carbohydrates. These groups can participate in a variety of reactions, such as the formation and breakage of glycosidic bonds between sugar molecules, contributing significantly to the energy-storing and releasing properties of carbohydrates. 3. Oxygen (O): Oxygen is the third essential component in carbohydrates. Along with hydrogen, oxygen atoms help to form hydroxyl groups (-OH) in carbohydrate molecules. Moreover, oxygen is part of the ether linkages, which connect individual monomer units in polysaccharides, the complex carbohydrates. Oxygen is also crucial for the formation and breakage of links between sugar units, involved in the dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis reactions. It's important to note that while the majority of carbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the ratio of 1:2:1, which is represented by the general formula (CH2O)n, some might have slightly different compositions. A variety of other elements might be present in minor amounts in certain complex carbohydrates depending on their specific biological functions. Nonetheless, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen remain the primary and most critical to their structure and functionalities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: Government plans to cut legal aid in criminal cases have been criticised by an elite group of barristers used by it to prosecute the most serious crimes.","completion":"Title: Elite Group of Barristers Denounce Government's Plan to Cut Legal Aid in Criminal Cases Introduction: The recent announcement of the government's decision to cut legal aid budgets for criminal cases has been met with significant criticism from an elite group of barristers. These highly respected legal professionals, often engaged by the government to prosecute the most serious crimes, have expressed strong disapproval over the proposed reductions, highlighting the potential consequences on the criminal justice system as a whole. This article explores the views of these eminent barristers and the potential impact of these cuts on the justice system, the legal profession, and the wider society. Barristers' Perspectives on the Cuts: Barristers within this elite group have reportedly emphasised that such cuts to legal aid could lead to a decline in the quality of representation for defendants who are unable to afford private counsel in criminal cases. They argue that these cuts will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable people in society, adding to the already existing social inequalities and increasing the risk of miscarriages of justice. These legal professionals are also concerned about the erosion of the principle of 'equality before the law,' which is a cornerstone of any democratic society. They argue that the proposed budget reductions place this fundamental concept at risk, as those with limited financial means will struggle to access the same level of quality legal representation that wealthier individuals can afford. Potential Consequences for the Criminal Justice System: The ramifications of such funding cuts stretch beyond the individuals directly affected. A reduction in the quality of legal representation offered in criminal cases may have wide-reaching implications for the criminal justice system as a whole. For instance, it has been suggested that if there are fewer resources for the effective investigation and presentation of cases, the courts might be faced with a higher number of faulty convictions. Full disclosure of evidence may also become a more significant issue, further hindering a fair trial process. In turn, this could lead to an increase in appeals against convictions, placing additional pressure on an already strained legal system. Additionally, it has been warned that the diminished availability of legal aid could also lead to a rise in litigants in person. In other words, defendants forced to represent themselves due to a lack of adequate legal assistance. This scenario is troubling, as self-representation not only jeopardises the defendant's case outcome, but also drastically slows down the speed at which cases progress through the legal system. Implications for the Legal Profession: The proposed cuts to legal aid in criminal cases have severe implications for the legal profession itself. As high-calibre legal representation becomes less accessible, the profession is at risk of becoming more elitist, with potentially fewer opportunities for newly qualified barristers. Furthermore, the reduced funding will likely discourage experienced lawyers from choosing a career in criminal law, where the benefits of legal aid work are being diminished. This shift could result in a significant loss of talent in this critical area of the legal profession, further exacerbating the deterioration in quality representation for criminal defendants. Wider Societal Impact: As the quality of representation in criminal cases declines, public confidence in the criminal justice system may be undermined. This erosion of trust could have widespread consequences, including increased civil unrest and a decline in societal cohesion. It is imperative that any proposed action regarding legal aid be carefully considered in light of the societal impact that may ensue. Conclusion: The government's plan to cut legal aid in criminal cases has been criticised by the very people who are enlisted to prosecute the most serious crimes in the country. The elite group of barristers expressed deep concern over the potential damage to the quality of legal representation, the legal profession, and subsequently, the criminal justice system. Soaring social inequalities, the risk of miscarriages of justice, and the dilution of the principle of 'equality before the law' serve as significant issues that require careful analysis and reconsideration from the policymakers involved. It remains to be seen whether the legal community's vocal criticism of these proposed reductions will result in a re-evaluation and protection of crucial legal aid provisions in criminal law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During this month, world-class festivals on teh island keep things lively and the weather remains comfortable enough for Bermuda shorts and bathing suits. In October, Bermuda hosts two major festivals--the Bermuda Music Festival and the Bermuda Culinary Arts Festival. The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda's West End. Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone, Pattie Labelle, and Al Green, and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists. General admission tickets start at 60 for on e day or 160 for a three-day pass. Starting October 21, the Culinary Arts Festival brings some of North America's top chefs to the island for four days of food and wine tastings, conferences and cooking competitions. Participating chefs include Todd English and Michael Lomonaco, among others. Three-day festival passes start at 649 per person, but you can also buy separate tickets for individual events. Even if you don't attend one of the festivals, there's still plenty to do.

In 2015 the 05 range (other than 0550) was also allocated to Digital Mobile Phones as a part of the Telecommunications Numbering Plan 2015. do all australian mobile numbers start with 04?","completion":"While many Australian mobile phone numbers do indeed start with the '04' prefix, it is not accurate to say that all mobile numbers in the country begin with this prefix. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) manages the allocation and administration of telephone numbers within the country, using the Telecommunications Numbering Plan. This plan serves as a guideline for determining the structure and organization of telephone numbers in Australia, including mobile numbers. In the early-stage development of the mobile market in Australia, mobile numbers commonly used the '018' and '019' prefixes. However, those prefixes have since been phased out, and numbers with the '04' prefix have become more widespread. As you mentioned, in 2015, Australia's Telecommunications Numbering Plan was updated, expanding the range of mobile number prefixes (excluding '0550') that can be allocated to digital mobile phones. The 2015 update aimed to address the shortage of mobile numbers and provide more options for telecommunications providers to choose from when allocating numbers to customers. The change allows mobile numbers to start with '05', including numbers within specific ranges such as '050', '053', '054', '056', '057', '058', and '059'. This means that you may encounter Australian mobile numbers that do not strictly begin with the '04' prefix. Nevertheless, as of now, the '04' prefix remains the most commonly used prefix for mobile numbers in Australia. Majority of mobile numbers still begin with '04', since the adoption and distribution of the newly-allocated '05' prefixes hasn't fully materialized. Over time, as existing '04' mobile numbers become more saturated and the demand for new numbers increases, you can expect to see a higher prevalence of the new '05' prefixed mobile numbers in Australia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Why is Autism sensory issues painful? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Pick from: --no. --yes.","completion":"To answer the first part of your request, I will explain why sensory overload and autism sensory issues can be painful. 1. Sensory overload is a condition where the brain receives too much information from the senses (touch, taste, smell, hearing, and sight). 2. Processing a high volume of sensory information can be overwhelming for the brain, which leads to difficulty in organizing, filtering, or understanding the input. 3. When the brain cannot efficiently process this information, it may manifest as physical discomfort, anxiety, or pain. 4. Pain experienced in sensory overload might be due to a heightened sensitivity to certain sensations and the inability to process the stimulus properly. Now, I will address the sensory issues associated with autism: 1. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can impact how individuals process and experience sensory information. 2. Individuals with autism may have atypical sensory processing, which can make them more sensitive or less sensitive to certain sensory inputs. 3. This atypical sensory processing can lead to physical discomfort, anxiety, or pain when exposed to certain sensory information. 4. Pain experienced in autism sensory issues might be due to their unique neurological makeup, which leads to difficulties in processing and filtering sensory inputs. For the multi-choice part of your request: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? I would say: --yes. While the two questions focus on different conditions, both involve atypical sensory processing resulting in physical discomfort, anxiety, or pain.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"The longest-running president in office was Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who served as the 32nd President of the United States. He held this position for 12 years, from 1933 until his death in 1945. Roosevelt was elected to four consecutive terms in office. It is important to note that, after his tenure, the 22nd Amendment was adopted in 1951, which limits U.S. Presidents to two terms in office. Regarding why don't better people run for U.S. President, there are several reasons to consider: 1. Political experience: The position of the U.S. President is a high-stakes job, and candidates with political experience may have an advantage in understanding the complexities of domestic and international affairs. Thus, better-qualified individuals may instead opt to contribute to society by working in other sectors or positions that value their unique insight and expertise. 2. Financial constraints: Running an effective presidential campaign is a costly process. It can require millions or even billions of dollars to hire staff, advertise, and organize campaigns effectively. This may deter potential candidates who lack personal wealth or a robust fundraising network. 3. Partisan politics: The U.S. political system has become deeply polarized, making it challenging for candidates with moderate or unorthodox policy positions to win their party's nomination. As a result, individuals with differing views may feel as though they have little chance of success. This discourages them from running for President. 4. Personal considerations: The presidency can take a considerable toll on one's personal life. Running for the highest office in the United States involves significant sacrifices when it comes to privacy, family, and overall well-being. Some qualified individuals might prefer staying away from the public eye and maintaining a more balanced work-life situation. 5. Reputation and scrutiny: Both during and after the presidential campaign, candidates are subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism from the media and the public. This might dissuade competent individuals from running for President, as they may not want to subject themselves and their past actions to such a level of scrutiny. To answer the final question about whether these two questions have the same meaning, they do not. The first question seeks factual information about the longest-serving U.S. President, while the second question delves into the reasons behind the types of people who run for and become President.

Movie plot: The story is told in flashback by a villager, played by Mervyn Johns, as though to a person visiting after the war. He recounts: one Saturday during the Second World War, a group of seemingly authentic British soldiers arrive in the small, fictitious English village of Bramley End.[1] It is the Whitsun weekend so life is even quieter than usual and there is almost no traffic of any kind. At first they are welcomed by the villagers, until doubts begin to grow about their true purpose and identity. After they are revealed to be German soldiers intended to form the vanguard of an invasion of Britain, they round up the residents and hold them captive in the local church. The vicar is shot after sounding the church bell in alarm. In attempts to reach the outside world, many of the villagers take action. Such plans include writing a message on an egg and giving them to the local paper boy for his mother, but they are crushed when Mrs Fraser's cousin runs over them. Mrs Fraser then puts a note in Cousin Maude's pocket, but she uses it to hold her car window in place; her dog, Edward, then chews it to shreds after it blows onto the back seat. Mrs Collins, the postmistress, manages to kill a German with an axe used for chopping firewood, and tries to telephone elsewhere. The girls on the exchange see her light and decide that she can wait. Mrs Collins waits until she is killed by another German who walks into the shop moments afterwards. The girl at the exchange then picks up the phone, getting no reply. The civilians attempt to escape to warn the local Home Guard, but are betrayed by the village squire, who is revealed to be collaborating with the Germans. Members of the local Home Guard are ambushed and shot by the Germans. They begin to bow in until a young boy, George, succeeds in escaping; despite being shot in the leg, he alerts the army. British soldiers arrive, and â aided by some of the villagers, including a group of Women's Land Army girls, who have managed to escape, barricade themselves in, and arm...

Nelson smelled much cleaner and fresher than Samuel did although","completion":"Once upon a time, there were two best friends named Nelson and Samuel. They did everything together and had lots of fun. One sunny day, they decided to play outside. Now, Nelson smelled much cleaner and fresher than Samuel did although they both played in the same places. This was because Nelson had a magical secret. Before they went outside, Nelson would put on a magical cape his mom had given him that kept him clean no matter how dirty he got. While playing outside, they found a big, muddy puddle. Samuel was so excited that he jumped right into it, splashing mud everywhere! Nelson, not wanting his friend to have all the fun by himself, jumped in too. They laughed and splashed, but soon Samuel began to wonder why Nelson stayed so clean. He asked Nelson, \\"How do you always stay so clean even when we play in the mud together?\\" Nelson smiled and showed Samuel his secret magical cape. He explained that it had a special power that kept him clean and fresh all the time. Samuel was amazed and thought the magical cape was the coolest thing he'd ever seen! Nelson, noticing Samuel's fascination, said, \\"Hey, Samuel, why don't you try wearing the cape and see what happens?\\" Samuel was thrilled! He carefully put on the cape and suddenly, the mud and dirt on him disappeared! He smelled all fresh and clean, just like Nelson. The two friends continued playing, making sure to share the magical cape so they both stayed clean and fresh. They knew they would always remember this day and the wonderful gift of the magical cape. And so, their friendship grew even stronger, and they kept enjoying many more adventures together, knowing that staying clean would never be a problem again, all thanks to their amazing secret—a magical cape that made them smell so clean and fresh."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Here's a question: What does a real estate agent typically do when describing homes? Here are possible answers to this question: - charming - cover up - exaggerate - incompetent - smile I believe the correct choice is \\"exaggerate\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"When describing homes, a real estate agent typically aims to present the property in the best possible light to attract potential buyers and facilitate a quick and profitable sale. Among the given options: charming, cover up, exaggerate, incompetent, and smile, the most accurate choice is \\"exaggerate.\\" Let's explore why this is the case and discuss the reasons behind the selection. 1. Exaggerate: Real estate agents often use persuasive language, highlighting the attractive aspects of the property, and may sometimes exaggerate the positive qualities to create a strong impression. This is a common sales tactic used to captivate the potential buyer's interest and encourage them to make a decision in favor of purchasing the property. An agent might emphasize the spaciousness, natural light, or the stunning views of a property, while downplaying any less desirable features. 2. Charming: While describing homes, some real estate agents might use the term \\"charming\\" to evoke positive feelings associated with the property. This word can create a picture of a cozy, welcoming, and homely environment, which might appeal to buyers. However, the term \\"charming\\" alone does not capture the essence of what an agent typically does when describing homes. 3. Cover up: Although it is possible that some agents might try to cover up or minimize the negative aspects of a property, this practice is not representative of what an agent typically does when describing homes. Honesty and transparency are important in the real estate industry, as trust plays a crucial role between agents and their clients. Therefore, \\"cover up\\" is not the correct choice to describe the agent's actions universally. 4. Incompetent: Describing a home requires the real estate agent to be knowledgeable about the property and its features. An incompetent agent would likely fail to provide an accurate and appealing description of the home or may miss crucial information that the potential buyer needs. However, incompetence is not a characteristic of what a real estate agent typically does when describing homes. It is important to differentiate between an agent's typical actions and occasional lapses in professionalism. 5. Smile: A real estate agent's smile and positive demeanor are part of their overall approach when showing a property and interacting with potential buyers. A warm and friendly attitude can help make clients feel at ease, fostering a positive environment during the house hunting process. However, \\"smile\\" does not directly relate to the way an agent describes a home. It is an element of their interpersonal skills, but not the main criterion in this context. In conclusion, the most accurate choice when describing what a real estate agent typically does when describing homes is \\"exaggerate.\\" Though some agents may use other methods to present a property or adopt additional interpersonal skills, exaggeration is a widely employed technique to accentuate the positive features of a home and showcase it in its best light. This, in turn, helps real estate agents attract potential buyers and facilitate a smooth and profitable transaction for all parties involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyze the words: - \\"Quickly\\" generally means something happening in a short amount of time or with rapidity. - \\"Forgettable\\" means easily forgotten, not memorable, or not leaving a lasting impression. 2. Combine the meanings: Combining the meanings of these words, the phrase \\"quickly forgettable\\" means something that is easily forgotten or doesn't leave a lasting impression and happens in a short amount of time. 3. Determine the connotation: Given the context of the phrase and the meanings of the words, it seems to have a negative connotation. This is because describing something as easily forgotten or not memorable usually implies that it lacks importance, quality, or value.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What were the names of the groups who left their respective bases of operations to conquer the Lacandon? In 1684, a council led by Enrique Enríquez de Guzmán, the governor of Guatemala, decided on the reduction of San Mateo Ixtatán and nearby Santa Eulalia, both within the colonial administrative district of the Corregimiento of Huehuetenango.On 29 January 1686, Captain Melchor Rodríguez Mazariegos, acting under orders from the governor, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán, where he recruited indigenous warriors from the nearby villages, 61 from San Mateo itself. It was believed by the Spanish colonial authorities that the inhabitants of San Mateo Ixtatán were friendly towards the still unconquered and fiercely hostile inhabitants of the Lacandon region, which included parts of what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas and the western part of the Petén Basin. To prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three of San Mateo's community leaders, named as Cristóbal Domingo, Alonso Delgado and Gaspar Jorge, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango. The governor himself arrived in San Mateo Ixtatán on 3 February, where Captain Rodríguez Mazariegos was already awaiting him. The governor ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region. The Spanish missionaries Fray de Rivas and Fray Pedro de la Concepción also remained in the town. Governor Enriquez de Guzmán subsequently left San Mateo Ixtatán for Comitán in Chiapas, to enter the Lacandon region via Ocosingo.In 1695, a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, Cobán and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán.

Cracks spotted in structural wall above a five-foot pile of rubble in street. Records show inspectors declared the facade safe in February. Recent listing offers a two-bedroom apartment for sale at 3.7 million.","completion":"Title: Big Trouble at a Fancy Building During Christmas Dinner! Once upon a time, on a special day called Christmas, many people were inside a tall building called the O'Neill Building on a street named 6th Ave. Christmas is a day when families gather together to eat a big meal and enjoy each other's company. The people living in this building were trying to do just that, but something scary happened! A strange thing occurred when people were sitting down for their Christmas dinner. They were told they had to leave the building right away because a part of the building wasn't safe. This is called an evacuation. Evacuation means people have to go and leave a place to be safe. So why did they have to evacuate the building? Well, somebody noticed that there were cracks in a very important wall that helps to hold the building up. To make things even scarier, there was a big pile of broken pieces from the building that fell onto the street. The pile was five feet tall! That's taller than most five-year-olds! Now, a crack in a wall might not sound too bad, but it could be dangerous if it's in a special wall that helps keep the building standing. The people realized that they needed to leave quickly to be safe, even if it meant leaving their delicious Christmas dinner behind. This building was usually a very safe place to live. Just earlier this year, in a month called February, some people called inspectors came to look at the outside of the building. Inspectors are like building doctors, and they help make sure the buildings are healthy and safe. They checked the building and said it was safe to live in. But now, with the cracks and the rubble, it seemed that something went wrong. The O'Neill Building is a fancy building where people live in expensive homes called apartments. One of the apartments, with two bedrooms, was for sale for a lot of money - 3.7 million! That's like buying 37 hundred thousand ice cream cones! The people who lived there usually felt proud and lucky to have such a nice place to live. But what really matters is that everyone stays safe and sound. The people in the building listened to the evacuation order and left their homes to make sure they were away from danger. It was a scary and unexpected adventure on Christmas Day, but it reminded everyone that being safe is even more important than a fancy building or a delicious dinner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Spend more time at work than at home, and you miss out on a rewarding personal life. Then again, when you face challenges in your personal life, such as caring for an aging parent or coping with marital problems, concentrating on your job can be difficult. Whether the problem is too much focus on work or too little, when your work life and your personal life feel out of balance, stress -- along with its harmful effects -- is the result. The good news is that you can take control of your work-life balance -- and give yourself the time to do the things that are most important to you. The first step is to recognize how the world of work has changed. Then you can evaluate your relationship to work and apply some specific strategies for striking a healthier balance. How work invades your personal life There was a time when employees showed up for work Monday through Friday and worked eight- to nine-hour days. The boundaries between work and home were fairly clear then. But the world has changed and, unfortunately, the boundaries have blurred for many workers. Here's why: *Global economy. As more skilled workers enter the global labor market and companies outsource or move more jobs to reduce labor costs, people feel pressured to work longer and produce more just to protect their jobs. *International business. Work continues around the world 24 hours a day for some people. If you work in an international organization, you might be on call around the clock for troubleshooting or consulting. *Advanced communication technology. Many people now have the ability to work anywhere -- from their home, from their car and even on vacation. And some managers expect this. *Longer hours. Employers commonly ask employees to work longer hours than they're scheduled. Often, overtime is mandatory. If you hope to move up the career ladder, you may find yourself regularly working more than 40... Options: A You might lose all your friends. B You will lose both health and wealth.

Under 100 words is a good title length. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Fusion between the viral and target cell membranes is an obligatory step for the infectivity of all enveloped virus, and blocking this process is a clinically validated therapeutic strategy. Viral fusion is driven by specialized proteins which, although specific to each virus, act through a common mechanism, the formation of a complex between two heptad repeat (HR) regions. The HR regions are initially separated in an intermediate termed ''prehairpin'', which bridges the viral and cell membranes, and then fold onto each other to form a 6-helical bundle (6HB), driving the two membranes to fuse. HR-derived peptides can inhibit viral infectivity by binding to the prehairpin intermediate and preventing its transition to the 6HB. The antiviral activity of HR-derived peptides differs considerably among enveloped viruses. For weak inhibitors, potency can be increased by peptide engineering strategies, but sequence-specific optimization is time-consuming. In seeking ways to increase potency without changing the native sequence, we previously reported that attachment to the HR peptide of a cholesterol group (''cholesterol-tagging'') dramatically increases its antiviral potency, and simultaneously increases its halflife in vivo. We show here that antiviral potency may be increased by combining cholesterol-tagging with dimerization of the HR-derived sequence, using as examples human parainfluenza virus, Nipah virus, and HIV-1. Together, cholesteroltagging and dimerization may represent strategies to boost HR peptide potency to levels that in some cases may be compatible with in vivo use, possibly contributing to emergency responses to outbreaks of existing or novel viruses.

If \\"A skateboarder high in the air at indoor ramp.\\", does this mean that \\"A person riding a scooter down a hill\\"?","completion":"The phrases \\"A skateboarder high in the air at an indoor ramp\\" and \\"A person riding a scooter down a hill\\" may seem similar, as they both describe individuals engaging in wheeled activities. However, the two expressions depict distinct scenarios with specific differences in the mode of transportation, environment, and action being undertaken. \\"A skateboarder high in the air at an indoor ramp\\" refers to a person who is performing a skateboard trick, possibly at an indoor skate park or facility. Skateboarding is an extreme sport that involves riding on a small, flat board with four wheels called a skateboard. Skateboarders often perform various stunts and tricks on ramps, rails, and other obstacles designed for the sport. In this particular phrase, the person is utilizing a ramp inside a building to gain momentum and high elevation, allowing them to soar through the air. This can be an impressive and thrilling sight, as skateboarders often attempt to execute complicated airborne maneuvers. Indoor ramps are usually built to provide skateboarders with a controlled environment, away from natural elements such as rain and fluctuating temperatures that could affect their performance. On the other hand, \\"A person riding a scooter down a hill\\" refers to an individual who is using a scooter, another type of wheeled transportation, to descend a slope. Scooters consist of a platform, generally with two wheels (one at the front and one at the back), which a rider stands on while holding a vertical handlebar for balance and control. Unlike skateboarding, scooting is not recognized as an extreme sport and does not typically involve performing tricks or aerial stunts. Instead, scooters are primarily used for transportation or leisurely activities. In this scenario, the person is propelling themselves downhill, taking advantage of the hill's gradient to build momentum as they descend. This could be an enjoyable ride, but it lacks the complexity and daring nature often associated with skateboarding at indoor ramps. In summary, while both phrases involve individuals engaged in activities on wheeled equipment, they represent distinct scenarios with specific variances. The first one, \\"A skateboarder high in the air at an indoor ramp,\\" is illustrative of an adrenaline-packed skateboarding trick performed in a controlled environment. Conversely, the phrase \\"A person riding a scooter down a hill\\" depicts a more casual and recreational activity as someone simply travels downhill on a scooter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: A man is moving fast. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"Yes, if the premise is true, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true. To dissect this scenario further, let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis in detail. Premise: A young man sprinting very quickly. In this premise, we are provided with three key pieces of information: 1. The subject is a young man. 2. He is sprinting. 3. His speed is being described as \\"very quickly.\\" Sprinting refers to the act of running at full or close to full speed over a short distance, and this kind of intense, fast movement is indeed characterized by a swift pace. So, when the premise states that the young man is sprinting very quickly, it conveys that he is moving at a significantly high speed. Hypothesis: A man is moving fast. This hypothesis can be broken down into two main components: 1. The subject is a man. 2. He is moving fast. There is a clear correlation between the premise and the hypothesis, as both refer to a male individual moving at a rapid pace. The premise and hypothesis do have a slight variation regarding the subject's age, with the premise specifically mentioning a \\"young\\" man, while the hypothesis simply refers to a \\"man.\\" However, this variation does not impact the core message shared between the premise and the hypothesis, which is the fast movement. Therefore, if we accept the premise as true - that a young man is indeed sprinting very quickly - then we can also validate the hypothesis that a man is moving fast. Both the hypothesis and the premise revolve around the central concept of a male individual making rapid progress, and the premise, if true, supports the hypothesis in terms of speed and overall motion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Dutch riot police have broken up a rally in support of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hours after a minister was refused entry to the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam.\\"","completion":"Title: Dutch Riot Police Break Up Rally in Support of President Erdogan Introduction: On Saturday evening, Dutch riot police dispersed a crowd gathered in support of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Rotterdam. The incident occurred hours after the Netherlands denied entry to a Turkish minister who was planning to visit the Turkish consulate in the city. The recent event marks yet another tension between Turkey and the countries in the European Union and has implications for diplomatic relations between the nations. Step 1: Provide Background Information on the Incident According to reports, several hundred pro-Erdogan demonstrators had assembled at the Turkish consulate yesterday evening, waving flags and expressing their displeasure at the Dutch government's decision to prevent Turkey's Family Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya from entering the country. Dutch authorities argued that the minister's visit to the consulate could potentially create further tension between the Netherlands and Turkey. Step 2: Detail the Actions of the Dutch Riot Police Responding to the escalating situation, Dutch riot police were dispatched to the location, where they proceeded to employ water cannons, mounted police, and K-9 units to disperse the protesters. As tensions between the demonstrators and security forces intensified, the police arrested several individuals, citing public order and safety concerns. Step 3: Analyze the Broader Diplomatic Implications This conflict between Dutch and Turkish authorities has caused a further rift between the two countries, with President Erdogan denouncing the Netherlands' actions as \\"fascist and a remnant of Nazism.\\" The incident has also soured relations between Turkey and the European Union as a whole. The EU has been critical of Erdogan's administration, particularly in regards to human rights and press freedoms, and this incident may curtail ongoing discussions for Turkey's potential EU membership. Step 4: Discuss the Possible Consequences for Future Diplomatic Relations The current strained relationship between Turkey and the Netherlands may result in long-lasting effects on diplomatic ties between the two nations. Other EU member states are now forced to reevaluate their relationship with Turkey, and the incident could potentially influence the outcome of the upcoming Dutch elections, scheduled for March 15th. Step 5: Conclude the Article In conclusion, the recent event in Rotterdam reflects yet another challenge to the already delicate relationship between Turkey and the EU. The degree to which this will impact negotiations and discussions for Turkey's potential EU membership and relations between both nations remains uncertain. What's clear, however, is that this incident serves as a harsh reminder of the ongoing tensions that must be addressed between Turkey and Europe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For years men have been more likely to shop on the Internet than women, but during the 2004 holiday season, 58 percent of those making online purchases were women. \\"It shows how mainstream the Internet is becoming,\\" said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project group, which carried out the study. Rainie said it was only a matter of time before women shoppers caught up with men. This is because women traditionally make decisions about spending. Users were more likely to shop online to save time. Internet users between the ages 18 and 29 were responsible for some of the most dramatic increase in the online gift-buying population this time around. However, three- quarters of the US Internet users did not buy holiday gifts online in 2004. They worried about credit card security, or just compared online prices with off-line prices, then dashed off to the shops to get the best deals. \\" But even if shoppers don't buy online , websites are becoming promotion tools for stores,\\" said Dan Hess, vice president of ComScore Networks Inc.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1 and question 2 are related, but they are not asking the same thing. Let me provide you with detailed answers to both questions. Question 1: Tax Identification Number: Is there a free database to look up any company's EIN/tax I.D. number? An Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as a Tax Identification Number (TIN), is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to businesses for tax purposes. Companies use their EINs when filing tax returns, opening bank accounts, and conducting various business transactions. To protect the privacy and security of companies, there isn't a comprehensive free database that allows people to look up any company's EIN. However, you may be able to find a company's EIN through public sources or multiple methods, such as: 1. SEC Filings: If the company is a publicly traded corporation, you may find its EIN on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system. 2. Nonprofit Organizations: The IRS maintains a database called the Tax Exempt Organization Search for tax-exempt organizations, including their EINs. 3. Public Documents: Some companies divulge their EIN on public documents, such as annual reports, permit applications, or financial forms. 4. Subscription-based Services: Some private databases, like LexisNexis or Westlaw, allow you to search for EINs but require a subscription to access their services. 5. Requesting from the Company: You can ask the company directly, but they may not be obligated to share their EIN, depending on the purpose it's needed for. It is important to remember that these methods may not cover all companies or may not yield accurate EIN records. Try multiple methods to verify the information. Question 2: Who has a right to know my PA tax number or Federal tax number? Both your Pennsylvania (PA) tax number and your Federal tax number (EIN or TIN) are sensitive pieces of information that should only be disclosed to certain parties for legitimate business or tax-related purposes: 1. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and State Tax Authorities: You are required to share your tax numbers with these government bodies for tax reporting and compliance purposes. 2. Financial Institutions: Banks and other lending institutions may need your tax numbers when opening accounts, applying for loans or credit, or completing transactions. 3. Clients or Customers: If you're operating a business, you may need to provide your tax numbers to clients or customers for invoicing purposes, tax-exempt sales, or related transactions. 4. Vendors, Suppliers, or Contractors: For certain transactions, including payments to contractors or businesses that require tax reporting, you may need to disclose your tax numbers. 5. Organizations and Partnerships: If your business engages in mergers, partnerships, or collaborative ventures, you might need to share these numbers as part of the financial and legal processes. 6. Legal Requirements: In specific situations, courts, attorneys, or other legal professionals may request your tax numbers for dispute resolution, judgments, or as part of a legal process. In general, it is crucial to ensure that sharing your tax numbers is necessary and appropriate before disclosing them. Keep your tax numbers secure and share them only with trusted parties who have a legitimate business or tax-related need to know. In summary, questions 1 and 2 are related, but they are not the same. Question 1 is about finding a database to look up company EINs, while question 2 focuses on who is entitled to know your tax numbers.

It's long been known the surface of Titan, a giant moon orbiting around Saturn, is covered in lakes but now never-before-seen images reveal new clues as to how these lakes may have formed. The shots, taken by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft, were captured as the moon entered its Spring season, meaning the sun was shining down onto its north pole making it possible to capture them for the first time. The near-infrared images show bright spots in the northern part of the lakes, suggesting the surface is unique from the rest of Titan, which. might explain why almost all of the lakes are found in this region. Scroll down for video. Images of the lakes near the north pole of Saturn's moon Titan, pictured, were taken by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft as it entered its Spring season. This shot shows the outline of the different lakes and bright spots seen in the northern part of the land suggest the surface is unique from the rest of Titan. The data also suggests parts of Titan's lakes and seas may have evaporated to leave behind the Titan equivalent of salt flats found on Earth. This evaporated liquid is thought to be made up of chemicals that come from particles in the haze that surrounds Titan that have been dissolved in liquid methane. Titan's lakes, pictured, have distinctive rounded 'cookie-cutter shapes with steep sides'. The data suggests parts of Titan's seas may have evaporated to leave behind salt flats. Titan's lakes have distinctive rounded 'cookie-cutter shapes with steep sides'. The explanations for how the lakes formed range. from the collapse of land following a volcanic eruption to so-called. 'karst' terrain, where liquids on the surface dissolve. soluble bedrock. Although there is one large lake and a. few smaller ones near Titan's south pole, almost all of Titan's lakes surround its north pole. Cassini captured the images during. flybys of Titan on 10 and 26 July and 12 September. These flybys,. coupled with the sunlight shining on the north pole and a lack of clouds. as the moon entered its Spring season gave a much clearer, close-up. view. 'Ever since the lakes and. seas were discovered, we've been wondering why they're concentrated at. high northern latitudes,' said Elizabeth Turtle, a Cassini. imaging team associate based at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics. Laboratory in Maryland. 'Seeing that there's something special about. the surface in this region is a big clue to help narrow down the. possible explanations.' Scientists at Nasa's. Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California study Titan's terrain. using Cassini's visual and. infrared mapping spectrometer. This mosaic, made from near-infrared images of Titan obtained by Cassini's imaging science subsystem, shows a view from the north pole (upper middle of mosaic) down to near the equator at the bottom. Here, the seas and lakes appear as dark shapes, embedded in some kind of bright terrain. Titan. is Saturn's largest moon - with a radius of appropriately 1,600 miles (2,574. kilometers). It's bigger than planet Mercury and is the second-largest. moon in the solar system. The. atmosphere of Titan is largely composed of nitrogen; minor components. lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and nitrogen-rich. organic smog. The climate -. including wind and rain - creates surface features similar to those on. Earth, including dunes, rivers, lakes and seas (probably of liquid. methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather. patterns as on Earth. Launched in 1997, Cassini has been. exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004. On Saturn, a full year is the. equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning Cassini has only been able to. observe a third of a Saturn year. Since 2004, Saturn and its moons have seen the seasons change from. northern winter to northern summer. Cassini revealed that Titan's. surface is shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane (the. main component of natural gas), during its initial flybys. Scientists are interested in Titan because its atmosphere is most like that on Earth. Titan is said to resemble a. frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before oxygen entered the atmosphere. Images taken using this visual and infrared. mapping spectrometer, which turns infrared colours into colours that can. be seen by the human eye, reveal differences in the composition of. material around the. lakes. Yet, until now, they have only been able to capture distant or partial. views of this area. Linda. Spilker, Cassini project scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion. Laboratory in California: 'Titan's northern lakes region is one. of the most Earth-like and intriguing in the solar system. 'We know lakes here change with the. seasons. Now that the sun is shining. in the north and we have these wonderful views, we can begin to compare. the different data sets and tease out what Titan's lakes are doing near. the north pole.' Jia-Rui. Cook, from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory added in a blog post: 'The. exploration of this amazing place is just beginning. Frigid and alien,. yet also remarkably similar to our own planet, Titan is a new world -. revealed before our very eyes by the Cassini and Huygens spacecraft.' Ultracold hydrocarbon lakes and seas (dark shapes) near the north pole of Saturn's moon Titan can be seen embedded in some kind of bright surface material in this infrared mosaic from the Cassini mission.

Let's follow these steps to achieve this: 1. Simplify the equation: The equation we're working with is 35*h + 0 = -35. Since adding 0 to any expression does not change its value, we can simplify the equation by removing the \\"+ 0\\" from it: 35*h = -35 2. Isolate h: Now that the equation is simplified, our next step is to isolate h. Since h is being multiplied by the coefficient of 35, we will need to divide both sides of the equation by 35 to isolate h. We can set up the equation like this: h = -35 / 35 3. Solve for h: Now that h is isolated, we just need to perform the division on the right side of the equation to get our answer: h = -35 / 35 h = -1 So, the solution to the equation 35*h + 0 = -35 is h = -1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach.

Wexford is recuperating from a serious illness, and the book gets good mileage out of this, but right from the start Rendell's writing is uncharacteristically flowery and awkward. More seriously, the plotting is feeble: more than halfway through the book, the rug gets pulled out from under Wexford's investigations (which is fine) but Rendell then takes the story in a direction which feels like an afterthought and the ending has little impact. Is this product review negative? Possible answers: 1). Yes. 2). No. Answer:","completion":"1). Yes. This product review is negative for several reasons.

Furthermore, the use of \\"worst\\" in the title reinforces that this book is considered to be inferior to Rendell's other novels by the reviewer. Thirdly, the reviewer critiques Rendell's writing style, describing it as \\"uncharacteristically flowery and awkward.\\" This critique of the author's prose further supports the negative assessment of the book. Additionally, the reviewer finds the plotting to be \\"feeble,\\" emphasizing their dissatisfaction with the way the story is structured and unfolds. The reviewer also mentions that the story's direction feels like an \\"afterthought\\" and that the ending has \\"little impact.\\" These comments imply that the book failed to engage or satisfy the reader, further validating the negative nature of the review.

Instead of a historic win by their favorite, the huge crowd at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, witnessed a dramatic finish in which Tonalist, ridden by Joel Rosario, overtook Commissioner in his last strides to win by a head. But the fact that none of the top three finishers had raced in both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, the two prerequisites to the Triple Crown, didn't sit well with California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn. Neither","completion":"Once upon a time, in a big horse race called the Belmont Stakes, a strong and fast horse named Tonalist won. This made a lot of people happy, but also a little sad because another horse, named California Chrome, was trying to win a special prize called the Triple Crown. To win the Triple Crown, a horse has to win three important races: the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes. California Chrome had already won the first two races, but because Tonalist won the Belmont Stakes, poor California Chrome didn't get to be the first Triple Crown winner in a very long time – 36 years to be exact. Everybody at the big race in Elmont, New York, got very excited when they saw Tonalist and another horse named Commissioner race towards the finish line. Tonalist, with a jockey named Joel Rosario on his back, managed to run just a little bit faster and crossed the finish line first by only a tiny bit – imagine a horse's head. But one person, Steve Coburn, who owned part of California Chrome, didn't think this was quite fair. He noticed that Tonalist and Commissioner hadn't raced in both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. He thought that maybe if they had, they might have been too tired and California Chrome would have had a better chance to win."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Sam Peters English professional football has been warned it faces a ‘tsunami’ of damaging legal claims that will cripple some clubs if managers continue to over-rule doctors and allow concussed players to play on. In an exclusive interview with the Mail on Sunday, the Football Association’s senior doctor Ian Beasley this week said the NFL’s massive legal settlement with former American Footballers suffering from early on-set dementia linked to head injuries — now in excess of £870million — has set a precedent other sports would be foolish to ignore. The last Premier League season saw an alarming number of incidences where managers ignored team doctors and allowed concussed players to return to play while this summer’s World Cup in Brazil also saw players with head injuries, including Uruguay’s Alvaro Pereira and Germany’s Christoph Kramer, play on. ‘My hope is it translates into meaningful initiatives beyond the first week of the season and that where the","completion":"medical professionals have a concern, the player's welfare is put first and foremost,’ Dr. Beasley said. To ensure the long-term safety of players and to prevent future legal claims, the following steps should be implemented in the world of professional English football: 1. Develop clear guidelines and protocols for managing suspected concussions: The Premier League and the Football Association (FA) should develop and promote comprehensive concussion protocols that outline the assessment, diagnosis, and management of head injuries. These guidelines should be consistent with the best practices and recommendations made by international sports medicine organizations, such as FIFA and the International Olympic Committee. 2. Train and educate players, managers, team doctors, and referees on concussion awareness and management: The FA should mandate regular concussion education for all involved parties to ensure that they understand the signs and symptoms of a concussion, as well as the potential short-term and long-term consequences of playing with a head injury. This education should also emphasize the importance of following established concussion protocols and seeking medical advice before making decisions about returning to play. 3. Encourage transparency and open communication between medical professionals and team management: The FA should be working on creating an environment where team doctors feel empowered to make decisions in the best interest of the player's health, without fearing any backlash or interference from the team management. Managers should be educated on the importance of trusting the medical professionals and giving them the authority to make these decisions. 4. Implement and enforce strict penalties for non-compliance: The FA and the Premier League should establish clear consequences for teams and managers that knowingly disregard concussion protocols or allow players to return to play without proper medical clearance. These penalties should reflect the severity of the infraction and serve as a strong deterrent against future violations. 5. Regularly review and update concussion protocols as new research emerges: The FA and the Premier League should be committed to staying informed on the latest concussion research and make evidence-based updates to their guidelines accordingly. They should also collaborate with other sports leagues and international sports medicine organizations to share and discuss best practices, learn from one another, and create a united front in the fight against concussion-related injuries and their long-term consequences. In taking these steps, English professional football can demonstrate its commitment to player safety and set an example for other sports. Implementing these measures can help to reduce the likelihood of damaging legal claims as well as ensuring the long-term health and well-being of its players. By prioritizing the welfare of its athletes, English football can continue to thrive and protect its reputation as one of the world's most respected sports leagues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In December 2005, the two ton Reclining Figure (1969–70) – insured for £3 million – was lifted by crane from the grounds of the Henry Moore Foundation on to a lorry and has not been recovered. Two men were jailed for a year in 2012 for stealing a sculpture called Sundial (1965) and the bronze plinth of another work, also from the foundation's estate. In October 2013 Standing Figure (1950), one of four Moore pieces in Glenkiln Sculpture Park, estimated to be worth £3 million, was stolen. In 2012, the council of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets announced its plans to sell another version of Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture. Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture at a fraction of its market value to the former London County Council on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed Old Flo, it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997. Tower Hamlets Council later had considered moving Draped Seated Woman to private land in Canary Wharf but instead chose to \\"explore options\\" for a sale. In response to the announcement an open letter was published in The Guardian, signed by Mary Moore, the artist's daughter, by Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery, by filmmaker Danny Boyle, and by artists including Jeremy Deller. The letter said that the sale \\"goes against the spirit of Henry Moore's original sale\\" of the work.

When Cowan Powers and his family recorded their old-time music from 1924-1926, his daughter Orpha Powers was one of the earliest known southern-music artists to record with the mandolin. By the 1930s, single mandolins were becoming more commonly used in southern string band music, most notably by brother duets such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys (Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick) and the more hard-driving Monroe Brothers (Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe). However, the mandolin's modern popularity in country music can be directly traced to one man: Bill Monroe, the father of bluegrass music. After the Monroe Brothers broke up in 1939, Bill Monroe formed his own group, after a brief time called the Blue Grass Boys, and completed the transition of mandolin styles from a \\"parlor\\" sound typical of brother duets to the modern \\"bluegrass\\" style. He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1939 and its powerful clear-channel broadcast signal on WSM-AM spread his style throughout the South, directly inspiring many musicians to take up the mandolin. Monroe famously played Gibson F-5 mandolin, signed and dated July 9, 1923, by Lloyd Loar, chief acoustic engineer at Gibson. The F-5 has since become the most imitated tonally and aesthetically by modern builders.

They are called the Easter Rising and the War of Independence. We will find out which one happened first. Now, imagine a big egg. This egg is special because inside it there are brave people who wanted to make Ireland a better place. This is called the Easter Rising because it happened around Easter time in the year 1916. The people inside the egg were called rebels. They wanted to be free from British rule, and they wanted to have their own country. Now, imagine a superhero who is fighting for freedom. This superhero represents the War of Independence. This war was also about Ireland wanting to be its own country without the British controlling them. It happened between the years 1919 and 1921. Now, let's see which event happened first. We know that the Easter Rising happened in 1916. The War of Independence took place between 1919 and 1921.

Step 2: Consequences In Sentence 1, the consequence of the meeting is that \\"he was summoned to a hangar.\\" In Sentence 2, after the meeting, \\"he was invited to a hangar.\\" Here, the main difference lies in the words \\"summoned\\" and \\"invited.\\" \\"Summoned\\" implies that the person was urgently or authoritatively called to the hangar, whereas \\"invited\\" suggests a more voluntary and friendly calling to the hangar.

Sibilance is what sort of sound?","completion":"Sibilance is a specific type of sound that occurs in speech and music, characterized by a hissing or \\"s\\" like quality. It is created when there is a significant emphasis on the pronunciation of sibilant consonants, which include \\"s,\\" \\"z,\\" \\"sh,\\" \\"zh\\" (as in the word \\"measure\\"), \\"ch\\" (as in the word \\"beach\\"), and \\"j\\" (as in the word \\"jump\\"). The term \\"sibilance\\" is derived from the Latin word \\"sibilare,\\" meaning \\"to hiss.\\" This sound is produced by directing a stream of air with the tongue towards the upper alveolar ridge, located just behind the upper front teeth, or towards the hard palate, the bony roof of the oral cavity. The air then passes between the tongue and the upper teeth or the hard palate, causing the hissing sound that is associated with sibilance. Sibilance is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many languages, including English, and can be found in various words and phrases. The prominence of sibilant sounds in speech can be influenced by factors such as the speaker's accent, dialect, or speaking style. Sometimes, excessive sibilance can be perceived as a speech impediment, known as a lisp, wherein the speaker may have difficulty pronouncing sibilant sounds correctly. In music, sibilance can be both desired and problematic. In some genres, particularly hip-hop, electronic, and pop music, artists may intentionally use sibilant sounds, such as alliteration or assonance, to enhance the overall effect and rhythm of their lyrics. Producers and engineers might also use sibilance to create a distinctive sonic texture within a track. On the other hand, sibilance can also create problems when recording vocals or speech. In a studio setting, microphones can be particularly sensitive to sibilant sounds, leading to an undesirable hissing or harsh quality in the audio recording. This issue is known as \\"sibilance distortion\\" or \\"sibilant distortion.\\" To counteract excessive sibilance, audio engineers often use a combination of proper microphone technique, equalization, and de-essing tools. De-essers are specialized audio processing tools designed to reduce the prominence of sibilance by compressing or cutting the specific frequency range associated with sibilant sounds. In conclusion, sibilance is a type of sound characterized by its hissing or \\"s\\" like quality, primarily resulting from the pronunciation of sibilant consonants. It occurs naturally in speech and can be both artistically advantageous and problematic in music production. The prominence of sibilance is influenced by various factors, and it is essential to understand and manage its presence in both speech and audio recordings for optimal communication and sound quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The White House said Monday that President Donald Trump \\"doesn't believe any of these accusations\\" made by adult film actress Stormy Daniels that she had a one-night affair with the future U.S. leader in 2006 and five years later was threatened to keep quiet about their alleged liaison. Trump spokesman Raj Shah rejected any suggestion that Trump had engaged in wrongdoing because his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, paid the porn star 130,000 from his own funds in hush money shortly before the 2016 presidential election. \\"False charges are settled out of court all the time,\\" said Shah, who faced a barrage of questions from reporters after a lengthy Daniels interview aired Sunday night on 60 Minutes, a CBS News show that drew its biggest ratings in a decade for the spectacle. \\"He's consistently denied these accusations,\\" Shah said of Trump. The spokesman said the 39-year-old Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was \\"inconsistent\\" because she has at various times denied she had a sexual encounter with Trump, but now claims she is telling the truth that she met up with him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. Shah also dismissed Daniels' claim that in 2011, when she was on her way to a fitness class in Las Vegas with her infant daughter, she was approached by a stranger who threatened her. \\"A guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,' \\" Daniels told journalist Anderson Cooper. \\"And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.\\" Trump has yet to comment directly on Daniels' story. However, he posted a Twitter comment Monday that seemed to allude to the controversy. Daniels says the Las Vegas incident occurred shortly after she first tried to sell her story about her encounter with Trump to a tabloid magazine. She said the incident made her fearful for years and that she thought she was doing the right thing when she accepted 130,000 from Trump... Who consistently denied the accusations? - Raj Shah - Donald Trump - Stormy Daniels - not enough information","completion":"The accusations made by adult film actress Stormy Daniels about her alleged affair with Donald Trump in 2006, and subsequent threat in 2011, have been consistently denied by President Donald Trump himself according to White House spokesman, Raj Shah. As the spokesperson for the U.S. President, Shah stood before the press and indicated that Trump \\"doesn't believe any of these accusations.\\" According to Shah, the payment of 130 000 made by Michael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney, to Daniels prior to the 2016 elections was not indicative of any wrongdoing. The spokesperson justified this by saying that \\"False charges are settled out of court all the time,\\" suggesting that it is not uncommon for wealthy individuals like Trump to make such settlements to avoid potentially drawn-out and damaging legal cases. Shah also indicated inconsistencies in the porn star's claims, stating that she had at various times denied having a sexual encounter with Trump. Observing her current claim of telling the truth about the encounter at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada, Shah stated that Daniels' accusations were not trustworthy. Also dismissed by Shah was Daniels' account of being threatened in 2011. The adult film star recalled a terrifying encounter when a stranger allegedly approached her and her infant daughter and told her to 'leave Trump alone.' This claim was rejected by Trump's spokesperson, further emphasizing the White House's stance that Trump does not believe any of the accusations leveled at him by Daniels. While Trump himself did not directly comment on the accusations, he made a Twitter post that seemed to indirectly refer to the issues at hand. The pattern suggests that Trump, through his own statements and those of his spokespeople, has been consistent in denying the accusations made by Stormy Daniels. In conclusion, the individual consistently denying the accusations about an affair with Stormy Daniels in 2006, and subsequent threat in 2011, is President Donald Trump. Though the denial has been voiced chiefly through his spokesperson, Raj Shah, the president's own social media activity aligns with this denial. However, true clarification on the matter would be for Donald Trump to address Daniels' claims directly. Until then, based on the information provided, it is President Donald Trump who has consistently denied the accusations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Facing jail: Emily Fox, 26, pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust. A lesbian PE teacher faces jail today after admitting having sex with a 15-year-old student she taught at a £24,000-a-year private school for girls. Emily Fox, 26, who can be named for the first time, pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust. She met the girl when she taught her at the Royal Masonic School for girls in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. The games teacher taught there for a year. Today, Fox of Bath, Somerset, admitted the charges at St Albans Crown Court. Defence barrister Dee Connelly asked for the case to be adjourned for a pre-sentence report. She said the sentencing guidelines starting point for the offences was four years in jail with a range of three to seven years. Judge Michael Baker QC adjourned sentence until 5 September and granted Fox bail. He said she must now register as a sex offender. He said bail should continue with the condition that Fox does not attend the Royal Masonic School and has no contact with anyone aged under 16. The girl cannot be identified, but Judge Baker lifted a contempt order that had prevented publication of the defendant’s name and the name of the school. The judge said: 'It is clearly in the public interest to identify the school as well as the defendant. It is, to my knowledge, by no means a small school.

The primary focus of these sections is on protecting the visibility within 156 national parks and wilderness areas. Visibility here most likely means the overall air quality and the clarity of the views that these areas offer. The sentence does not mention anything about bird sanctuaries or if the parks happen to have any specific purpose beyond the visibility preservation. Sentence 2: \\"Several of these parks are also bird sanctuaries.\\" This sentence brings up the fact that several of the parks mentioned in the first sentence also serve as bird sanctuaries.

This information is new and not included in the first sentence, implying some additional purpose or uniqueness of the parks beyond the protection of visibility. In summary, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as it introduces a new piece of information that is not mentioned or implied in the first sentence. While both sentences discuss certain aspects of national parks and wilderness areas, their focus differs, with the first sentence addressing the protection of visibility and the second addressing the role of several parks as bird sanctuaries.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: The East India Company drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The Company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to co-operate in arenas outside India: the eviction of the French from Egypt (1799), the capture of Java from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of Penang Island (1786), Singapore (1819) and Malacca (1824), and the defeat of Burma (1826).From its base in India, the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War, and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island, at that time a minor settlement.During the late 18th and early 19th centuries the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the Company. A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the Regulating Act of 1773, Pitt's India Act of 1784 and the Charter Act of 1813 which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired. The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion in 1857, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys, Indian troops under British officers and discipline. The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the Government of India Act 1858, establishing the British Raj, where an appointed governor-general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India.

Select from: (I). olivary tubules; (II). integumentary tubules; (III). intestinal tubules; (IV). malpighian tubules; Q: Q: What are the outpocketings of the digestive tract that remove nitrogenous wastes and function in osmoregulation? A: A:","completion":"The outpocketings of the digestive tract that remove nitrogenous wastes and function in osmoregulation are the Malpighian tubules (option IV). Malpighian tubules are a unique excretory and osmoregulatory system found primarily in insects, arachnids, and some other invertebrates. These tubules extend from the midgut and hindgut junction directly into the insect's blood, called hemolymph, without any filtering mechanism like those found in the excretory organs of vertebrates. The main function of these tubules is to remove nitrogenous waste products, such as uric acid and ammonia, from the hemolymph. As nitrogenous waste can be highly toxic to cells, these tubules are essential for maintaining the overall health and well-being of the organism. In addition to their waste removal function, Malpighian tubules play a crucial role in osmoregulation by regulating the balance of salts and water in the hemolymph. This balance is critical to the survival of invertebrates living in diverse environments, including dry conditions, where water retention is crucial, and freshwater habitats, where appropriate osmotic balance is essential. Insects, for example, need to maintain a stable internal environment to ensure the proper functioning of their cells and organs. The process of osmoregulation and nitrogenous waste removal occurs as the hemolymph is filtered through the walls of the Malpighian tubules. Inside the tubules, nitrogenous waste is combined with potassium ions and water to form a waste product, such as uric acid, which is then precipitated in the tubule lumen. This waste product is carried along the tubule, where further reabsorption of salts and water occurs, concentrating the waste until it is eventually released into the hindgut for excretion through the anus. To summarize, Malpighian tubules are the outpocketings of the digestive tract that are responsible for the removal of nitrogenous wastes and regulation of osmotic balance in insects and some other invertebrates. These tubules play a vital role in maintaining the health and overall functionality of the organisms they are present in."},{"prompt":"Process: - Mix pancake mix with water - Heat a griddle - Pour a circle of batter in the griddle - When most of the bubbles pop on the surface, flip - Cook to desired color - Apply butter, syrup and enjoy - Question: suppose the stove is not regulating temperature correctly happens, how will it affect no bubbles will form.

The reviewer has highlighted several good features of the program such as speaking, writing, and character identification tutorials. Moreover, they express their intention to purchase the next volume of the program, which is a strong indicator of their satisfaction with the product. This would overall increase the chances of me considering buying the product. However, the review does mention a slight drawback; that is, the organization of the program could be improved, as it does not have a whole group of numbers. This critique, though relatively minor compared to the positive aspects mentioned, might decrease the chances slightly, but would still require some additional insight into the importance of this issue for the program’s overall effectiveness in teaching Chinese. In order to make an informed decision, it would be advisable to consider a few more reviews of the product to gauge the overall user experience and satisfaction levels. A balanced perspective would also involve looking at reviews that highlight potential negative aspects and weigh them against the positive ones. This would allow for a better understanding of how the product suits one's individual needs.

Choices: - open meadow - arctic tundra - beach - great outdoors - england The rationale to choose \\"open meadow\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the Choices I will first examine each choice and evaluate its suitability as a fox hunting location. Choice 1: Open Meadow - Foxes are known to hunt in meadows since they provide suitable environments for prey such as small mammals and birds. Choice 2: Arctic Tundra - While foxes like the arctic fox can be found hunting in the tundra, not all species of foxes are adapted to such cold environments. Choice 3: Beach - Foxes are not typically found hunting on beaches, as their primary prey is not abundant in such locations. Choice 4: Great Outdoors - This choice is too broad and vague; it can encompass various environments, including forests, which is not what the question asks for. Choice 5: England - While foxes can be found in England, the country itself does not define a specific environment for fox hunting. Step 2: Eliminate Unsuitable Choices I will now eliminate choices that do not fit the criteria of the question. - Arctic Tundra: Eliminated because not all foxes are adapted to this environment. - Beach: Eliminated because foxes are not typically found hunting on beaches. - Great Outdoors: Eliminated because it is vague and includes disqualified environments. - England: Eliminated because it does not describe a specific hunting environment. Step 3: Determine the Best Choice After eliminating unsuitable options, the only choice left is Open Meadow. This environment is known to be a suitable hunting ground for foxes, as it provides enough prey for them to hunt. Conclusion: The rationale to choose \\"open meadow\\" as the answer is that it is a suitable environment for foxes to hunt when not in a forest, while the other choices contain disqualified environments or do not describe specific hunting habitats."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: This article: (English: \\"Armida abandoned\\") After the rejection of Licori, Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to Armida. Instead, he went to Parma, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma and Margherita de' Medici. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 he was able to tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, to allow her to be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.Carter indicates several structural similarities to Il combattimento; both works require three voices, one of which acts as the narrator. Despite these similarities, Armida abbandonata, unlike the earlier work, is generally considered by scholars of Monteverdi to be an opera, although Denis Stevens, translator of Monteverdi's letters, has termed it a \\"parergon\\" (subsidiary work) to Il Combattimento.Plans for Armida's performance were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo died at the end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio was still asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy... contains an answer for the question: Which works require three voices including a narrator?, what is it ?

The broadcaster’s board came under pressure to review Murdoch’s role as non-executive chairman after his testimony to U.K. lawmakers on July 19 over the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World tabloid was contradicted by two former employees. While the hacking incidents took place before he started overseeing News Corp. (NWSA)’s U.K. newspaper publishing unit in 2007, Murdoch authorized settlements to hacking victims that are now being questioned. The 14-person board also had planned to discuss whether BSkyB will return cash to shareholders, with a share buyback a more likely option than a one-time dividend, one person said yesterday. BSkyB stock dropped 17 percent in seven days before the hacking allegations forced News Corp. to shelve its 7.8 billion-pound (12.7 billion) offer for full control of the U.K. pay-TV company.

Read More James Murdoch’s entanglement in the hacking scandal has raised questions about his future as BSkyB chairman. Close Close Open Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg James Murdoch’s entanglement in the hacking scandal has raised questions about his future as BSkyB chairman. ‘Feeling Bruised’ “Shareholders in the round are feeling bruised after the share price collapse over the last two to three weeks,” said Alex de Groote, an analyst at Panmure Gordon in London. “Realistically there’s not going to be a bid for Sky for the foreseeable future so they want to be compensated for that.” News Corp. is dealing with three probes by police and regulators into phone hacking at the News of the World. At least 10 people have been arrested, including former News International CEO Rebekah Brooks, and ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson, who was Prime Minister David Cameron’s press chief until January. BSkyB’s board meeting took place as New York-based News Corp. separately surveys its biggest shareholders on Murdoch family control, the company’s dual-class stock structure and the independence of its board, according to three people familiar with the matter. Rising Earnings The survey results may be shared with the board, said the people. News Corp.’s goal is to inform and frame shareholder communications, one person said. Sard Verbinnen & Co., the public-relations firm hired to respond to phone-hacking and police bribery allegations at News Corp.’s U.K. newspaper unit, has been conducting the conversations. Some investors were offered to speak with Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey. BSkyB may say tomorrow that earnings before interest and taxes rose 29 percent to 1.05 billion pounds in the year through June, helped by the addition of high-definition TV subscribers, according to the average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The last time BSkyB shares fell more over a seven-day period was in August 2004, when James Murdoch, then chief executive officer, announced an expanded spending plan, a target for more than 10 million subscribers and returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks. Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with News Corp. units in providing financial news and information. News Corp., which owns Fox News and the Wall Street Journal in the U.S., rose 2.5 percent to 16.40 at 12:01 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. New Allegations The News of the World newspaper also targeted a mobile phone it gave to a murdered girl’s mother, a charity she set up said today. Sara Payne’s eight-year-old daughter, Sarah, was murdered in 2000 by a convicted pedophile, leading her to start a campaign to allow parents to find out if sex offenders lived near them. The campaign was supported by the News of the World, which provided Payne with a mobile phone for the next 11 years. Police have now found evidence that suggests Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator who was convicted in 2007 of hacking phones for the News of the World, targeted Payne, Phoenix Chief Advocates, part of the Payne charity, said in a statement on its website. “Sara is absolutely devastated by this news, we’re all deeply disappointed,” the charity said. The scandal at the News Corp. tabloid intensified after the Guardian newspaper reported July 4 that the newspaper hacked into the phone of Milly Dowler, who was murdered in 2002. “These allegations are abhorrent and particularly upsetting as Sara Payne is dear friend,” Brooks, the editor of the News of the World in 2000, said in an e-mailed statement today. “The idea that anyone on the newspaper knew that Sara or the campaign team were targeted by Mr. Mulcaire is unthinkable. The idea of her being targeted is beyond my comprehension.” To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Jonathan Browning at jbrowning9@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net ||||| LONDON (Reuters) - James Murdoch was unanimously confirmed as chairman by BSkyB's board, winning a reprieve from a phone-hacking scandal that threatens to draw him into multiple investigations, two sources briefed on the board meeting told Reuters. Thursday's meeting of the BSkyB board was its first since the crisis forced News Corp to close the News of the World newspaper, drop a 12 billion bid for BSkyB and offer up James and his father Rupert to answer questions in the UK parliament. Several shareholders had demanded he step down to avoid conflicts of interest, fearing contamination from the scandal that acquired new dimensions earlier this month when it was revealed that a murdered schoolgirl had had her phone hacked. One of the sources said: \\"The role of chairman was discussed at some length,\\" and added that the board would be monitoring external developments that might prove relevant to Murdoch's continuing chairmanship. Murdoch did not oversee operations at the News of the World at the time the hacking occurred but did approve large payoffs to victims after he took charge of News Corp's British newspaper operations. He was chief executive of BSkyB before moving to News Corp and is widely considered to have done a good job. On Thursday, a children's charity said the mother of another murdered schoolgirl, who was championed by the News of the World's \\"Sarah's Law\\" anti-pedophile campaign, had been told that her own phone may have been targeted. The Phoenix Foundation, a children's charity that Sara Payne co-founded after her daughter Sarah was killed by a pedophile 11 years ago, said police had found her details on a list seized from an investigator employed by the tabloid. The anti-pedophile campaign was a pet project of then-editor Rebekah Brooks, who was arrested earlier this month. ARC OF A CRISIS The phone-hacking affair is now the subject of three separate investigations in Britain: a criminal police investigation, a parliamentary probe and a judicial inquiry that opened on Thursday. Murdoch's testimony given in parliament last week has already been called into question by two ex-News of the World executives, who say he was aware of evidence that showed the hacking was not limited to a couple of \\"rogue\\" individuals. The now defunct-tabloid's last editor and its chief lawyer said Murdoch had been mistaken when he told parliament he had not been aware of an email containing evidence of hacking when he approved a large payoff to the victim. Murdoch said he stood by his statement, while the chairman of the parliamentary committee in charge of questioning the Murdochs has said he will seek further clarification. Richard Levick, president and CEO of Levick Strategic Communications, who has advised countries and companies on issues including the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay and the recent Wall Street crash, says the crisis is far from over. \\"If you look at the arc of a crisis, their worst days are not yet behind them. It's parallel in many ways to Watergate. Watergate took 18 months to unfold. It appears that this is one of those elongated crises,\\" he told Reuters. The Murdochs face further questions from a judge-led inquiry ordered by Prime Minister David Cameron in response to the public outcry. Cameron's own image has been tarnished by his support for his ex-spokesman Andy Coulson, a former News of the World editor who was arrested earlier this month. Judge Brian Leveson, who prosecuted serial killer Rosemary West in the 1990s, is leading the inquiry into the phone-hacking allegations, media ethics, and the relationship between media organizations, police and politicians. On Thursday, he urged all parties to consider the public interest, not only their own. He has authority to call any party to give evidence under oath to the inquiry, which is planned to take about a year. \\"It may be tempting for a number of people to close ranks and suggest that the problem is or was local to a small group of journalists then operating at the News of the World,\\" he told a news conference in London. \\"I would encourage all to take a wider picture of the public good and help me grapple with the length, width and depth of the problem.\\" SPECIAL DIVIDEND Shareholders in News Corp have called for an overhaul of corporate governance as the crisis spreads. A spokesman for Co-Operative Asset Management, a small investor in both News Corp and BSkyB, said on Thursday: \\"We believe radical reform is needed at both companies but at News Corp in particular, and indeed in the newspaper industry in the UK to stamp out the kind of illegal and grossly invasive practices that are alleged.\\" Thursday's BSkyB board meeting in London took place on the eve of the company's quarterly results announcement. The results are expected to continue a strong run for the company, and investors hope a special dividend will also be announced. The board had said for the last year that it would not be appropriate to consider such a measure while it was a takeover target, and many brokers are stoking hopes of a payout now. Analyst Ian Whittaker of Liberum Capital cautioned, however, that the moment may be too sensitive politically. \\"Given the fast-moving events of the past two weeks, management may feel now is not the right time to announce a special dividend, especially given the potential complications of returning a significant level of cash back to its 39 percent shareholder News Corp,\\" he said. \\"Historically, BSkyB management have emphasized investment over a return of cash back.\\" |||||","completion":"James Murdoch is staying as the chairman of British Sky Broadcasting Group (BSkyB) after a board meeting.

Schneier: The benefits in protecting privacy far outweigh the costs.","completion":"Title: Apple's iPhone Security Update: A Necessary Step Towards Privacy Protection Introduction: In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, ensuring the security and privacy of user data has never been more important. Companies such as Apple have taken measures to protect their customers' information by implementing robust encryption. One such notable instance is Apple recently addressing a serious security vulnerability in the iPhone. Security expert Bruce Schneier believes that while law enforcement may have concerns, these encryption efforts significantly outweigh the costs and provide a greater level of privacy protection. Schneier's Take on the Update: Bruce Schneier, a prominent security expert, applauds Apple for closing a significant security vulnerability in the iPhone, which enabled the company to provide users with stronger encryption. In response to concerns raised by law enforcement, Schneier points out that their apprehension regarding encryption as a major form of protection for criminals is an overreaction. Law Enforcement's Perspective: While it's true that law enforcement agencies often express their worries about encryption, claiming it obstructs their ability to access crucial information to solve cases, Schneier highlights that in reality, these agencies are not significantly hindered by it. He argues that the usefulness of encryption in protecting user privacy far surpasses any limitations it may impose on law enforcement efforts. The Role of Encryption in Privacy Protection: As cybersecurity threats continue to rise in sophistication, encryption plays an increasingly critical role in safeguarding user data. When implemented effectively, it puts up a formidable barrier against unauthorized access and ensures that sensitive information remains confidential. In Apple's case, it means providing their customers with the assurance that their personal data, communications, and transactions are secured from potential breaches. Conclusion: Apple's decision to address the iPhone security vulnerability and opt for stronger encryption hasn't gone unnoticed, as experts like Schneier commend the company for prioritizing user privacy. While law enforcement may continue to express concerns, it's crucial to remember that encryption plays a vital role in both individual privacy and overall digital security. For companies at the forefront of the tech industry like Apple, maintaining robust encryption standards must be a top priority, as the benefits in protecting user privacy far outweigh any perceived costs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Recently, Nestlé has released vintage images of their first ever chocolate Easter eggs, shedding light on the evolution of this beloved confection. These early Easter eggs not only had religious connotations but also paved the way for the future of holiday-themed sweets. Body: In the early days of chocolate Easter eggs, they were considered religious symbols, embodying the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Eggs have long been a symbol of new beginnings, and during the Easter season, they took on a specific Christian meaning. The hatching of a chick represented new life – a fitting metaphor for the resurrection. The first Easter eggs created by Nestlé were made of cardboard, containing chocolates inside. Although the packaging has changed considerably over the years, these cardboard eggs stand as a testament to the company's early commitment to celebrating this religious holiday and delighting its customers with chocolate treats. It wasn't until the 1960s that we began to see branded Easter eggs appear on the market. Products such as Smarties and Aero Easter eggs began to emerge, adding a new twist to the traditional chocolate eggs. These branded versions offered consumers a variety of flavors and styles, catering to different tastes and preferences. Over the years, these religious symbols transformed into the secular treats loved by people all over the world during the Easter season. While we've come a long way from cardboard eggs filled with chocolates, the heart and purpose of these confections remain the same – celebrating new beginnings and sharing joy with loved ones. Conclusion: Nestlé's release of vintage images of their first ever chocolate Easter eggs serves as a reminder of the rich history behind these treats and the significance they held as religious symbols. As we enjoy our chocolate eggs this Easter, we can appreciate the journey from their origins as symbols of the resurrection of Jesus to the diverse and delicious confections they are today. In the midst of modernization, the core idea of new beginnings and the sharing of joy continues to resonate with people around the world, making these chocolate Easter eggs an enduring tradition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stryker, a man as rock-solid as the cliffs against the roaring seas, a man whose strength and resolve were tested time and again in the battlefield, was not immune to the pressures of life. Experience had taught him to hide away the worry lines and soldier on, notwithstanding the internal turmoil that often crashed against the walls of his ironclad resilience like tumultuous waves. The general understood that side of Stryker - the fervent commitment, the steadfast fortitude, the relentless determination in the face of odds that would break the average man. Yet, he also recognized that even the strongest steel, when under unrelenting stress, would develop cracks over time. Even so, Stryker maintained a demeanor of calm and calculation, wearing his power and self-possession like a coat of armor. It was because of that unwavering disposition that the occasional emergence of anxiety in his eyes, particularly over women, had been strikingly noticeable. Intriguingly though, the general had not witnessed such anxiety for quite some time, until the arrival of Candace. Candace, with her fiery spirit and captivating charm, seemed to cut right through Stryker. She was not like many women that Stryker had encountered in his life. She was tenacious, her indomitable spirit matching his own in its intensity. The challenge that she offered was not merely of a romantic nature, but something deeper, something that made Stryker question things that he thought he had figured out. The general felt that having to deal with Candace might be a good thing for Stryker. She has the potential to give him a fresh perspective, to help him unwind the tight coil of stress that was constantly wound up inside him. The general believed that confronting and dealing with this new emotional challenge could relieve some of the burdens that seemed to constantly hang over Stryker's shoulders, much like his own family did. The general often attributed his own balance and sanity to the love and support of his family. They were his solid ground, his soft landing in a world fraught with danger and unpredictability. His wife, children, and grandchildren gave him a sense of fulfillment and purpose that went beyond his responsibilities and obligations. They reminded him of why he fights, why it matters - they were his bastion of hope and his refuge from the battering storms. For Stryker, Candace could become that beacon. She might just be the element that brings new life to his stressful being, much like a breath of fresh air invigorating a weary soul. Despite the layers of hardness that years of stress and combat had encased him in, the general saw within his comrade a heart – one that needed more than just an adrenaline rush to keep pumping. The general held on to a hope that for Stryker, dealing with Candace could become a transformative experience, an avenue for his spirit to find the equilibrium it deserved. Even for a man as solid as Stryker, the General knew, the essence of life wasn't just in its endurance, but also in its celebration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: - A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The last step in the process of a red giant's life cycle, after the outer layers have been shed and only the inner core remains, is the formation of a white dwarf. A white dwarf is a compact stellar remnant, typically composed mostly of carbon and oxygen. This highly dense object is the final stage of a low- to intermediate-mass star's life, such as our Sun or the red giant we are considering in your question. The process leading to the formation of a white dwarf involves several steps: 1. As the red giant's core can no longer sustain nuclear fusion, the core starts contracting due to the influence of gravity. Meanwhile, the outer layers expand and eventually get ejected as a planetary nebula. A planetary nebula is an expanding cloud of ionized gas and dust, which is illuminated by the residual ultraviolet radiation from the exposed hot core. 2. The contraction of the core is halted when it reaches a state known as electron degeneracy. In this state, the electrons within the core are so densely packed that they create a pressure that opposes further contraction. This balance of gravitational pull and electron degeneracy pressure stabilizes the core and forms the white dwarf. 3. The white dwarf has a high surface temperature initially, radiating its leftover heat into space. However, as it no longer has any source of energy generation, the white dwarf will gradually cool down over an immensely long period, on the order of billions of years. 4. Eventually, as the white dwarf cools and its thermal radiation fades, it will reach a state where it no longer emits significant amounts of energy. At this point, it becomes a black dwarf—a cold, dark, and essentially dead stellar remnant. However, it is important to note that, given the age of the Universe (around 13.8 billion years), no black dwarfs are expected to exist yet, as even the oldest white dwarfs have not had enough time to cool down to that stage. In summary, the last step of the process you've described, after the outer layers of a red giant have been shed and only the inner core remains, is the formation of a white dwarf. This dense object, composed primarily of carbon and oxygen, will slowly cool over billions of years until it eventually turns into a black dwarf."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the UK a binary system of higher education emerged consisting of universities (research orientation) and Polytechnics (engineering and applied science and professional practice orientation). Polytechnics offered university equivalent degrees from bachelor's, master's and PhD that were validated and governed at the national level by the independent UK Council for National Academic Awards. In 1992 UK Polytechnics were designated as universities which meant they could award their own degrees. The CNAA was disbanded.

(CNN) -- As the forklift trucks packed up the motorhomes and emptied the garages at Interlagos in Brazil, it did not take very long for the inevitable question to be asked - just how good a driver is Sebastian Vettel? Sunday's race confirmed Vettel as just the ninth driver in the sport's 62-year history to win three world titles, joining greats Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher as the only racers to triumph in three consecutive seasons. However, what is telling -- given Vettel is still only 25 -- was the somewhat circumspect response from three world champions and former McLaren race-winner John Watson when asked to assess the Red Bull driver's talents and his place in history. \\"To drive on the limit and win races is the same challenge, but today OPTIONS: - Ayrton Senna is much safer.\\" - Brazil is much safer.\\" - CNN is much safer.\\" - Formula One is much safer.\\" - Interlagos is much safer.\\" - John Watson is much safer.\\" - Juan Manuel Fangio is much safer.\\" - McLaren is much safer.\\" - Michael Schumacher is much safer.\\" - Red Bull is much safer.\\" - Sebastian Vettel is much safer.\\" - Vettel is much safer.\\"","completion":"- Formula One is much safer.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The most common cause of acute encephalitis in the United States is viral infections, especially herpes simplex virus (HSV). Herpes simplex virus has two types: HSV-1, often referred to as oral herpes responsible for cold sores and fever blisters, and HSV-2, usually the cause of genital herpes. It's typically HSV-1 that's associated with viral encephalitis. Known as herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), this type is regarded as the most common form of severe sporadic (nonepidemic) encephalitis in the U.S. HSE is a medical emergency requiring hospitalization. The virus targets the temporal lobe of the brain, which can result in seizures, cognitive deficits, and in severe cases can lead to mortality or leave a person in a vegetative state. Early diagnosis and administration of antiviral drugs can significantly improve outcomes for patients. Another notable cause is arboviruses, which are typically transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes or ticks. The most common types of these in the U.S. include the West Nile virus, La Crosse (LAC) encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), and Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). It's also necessary to mention that while viral infection is the most common cause, encephalitis can also arise from bacterial infections, parasitic infections, noninfectious inflammatory conditions like autoimmune encephalitis, and can also be a rare complication of certain vaccinations. Recognizing encephalitis and determining its cause can be challenging as the symptoms often resemble those of other illnesses, such as meningitis or influenza. Symptoms can range from mild (fever, headache, lethargy) to severe (seizures, confusion, disordered thought processes), depending upon the part of the brain affected. While anyone can get encephalitis, those at higher risk include the very young, the elderly, those with a weakened immune system, and those who live or travel in areas where vector-borne diseases are common. Preventive measures depend on the cause. With HSV, avoiding direct contact with cold sores can help prevent infection. For arbovirus-borne forms of encephalitis, strategies include using insect repellent and wearing long-sleeves and pants in areas where these diseases are common. For other non-viral forms, early identification and treatment of the underlying cause is crucial. Vaccination when available is also tremendously effective. For example, the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine has dramatically reduced the incidence of encephalitis from these diseases in the United States. In conclusion, while there are various causes for acute encephalitis, HSV is the most common in the United States, but other viral infections and causes deserve consideration depending on the context and setting. A multifaceted approach including early detection, prompt treatment, and appropriate preventative measures is key to reducing the impact of this condition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Foreign criminals and illegal immigrants have pocketed almost £17million in compensation for being locked up for too long while officials fight to deport them, it has been revealed. Sex offenders, robbers and drug dealers who are not supposed to be in Britain have been paid huge sums of taxpayers’ money because they were wrongly detained by the Home Office. In a slap in the face to the British public, at least 229 offenders were among more than 480 individuals handed controversial payouts for being unlawfully held under immigration powers in the past four years. Foreign criminals and illegal immigrants have pocketed almost £17million in compensation for being locked up for too long while officials fight to deport them, it has been revealed. Even though Home Secretary Theresa May wanted them removed from the UK, hundreds sued, claiming their human right to liberty had been breached. Last night MPs and campaigners condemned the cost to the public purse and said judges who awarded the vast payments, averaging around £25,000, were making a mockery of the justice system. Conservative MP Michael Ellis, who sits of the Commons’ home affairs committee, said: ‘No wonder people think the law is an ass. To hear of some cases where dangerous criminals have been given large amounts of money is tantamount to a perversion of the justice system. People will be appalled.’ Even though Home Secretary Theresa May (left) wanted them removed from the UK, hundredsof offenders have claimed their human right to liberty was breached. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire (right) has revealed that £4.8million in 2013-14 was paid out last year. Unlawful: Nemah Shehadeh was held for a year. Nemah Shehadeh was awarded £36,000 after being held following an attempt to deport her to Jordan. The deportation failed in January 2008 when she claimed to be a Palestinian. A judge at the Court of Session in Edinburgh ruled that the then 58-year-old was unlawfully detained for one year from August 2008. She was originally issued with a six-month visitor visa to come to Britain on the basis that she was a Jordanian citizen. She arrived in August 2002 but overstayed. She was arrested in 2005 at Heathrow with a son when they were attempting to use false French passports to travel to Canada, and subsequently sentenced to four months imprisonment with a recommendation for deportation. After the failed bid to deport her to Jordan, the Home Office placed her in detention while her case was for release considered – with rigorous reporting restrictions. Judges agreed this was unlawful and ordered compensation. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire revealed that £4.5million was paid out in 2011-12, £5million in 2012-13, £4.8million in 2013-14 and £2.1million so far in the year to September. That amounts to £16.4million compensation. Of this, at least £6.2million was awarded to 229 criminals who had been unlawfully detained while waiting to be booted out of the country after finishing prison sentences – roughly £27,000 per offender. The UK does not specify how long people can be kept in immigration detention before deportation, with Home Office guidance saying it should not extend beyond a ‘reasonable period’. But some cases involve illegal immigrants who refuse to reveal where they are from so the authorities have to waste time trying to locate their homelands. Others put in multiple appeals or asylum claims over several years to try to ‘frustrate’ attempts to remove them, said Mandie Campbell, the director general of Immigration Enforcement at the Home Office. Many cases also involve criminals who the Home Office do not want to release amid concerns they are a risk of committing more crimes or absconding. In one instance, Joseph Mjemer – branded a ‘one-man crime wave’ – was jailed for two years just a year after winning £17,360 compensation for being unlawfully detained while awaiting deportation. He used at least five aliases and claimed to be from four countries. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance pressure group, said payouts could be avoided if Home Office staff were more efficient. ‘Taxpayers will be furious that their cash is being wasted thanks to Home Office bungling,’ he said. ‘Unlawful detention doesn’t just hurt those who are kept under lock and key, but costs an extraordinary amount. The authorities must do a better job.’ Former coalition minister Sarah Teather, who uncovered the figures, accused the Home Office of treating people inhumanely and costing the taxpayer millions. ‘It appears that the Home Office would sometimes rather detain people indefinitely than treat them humanely, even if this ends up costing the taxpayer millions of pounds,’ said the Lib Dem MP. ‘But these figures shouldn’t obscure the considerable emotional and mental cost that not knowing how long you might be detained for, or if you’re going to be deported tomorrow, or moved hundreds of miles away to a different detention centre, has on detainees.’ The UK made the second-highest use of detention for asylum seekers in Europe in 2013, with more than 30,000 asylum seekers spending some time in detention. Some who have been paid compensation have subsequently been deported, while others remain in the UK. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1. Foreign criminals and illegal immigrants in the UK have received around £17 million in compensation for being detained for too long while authorities attempted to deport them. 2. Over the past four years, more than 480 individuals were handed payouts for being unlawfully held under immigration powers. 3.

Translate this to English?","completion":"\\"Back in the day, we grudgingly accepted the existence of nuclear weapons due to their deterrent effect.\\" Let's delve a bit deeper into this sentence: 'The existence of nuclear weapons' refers to the creation and maintenance of a nuclear arsenal. The nuclear weapon, a product of 20th-century warfare, is a device capable of a high level of destruction and loss of life due to its nuclear reactions. The first and the only instances of nuclear weaponry in combat were the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II by the United States. 'We grudgingly accepted' suggests a reluctant approval or acceptance of a situation or fact that makes one uncomfortable or goes against one's ethics, beliefs, or desires. In this context, it implies that the speaker might have been morally or ethically displeased with the idea of nuclear weapons, however, recognizing their role in the global political and military scenario, they had to reluctantly accept their existence. The phrase, 'due to their deterrent effect,' highlights the reason behind this reluctant acceptance. The deterrent effect of nuclear weapons is mainly the theory known as 'Mutually Assured Destruction' (MAD), where two or more nations possess enough nuclear firepower to destroy each other completely. It's a form of Nash Equilibrium where no player(in this case, a nation) has anything to gain by unilaterally changing its strategy. And thus, theoretically, every player continues to stick to its strategy of not engaging in nuclear warfare, preventing the use of nuclear weapons and hence ensuing destruction, despite having nuclear arsenal at their disposal. To sum it up, the statement reflects on the moral and ethical dilemma surrounding the existence of nuclear weapons and the reluctant acceptance of the same driven by its potential as a preventive measure against nuclear warfare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first question is asking if it is \\"good\\" to give up on life. Whether something is \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" is a subjective judgment and varies largely based on one's morals, beliefs, and societal values. However, if we interpret \\"good\\" in terms of constructive or beneficial outcome, then it is generally agreed upon by the majority that giving up on life doesn't lead to a beneficial or constructive result. Hence, for Question 1, the answer picked would be \\"no\\". The second question asks if it is \\"okay\\" to give up on life. This question also implies a moral judgment. In this context, \\"okay\\" could be interpreted similarly to \\"acceptable\\". Given that living life to its fullest is a common societal value and aim, giving up on life is generally viewed as not acceptable. So for Question 2, the answer picked would also be \\"no\\". Based on this logic, yes, the answer to these two questions would be the same, as neither question suggests a position that aligns with societal norms or constructive outcomes.

He touched on Get Out: \\"None other than President Trump called Get Out the best first three-quarters of a movie.\\" He addressed Call Me By Your Name: \\"We don't make films like Call Me By Your Name to make money. We make them to upset Mike Pence.\\" And, yes, he talked about Harvey Weinstein, pointing out that the Academy gave him the same punishment as a member who shared screeners. But his best joke had to have been about The Shape of Water, when he said this was \\"The year men screwed up so badly women started dating fish.\\" Most importantly, he encouraged everyone who went on stage to use that microphone as a platform to talk about equality or politics. Read Kimmel's full opening monologue below: Hi. Welcome. Welcome, beautiful people. Welcome to the Dolby theatre and greetings to our viewers all around the world. Thank you for watching. Thank you very having me. It is a great honor to be invited back for a second time. It's a great honor to be here among so many talented women and men. Congratulations to all of you. We're at the Oscars. Some of you will be going home tonight with an Academy Award. What could be better than that? Nothing, right? Oh. I do want to mention. This year, when you hear your name called, don't get up right away. Give us a minute. We don't want another thing. What happened last year was unfortunate, I've not told the story in public because I wanted to save it for tonight, but here's what happened. This is true. Last year, about a week before the show, the producers asked me if I wanted to do some comedy with the accountants, I said, no, I don't want to do that. So, the accountants went ahead and did comedy on their own. And I have to hand it to them, it was hilarious, but it won't happen again. This time, the chairman of Pricewaterhousecoopers said, and I quote, “Our singular focus will be on the show and delivering the correct envelopes,” which is—does make sense? Just out of curiosity, what was your focus the other 89 years? I'm hopeful that things will go smoothly tonight. We can't ruin this one. This is a special year. This is a big one. These are the 90th Academy Awards. This is history happening right here. Our friend Oscar—Oscar is 90 years old tonight, which means he's probably at home right now watching Fox News. Of course—no, Oscar is here with us. After all the years, after all the awards given for achievements in show business, Oscar is still number one. No question about it. Oscar is the most beloved and respected man in Hollywood. And there's a very good reason why. Just look at him. Keeps his hands where you can see them. Never says a rude word. And most importantly, no penis at all. He is literal little a statute of limitations. And that's the kind of men we need more of in this town. Here's how clueless Hollywood is about women. We made a movie called What Women Want and it starred Mel Gibson. Kind of all you need to know. The Academy as you are no doubt aware took action last year to expel Harvey Weinstein from their ranks. There were a lot of great nominees, but Harvey deserved it the most. The Academy kicked him out and after they did, I was curious, so, I looked it up. You know the only other person to be expelled from the Academy, ever, was a character actor. He was kicked out for sharing screeners. He got the same punishment as Harvey Weinstein for giving his neighbor a copy of Seabiscuit on VHS. But what happened with Harvey, what's happening all over was long overdue. We can't let bad behavior slide anymore. The world is watching us. We need to set an example. And the truth is, if we are successful here, if we can work together to stop sexual harassment in the workplace, if we can do that, women will only have to deal with harassment all the time at every other place they go. Over the course of this evening, I hope you will listen to many brave and outspoken supporters of movements like me too and time's up and never again, because what they're doing is important. Things are changing for the better, they're making sure of that. It is positive change. This is a night for positivity and our plan is to shine a light on a group of outstanding and inspiring films, each and every one of which got crushed by Black Panther this weekend. Which, that's—that's okay. The success of Black Panther is one of many positive stories this year. Especially for African-Americans and Bob Iger. Black Panther and Wonder Woman were massive hits. I remember a time when the major studios didn't believe a woman or a minority could open a superhero movie and the reason I remember that time was because it was March of last year. But this year, we have a lot to celebrate. Ceilings have been shattered. We have our first ever female nominee for cinematography. Which is historic. So many of tonight's nominees are making history, and, in fact, if you are a nominee tonight who isn't making history, shame on you. Greta Gerwig is the first woman to be nominated for director in eight years. And that's important. Only 11% of movies are directed by women. And that is nuts. We still have a very long way to go in that department, and a very long way to go when it comes to equal pay. Especially when you look at what happened with Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams. We all know the story. Mark Wahlberg was paid 1.5 million to reshoot his scenes while Michelle Williams for he reshoots got per diem. The chef was paid 80 a day for the same thing. And what made it especially unfair is that Mark and Michelle are represented by the same agency. And I have to admit, this story really surprised me. This one shook me, because if we can't trust agents, who can we trust? To his credit, Mark Wahlberg announced he would be donating all 1.5 million to the time's up legal defense fund. That's right. So, I guess now the ball's in your court, Michelle. What are you going to do with that 80 bucks? In the meantime, triple congratulations are in order for the kid from Comedy Central, Jordan Peele, who had a huge success with his movie, Get Out. Jordan is only the third person in 90 years to be nominated for directing, writing and best picture for his debut film. And what a debut it was. None other than President Trump called Get Out the best first three-quarters of a movie this year. Margot Robbie had a great year. She scored her first nomination for her portrayal of Tonya Harding in I, Tonya and was terrific. Whose kneecaps did Tonya Harding have to break to get this dream casting? Because, I mean, if they made a movie about my life, best case see fair owe, I'd be played by Jim Belushi. Another young actor nominated for the first time is Timothee Chalamet, who looks very dashing tonight. Look at that tux. Are you having fun? This is a big deal. He's missing Paw Patrol to be here tonight. Don't worry, Ryder and his team of pups saved the day. He's the star of a small but powerful story Call Me By Your Name. Only two of the best picture movies made more than 100 million. That's not the point. We don't make films for money. We make them to upset Mike Pence. Right? He's the youngest best actor nominee in almost 80 years, and on the other end of the abacus, we have our oldest acting nominee ever, the magnificent Christopher Plummer is 88 years old and still going strong. Maybe this is not the place, but I want to ask you, how does Lin-Manuel Miranda compare to the real Alexander Hamilton? And once again, right here in the front row, maybe the greatest actor of all time, Meryl Streep is here with us. She earned her 21st Oscar nomination. Her film career started in 1977. The longest she ever went without being nominated was from 1992 to 1995. And that's only because those were the years she was in prison, and that, I think, is amazing. The most nominated movie tonight, a film that's up for 13 Oscars is The Shape of Water, written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, a wonderful man. Congratulations, I'm very happy for Guillermo. You made a beautiful movie, and thanks to Guillermo we will always remember this year as the year men screwed up so badly, women started dating fish. Okay, before we start handing out the awards, some history, because we're going to do things a little bit differently. The first Oscar ceremony lasted, and this is true, 15 minutes. From beginning to end. People still complained. So, if you do win an Oscar tonight, we want you to give a speech, we want you to say whatever you feel needs to be said, speak from the heart, we want passion; you have an opportunity and a platform to remind millions of people about important things like equal rights and equal treatment, if you want to encourage others to join the amazing students at Parkland at their march on the 24th, do that. If you want to thank a favorite teacher, do that. Or maybe you just want to thank your parents, tell your kids to go to sleep. What you say is entirely up to you. Do whatever you want. But with that said, this is a really long show. So, here's what we're going to do: Not saying you shouldn't give a long speech, but whoever gives the shortest speech tonight will go home with a brand new jet ski! Why waste precious time thanking your mom when you could be taking her for the ride of her life on a brand new jet ski? This is not a joke. I will be timing you. I have a stopwatch. The moment you are handed that Oscar, the clock will start ticking, so, get up here, grab it and go. And in the unlikely event of a tie, I need to say, the jet ski will be awarded to Christopher Plummer, so—let's get the show going. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Jimmy Kimmel hosted the 90th annual Academy Awards at Hollywood & Highland Center's Dolby Theatre for the second consecutive year, where he poked fun at last year's wrong best picture winner announcement, called out Harvey Weinstein, and addressed Hollywood's issues with equal pay and sexual harassment in the workplace.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Why do Jehovah's witnesses go house to house?\\" Context: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses are perhaps best known for their efforts to spread their beliefs, most notably by visiting people from house to house, distributing literature published by the Watch Tower Society in 700 languages. The objective is to start a regular \\"Bible study\\" with any person who is not already a member, with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group; Witnesses are advised to consider discontinuing Bible studies with students who show no interest in becoming members. Witnesses are taught they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching. They are instructed to devote as much time as possible to their ministry and are required to submit an individual monthly \\"Field Service Report\\". Baptized members who fail to report a month of preaching are termed \\"irregular\\" and may be counseled by elders; those who do not submit reports for six consecutive months are termed \\"inactive\\".\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Jehovah's Witnesses go house to house for several reasons: 1. Spreading their beliefs: The primary reason Jehovah's Witnesses go house to house is to share their faith and religious beliefs. They aim to reach as many people as possible, educating them about the teachings of Jehovah and the Bible. By going door to door, they can directly engage with individuals, answer questions, and provide resources to help people understand their beliefs. 2. Fulfilling a biblical command: Jehovah's Witnesses believe that they are following Jesus' command to his disciples, as mentioned in Matthew 28:19-20 and Acts 1:8. They view public preaching and spreading the word of God as a vital part of their mission and religious duties. 3. Establishing Bible studies: Another goal of their house-to-house ministry is to initiate regular Bible studies with people who are not already members of their faith. They hope that through studying the Bible together, these individuals will develop a deeper understanding of Jehovah's teachings and eventually choose to become baptized members of the Jehovah's Witnesses community. 4. Maintaining an active ministry: Jehovah's Witnesses are expected to devote as much time as possible to their ministry. Each member must submit a monthly \\"Field Service Report,\\" documenting their efforts in spreading the word of God. This report allows the organization to track the progress of individual members and ensure that they remain active and engaged in their missionary work. 5. Providing support and encouragement: By visiting people in their homes, Jehovah's Witnesses can offer a personal connection and support to those who are interested in their faith. They can address specific concerns, provide guidance, and help people navigate their spiritual journey. In summary, Jehovah's Witnesses go house to house as a way to spread their beliefs, fulfill a biblical command, establish Bible studies, maintain an active ministry, and provide support and encouragement to those they encounter. This approach allows them to engage with a wide range of people and reinforce their commitment to sharing their faith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph: Air in the troposphere is warmer closer to Earth’s surface. Warm air is less dense than cool air, so it rises higher in the troposphere. This starts a convection cell. Convection mixes the air in the troposphere. Rising air is also a main cause of weather. All of Earth’s weather takes place in the troposphere. Q: Why does warm air rise higher in the troposphere? A: Choose your answer from: * it is more dense than cool air * It contains hydrogen * it is less flourishing than cool air * it is less dense than cool air Answer:","completion":"it is less dense than cool air Warm air rises higher in the troposphere because it is less dense than cool air. When air is heated, the molecules in the air gain energy and move faster and farther apart from each other. This causes the warm air to expand and become less dense than the surrounding cool air. Due to buoyancy, the warm air then rises, causing vertical movement and creating a convection cell. The convection cell is vital for the distribution of heat and the formation of weather patterns in the troposphere. As the warm air rises and cools, it eventually sinks back down to the surface, creating a continuous cycle of air movement. This process helps to mix the air in the troposphere and plays a significant role in the development of various weather phenomena. In summary, warm air rises higher in the troposphere because it is less dense than cool air. This difference in density is due to the expanded state of warm air caused by the increased energy levels and movement of its molecules. This process contributes to the establishment of convection cells and the overall behavior of weather patterns in the Earth's troposphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A. getting arrested B. throw up C. staggering D. fall down E. explode The best answer is Answer:","completion":"B. throw up When a person consumes alcohol, their body can only process and metabolize a certain amount at a given time. In general, the liver can metabolize approximately one standard drink (which contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol) per hour. A standard drink can be a 12-ounce beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, or a 1.5-ounce shot of distilled spirits. However, this rate may vary depending on factors such as the individual's size, weight, sex, and overall health. If a person drinks alcohol faster than their liver can metabolize it, the excess alcohol will circulate throughout their bloodstream, leading to increased intoxication and potentially causing symptoms like slurred speech, impaired coordination, and unsteady gait (staggering). When the body detects a high level of alcohol in the system, it activates its protective mechanisms to eliminate the potential toxin. One of these mechanisms is to induce vomiting, which helps to expel the unabsorbed alcohol from the stomach and prevent further absorption into the bloodstream. So, the best answer is B. throw up. If a person drinks too much alcohol too quickly, their stomach may respond by making them throw up in order to reduce the toxicity load and protect the body from potential harm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One day, the henchmen of a local gangster boss named Torsillo come ashore in Amantido to initiate the construction of a banana processing plant. Of course, Joe (in typical direct-approach manner) evicts the goons, who promptly return to their boss. Torsillo finds out that Joe is trading bananas without a license and decides to exploit it. Upon his next delivery, Joe is apprehended by the police and given the choice of either acquiring a legal license or getting his boat impounded and himself arrested for illegal shipment. Joe travels to the nearest city, which to him is a new world, as he grew up in the rainforest. Unfamiliar with city life and only marginally literate, he falls prey to a con man named Manuel, who has a gift of the gab which has placed him in favor in several high positions, even with the country's President for his help in developing a remedy for a genetic defect in the Presidential family. Eventually Joe meets Dorianne, an attractive singer, in a bar owned by Torsillo, where he gets a temporary job as a bouncer. Torsillo also runs into Joe personally time and again, and after having seen Joe easily finishing off five of his toughest goons, the gangster boss has taken to jumping out of the next window in a panic the instant he lays an eye on Joe.

Football uses a rectangular field (Canadian football fields are larger than American ones), while baseball is played on a diamond and large outfield. This requires a particular design to accommodate both, usually an oval. While building stadiums in this way means that sports teams and governments can share costs, it also imposes some challenges. - Mandala Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Jayapura , Papua Province , Indonesia .

Two hundred years after it was beaten at Waterloo, France has suffered a fresh defeat over how to commemorate the great battle’s bicentenary. The row began earlier this year when Belgium minted 175,000 €2 coins decorated with images of the battle that ended Napoleon’s hopes of supremacy in Europe. France objected, saying the coins appeared to run against the spirit of European unity, and effectively vetoed them as EU-wide tender. While grumbling that the eurozone had much more serious problems to worry about — such as a possible Greek exit — Brussels acquiesced and melted them down. But this week Belgium resorted to a cunning ruse de guerre to outflank the French: it minted €2.50 and €10 coins which can only be used on its own territory. “We had a little problem with our French neighbours, for whom the battle seems to still be very sensitive today. We judged that it wouldn’t be worth having a diplomatic incident over,” Johan Van Overtveldt, Belgium’s finance minister told RTL television, explaining the decision to produce the novel denominations. French sensitivities over a battle that changed the course of European history are also evident in the line-up of guests at events to mark the bicentenary, which will take place from June 18. While the Belgians, Dutch and British are sending members of their royal families, France has instead opted for a “high representative”. The Belgian coins are technically legal tender, but their high pricetag means they are essentially collectors’ items. The €2.5 coins cost €6 each, and the €10 one €42. While shops would be under no obligation to accept them, Belgium’s Royal Mint said that they could always be exchanged at face value at the central bank. The €2.5 coin shows the Lion’s Mound, the most distinctive landmark on the battlefield south of Brussels, with an illustration of battle formations below. We had a little problem with our French neighbours, for whom the battle seems to still be very sensitive today. - Johan Van Overtveldt, Belgian finance minister The €10 sports a silhouette of Napoleon and two key scenes from the battle: the Duke of Wellington receiving news that relief from the Prussian army was on its way, and William, Prince of Orange, being wounded in the shoulder. Apart from the historic significance, Belgium is using the interest in Waterloo to generate tourism in French-speaking Wallonia, which currently attracts only a third of the tourists as Dutch-speaking Flanders, famous for Bruges and for its first world war battlefields. ||||| For France, it's Waterloo all over again. Belgium is issuing a new euro coin to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo -- one of the most painful defeats in French military history. The French government does not like it at all. Paris objected when Belgium first unveiled its plan for a new 2 euro coin in February, arguing that it could \\"cause an adverse reaction in France\\" at a time when the eurozone needs to stand together. Eurozone countries need the agreement of their partners to issue new coins. So Belgium set about destroying 180,000 coins it had already minted. But France's much smaller neighbor has now used a little-known clause in European law that allows countries to issue commemorative coins in non-standard values. The result: A 2.50 euro coin commemorating the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. \\"The French protest led to the choice of a value that is not common in the eurozone,\\" the Belgian finance ministry said in a statement. \\"This is the first Belgian coin with such a nominal value.\\" France was reassured that the new coin will only be used in Belgium, but that did not stop French media calling the spat \\"a new Waterloo.\\" Related: Napoleon's hat sells for 2.4 million Waterloo is a small town a few miles south of the Belgian capital Brussels and about 50 miles from the French border. The battle marked the final defeat of Napoleon, and the end of 23 years of wars between France and the rest of Europe. An estimated 12,000 people were killed and 35,000 wounded that day. It overturned Belgium's annexation by France -- ultimately leading to independence from the Netherlands in 1830 -- and brought an end to a period of unmatched French influence over the continent. The new 2.50 coin depicts the position of troops on the battlefield and is being sold online for 6 euros. A large 10 euro silver coin is also available for 42 euros. Related: This 2.50 coin just sold for 2.4 million ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Belgium, commemorating the bicentenary of the Battle of Waterloo, initially minted 175,000 €2 coins with images depicting the historic battle.

However, Belgium later circumvented this by minting €2.50 and €10 coins which can only be used within its territory. These coins, essentially collectors’ items due to their high price tags, depict various battle scenes and landmarks. France has been sensitive towards these commemorations, reflecting on their historic defeat in battle. This is part of Belgium's strategy to boost tourism in Wallonia, a French-speaking region that currently attracts fewer tourists than the Dutch-speaking Flanders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(July 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Teresa \\"Terry\\" Doolittle (Whoopi Goldberg) transfers funds for the First National Bank in Manhattan, New York. She does not quite fit with the bank's corporate image, despite being a good employee and well-liked by her co-workers. She is often chastised by her no-nonsense boss James Page (Peter Michael Goetz). Set against the backdrop of the pre-Glasnost Cold War, Terry receives the message, \\"Knock, Knock,\\" and is contacted by a man calling himself \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" who turns out to be a British Intelligence agent in Eastern Europe who is being pursued by the KGB. After being given a riddle for his password, Terry determines the password to be B-flat, after the key in which \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" is supposedly written (as the actual song by the Rolling Stones is recorded in the key of B-flat). Jack sends her to the British Consulate to deliver the message \\"Dog's barking, can't fly without umbrella\\" to Department C. Despite feeling ludicrous, Terry delivers the message to Jeremy Talbot (John Wood) who is apparently puzzled and informs her there is no Department C. Jack then asks her to enter his apartment in New York to retrieve a frying pan, on which are Jack's CIA contacts to acquire a passport. Meanwhile, Marty Phillips (Stephen Collins) arrives at First National Bank as a new coworker and, unbeknownst to her, Terry is being watched. A computer technician (Jim Belushi) shows up at the bank to repair her terminal, but when Terry calls Sperry Corporation to confirm his identity, the technician vanishes. As she enters the taxi upon leaving Jack's apartment, she is frightened to find him as the driver. His plan to abduct her fails when she knocks him out with the frying pan and flees the cab.

Elizabeth: The Zirconian Age The Queen is visiting New York, possibly for the last time. I say that not because she is now an octogenarian or because Anglo-American relations are in a poor state of repair (which they are, though not quite that bad). It's the money. Crossing the Atlantic for an official visit costs a lot of mullah, and mullah is something of which Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, sovereign of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, wearer of spangly crowns, is disagreeably short at present. Vulgar of me to mention it, I know. The Royal way has always been to discuss the folding stuff as little as possible. Members of the House of Windsor do not, by and large, walk around London with their empty pockets inside out, wailing about cash flow. Well, Princess Michael of Kent (nicknamed \\"Princess Pushy\\") does something along those lines, but her royal cousins are generally more discreet. The Queen would not be particularly thrilled if any New Yorker, meeting her today, tried to show friendship by adopting an expression of moist concern and pressing a few crisp greenbacks into her gloved hand. The bellboys of Manhattan or their equivalent may still be given the occasional tip. There will be no need for them to turn to the Royal visitor and say, \\"Keep your coins, lady, I know you need them more than me.\\" But the Royal finances are being squeezed to an uncomfortable extent, and diplomatic groans are emanating from the bean-counters at Buckingham Palace. They claim that our head of state could soon be \\"broke.\\" One of the royal court's accountants has said that finances are so tight it may have to come down to feeding the Royal Family less. Figures just released show that the Monarch will have spent all her reserves by the year 2012, the year of the diamond jubilee planned to mark her 60 years on the throne. She is down to her last 15.2 million pounds of savings, and next year that figure is expected to drop to 8 million. When you have four stonking piles to maintain (Buck House, Windsor Castle, Balmoral in Scotland and her Norfolk country home, Sandringham), the money soon evaporates. In last month's budget our new government announced that the Royal Household would not be immune to the Whitehall austerity drive with which David Cameron's administration is hacking back at the dreadful national deficit. There will be greater parliamentary scrutiny of the Royal accounts. This is being done in the name of helping the Royal Family with its bookwork, but Parliament contains several roundheads these days. Its desire to obtain more detailed knowledge of the Queen's spending will be manna to the monarchy's enemies. The Queen is so widely loved that she herself is probably safe from criticism. She simply has to worry about the bills. She has to pay for those open-carriage processions at Royal Ascot horse races. She has to stump up for her footmen's uniforms, her lawyers, her comptrollers, her embossed stationery, her gleaming motor cars, her ladies-in-waiting and her bodyguards' bullet-proof jackets. She has to fork out for all those open-air parties she throws every summer, when thousands of formally dressed guests mill around the Buckingham Palace gardens, drinking tea, chewing on cakes, gawping at the band and treading dropped sandwiches into the lawns. She has to pay for her own dresses, for her husband's swords to be polished, for her miles of corridors to be vacuum-cleaned, for her stable boys, for her oats (well, her horses' oats), for her feckless children and their occasional mistakes (ahem, Fergie). There are the bills for carpets, chandeliers and the choicest nibbles for her numerous corgis. All this before she has even bought an airline ticket for herself and her attendant flunkeys. You think your household bills are a nightmare? Think again. By long custom the Queen does not actually carry any cash in her ever-present handbag. Officially, that is for reasons of protocol. It must be a little strange to handle banknotes that carry your own portrait, too. She is, however, said to be admirably frugal, so maybe the decision to leave her credit card at home is a budgetary gambit. She and the Duke of Edinburgh keep their breakfast cereal in Tupperware containers. The light fittings in their private quarters have changed little over the decades and are said to give off the faint smell of warm bakelite when they have been left on too long. She drives fairly elderly Land Rovers round her estates and has no taste whatsoever for holidays in the swanky parts of the Med. Her idea of a holiday is striding the rainswept hills near Balmoral, dressed in gum boots, a tweed skirt and an old scarf. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Physical intimacy is important to a romantic relationship. If your partner is a virgin, you may struggle to feel close to him or her. You also want to make sure sexual desires in a relationship are mutually fulfilled. Talk to your partner about alternatives to penetrative sex. Kissing can be a very sexually stimulating, especially if you kiss your partner on sensitive areas like the neck and the ears. If your partner is not ready to have sex, you can both gain some sexual pleasure from simple kissing. You can also touch your partner in sexually sensitive areas. The breasts, the penis, and the clitoris are all very sensitive body parts. If your partner is open to it, you may enjoy sexual touching instead of actual intercourse. Oral sex can also be a pleasurable activity for you and your partner. However, keep in mind if your partner is abstinent due to moral or religious, reasons he or she may consider oral sex a form of sex. Mutual masturbation is another alternative to sex. This is where you and your partner masturbate together. This can be an arousing form of sex play that does not involve physical contact with your partner. There are a variety of forms of sexual contact and sex play you can engage in without having penetrative sex. The best way to figure out what works for you and your partner is to discuss and explore your options together. Many couples find watching porn or reading erotica together an intimate, arousing experience. This can also help you get a sense of what your partner finds arousing. If you have sex at some point in the future, it can be helpful to know what turns your partner on. Talk to your partner about watching pornography or reading erotica together. You can feel intimate with your partner as the two of you can explore your sexual desires together. Keep in mind not everyone is comfortable watching pornography or reading erotica. Remember to be respectful if your partner does not want to participate in this activity. Physical contact is not the only route to intimacy. Becoming emotionally intimate is very important in a successful relationship. Talking, listening, enjoying one another's company, and sharing thoughts and feelings can help establish emotional intimacy. Talk to your partner. Engage in activities like long walks, long phone calls, and late night conversations. Go out to a coffee shop for a few hours and simply converse. Be willing to be vulnerable and share with your partner. Meet your partner's emotional needs. If your partner needs to talk to you after a hard day, try to give him or her your full attention. Provide comfort when necessary. Sometimes, it can be hard to figure out how to best comfort someone. People respond differently to different kinds of feedback and comfort. It can be helpful to ask your partner something like, \\"What can I do to make you feel better right now?\\" Emotional intimacy takes time to establish. The best way to be emotionally intimate is to simply spend a lot of time together. Make time to talk to your partner every day.","completion":"Physical intimacy is a special kind of closeness that people in romantic relationships share. Sometimes, one person is not ready for certain activities, like a hug between two pieces of bread (that's called sex). There are other ways to be close and feel good together, like kissing, touching, or even just talking about feelings and things they like. It's important to talk to each other and find out what feels right for both people. It's also nice to do fun things together to grow closer emotionally, like going for walks, talking on the phone, and sharing thoughts.

Who is the subject of the poem The Widow at Windsor, part of the Barrack-Room Ballads, by Rudyard Kipling published in 1892????","completion":"The subject of the poem \\"The Widow at Windsor,\\" which is part of the Barrack-Room Ballads by Rudyard Kipling published in 1892, is Queen Victoria. Queen Victoria was the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom and Ireland from June 20, 1837, until her death on January 22, 1901. Her reign, which lasted over 63 years, was the longest in British history until it was surpassed by Queen Elizabeth II in 2015. Queen Victoria's reign is often referred to as the Victorian era, which saw extensive industrial, cultural, political, and scientific changes. In the poem, the Queen is referred to as the \\"Widow at Windsor\\" due to her status as a widow following the death of her husband, Prince Albert, in 1861. After Albert's death, Queen Victoria went into a period of deep mourning and seclusion, dressed in mourning clothes for the rest of her life, and became more private and less involved in the public eye. However, she continued to perform her royal duties and maintained correspondences with politicians and world leaders. Rudyard Kipling's \\"The Widow at Windsor\\" is part of the Barrack-Room Ballads, a collection of poems that he penned illustrating the lives, perspectives, and experiences of British soldiers during the Victorian era. These ballads are known for their use of military slang, colloquial language, and the exploration of themes such as courage, camaraderie, sacrifice, and the effects of imperialism. In this particular poem, Kipling uses the voice of a British soldier who speaks of the loyalty, devotion, and service to Queen Victoria, under whose rule the British Empire expanded significantly. Moreover, the poem sheds light on the pride and the burden that soldiers felt in serving their Queen, as well as the sentiment that they were mere pawns in the larger game of empire-building and imperialism."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person, who using a German text, included some period instrumentation? ? After the publication of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

What is a possible side to this debate?","completion":"In the debate about whether to ban the sale of violent video games or censor them, there are multiple sides to consider, each with their own differing opinions and rationale. Below, we will explore both the side arguing in favor of these bans or censorship, as well as the side advocating against them - along with each side's key arguments and concerns. Side 1: In Favor of Banning or Censoring Violent Video Games 1. Protecting Children and Teenagers: Advocates for banning or censoring violent video games argue that these games pose significant harm to the mental health and well-being of younger, impressionable players. This side posits that children and teenagers may become desensitized to violence or develop a warped sense of what is considered socially acceptable behavior. 2. Link to Aggressive Behavior: Some studies have highlighted a potential link between violent video game play and increases in aggressive behavior. Proponents of bans or censorship contend that limiting access to these games could reduce aggressive tendencies in players, leading to a more peaceful and cooperative society. 3. Copycat Crimes: In the aftermath of various tragic events, the media has often reported the perpetrators' consumption of violent video games. Ban or censorship advocates argue that these games could inspire vulnerable or disturbed individuals to commit similar acts of violence in real life, also referred to as the \\"copycat\\" effect. 4. Reinforcing Harmful Stereotypes: Violent video games may perpetuate and normalize stereotypes that are detrimental to society, such as racial discrimination, sexism or denigration towards certain socio-economic groups. Supporters of censorship or bans suggest that putting an end to the sale of these games could counteract these negative effects. Side 2: Against Banning or Censoring Violent Video Games 1. Freedom of Expression: Critics of bans and censorship argue that these measures encroach upon the fundamental right of free speech, which includes the freedom of artistic expression. According to this viewpoint, individuals and businesses should have the right to create and distribute the content they choose, within the confines of the law. 2. Parental Responsibility: Rather than relying on government intervention and censorship, opponents of bans argue that it is the responsibility of parents to monitor and limit their children's exposure to violent video games. This side contends that with appropriate parental guidance and involvement, children can safely navigate these forms of entertainment without suffering negative consequences. 3. Inconclusive Research: While there have been studies pointing to a connection between violent video games and aggressive behavior, critics of bans or censorship argue that the evidence is far from definitive. They posit that various factors, such as socio-economic background and family environment, are likely more significant contributors to aggressive tendencies than video games alone. 4. Economic Impact: The video game industry generates billions of dollars in revenue annually, creating numerous jobs and fueling economic growth. Opponents of bans or censorship argue that limiting the sale of violent video games could have detrimental impacts on the economy, including job loss, stifled innovation, and decreased profits for game developers and retailers. In summary, the debate over whether to ban or censor violent video games encompasses various perspectives, with proponents concerned about protecting young people and society from potential harm, while opponents defend artistic freedom and argue for parental responsibility. Each side raises valid points and concerns, which must be carefully considered before reaching a well-informed conclusion on this matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: Prevent drips from ice cream cones.","completion":"Preventing drips from ice cream cones can be a fun and satisfying activity that keeps your hands and clothes clean, while allowing you to enjoy your frozen treat. Here are some tips and techniques to help reduce the likelihood of drips and mess: 1. Cone selection: Start by choosing a sturdy cone that can withstand the weight of your ice cream. A waffle cone or sugar cone works great because of its thickness, while a regular wafer cone might not hold up as well. 2. Ice cream consistency: Select an ice cream with a firmer texture that will take longer to melt. Soft serve or ice cream that has been sitting in a warm environment may melt more quickly, increasing the chances of drips. 3. Scoop size and layers: Instead of having one large scoop on top, opt for smaller scoops and stack them in layers. This will help distribute the weight of the ice cream more evenly and slow down the melting process. 4. Serve cold: Make sure your ice cream is served and enjoyed immediately after scooping. This reduces the chance of your ice cream melting too quickly. 5. Work your cone: As you eat your ice cream, occasionally spin the cone around, allowing the melting ice cream on the sides to mix with the colder, firmer parts. This will not only help prevent drips, but also prolong the overall consumption time. 6. Napkins and drip-catching techniques: Keep a supply of napkins handy to catch stray drips, or wrap a napkin, paper towel, or even a small disposable plastic bib around the base of the cone. You can also try using a cupcake or muffin liner to create a drip catcher around the base of the cone. 7. Umbrellas and cone jackets: Another creative solution is using a small paper or plastic umbrella (like those used in cocktails) to cover the ice cream and protect it from the sun or heat sources. Some shops even sell specialty cone jackets that can help absorb dripping ice cream. 8. Eat evenly: Try to maintain an even eating pace and consume your ice cream in a uniform way. Concentrate on one area to create a cavity or \\"bowl\\" to catch the melting ice cream. 9. Plan ahead: Anticipate which sections of your ice cream are more likely to melt and drip first. Pay attention to how the sun or other heat sources are impacting the ice cream's melting pattern and adjust your eating strategy accordingly. 10. Go for a different dessert option: If all else fails and you're still concerned about drips, you may want to consider alternatives like ice cream cups, sundaes, or bars, which can be less messy and easier to manage. In conclusion, preventing ice cream cone drips is all about finding the right balance of technique, cone choice, and planning. When you keep these tips in mind, you'll be able to enjoy your frozen treat with minimal mess and maximum enjoyment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The end of each new branch will continue to grow outwards if left on your fuchsia. Make your cut above the knobby spots on the stem where leaves grow on the stem, otherwise known as a node. Flowering will be delayed until later in the season, but your fuchsia will produce more flowers for a longer amount of time. Long branches will get heavy with leaves and flowers and could break under strong winds. Leaf nodes will split into 2 or 3 individual branches that produce more flowers when they're cut back. Count up from the main stem to the second or third node with 2 leaves and make your cut. The leaves on each node will grow on the opposite side of one another. This makes new branches spread out. Remove any spindly branches growing inside the shrub. This helps the air flow through the plant and prevents fungal disease. Keep hedges clean and shaped.

One Dead and Two Missing After Tugboat Hits Barge Near Tappan Zee Bridge Rescuers were searching the Hudson River for two missing people on Saturday after a tugboat hit a barge moored near the Tappan Zee Bridge and sank, the Coast Guard said. The Associated Press, citing a spokesman for the New York State Police, said that one person had died as a result of the crash. Officials were notified at 5:20 a.m. that the tugboat, a steel-hulled vessel named the Specialist, had sunk, and that one person had been pulled from the river 10 minutes later and brought to shore for treatment, the Coast Guard said. That person died, according to The Associated Press. Several fire and law enforcement agencies were involved with the search and rescue operation. The New York Police Department provided two helicopters and two search boats, though a spokesman said those units had returned to their command posts by later in the morning. It was not immediately clear what caused the crash or whether the victims were workers on the construction of the new Tappan Zee Bridge, which is replacing the existing bridge. In 2013, a bride-to-be and her fiancé’s best man were killed near the building site, when a boat they were aboard struck a Tappan Zee construction barge. The boat’s driver had been drunk, prosecutors said, and after pleading guilty to vehicular manslaughter, he was sentenced to two years in prison in 2014. The victims’ families filed lawsuits against several companies involved with the bridge project, saying that poor lighting at the site had been a factor in the crash. The status of those suits could not be determined on Saturday.

Given the question \\"How would the teacher feel as a result?\\", is \\"they were talented\\" a valid answer?","completion":"To determine if the answer \\"they were talented\\" is a valid response to the question \\"How would the teacher feel as a result?\\", we must first analyze the context of the question and the information provided. From the given situation, we are aware that Taylor loves her English class and has presented another poem. This suggests that Taylor is passionate and engaged in the subject, actively participating in class activities, and potentially showing a level of skill and creativity when it comes to poetry. However, the question posed is about the teacher's feelings as a result of Taylor presenting a poem. The teacher's feelings may depend on several factors, such as the quality and content of the poem, Taylor's presentation skills, and the teacher's perspective or expectations from the students. Given that we are unaware of the specifics of these factors, it would be more accurate to generate a broader response that takes into account multiple possibilities regarding the teacher's emotions. For example, the teacher might feel: 1. Proud: The teacher may be proud of Taylor's passion for poetry, commitment to the subject, and the fact that she has presented another poem in class. This could showcase the teacher's ability to inspire students to excel. 2. Impressed: If Taylor's poem is of high quality, well-written, and thought-provoking, the teacher may feel impressed by her talent, creativity, and knowledge of poetic forms and techniques. 3. Encouraged: Witnessing Taylor's enthusiasm and initiative in presenting her work might encourage the teacher to continue using similar teaching strategies and nurture the talents of other students. 4. Happy: The teacher may simply feel happy and content to see a student enjoying their class, actively participating, and exploring their passion for poetry. Consequently, while the answer \\"they were talented\\" may imply that the teacher appreciated and acknowledged Taylor's skills in poetry, on its own, it does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the teacher's overall feelings as a result of Taylor presenting her poem. A more accurate response would be one that includes various emotion-based adjectives to encompass potential emotions the teacher might experience upon witnessing Taylor's poetry presentation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Given the background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. and the situation: Two identical chemical compounds are both in beakers on top of burners in a laboratory. Beaker A is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature, and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature. Ken, the scientist studying these compounds, is closely monitoring the chemicals to see what type of changes occur. Answer the following question: Which beaker will have a slower rate of reaction? Answer:","completion":"Given the background information and the situation described, Beaker A will have a slower rate of reaction. This is because Beaker A is set to a low temperature, and as explained earlier, lower temperatures cause reactant particles to have less energy and move slower, making them less likely to collide with each other and react. In contrast, Beaker X is set to a high temperature, which leads to a faster rate of reaction due to the increased energy and movement of the reactant particles."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

First question: What is the disadvantage of CNG in cars and why it is not used in every state? Second question: Is it better to lease or buy a vehicle? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First, let me answer both questions one by one, providing a step-by-step analysis. Question 1: What is the disadvantage of CNG in cars and why it is not used in every state? Step 1: Identify the key issue - disadvantage of CNG in cars Step 2: Analyze and list the disadvantages of CNG in cars - Limited driving range: CNG vehicles typically have a smaller driving range compared to gasoline-powered vehicles because CNG has a lower energy density. - Limited refueling infrastructure: The availability of CNG refueling stations is limited, especially in rural areas, which makes it difficult for CNG vehicles to be used in every state. - Vehicle conversion cost: Converting a gasoline vehicle to CNG can be expensive, and CNG vehicles generally have a higher upfront cost. - Reduced cargo space: CNG tanks often take up more space than gasoline tanks, decreasing the available cargo space in a vehicle. Step 3: Explain why it is not used in every state - The limited refueling infrastructure and limited driving range make it inconvenient for drivers in areas without nearby CNG stations. - The higher upfront cost and additional expenses for conversion may deter potential buyers. - Not all vehicles are compatible with CNG technology, further limiting its widespread adoption. Question 2: Is it better to lease or buy a vehicle? Step 1: Identify the key issue - comparing leasing and buying a vehicle Step 2: Explain the benefits and drawbacks of leasing a vehicle Benefits: - Lower monthly payments: Lease payments are generally lower than loan payments for buying a vehicle. - Easy upgrade: Leasing allows drivers to switch to a new vehicle at the end of their lease term. - Little to no down payment: Leasing often requires little or no down payment. Drawbacks: - Limited mileage: Lease agreements often have strict mileage limits, with extra charges for exceeding those limits. - No ownership equity: At the end of the lease term, the driver doesn't own the vehicle and will need to find a new one or buy out the lease. - Potential wear and tear fees: Any damage to the vehicle beyond \\"normal wear and tear\\" can result in additional fees. Step 3: Explain the benefits and drawbacks of buying a vehicle Benefits: - Ownership equity: The driver owns the vehicle and builds equity over time. - No mileage limits: There are no mileage restrictions when buying a vehicle. - Customization is allowed: Owners are free to modify or customize their vehicle as they wish. Drawbacks: - Higher monthly payments: Loan payments for buying a vehicle tend to be higher than lease payments. - Depreciation: Vehicle value depreciates over time, potentially leading to a lower resale value. - Potential higher maintenance costs: As the vehicle ages, it may require more expensive maintenance and repairs. Step 4: Determine if it's better to lease or buy a vehicle - The answer depends on the individual's priorities, financial situation, and lifestyle needs. Some people may prioritize lower monthly payments or the ability to drive a new vehicle every few years, while others value ownership and no mileage restrictions. Now I'll address the last part of the question: Are these two questions asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is about the disadvantages of CNG in vehicles and why it is not used in every state, while the second question is comparing the pros and cons of leasing versus buying a vehicle. They are two distinct topics related to the automotive industry but address separate issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Furthermore, it is worth considering that people can contract illnesses, such as the flu, from various sources, and it may be challenging to pinpoint the definitive cause or source of Tracy's illness. A more reasonable assumption about what Tracy might want to do next could include the following possibilities: 1. Rest and recover: Given that Tracy has the flu, it is crucial for her to prioritize her health and well-being. She may wish to spend more time resting, sleeping, and staying hydrated to alleviate her symptoms and speed up her recovery process. 2. Seek medical attention: Depending on the severity of her flu symptoms, Tracy may feel the need to consult a healthcare professional for treatment, advice, and potential medications to mitigate her symptoms. 3. Practice self-care: Tracy might prioritize self-care activities, such as taking warm baths, drinking hot tea, or engaging in stress-reduction techniques to improve her mental and physical well-being during her illness. 4. Communicate with Jenn: Tracy could choose to discuss her illness with Jenn, letting her know that she contracted the flu and suggesting that Jenn take precautions to avoid spreading it to others. This could also serve as an opportunity to clear any misunderstandings between the two and build a more robust and positive relationship. 5. Take preventive measures: Tracy may want to ensure that she takes steps to prevent illnesses in the future by staying up to date on vaccinations, practicing good hygiene, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It is essential to remember that not all conflicts involve revenge or retaliatory actions.

Ralston asks Miz Carnation, a necromancer, to revive his recently deceased wife; she refuses, but then decides to tell him the story of Ernst Haeckel, and says that, if he still wishes to revive his wife afterwards, she will do as he asks. Main story[edit] The story mainly concerns Ernst Haeckel (Derek Cecil), who is trying to follow in the footsteps of Victor Frankenstein, but is unsuccessful with his attempts to create life.

Learning of his father's ill condition, he travels and encounters Walter Wolfram (Tom McBeath) and his wife Elise (Leela Savasta). Haeckel is oddly drawn to Elise and vice versa.

Elise finally goes outside and the despondent Wolfram notes that he can't satisfy his wife, although he has sold everything he has to take care of her. Haeckel goes after Elise and follows the shrieks to a nearby necropolis. There he discovers that Elise is having sexual consort with her dead husband and the other resurrected corpses. Wolfram has paid Montesquino to raise the dead so that they can satisfy Elise. When Wolfram tries to take her home, the corpses kill him. Haeckel confronts Montesquino and demands that he make it stop. The necromancer says that he cannot, and an angry Haeckel shoots him as he tries to escape. The dying Montesquino shoves Haeckel into a tombstone, knocking him out. The next morning, Haeckel wakes up and returns to the cabin, where he finds Elise nursing the baby: a corpse-child, the son of her \\"true\\" husband. The baby rips out Haeckel's throat.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Most people have at least some form of debt, and the payments on this can eat up a large part of your budget. While you always have to pay your debts, you can prioritise them to ensure that you are getting the most for your money and not risking any extra charges. Start by working out which are priority debts, namely those which have the harshest penalties for missed payments. High priority debts include your mortgage or rent, income and other government taxes, utility bills and hire purchase agreements. Always meet the minimum payments for debts, and try to work towards paying off debts with the highest interest rates first. If you can pay off expensive debt, it will make it easier for you to save money in the long-term. If you’re struggling with debt, you should think about any possible alterations you can make to your repayment schedules. If you are paying back more each month than you can afford, it might be possible for you to renegotiate the loan so you pay back less each time, but you are paying back for a longer. This may work out as more expensive as you will have more interest to pay off, but it can be a good option if you are unable to make your payments. Get some independent financial advice to discuss your possible options. Don’t be tempted to take out another loan to help you pay off an existing loan. This can lead to a spiral of indebtedness that it is hard to get out of. Beware of companies offering to restructure your debt. There are reputable companies that do this, but it can be very expensive and increase rather than decrease your debt burden. Another way to take charge of your debts is to pay above the minimum rate. You may choose to do this if have some extra money and you want to take advantage of it to reduce your debt burden. This will be most beneficial if you are paying high interest rates and the minimum payments and not making an impact on your overall indebtedness. Always talk to your loan holder first, as some loan may prohibit you from paying above a certain rate. Often loans have early repayment penalties which may make it more expensive to pay off the loan ahead of schedule. Just paying back the minimum amount on a relatively modest credit card debt could mean it takes years to pay off. A good rule of thumb for getting to grips with your finances and moving towards financial independence is using savings to pay off your debt. This is normally the right thing to do financially because the amount you can earn on your savings is typically less than you are charged for your debt. Having ongoing debt repayments can make it very hard to break free and achieve financial independence. If you have assessed your situation and think a debt burden is a big barrier for you, consider using savings to pay it down and give yourself some financial breathing space. Summary:","completion":"This article advocates prioritizing and strategically managing debts to avoid additional charges and financial strain, with suggestions that include targeting high-interest debts first, potentially renegotiating repayment schedules for affordability, avoiding taking out new loans to pay existing ones, exceeding minimum payment rates if possible, and using savings to pay off debts since interest charged is often higher than interest earned on savings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One hundred episodes are advantageous for stripped syndication because it allows for 20 weeks of weekday reruns (depending on the number of episodes produced once the program debuts in syndication) without repeating an episode, and such shows can be sold for higher per episode pricing. Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supported by the text: most television shows that reach 50 episodes minimum go into syndication and go into re-runs? Options are: *no. *yes.","completion":"*no. The text states that 100 episodes is the traditional threshold for a television series to become viable for syndication, not 50 episodes. So, the statement that most television shows that reach 50 episodes minimum go into syndication and reruns is not supported by the text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the below context: There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park. The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist George Bird Grinnell. Grinnell documented the poaching of... Guess a valid title for it!

BY EARLY in the week, amid the latest revelations of massive security lapses, it became clear that Julie Pierson would be canned as director of the Secret Service — or rather, that she would be granted a “Washington resignation,” which simply means that she falls on her own sword without us seeing who delivered the official final push. The inevitable arrived on Wednesday, as Pierson resigned just a day “after Obama expressed full confidence in her,” and “lawmakers from both parties were calling for her ouster after her halting performance during a House hearing Tuesday,” reported The Post’s Carol D. Leonnig and David Nakamura. It was also on Tuesday, after that hearing, that I began mulling cartoon ideas about Pierson’s all-but-sealed departure. As I did — and as I read and heard comments about what the Secret Service was supposed to represent, and embody, and “stand for” — I kept going back to the 1993 film “In the Line of Fire,” in which Clint Eastwood plays an aging agent who is still haunted by his failure to prevent JFK’s assassination that day decades ago in Dealey Plaza. Amid the cat-and-mouse plot twists, Eastwood’s agent, Frank Horrigan, embodies the professional as throwback. Pierson, by most accounts, was not a throwback as director. And as scrutiny of Pierson’s tenure at the top intensified, biographical details took on freighted meaning. Those included her words about her vision for the agency. The Post’s Leonnig (who of course broke multiple devastating stories about Pierson’s Secret Service) wrote that supervisors “said they were taken aback when Pierson, who worked during high school at Walt Disney World as a costumed character and park attendant, said: ‘We need to be more like Disney World. We need to be more friendly, inviting.’ ” Once I read that, my cartoon crystallized. Coincidentally, I had already envisioned a caricature of Pierson wearing a clown nose; now a full-body costumed depiction, big shoes and all, made complete metaphoric sense. And thus — employing even gritty throwback tints vs. “friendly” Disney-bright pastels — a contrast was drawn: SECTION: {section=entertainment, subsection=null}!!!

Zaijian was also a cast member in the children 's sketch comedy show Goin ' Bulilit . - May Bukas Pa (lit. There Is Still Tomorrow) is a Philippine drama series which started long-airing from February 2, 2009 to February 5, 2010 for one year. It is the highest-rated show of all time according to Kantar Media Philippines - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called \\"sketches\\", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy.

Fact 2: Plants include blue pine, hemlock, spruce and oak. Given the two facts above, what releases oxygen during the day but not during the night? Options are: -elephants; -dogs; -hydrocarbons; -blue pine; -Conifers; -vegetation; -humans; -Fuel cells; The answer is:","completion":"The answer is blue pine. Given the two facts, we can deduce that the subject in question must be a type of plant. Fact 1 states that plants release oxygen during the day but not during the night. This is because of the process of photosynthesis, where plants utilize sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis occurs during the day when sunlight is available, and thus, oxygen is released in the process. At night, photosynthesis stops due to the lack of sunlight, and plants undergo a process called respiration where they consume oxygen and release carbon dioxide. Fact 2 states that plants include blue pine, hemlock, spruce, and oak. Considering the options given, blue pine is the one that falls under the category of plants. Although conifers and vegetation are related to plants, they are more general terms, rather than specific names of plants. Let's look at the other options mentioned: 1. Elephants and dogs are animals, not plants. They don't release oxygen during the day or at night, as they obtain their oxygen from respiration and release carbon dioxide instead. 2. Hydrocarbons are organic compounds consisting of hydrogen and carbon. They are typically found in fossil fuels or natural gas and do not release oxygen during the day or night. 3. Conifers are a group of cone-bearing seed plants, including pine, hemlock, and spruce. However, this term is broader than specifying an individual plant. 4. Vegetation is a general term used to describe the plant life of a particular region or habitat. It doesn't specifically release oxygen but rather refers to the collective plant life that performs photosynthesis and releases oxygen during the day. 5. Humans, like elephants and dogs, are animals that rely on respiration to obtain oxygen and release carbon dioxide. 6. Fuel cells are devices that convert chemical energy into electrical energy through a chemical reaction involving hydrogen and oxygen. They don't naturally release oxygen during the day or night. Given these explanations, the answer that correctly fits with the given facts is blue pine, a type of plant that releases oxygen during the day through photosynthesis but not during the night when photosynthesis ceases."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of numbers. Each list is presented with brackets and comma-separated values. For example, a list of numbers is [1,2,3] and a list of two lists of numbers is [[1,2],[3,4,6]].

Q: [[-23, 84, 69, -92], [-96, -54, 13, 96, -12, -36, -98], [56, 79, -11, 7], [-92, 30, 24, -69, 15, -96, -28, 24, 54]] A:","completion":"Part #1: Given a list, of lists, of numbers. Usage: The input is a list of lists of numbers such as [[-23, 84, 69, -92], [-96, -54, 13, 96, -12, -36, -98], [56, 79, -11, 7], [-92, 30, 24, -69, 15, -96, -28, 24, 54]]. I think it meets the criteria because it is made up of four separate lists, and each list includes one or more numbers. Part #2: Sum up the values at every position of every inner list. Usage: For each position in the inner lists, the values must be added together. For instance, at position one in all the lists, the values are -23, -96, 56 and -92. When added together, their total is -155. I think this part meets the criteria because it correctly sums up all the first values of the inner lists. Part #3: Put the sum of each position as an element of your answer. Usage: The sum of the values at each position will be placed into the resulting list. In our example, -155, the sum of all the first values, will be the first element of the final list. It meets the requirement because it place the sum as an element in the output. Part #4: The output should be a list of numbers with the same length as the longest inner list. Usage: The final list that contains the sums should be the same length as the longest list from the input. In our example, the longest list is [-96, -54, 13, 96, -12, -36, -98] with 7 elements, so the final list should also contain 7 elements.

Cardinals sing something that sounds a little like \\"What cheer, cheer, cheer.\\" Towhees sing, \\"Drink your tea.\\" Most of the time, birds pay attention only to the songs of birds of their own kind. Cardinals answer cardinals, and song sparrows answer song sparrows. A cardinal knows that a song sparrow will not try to steal its mate. So you can see one reason why a cardinal may chase away another cardinal but will not bother a song sparrow. Most different kinds of birds eat different things. To find enough to eat, a bird needs a big piece of land to search in. Many kinds of birds have some ways of dividing up the land into territories. Song sparrows, cardinals ovenbirds, and white-throated sparrows are some of the birds that have territorial systems. Especially in early spring, birds work out the boundaries between their territories by singing \\"keep out\\" threats and by chasing and fighting each other. The birds continue singing to tell females that they have set up territories. Neighboring birds seem to agree that there are make believe fences between their pieces of property. Then they do not have to waste energy chasing each other instead of taking care of their young. Scientists guessed that some birds could recognize their neighbors by small differences in their songs. Two scientists who studied white-throated sparrows found that these birds can even tell the difference between songs of individual birds of their own kind. White-throated sparrows...

The management of Rockefeller Center shifted around this time. In November 1936, John Todd was featured in two New Yorker articles that emphasized his role in the complex's construction. At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose. Rockefeller Center was one of Nelson's primary business ventures until 1958, when he was elected Governor of New York.Public relations officials were hired to advertise the different parts of the complex, such as the gardens and the plaza.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. – Rudy Giuliani found himself the subject of plenty of angry headlines Monday, and many sounded much like that of the New York Daily News: \\"Rudy Giuliani forgets about 9/11.\\" The former NYC mayor—whose tenure included 9/11—was in Youngstown, Ohio, to introduce Donald Trump at a campaign event, and said these lines: \\"Under those eight years, before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack inside the United States. They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office.\\" Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009, leading many outlets to point out that the eight years prior included the 9/11 attacks. How it's playing out: CNN reports that Giuliani had only moments before referenced the World Trade Center attacks, and Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Giuliani meant the time between 9/11 and Obama's first day on the job. Slate agrees that Giuliani's sin was simple imprecision. Yes, \\"his phrasing was misleading,\\" but take a look at the context: Giuliani was praising Mike Pence's work on the Patriot Act \\"with preventing more attacks before pivoting to his remarks about eight years without another attack.\\" He was talking post-9/11, and just said it poorly. The Washington Post and Slate flag something they see as more fascinating than the verbal faux pas: As the Post writes, what Giuliani is saying is \\"actually pretty diametrically opposed\\" to Trump's campaign stance on America's safety under George W. Bush. MSNBC points out Giuliani made a similar gaffe in 2010. How's that for timing? The comments coincide with a New Yorker article published Monday that isn't about the Youngstown appearance.

I can use this background: Wildfires occur when all the necessary elements of a fire triangle come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation, that is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 °C (212 °F). Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 °C (450 °F) releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 °C (720 °F) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 °C (1,000 °F). Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 °C (1,470 °F), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from...

By Ian Ladyman Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM Louis van Gaal is interested in appointing Roy Keane as his assistant manager if he is given the job of replacing David Moyes as Manchester United manager. The Dutchman is among the favourites to take charge at Old Trafford this summer, with owners the Glazer family keen to get the club back on track after Moyes' disastrous 10 months at the helm. Club chiefs are interested in retaining at least one former player to help manage the first team next season, opening up the possibility of Keane returning after more than eight years away. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis Van Gaal: I want to manage in the Premier League Insecurity: OPTIONS: - David Meyler was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - David Moyes was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Dutchman was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Glazer was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Hull was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Ian Ladyman was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Ian_Ladyman_DM was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Keane was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Louis Van Gaal was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Louis van Gaal was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Man United was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Manchester United was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Moyes was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Old Trafford was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Premier League was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Roy Keane was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Ryan Giggs was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - United was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed - Van Gaal was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed","completion":"Answer: - David Moyes was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed Explanation: The answer is \\"David Moyes was edged out of the David Moyes backroom staff as the season progressed\\", because the text clearly states that David Moyes was replaced.

Roy Keane was not a part of David Moyes' backroom staff to begin with, he is considered as an assistant for the potential new manager, Louis van Gaal.

However, it is important to note that tuna species do not undergo a proper incubation process like some other fish species that lay stationary eggs. Tuna species, including Yellowfin tuna, are broadcast spawners which means they release their eggs and sperm into the water column. These fertilized eggs float in the water and hatch relatively quickly, within a day or two, depending on the water temperature.

They say the club is operating illegally close to a place of worship. (Posted June 17, 2014) A group of nuns is suing to shut down a strip club next to their convent in Stone Park that the sisters say keeps them awake at night. The Missionary Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo Scalabrinians say in the suit that Club Allure has ruined their peace with blinking neon lights and loud thumping music. The nuns say they have witnessed drunken fights and found condoms littering the area. The suit, filed against the club and the village of Stone Park, states that the club violates a state law against operating adult entertainment within 1,000 feet of a school or place of worship. The club is also near houses, and three neighbors have joined the suit. “I think most people would find that offensive, to put a strip club next to a home for sisters,” said Peter Breen, attorney for the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm that filed the suit on behalf of the nuns. The suit was filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court. The club opened last fall, but attorneys said the nuns were not properly notified. Dean Krone, an attorney for the village of Stone Park, said the state law is unconstitutional because it is overly broad by prohibiting such uses within 1 mile of houses of worship. That would eliminate any site in the tiny village from hosting a strip club, but under the First Amendment guaranteeing freedom of expression, Krone said, the courts have generally ruled that municipalities may not put blanket bans on strip clubs. The fight over the club has been raging for years. Village Board members initially denied a strip club proposed by the same ownership in 2009, Krone said, but when the owners sued, the village settled the suit by allowing the club. The suit is more about moral views than lights or noise, according to Robert Itzkow, who said he used to be the club's owner and is now its attorney. “This is an ideological dispute,” he said. The club is soundproofed and keeps lighting and deliveries in the front to avoid bothering neighbors, he said. The club is next to a container yard and a recycling dump, in an area zoned for adult entertainment and in a village known for strip clubs. Itzkow said the business improved the area by replacing vacant warehouses and generating jobs and tax revenue. Club Allure's website advertises it as “Chicago's Premier Adult Playground.” Part of the convent is in the neighboring village of Melrose Park, also a plaintiff in the suit. The convent is home to about 20 women, Breen said, and includes three chapels and holds Sunday services open to the public. rmccoppin@tribune.com Twitter @Robert McCoppin ||||| Melrose Park Joins Nuns and Families in Suing Stone Park over Strip Club Thomas More Society to file suit this week Contact: Tom Ciesielka, 312-422-1333, CHICAGO, June 10, 2014 / \\"Strip clubs don't belong next to convents and single-family homes,\\" said Peter Breen, vice president and senior counsel of the Thomas More Society. \\"We are dedicated to standing up for the rights of the Sisters, residents, and the people of Melrose Park, all of whom have been suffering disruption and damage from this strip club in their backyards.\\" The state of Illinois has a 1,000 foot buffer zoning law which forbids strip clubs from being placed within 1,000 feet of a place of worship.

Translate to English","completion":"The sentence provided is in Czech language and reads as follows in English: \\"Just like the Commission's decision to impose fines in the area of economic competition, which also has such effects, the decision on customs reimbursement or forgiveness is an individual decision.\\" This sentence is likely referring to legal and regulatory decisions undertaken in the Czech Republic. Specifically, it appears to be discussing the idea that certain decisions, like those that impose fines in the area of economic competition, have specific effects and are considered on an individual basis. The concept of individual decisions is then related to another regulatory area: that of customs reimbursement or forgiveness. In more detail, the sentence is saying that regulatory decisions — whether they pertain to economic competition (which probably involves maintaining fair business practices and preventing monopolies) or customs (which could involve import/export taxes) - are not generic. They are not automatically applied across the board to all companies or corporations. Instead, they are 'individual' decisions, most likely meaning that the specific circumstances and actions of each company are taken into account. Therefore, just as each decision to impose a certain competition-related fine would consider the unique actions and context of the company in question, so too would decisions about customs reimbursement or forgiveness. For instance, the customs authorities would look at the specific details of each case — such as what goods were imported/exported, any relevant taxation laws, the company's prior behavior, etc. — before deciding whether to refund or forgive any customs duties.

If you build a campfire, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it.

Write a summary based on this article: In this image, snapped from the International Space Station on Jan. 30, 2014, while South Korea (lower right) and China (upper left) are aglow in lights, poverty-stricken North Korea is really in the dark. Political favoritism can quite literally be seen from space, according to a new study that finds the home regions of leaders become brighter at night after the person comes to power. The findings apply mostly to countries with weak political institutions and limited public education. One prominent example was Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) during the reign of Mobuto Sese Seko. Mobuto, who was president between 1971 and 1997, was born near the small town of Gbadolite. While he was in power, the town flourished. \\"Mobuto built a huge palace complex costing millions of dollars, luxury guesthouses, an airport capable of handling Concords, and had the country's best supply of water, electricity and medical services,\\" study researcher Paul Raschky, an economist at Monash University in Australia, said in a statement. Years of satellite data reveal Gbadolite as initially dark at night, brightening under Mobuto and quickly fading again after the authoritarian ruler's exile and death. Electricity and the economy At night, when rural areas go dark, urban development remains bright and sparkly, lit by electric lights. These bright spots are handy indicators of wealth and development. In fact, multiple researchers have used light intensity at night as a proxy for a country's economic power. ['Black Marble:' Images of Earth at Night] One recent image of North and South Korea shows how striking the night light difference can be. In a photograph snapped from the International Space Station (ISS), South Korea and China look bright as day. Isolated and poverty-stricken North Korea is a dark gash between the two. Only a small glow from the country's capital of Pyongyang is visible. Raschky and his colleague, University of St. Gallen economist Roland Hodler, used data on light intensity from U.S. Air Force weather satellites and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to track nighttime light intensity changes worldwide between 1992 and 2009. They had data from 126 countries, broken into 38,427 provinces, states or subregions. Political patronage The results revealed regions that birthed leaders saw a boost in light after the election or power takeover, a sign of economic favor. \\"Our results suggest that being the leader's birthplace increases nighttime light intensity and regional GDP by around 4 and 1 percent, respectively,\\" Raschky said. The effect was basically nonexistent in regions with well-developed political systems and educated populations. Light intensity showed little change related to leadership in Europe, the Americas, or Australia and its surrounding islands, the researchers reported in March in the Quarterly Journal of Economics. But the effect was strong in Africa and Asia. Beyond Zaire, another major example was Sri Lanka. Mahinda Rajapaksa, president of the country since 2005, was born in the rural Hambantota district. That area's largest city is home to only 11,000 people, but since Rajapaksa's election, Hambantota has become home to a 35,000-seat cricket stadium and an international airport, with plans for an enormous port. In the countries with the weakest political institutions, being the hometown of a leader sent nighttime lights soaring by 30 percent, reflecting an estimated 9 percent increase in GDP. When sorting countries by education, those with the least-educated populations saw a leadership effect of 11 percent more light in a leader's home region, and a boost of approximately 3 percent in that region's GDP. Autocracy clearly drives the trend, the researchers wrote, probably because dictators have few constraints on how they spend money or direct resources. \\"Sound political institutions and education are socially desirable and help keep political leaders accountable,\\" Raschky said. Unfortunately for the regions lucky enough to be favored under a rising leader's star, the effect does not last. Shortly after a leader leaves power, the researchers found, the region's gains ease off, and the changes are not sustained. Follow Stephanie Pappas on Twitter and Google+.

Original article on Live Science. ||||| In some countries, a region that can lay claim to being the birthplace of a country’s political leader is likely to get preferential treatment – bias that shines out when the intensity of night lights is compared with that in other regions. This new approach to pinpointing regional favouritism has been developed by researchers from Monash University and the University of St Gallen. Using information on the birthplaces of political leaders in 126 countries, and satellite data on night-time light intensity from 38,427 subnational regions from 1992-2009, they established a strong relationship between light intensity and regional GDP. Dr Paul Raschky from the Monash Centre for Development Economics and Sustainability said previous research had confirmed the connection between economic activity and light generated at night. But relating night-time light intensity to information about the birthplaces of politicians gave new insights into what determines regional favouritism. “Our results suggest that being the leader’s birthplace increases night-time light intensity and regional GDP by around four and one per cent respectively,” Dr Raschky said. Thelarge sample of countries in the study included both democracies and autocracies. Zaire’s former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko provided an extreme example of the phenomenon, Dr Raschky said. Mobutu had bank accounts and properties all over the world, but spent his money most lavishly in his remote hometown of Gbadolite. “Mobutu built a huge palace complex costing millions of dollars, luxury guesthouses, an airport capable of handling Concords, and had the country's best supply of water, electricity and medical services,” Dr Raschky said. “The satellite imagery over the Gbadolite region clearly showed the rise of Mobutu, starting off with very little night-time light intensity through to extremely high levels during his reign, then easing off once he was no longer in power.” Similar effects were noted elsewhere, with any benefits gained by favoured regions unlikely to be sustained beyond a change in government. Inevitably, such favouritism was most common in countries with weak political institutions and poorly educated citizens. “Sound political institutions and education are socially desirable and help keep political leaders accountable,“ Dr Raschky said. “We demonstrate their importance in constraining regional favouritism. The enforcement of term limits also seems to be a crucial aspect.” The researchers also looked at the effect of regional favouritism on the distribution of foreign aid and oil rents. “Our findings suggest that donor agencies need to be very cautious when supporting countries with authoritarian leaders because such leaders mainly use foreign aid to the benefit of themselves, their family and clan members, and others living in their stronghold,” Dr Raschky said. He hopes his new approach will aid future research on regional favouritism and the political economy of regional development. The research has been published in Quarterly Journal of Economics.

Utilizing data on light intensity from satellite images between 1992 and 2009, as well as birthplaces of political leaders in 126 countries, the researchers discovered that regions where leaders were born saw an increase in nighttime light intensity, an indicator of wealth and development, as well as regional GDP. Countries with weak political institutions and limited public education were primarily affected by this favoritism. The study highlights the Congo's authoritarian ruler, Mobuto Sese Seko, as an example. When Mobuto, who was born in the small town of Gbadolite, was in power, he built luxurious infrastructure in his hometown, demonstrating a significant boost in wealth for the area during his reign. Similarly, Sri Lanka's Hambantota district, where Mahinda Rajapaksa, the country’s president since 2005, was born, has seen economic favoritism under his rule. Countries with the weakest political institutions experienced an estimated 9% increase in GDP due to political favor.

What is the answer: Which city was the capital of the Untied States from 1790 to 1800?","completion":"The city that served as the capital of the United States from 1790 to 1800 was Philadelphia. During this time, Philadelphia played a highly significant role in the nation's early history. It was the meeting place for the Founding Fathers, who debated and ultimately drafted the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The city's role as the capital was solidified by the Residence Act of 1790, which designated Philadelphia as the temporary capital while the new federal city, Washington, D.C., was being constructed. Philadelphia was chosen as the temporary capital for several reasons. First, it was located near the geographic center of the original thirteen states, making it accessible to government officials and citizens alike. Second, Philadelphia was, at the time, the largest city and most important commercial center in the newly formed United States. It had well-developed infrastructure, including housing, transportation, and communication networks, that made it suitable for hosting the nation's government. Lastly, Philadelphia had a rich history of hosting important political events, such as the First and Second Continental Congresses, before the United States was officially formed. During its tenure as the U.S. capital, Philadelphia witnessed many significant events in the country's development. The city was the site of George Washington's second inauguration in 1793 and John Adams' inauguration in 1797. It also hosted key diplomatic meetings, including the negotiation of the highly contested Jay Treaty with Great Britain in 1794. In addition, the capital city was home to critical institutions, including the First Bank of the United States, which was established by Congress in 1791 to serve as the nation's central financial institution. The Supreme Court met in Philadelphia's Old City Hall, and Congress convened in Congress Hall, both adjacent to Independence Hall. Though the capital officially moved to Washington, D.C., in 1800, upon the completion of federal buildings there, Philadelphia remains an important symbol of the United States' early history. Its rich past as the temporary capital, as well as its contributions to the founding of the nation, make it a city of immense historical value. Today, visitors can explore the Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, which includes sites such as Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, and Congress Hall, to learn about the city's significant role in the formation of the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Following the American Revolutionary War, the United States faced potential military conflict on the high seas as well as on the western frontier. The United States was a minor military power during this time, having only a modest army, Marine corps, and navy. A traditional distrust of standing armies, combined with faith in the abilities of local militia, precluded the development of well-trained units and a professional officer corps. Jeffersonian leaders preferred a small army and navy, fearing that a large military establishment would involve the United States in excessive foreign wars, and potentially allow a domestic tyrant to seize power. Now answer this question: What did early American leaders worry a large standing army would involve America in?","completion":"Early American leaders, particularly those of the Jeffersonian era, were deeply concerned that maintaining a large standing army would involve the United States in various negative consequences, both domestically and internationally. Firstly, they feared that a powerful military establishment could lead to America's involvement in excessive foreign wars. This concern stemmed from the European experience, where large standing armies were often used to assert dominance and wage wars for conquest and territorial expansion. American leaders, seeking to focus on nation building and domestic priorities, did not want the U.S. to be embroiled in international conflicts that could jeopardize their young nation's fragile stability and economic growth. Instead, they sought a more isolationist policy geared towards the defense of their territories and maintaining peace with foreign countries. Secondly, the early American leaders worried that a large standing army could potentially enable a domestic tyrant to seize power. This concern was rooted in their belief that centralized power posed a great threat to individual liberties and the democratic process. Many of these leaders had witnessed or been influenced by the events of the American Revolution, during which they fought against the tyranny of the British monarchy. Consequently, they did not want to recreate the same conditions where a potential military dictator could exploit the power of a large standing army to undermine the country's democratic institutions and impose authoritarian rule. Furthermore, these early leaders had a traditional distrust of standing armies which they saw as a potential danger to civil liberties and republican government. They favored relying on local militias instead, which were seen as more in tune with the needs and interests of their communities. Militias were also considered less likely to be used for oppressive purposes, as they were composed of citizen-soldiers who could return to civilian life and not a professional army that needed conflicts to sustain its existence. In summary, early American leaders worried that having a large standing army would involve the United States in excessive foreign wars and potentially allow a domestic tyrant to seize power, thereby threatening the nation's democratic principles and the liberties of its citizens. To counter these concerns, they chose to maintain a modest military force and place their trust in the effectiveness of local militias."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: A kid is studying new words at home in the kitchen, where could a dictionary be? Possible A: library, table, bookstore, shelf, classroom Why is \\"table\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Table\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the following reasons: 1. Location: The question states that the kid is studying new words at home in the kitchen. In many homes, kitchens often have tables where family members gather, eat, and sometimes study or work. Therefore, it is plausible that the kid could be using the table for studying. 2. Accessibility: A table provides a flat surface to place and open a dictionary, making it easily accessible while the child is studying new words. It also allows the kid to have the dictionary close at hand for quick reference. 3. Familiar setting: Studying at home, especially in the kitchen, suggests a comfortable and familiar environment for the kid. Having the dictionary on the table implies that it is in a familiar and convenient place, which can be crucial for efficient learning. 4. Comparison to other options: When comparing \\"table\\" to the other possible answers (library, bookstore, shelf, classroom), \\"table\\" aligns with human common sense because it is more likely to be found inside a home, particularly in a kitchen. While dictionaries can also be found in libraries, bookstores, and classrooms, these locations are not as relevant to the context of a kid studying at home. A shelf could be a plausible location for a dictionary in a home, but placing it on a table would be more convenient for immediate reference while studying new words. By considering these factors, we can conclude that \\"table\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in the given scenario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Now right here in Arizona, that difference would have been 131 million to the state of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens. The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? No Child Left Behind requires no funding.","completion":"While the next sentence is a statement about No Child Left Behind's funding requirements, it does not follow the preceding text's context. In contrast, the preceding text discusses the financial impact of underfunding the No Child Left Behind program in Arizona, and President's renege on a funding promise. A more suitable sentence that would follow based on the context and logic established in the preceding text could be: \\"Due to the lack of adequate funding, the No Child Left Behind program faces significant challenges in achieving its goal of improving educational outcomes for all students, particularly in states like Arizona.\\" No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is the 2001 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that sought to improve the performance of America's primary and secondary schools. One of the main aspects of NCLB was to hold schools accountable for the academic performance of their students, as measured through standardized tests. It was a federal program that focused on closing the achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their better-off peers, aiming to ensure all students meet minimum proficiency levels in reading and math. The program did require funding to implement its many requirements, including support for schools and districts to improve teacher quality, develop better assessments, and provide additional resources to aid struggling schools. It was up to Congress to appropriate the necessary funds to support these efforts fully. However, NCLB has faced criticism for being underfunded, which has resulted in the challenges mentioned in the preceding text. Many argue that the lack of sufficient funding has hampered the program's effectiveness in benefiting students in need. In the case of Arizona, as mentioned in the preceding text, insufficient funding could negatively impact the state's ability to support struggling schools and address the academic needs of its students. This could not only affect education quality but also place a greater financial reliance on local property taxes, creating further disparities among districts with different funding capabilities. To summarize, the statement \\"No Child Left Behind requires no funding\\" does not follow the context established in the preceding text. Instead, a sentence that discusses the challenges of funding NCLB or its impact on education quality would be more appropriate given the preceding text's focus on the financial implications of the President's broken funding promise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Friday's two-train collision killed 25 people and injured more than 130 others near Los Angeles after an engineer failed to heed a traffic signal, a spokeswoman for Metrolink commuter trains said. A commuter rail car lies on its side after a collision Friday near Los Angeles, California. The engineer was guiding the Metrolink train that slammed head-on into a freight train and is not believed to have survived, Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell said on Saturday. \\"It was human error,\\" Tyrrell said, adding this was Metrolink's belief \\"barring any new information\\" from an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. NTSB spokeswoman Kitty Higgins said the agency would \\"look at everything before we rule anything in or out.\\" Tyrrell said the engineer, whom she didn't identify, was a subcontractor employed by another company. She said she did not have details of his record. The crash occurred about 4:30 p.m. PT Friday in Chatsworth, a northwest Los Angeles suburb. The Metrolink train had about 220 passengers and two crew members on board at the time, according to Tyrrell. Watch rescuers search for victims ». Forty-five of the injured were in critical condition, with 40 flown to hospitals, Tyrrell said. Another 50 had minor injuries, and 40 others were treated at the crash site but transported to hospitals for evaluation. \\"It was like running into a brick wall at 60 miles an hour,\\" an injured passenger told CNN affiliate KABC. In the minutes after the crash, passers-by joined emergency personnel in an effort to free passengers from the wreckage. On Saturday afternoon, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said the search of the wreckage had finished. Earlier in the day, authorities were picking through the wreckage and freeing trapped bodies. Ed Winter, assistant chief of the Los Angeles County coroner's office, told reporters two bodies -- both of females -- had yet to be identified. If the females had carried identification, it probably was lost in the crash, he said. As of 9 a.m. PT Saturday, authorities had been able to notify relatives of eight victims, he said. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger visited the crash site on Saturday, telling reporters it was \\"one of the worst train accidents in modern history in California.\\" The NTSB will make a final determination of the crash's cause. Higgins, the agency's spokeswoman, said data recorders have been recovered from both trains, along with a video recorder from the freight train. Higgins said that out of the trains' five crew members, four survived. Authorities will interview the surviving crew members, Higgins said. Tyrrell said a review of \\"a number of programs,\\" including the signal system, showed the commuter train's engineer failed to heed a stop signal, Tyrrell said. \\"We don't know how the error happened, but this is what we believe happened,\\" Tyrrell said. The wreck occurred on a curved part of the track where the speed limit is 40 mph, Tyrrell said. She said that just like road vehicles, trains are subject to signal systems. At the wreck site is a siding where one train can wait while another passes, she said. \\"They receive a signal to stop and they must hold their location until other traffic has passed,\\" she said. Villaraigosa praised police officers and firefighters for working under emotionally draining conditions and treating the victims with respect. \\"This has been a grueling night for them,\\" he said. The crash sparked a fire that impeded firefighters's efforts to reach the front commuter car, where most of the injuries occurred, Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. The fire eventually was brought under control. \\"We've already found survivors trapped under fatalities,\\" Whitmore said late Friday. Among those killed was Spree Desha, 35, a Los Angeles police officer on her way home from work, officials said Saturday. \\"It's not unusual for us to respond to disasters,\\" said Jerry Szymanski, an assistant commander for the LAPD. \\"When we got here, we found it was one that hit close to home.\\" Desha had \\"mentored and trained a lot of the young officers in the North Hollywood area,\\" Szymanski said. Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said Friday night a sheriff's deputy was in a hospital's intensive care unit after collapsing while conducting rescue work.

The statement discusses a general approach or method used to lessen the burden on fish populations within particular zones, which are typically inhabited by young fish. The goal of this approach is to ensure the sustainability and health of these fish stocks by mitigating the pressures that may result from factors such as overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Various strategies can be employed to reduce pressure on young fish populations in their habitats. Some of the potential measures include: 1. Establishing protected areas or no-fishing zones – By designating specific areas off-limits for fishing activities, these zones allow young fish to grow and reproduce without the threat of being removed from the population prematurely. This increases their chances of survival and ability to replenish the overall fish stock. 2. Implementing seasonal closures – During specific times of the year, when young fish are more abundant or particularly vulnerable to fishing pressure, temporary bans or closures can be implemented. This allows the fish to grow and mature without the stress of fishing activities during these crucial periods. 3. Regulating fishing gear and methods – By restricting the use of fishing gear or methods that are more likely to catch and harm young fish, pressure on these populations can be lightened. For example, regulations may require the use of certain mesh sizes in fishing nets to allow smaller, younger fish to escape capture. 4. Enforcing catch limits and quotas – By placing limits on the number of fish that can be caught or the overall mass of fish that can be harvested, catch limits and quotas can help maintain sustainable fish populations. This prevents overfishing and gives the younger fish a chance to mature and reproduce, ultimately supporting the long-term health of the fish stock. 5. Encouraging sustainable fishing practices – By providing education, resources, and incentives for responsible fishing, sustainable practices can be promoted at both commercial and recreational levels. This ensures that fish populations remain healthy for future generations. In summary, a variety of approaches can be used to reduce pressure on fish populations, particularly within zones that serve as habitats for young fish. By implementing measures such as protected areas, seasonal closures, gear regulations, catch limits, and promoting sustainable fishing practices, the long-term health and sustainability of these aquatic ecosystems can be preserved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Melania Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention has notable similarities with a speech given by current first lady Michelle Obama in 2008.

Skipped out on two parties, but had a wonderful night with the boy","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as mixed or complex due to the different feelings and experiences communicated in it. At the beginning, the tweet expresses a feeling of extreme fatigue with the statement \\"DEAD TIRED.\\" The use of all capital letters intensifies the sentiment and gives the impression of the tweeter's physical state being greater than just being typically tired. Their exhaustion may have come from the day's activities, responsibilities, or stressors. \\"I'm a granny\\" suggests a self-deprecating humor or slight resignation, reinforcing the tiredness. The tweeter is using the term figuratively to show that they feel older beyond their years or that they're behaving like an elderly person who often goes to bed early or doesn't engage in late-night activities. This light-hearted, slightly negative sentiment reveals a social stereotype, but it can also be seen as a reflective observation regarding the tweeter's behavior on that particular night. Skipped out on two parties suggests feelings of withdrawal or avoidance. It signals that the tweeter may have prioritized their need for rest over their social obligations. They might have felt disappointed or may have experienced a sense of missing out by not attending these social events. However, the last part of the tweet – \\"but had a wonderful night with the boy\\" – shifts to a positive sentiment. The word \\"wonderful\\" indicates happiness, joy, or satisfaction. It implies that despite their fatigue and decision to skip out on parties, they had an enjoyable and fulfilling experience with the individual referred to as ‘the boy’. This could be a romantic partner, a close friend, or even their child. Therefore, the sentiment is not completely negative or filled with regret; the tweeter has found a silver lining in their decision. In summary, this tweet reflects a complex mélange of feelings - exhaustion, self-deprecating humor, possible regret from the lack of socialization, and eventual positivity and contentment from a treasured personal interaction. It is a snapshot of a deeply human experience, filled with ups and downs, choices and consequences, and ultimately personal gratification."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who made a cameo? Movie title: A Modern Musketeer Movie plot: The film opens with a sequence in which D'Artagnan (Douglas Fairbanks) rides up to a tavern on horseback and ends up brawling with sword and fist with the patrons inside in his haste to approach a fair young stranger. After triumphing, he morphs into modern day Ned Thacker (also played by Fairbanks). Ned is born and raised in Kansas by a mother who passes along to him her love of D'Artagnan and The Three Musketeers, despite his father's concern that it is not good for him. In fact, Ned does get into trouble with his (sometimes unwanted) chivalrous attempts to help women. Finally, Ned can stand it no more; he decides to leave dull Kansas. In mirroring scenes, D'Artagnan is astride a somewhat less-than-noble steed, a present from his father for his departure from home, while Ned's father gives him the modern equivalent: a car. While driving in the desert, he comes upon a chauffeur-driven automobile stopped because the road ahead has been washed away. Unimpressed with one passenger, the middle-aged Forrest Vandeteer (the \\"richest man in Yonkers\\"), Ned is quite taken with the lovely \\"Park Avenue flapper\\" Elsie Dodge. Her mother, the third passenger, sees her only daughter's marriage to Vandeteer as the solution to their dire financial straits. Vandeteer buys what he wants, and he wants Elsie. She, however, loathes her suitor; she much prefers young Ned. Scene from the movie Ned comes up with the idea to put his car on railroad tracks. He takes the party (with Elsie in the front seat beside him) to their Grand Canyon resort hotel. There, Vandeteer tells Ned to stay away from the ladies. John Blabb, who works for \\"Town Topics\\", informs Ned that Vandeteer already has three wives hidden away somewhere. Meanwhile, Chin-de-dah, the Native American leader of an outlaw gang hiding in a tributary canyon, is bored. He decides to kidnap a white woman to be his wife (his last \\"wife\\" is shown to have committed suicide). He goes to the resort, pretending to be a guide, and selects Elsie as his target.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: A prisoner's girlfriend and his sister have been sentenced for helping him to escape. Article:","completion":"Title: A Prisoner's Great Escape with the Help of His Girlfriend and Sister Once upon a time in a land not so far away, there lived a man who was in prison. This man must have done something not-so-nice, so the big people in charge put him in a place called prison. A prison is a place where people have to stay when they do not follow the rules. This man had a girlfriend and a sister who loved him very much. They thought he should not be in prison anymore. So, the girlfriend and the sister came up with a plan to help him get away from that place. Because they were very sneaky and creative, they worked together to help the man break out of the prison. They figured out how to remove locks and trick the people watching over the prison, so the man could leave without anyone noticing. But sometimes, plans do not go as well as we hope. This story is one of those times. After some days, the big people in charge found out that the man had escaped, and they knew it was because of his girlfriend and his sister. The people in charge were not very happy, so they decided that the girlfriend and the sister should be punished, too. They were taken to a special room where another big person, called a judge, listens to stories and decides who is right or wrong. The judge said that both the girlfriend and the sister were wrong to help the man, so they were sentenced, which means they were given a punishment. Now, the girlfriend and the sister must spend some time away from their families as a punishment for helping the man escape. They will have to stay in a special place where they can learn to follow the rules better. In the end, the man, his girlfriend, and his sister all learned an important lesson: it is best to follow the rules and be kind to everyone, instead of trying to sneak around and break the rules."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.
