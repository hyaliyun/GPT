Sentence: \\"Danny's new math textbook would not fit inside his old backpack, the...\\" Option i: \\"book was too narrow.\\" Option ii: \\"backpack was too narrow.\\" Step 1: Evaluate the context The sentence states that the new math textbook does not fit inside the old backpack. This means there's a size or space issue between these two objects. Step 2: Evaluate option i \\"The book was too narrow.\\" This option implies that the problem is with the book being too small, which doesn't make sense because a narrower book would have an easier time fitting in the backpack. Therefore, this option is not logically consistent with the context. Step 3: Evaluate option ii \\"The backpack was too narrow.\\" This option states that the problem is with the backpack being too small for the new textbook, which aligns with the context of the sentence. A narrow backpack would struggle to fit a larger book, making it a logical choice. Based on the evaluation of the given options and understanding the context, the most fitting sentence ending is: \\"Danny's new math textbook would not fit inside his old backpack, the backpack was too narrow.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the relationship between boiling points and intermolecular forces? How can the intermolecular forces of HCl be described? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose from: i. no ii. yes","completion":"Imagine you have a pot full of tiny toys, and these toys represent molecules. The toys are holding hands, and this is similar to the intermolecular forces. Now, imagine you want to remove some toys from the pot. You have to shake it harder if the toys are holding hands very tightly, which represents strong intermolecular forces. On the other hand, if the toys are holding hands loosely, you can remove them more easily, which represents weak intermolecular forces. Boiling point is like shaking this pot of toys to remove them (or turning liquid into gas). If the intermolecular forces are strong, it takes more energy (heat) to break them apart, which means a higher boiling point. If the forces are weak, less energy is needed, which means a lower boiling point. Now, let's talk about HCl. HCl is like two friends (the elements hydrogen and chlorine) holding hands. Their bond type is a special one called a polar covalent bond. In this bond, chlorine is bigger and stronger, so it pulls the electrons towards itself a bit more, making it slightly negative. On the other hand, hydrogen becomes slightly positive because it has fewer electrons near it. This creates a small force (called a dipole) that can attract other HCl molecules, forming intermolecular forces. Finally, about your last question, both of your questions are related, but they are different. The first one talks about boiling points and intermolecular forces in general, while the second one is specific about HCl.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the last names of the people who formed the Smashing Pumpkins? ? The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014. Chamberlin and Iha officially rejoined the band in February 2018. The reunited lineup released...

Here are the steps to solve the problem: Task: Find the remainder when the square of a number is divided by 6. Guidelines: 1. The number, when divided by 6, leaves a remainder of 3. 2. We have provided options for the remainder: a) 0, b) 1, c) 2, d) 3, e) 4 Solution: 1. Let the number be n. According to the guideline 1, n % 6 = 3. That means n can be written as n = 6k + 3 (where k is an integer). 2. We need to find the remainder when the square of the number (n^2) is divided by 6. 3. Now, we can substitute n from step 1 into the expression n^2: (6k + 3)^2. 4. Expand the expression: (6k + 3)^2 = 36k^2 + 36k + 9. 5. Now, we will find the remainder when this expression is divided by 6. (36k^2 + 36k + 9) % 6 = (36k^2 % 6) + (36k % 6) + (9 % 6). 6. Find the remainders individually: 36k^2 % 6 = 0 (as 36 is divisible by 6), 36k % 6 = 0 (again, as 36 is divisible by 6), 9 % 6 = 3. 7. Now, we sum these remainders: 0 + 0 + 3 = 3. So, the remainder when the square of the number is divided by 6 is 3. Therefore, the correct option is: Student: d) 3"},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -2476*y - 13382 = -257*y - 5780 + 36778 for y, we need to follow these steps: 1. Simplify the equation by combining constant terms on the right side of the equation: -2476*y - 13382 = -257*y + (36778 - 5780) -2476*y - 13382 = -257*y + 30998 2. Move the '-257*y' term to the left side of the equation by adding '257*y' to both sides: -2476*y + 257*y - 13382 = 30998 (-2476 + 257)*y - 13382 = 30998 -2219*y - 13382 = 30998 3.

He did not have a rich family. He was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Instead,my friend was always hard up for cash. He did not have much money. And the money he did earn was chicken feed -- very little. Sometimes Al even had to accept handouts,gifts from his family and friends. But do not get me wrong. My friend was not a deadbeat. He was not the kind of person who never paid the money he owed. He simply _ pennies. He was always very careful with the money he spent. In fact,he was often a cheapskate. He did not like to spend money. The worst times were when he was flat broke and had no money at all. One day,Al scraped together a few dollars for a lottery ticket. He thought he would never strike it rich or gain lots of money unexpectedly. But his combination of numbers was chosen and he won the lottery. He hit the jackpot. He won a great deal of money. Al was so excited. The first thing he did was buy a costly new ear. He splurged on the one thing that he normally would not buy. Then he started spending money on unnecessary things. He started to waste it. It was like he had money to burn. He had more money than he needed and it was burning a hole in his pocket so he spent it quickly. When we got together for a meal at a restaurant,Al paid every time. He would always foot the bill,and pick up the tab. He told me the money made him feel like a million dollars. He was very happy. But,Al spent too much money. Soon my friend was down and out again. He had no money left. He was back to being strapped for cash. He had spent his bottom dollar, his very last amount. He did not even build up a nest egg. He had not saved any of the money. I admit I do feel sorry for my friend. He had enough money to live like a king.

II. One should follow the fashion so that society is progressing.. III. One should follow the fashion so that people will have their own judgement.. IV. One should follow the fashion so that society will be boring.. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Fashion is a term commonly used to describe a style of clothing worn by most people of a country. A fashion usually keeps popular for 1-3 years and then is replaced by another fashion. Even though there are a lot of changes in fashion, most people do not easily hope for the changes. Nowadays more and more young people prefer following the fashion. On this phenomenon , different people have different opinions. It is held that one should follow the fashion so as not to be looked down or seem strange. But it is also held that one should have his or her own judgement . Those who hold the first opinion think that society is progessing and one should get used to the changes. In their opinions, if everyone always follows the old fashion, there won't be any change and naturally there won't be much progress. However, those who hold the second view think that one shouldn't follow the fashion without having his or her own judgement and characters. As for me, I agree with the second opinion. Of course, it's good for people to keep up with the fashion, but this is not to say that people should follow the fashion blindly . If all the people follow the same fashion, there will be no variety and the whole society will be boring. Question: According to those who hold the first view, why should one follow the fashion?

During flu season people flocked to the pharmacies to buy aspirin but not medication because the OPT: (1). aspirin was sold out.. (2). medication was sold out..","completion":"(2). medication was sold out. During the peak of the flu season in the small town of Glenfield, people flocked to the local pharmacies to buy aspirin but not medication because the medication was sold out. The pharmaceutical companies had underestimated the demand, and with delivery delays, the stock had quickly depleted. The locals were left to rely on over-the-counter pain relievers like aspirin to alleviate their symptoms. Meanwhile, Glenfield's town council took notice of the situation and held an emergency meeting to discuss potential solutions. The mayor, Gwen Hawthorne, was concerned for her town's well-being. Glenfield was a close-knit community, and many of the locals were getting more sick by the day. Gwen initiated a temporary healthcare committee that was tasked with quickly finding an alternative solution. The members consisted of local doctors, pharmacists, and healthcare consultants, including Dr. Mike Novak, pharmacist Beth Landon, and healthcare consultant Jim Stevens. The team quickly got to work, brainstorming different approaches to ease the situation. Some sought to expedite the delivery of medications, while others proposed contacting surrounding towns to check for available stock. Jim Stevens, a seasoned healthcare consultant, recommended reaching out to local medicine-making practices, suggesting that traditional remedies could alleviate the burden on the pharmaceutical supply. The committee members divided tasks, with Dr. Novak and Beth Landon contacting nearby towns and pharmacies, while Jim Stevens worked on connecting with local herbal medicine practitioners. A few days later, Dr. Novak secured a limited supply of the necessary medication from a neighboring town, Butte Springs, scheduled for delivery within the week. However, that wouldn't be enough to cover the needs of the town's population. Meanwhile, Jim met with Martin Jamison, a local herbalist who had a wealth of knowledge about plant-based remedies that could be used to counter the symptoms of the flu. Martin shared recipes for various herbal teas and extracts that could alleviate congestion and soothe sore throats. He even taught the community how to make their own homemade syrups using ingredients like honey, lemon, and ginger. Gwen decided that investing in these alternative solutions would be a wise move for the town, and she organized workshops for locals to learn about the power of herbal medicine. By the following weekend, Glenfield's community hall was filled with concerned residents who eagerly participated in the workshops, learning from Martin and practicing their newfound skills. Word spread quickly, and as the herbal remedies began to ease the pressure on medical supplies, Glenfield locals supported one another in their time of need. Neighbors shared their homemade teas, syrups, and remedies, forming an even stronger sense of community. Within a few weeks, the flu outbreak was on the decline, and thanks to the collaborative efforts of everyone involved, recovery was swift. Although the town still needed modern medicine, the flu season had taught the people of Glenfield the importance of local resources and the power of unity. Residents gained a new appreciation for herbal remedies, which continued to thrive as a supplementary practice in the town. The healthcare committee remained active, consistently working on improving the local healthcare system and keeping an eye on the town's well-being. In the end, the flu season that threatened to overwhelm the small town of Glenfield had unexpectedly brought the residents closer together. It had ignited a sense of empowerment, resilience, and comradery among the people who had lived in fear of the illness. They had found strength in one another and learned to collaborate for the greater good of their community, leaving a lasting impact on Glenfield's future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which would be a better option, a vehicle loan or a credit card? Second question: Can you buy online and pay with a credit card in installments? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: When deciding between a vehicle loan and a credit card for purchasing a bike, several factors should be considered to determine the better option for your specific situation. 1. Interest rates: Vehicle loans tend to have lower interest rates compared to credit cards. Therefore, opting for a vehicle loan may be more cost-effective in the long run. However, it's essential to compare the rates offered by multiple lenders to get the best deal possible. 2. Loan term (duration): Vehicle loans typically have a fixed repayment schedule, often ranging from 2 to 5 years. This allows you to spread the cost of the bike over a more extended period. Credit cards, on the other hand, provide more flexibility in terms of repayment, but this can lead to higher interest costs if you only pay the minimum amount each month. 3. Approval requirements: Vehicle loans may come with stricter application processes and credit score requirements compared to credit cards. You might need to provide proof of income, employment history, and a credit check to qualify for a loan. If you don't meet these requirements, you may find it difficult to get a vehicle loan. 4. Ownership: When you purchase a bike through a vehicle loan, the lender holds the ownership of the bike as collateral until you have paid off the loan in full. In contrast, with a credit card, you are the owner of the bike upfront. 5. Additional fees and charges: Vehicle loans may come with application, processing, and prepayment penalties that you should be aware of. Credit cards may also have fees, such as annual fees or foreign transaction fees, depending on the card you choose. Considering these factors will help you determine whether a vehicle loan or a credit card is a better option for purchasing a bike on installments. Second question: Yes, you can buy a bike online and pay with a credit card in installments. Many online retailers offer various payment options, including installments via credit card or third-party financing options. These financing options may come with promotional offers, such as 0% interest for a specified period or deferred interest. These two questions are related, but they are not asking the same thing. The first question is about comparing vehicle loans and credit cards for purchasing a bike, while the second question focuses on using a credit card to pay for a bike online in installments specifically.

Once an elite cadre of glamorous pros catering almost exclusively to well-heeled passengers, they now have to face the grumblings of overcrowded masses while wearing unflattering polyester suits. Virgin Atlantic wants to restore some lost dignity, however, with redesigned uniforms by the British fashion icon Vivienne Westwood. The partnership with Richard Branson’s airline updates the wardrobe of in-flight and ground employees, bringing elegance and tailored touches to uniforms that had grown boxy and generic. But don’t expect the punk-infused haute couture that has become Westwood’s signature; the new uniforms play it relatively safe. Instead of referencing space-age travel, Westwood channeled the feminine silhouettes of 1940s French fashion. For female flight attendants, Westwood created a jacket inspired by an early-1990s design featuring a nipped-in waist and an oversize high collar in Virgin’s signature red. A matching pencil skirt includes the most daring detail: darted seams that emphasize the bum. A red double-breasted overcoat, a handbag and hourglass heels (offered in three heights) complete the vintage-looking ensemble. Pants do not seem to be an option. One can argue that Westwood brought sexiness back into stewardess attire, but is that something that should be applauded? Gianfranco Ferré for Korean Air and Christian Lacroix for Air France both managed to inject modern sophistication into airline uniforms without remaking flight attendants into temptresses. Men get a more dignified makeover: a three-piece suit in a deep burgundy Oxford weave wool. The standard trouser is an au courant slim cut, though regular fit is also available. Lads also get a classic Oxford shoe in matte black leather with a polished toe. Here, the red is an accent color, showing up only in the jacquard fabric tie. Many items in the new uniforms will be made from sustainable materials, including a polyester yarn made from recycled plastic bottles. The new threads, which will be worn by more than 7,500 staff, will officially take flight on Sept. 1.

As he continues, he alternates between using the comb to lift his hair at various angles and the scissors to make precise cuts that reduce bulk and soften any harsh lines. With each snip, his skill and experience shine, as he meticulously sculpts the shape of his hairstyle. The fallen hair begins to accumulate on the floor, forming a testament to his progress. He occasionally dampens his hair with water from a spray bottle, allowing him to better manage the strands and easily separate them during the cutting process. This also ensures a more accurate gauge of the hair's true length once it dries.

He employs the mirror to inspect his work from multiple angles, making any necessary adjustments to guarantee the outcome is harmonious and well-balanced. He pays particular attention to the hair around the ears and the nape, using the comb's fine teeth to gather and lift the hair before carefully trimming away any excess length. Aware that these areas are more sensitive and visible, he proceeds with caution and deliberation. Brushing off stray hairs from time to time, he slowly starts to envision the final result taking shape.

This choice was driven by several factors that made the country house more appealing to her. First, Mom has always been an avid horse lover, and living in the country would provide her with ample opportunities to not only own horses but also to engage in various horse-related activities. She could easily build a stable for her horses, create a riding arena, and have direct access to trails and paths that would be perfect for riding. Additionally, living in the country would offer a peaceful and serene environment that is often hard to find in bustling cities. This would allow her to maintain a healthier lifestyle, with less exposure to noise pollution and the stress that comes with urban living. She could take up gardening, cultivate some fruit trees, go for nature walks, and indulge in an overall slower pace of life that would be both mentally and physically beneficial. Moreover, Mom also appreciated the close-knit community aspect that often comes with living in rural areas. She believed that fostering strong relationships with neighbors and participating in local events would help her family create lasting connections and feel more integrated and supported. This sense of belonging and companionship is sometimes lacking in the city, which can feel isolating despite the bustle. Another factor in her decision was the potential for a larger living space, both indoors and outdoors, that could be found in the country. This not only suited her desire to keep horses but also provided more room for her family to grow and thrive. Children could have more space to play and explore outdoors, and even family pets would benefit from the freedom offered by a rural house. Finally, the country would offer an opportunity for her to contribute directly to her family's well-being by growing fresh produce and keeping a few chickens for eggs. This would provide her family with healthy, organic food and a level of self-sufficiency that would be difficult to achieve in a city home. In summary, Mom chose the house in the country because she liked horses, as well as for the numerous benefits that this lifestyle would provide her and her family. From more space and a healthier environment to a sense of community and the possibility to engage in fulfilling, nature-based hobbies, living in the country was a choice that aligned more closely with her values and priorities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choose the next sentence for this paragraph. (CNN) -- It's unlikely commercial aviation stories in 2014 will surpass those of 2013 for pizzazz or significance. This is probably a good thing. Who could have foreseen the three-month grounding of the entire Boeing 787 fleet when we forecast events for 2013? We were only 16 days into 2013 when 50 787s worldwide were grounded following a battery fire on a Japan Air Lines 787 and a near-fire occurred days later on an ANA 787 flight. Boeing Co. ended the year with embarrassing, dysfunctional standoff with its largest union, the International Association of Machinists District 751, over where the 777X (successor to the popular 777 airliner now in service) will be built. An EIS date slip from the original plan of December 2013 to mid-2015 (a period of about 18 months) would put the aircraft on a par with the A350's delays, but well ahead of the 3 Â½ years of delays for OPTIONS: - 777X's 787. - A350-800's 787. - ANA 787's 787. - Airbus's 787. - Boeing's 787. - Boeing 787's 787. - Boeing Co.'s 787. - Bombardier's 787. - CNN's 787. - International Association of Machinists District 751's 787. - Japan Air Lines's 787.","completion":"Boeing's 787. The correct answer is \\"Boeing's 787\\" because the paragraph is discussing delays in the aviation industry, specifically relating to Boeing and its aircraft models like the 787. Now, let's explain why the other options are wrong: 1. 777X's 787: This option is incorrect because the 777X is a different aircraft model from the 787, and the sentence should discuss the delays of Boeing's 787. 2. A350-800's 787: This option is wrong because the A350 is an aircraft made by Airbus, not Boeing, and it's not relevant to the topic in the paragraph. 3. ANA 787's 787: This doesn't make sense because ANA is an airline, and the sentence needs to refer to the delays of the aircraft model. 4. Airbus's 787: This option is incorrect because Airbus doesn't manufacture the 787 - this is a Boeing aircraft. 5. Boeing 787's 787: This is a repetitive statement, and it doesn't make sense. 6. Boeing Co.'s 787: This is very close to the correct answer, but it should be \\"Boeing's 787\\" for better consistency with the rest of the paragraph. 7. Bombardier's 787: This is wrong because Bombardier is another company that doesn't manufacture the 787 - that's a Boeing aircraft. 8. CNN's 787: This doesn't make sense because CNN is a news network, not an aircraft manufacturer or an airline. 9. International Association of Machinists District 751's 787: This is incorrect because it refers to the union involved in a dispute with Boeing, not the actual delay of the aircraft. 10.

Then, she brings back with her a gypsy fortune teller, Madame Zimba [Adeline DeWalt Reynolds]. Finally, she has invited Hungarian Count Alucard [Lon Chaney, Jr] to be a guest at Dark Oaks, the southern plantation where Kay lives with her father Colonel Caldwell [George Irving] and her sister Claire [Evelyn Ankers].On the night of Alucard's arrival, Kay throws a welcome party. But only Alucard's baggage arrives on the train; no Alucard. Madame Zimba warns Kay that Alucard is not who he says he is and that death looms over Dark Oaks. True to her word, Madame Zimba suddenly dies of a heart attack after seeing a bat. Later that evening, Colonel Caldwell also dies of a heart attack, and Alucard arrives at Dark Oaks.Days later, at the reading of the will, it is discovered that Kay inherits the plantation and Claire all the money. With no resources to care for the plantation, Kay should be worried, but she is not. In fact, she admits that this is the way she wants it. In addition, Kay does not intend anymore to marry Frank and appears to be seeing Alucard, but no one can find out where Alucard is staying or what happened to the two large boxes that arrived with his baggage. Claire and Dr. Harry Brewster [Frank Craven] wonder if Kay might be insane, and Brewster calls his Hungarian friend Professor Lazlo [J. Edward Bromberg] to inquire about the legitimacy of Count Alucard. Could he really be Count Dracula?One night Kay goes into the swamp where Alucard issues forth from a coffin buried under the water.

LaBoeuf proposes to team up with Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in Texas for killing the senator.

Therefore, the answer to the question would be case B: the modern farming facility. Let's delve deeper into these topics to understand why. In case A, John visits the Amish country, known for their traditional farming practices. Amish farming typically involves manual or horse-drawn equipment, crop rotation, and organic or natural methods of pest and weed control rather than the synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides that are common in industrial farming. These farming methods have a lower risk to contaminate groundwater because there's less chemical input to leach into the ground and possibly reach the water table. Furthermore, traditional Amish farming techniques often involve cover cropping and other practices that improve soil health and reduce runoff, further protecting the water quality. In contrast, in case B, John visits a modern farm that uses chemical fertilizers and pesticides. These contribute significantly to groundwater contamination. Pesticides, which are substances used to eliminate pests, can be extremely harmful to various forms of life including humans, especially when they infiltrate the water supply. Fertilizers can also seep into the groundwater, leading to contamination. The chemicals, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, common in many fertilizers, can cause a form of pollution known as nutrient pollution. These nutrients stimulate an overgrowth of algae, which uses up oxygen and can kill marine life. When the fertilizers and pesticides are used in excess, the plants can't absorb everything. The excess then washes from the fields into the groundwater or into nearby rivers and/or lakes, potentially contaminating the water that wildlife and humans depend on. The modern farming facility's practices of using heavy amounts of pesticides and fertilizers can lead to non-point source pollution, a type of water pollution that's hard to trace back to a single point because it comes from many sources. This pollution can spread out over a large area, affecting the groundwater beneath. In conclusion, it is more likely that the groundwater under the modern farming facility (case B) would be more contaminated than that under the Amish farmland (case A) due to the extensive use of chemicals in contemporary farming methods. So John's study is identifying a crucial factor affecting groundwater contamination: the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides in modern farming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The section whose liquid crystalline range corresponds to the temperature of the body becomes translucent (here shown in green), indicating the temperature. We also see the effect of liquid crystals in nature. Iridescent green beetles, known as jewel beetles, change color because of the light-reflecting properties of the cells that make up their external skeletons, not because of light absorption from their pigment. The cells form helices with a structure like those found in cholesteric liquid crystals. When the pitch of the helix is close to the wavelength of visible light, the cells reflect light with wavelengths that lead to brilliant metallic colors. Because a color change occurs depending on a person’s angle of view, researchers in New Zealand are studying the beetles to develop a thin material that can be used as a currency security measure. The automobile industry is also interested in exploring such materials for use in paints that would change color at different viewing angles. With only molecular structure as a guide, one cannot precisely predict which of the various liquid crystalline phases a given compound will actually form. One can, however, identify molecules containing the kinds of structural features that tend to result in liquid crystalline behavior, as demonstrated in Example 11.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Lactose Lactose is known as milk sugar because it occurs in the milk of humans, cows, and other mammals. In fact, the natural synthesis of lactose occurs only in mammary tissue, whereas most other carbohydrates are plant products. Human milk contains about 7.5% lactose, and cow’s milk contains about 4.5%. This sugar is one of the lowest ranking in terms of sweetness, being about one-sixth as sweet as sucrose (seeTable 16.1 \\"The Relative Sweetness of Some Compounds (Sucrose = 100)\\" in Section 16.3 \\"Important Hexoses\\"). Lactose is produced commercially from whey, a by-product in the manufacture of cheese. It is important as an infant food and in the production of penicillin. Lactose is a reducing sugar composed of one molecule of D-galactose and one molecule of D-glucose joined by a β-1,4-glycosidic bond (the bond from the anomeric carbon of the first monosaccharide unit being directed upward). The two monosaccharides are obtained from lactose by acid hydrolysis or the catalytic action of the enzyme lactase:. Q: Where does the natural synthesis of lactose occur?

Equation: -32*a = -46 - 18 Step 1: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. -46 and -18 are like terms since they are both constants. -46 - 18 = -64 So now, our equation becomes: -32*a = -64 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'a' by dividing both sides of the equation by -32. To do this, we will perform the following operation: (-32*a) / (-32) = -64 / (-32) On the left side of the equation, -32 in the numerator and -32 in the denominator will cancel each other out, leaving just 'a': a = -64 / (-32) Step 3: Simplify the right side of the equation. The right side of the equation consists of two negative numbers being divided: -64 / (-32) Since dividing two negative numbers gives a positive result: 64 / 32 Now, we'll divide 64 by 32: 64 / 32 = 2 So, the final simplified equation is: a = 2 The solution to the equation -32*a = -46 - 18 is a = 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: HONESDALE, Pa. (AP) — A 10-year-old boy charged with fatally beating a 90-year-old woman remained in adult prison Wednesday after his lawyer withdrew a request for bail, saying his family isn't ready to have him released into their custody. The boy, who is charged as an adult with criminal homicide, appeared via a video hookup for a hearing, burying his face in his hands at times but not speaking. The boy's family believes he is being treated well at the county prison, where he is being housed alone in a cell and being kept away from the general population, said his attorney, Bernard Brown. He said the boy was being provided recreational opportunities and coloring books. Brown had filed a petition to have the boy released into the custody of his father or moved to a juvenile detention facility. But he said the family was not comfortable having him placed in their care right now. He didn't elaborate on the reasons. The closest juvenile detention center is 80 miles away, which would make family visits inconvenient, Brown said. Judge Raymond Hamill said he was also concerned about moving the boy to a juvenile center and exposing him to \\"elements more detrimental to his well-being.\\" The attorney still plans to seek to have the case transferred to juvenile court. The boy is among the youngest charged with homicide in Pennsylvania, a list that includes two 11-year-olds and a 9-year-old, said Marsha Levick, chief counsel of the Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia. Levick said the case belongs in juvenile court, calling it a \\"no-brainer.\\" \\"He's a little boy,\\" she said. \\"It's a horrible tragedy, but it's shocking that he suddenly turned into an adult because of conduct that he engaged in.\\" Prosecutors had said that they had no choice but to charge him as an adult. In Pennsylvania, homicide charges must be filed in adult court. Judges can then move the cases to juvenile court when deemed appropriate. District Attorney Janine Edwards said she will wait for the results of a mental health evaluation before deciding whether to contest having the case moved to juvenile court. Detectives who executed a search of the boy's cell Wednesday turned up a piece of notebook paper with the words \\"How to Escape\\" on it, a court document showed. But the prosecutor told The Wayne Independent in Honesdale that nothing else of significance was found on the paper. The beating Saturday occurred at the home of the boy's grandfather, who had been caring for the woman, Helen Novak. According to the boy's mother, her son said he lost his temper when he went into the woman's room to ask her a question and she yelled at him. Authorities said the boy briefly held Novak down with a cane and then punched her in the throat and stomach. The boy told a state trooper that he was \\"only trying to hurt her,\\" but also acknowledged, \\"I killed that lady,\\" according to the arrest affidavit. ||||| Wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, ten-year-old Tristen Kurilla appeared at the Wayne County courthouse only by video-conference Wednesday. He kept his head in his hands as his attorney withdrew a request to have him released from prison. \\"Their family just doesn't feel comfortable for numerous reasons, not only of the supervision, of work, of everything but also in a concern of Ms. Novak and her family too\\" said Bernie Brown, Defense Attorney The decision means the ten-year-old will remain behind bars in Wayne County. Kurilla is accused of using a walking stick to choke 90-year-old Helen Novak inside this home in Damascus Township Saturday. The boy also allegedly punched the woman five times in the throat. The boy has already spent two nights in jail. \\"He is not in general population. He is not in solitary confinement and he is not in isolation. He is in a cell which I believe is next to the infirmary where he can come and go from the cell to the infirmary. He is under 24 hour supervision\\" said Janine Edwards, Wayne County District Attorney Kurilla's attorney Bernie Brown says the boy understands where he is and what has happened but is focused more on things a normal ten year old would be, referencing his prison outfit and not the possible life sentence he could face. \\"He talked about that being a Halloween costume and that he'd probably never wear that as a Halloween costume because that's what most kids his age are thinking about right now\\" Brown says he expects to file a request to have this case moved to juvenile court by Thursday. That would put the decision on how this case proceeds in the hands of a judge. \\"At that time, experts have to be involved to evaluate the defendant and we would go from there with a hearing being set. I can't guess for you what the time frame would be\\" said District Attorney Janine Edwards ||||| Summary:","completion":"A 10-year-old boy has been charged with fatally beating a 90-year-old woman and is currently being held in an adult prison.

Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a sentence that justifies which noun phrase the pronoun refers to. Correct reasons do not need to use all the knowledge from the sentence. The resolution of the pronoun coreference relations typically involve one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. You should answer 'Correct' if the reasoning made sense, otherwise, you should answer 'Wrong'. Teacher: Now, understand the problem?

The application will include stories that range from the humorous to the dramatic and plugs into Facebook, he said. Fifty percent of 14 to 24 year olds have been the target of some form of digital abuse and 30 percent have sent or received nude photos of other young people on their cell phones or online, according to a December study released by MTV and the Associated Press. Twelve percent of those who have sexted have contemplated suicide, which is four times higher than those who haven't, the study concluded. In a recent example, a Massachusetts boy sold nude images of his girlfriend to classmates for 5. Police said his action (as well as the girl's sexting him the photo) could violate child pornography laws because she is in eighth grade.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Pick your answer from: [-] Yes [-] No Q: If I tell you that An animal requires food to grow and heal, and ask you the question \\"what does an animal require to grow and heal?\\", is the correct answer \\"pH\\"? A:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"pH\\". When you're asked about what an animal requires to grow and heal, referring to \\"pH\\" would not provide a complete or largely accurate answer. The pH, which stands for potential Hydrogen, is a scale used to specify the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution. While it's true that animals' bodies do require a certain pH balance to maintain their metabolic functions effectively, it is not the primary factor when it comes to growth or healing. Instead, these processes primarily depend on nutrients and energy that animals get from their food. Animals need a well-balanced diet to grow effectively. Growth occurs as animals intake food and utilize the nutrients and energy this food provides. For instance, proteins are critical for growth as they provide the necessary amino acids for the building of tissues and muscles, carbohydrates supply the energy required to fuel processes such as growth, and vitamins and minerals are essential for various bodily functions and biochemical reactions. Similarly, when it comes to healing, the type and amount of food animals eat is also equally important. After an injury or illness, animals need additional nutrients to repair damaged tissues and restore their health. Proteins are vital as they are the building blocks of tissue repair and regeneration. Certain minerals like zinc and vitamins such as Vitamin C and Vitamin A are also important for wound healing. So, the primary requirement for an animal's growth and healing is not pH, but rather adequate and nutritious food. pH levels within the body have their role in overall health, but they are maintained by the body's buffer systems and aren't directly influenced in the same way as growth or healing through food consumption. Thus, while maintaining the correct pH balance within the body is a key part of overall health, it is not the direct answer to what an animal requires to grow and heal. That would be nutrient-rich food."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Tara Brady. Guilty: Sir George Castledine started a relationship with an 83-year-old widow out of sexual desire and financial greed, a panel has ruled. A knighted nurse who had an affair with an 83-year-old widow he was counselling following the death of her husband was struck off today. Sir George Castledine, 67, declared his love for the recently bereaved woman, known during regular visits to her home and called her ‘my little tinkerbell.’ Sir George, who shook his head as the decision was announced, has been thrown out of the profession and cannot apply to be restored to the register for five years. Susan Hurds, NMC panel chairman said: ‘Your actions represent a serious departure from the standards expected from a registered nurse. ‘You have been dishonest during the course of this investigation and were deliberately evasive and inconsistent while giving evidence. ‘You have shown no remorse for your actions and the effect they have had on Patient A and her family. ‘You have a distinguished career of over 40 years as an author, clinician, educator and mentor and have made a substantial contribution to the nursing profession, including care for older people. ‘The misconduct was wide-ranging and continued beyond the limits outlined in the charges, you continued to see Patient A after receiving written instructions not to. ‘You sought to mislead the panel and you lied to the panel during these proceedings. ‘During your evidence to the panel you tried to blame Patient A for pestering you. ‘You have failed to satisfy the panel that you are remorseful and that there will be no repetition of the misconduct. ‘Your actions are so serious as to be fundamentally incompatible with your remaining on the register. ‘A striking off order is the only proportionate sanction.’ Sir George Castledine declared his love for the recently bereaved woman and told her he needed to work out at the gym so he could 'make love' to her. Treatment: Sir George first started working with the widow at Onneley House in Birmingham in November 2008. He denied that his behaviour was motivated by financial gain or sexual desire - but a committee sitting at the Old Bailey in London has now ruled that this was in fact false. Sir George regularly visited the elderly patient and showered her with gifts and flowers, accepting thousands of pounds in return. The woman's family became so concerned about his behaviour that they bugged her phone - and heard him calling her 'Tinkerbell' and saying he had to go to the gym or he 'wouldn't be able to make love' to her. NMC panel chairman Susan Hurds said today that he had 'manipulated a vulnerable patient' while motivated by sexual gratification and greed. She added that the woman, known as 'Patient A', was 'clearly grief-stricken' following the death of her husband, and needed bereavement counselling which Sir George was not qualified to give. 'You gave evidence which the panel often found difficult to believe,' Mrs Hurds told Sir George. 'You lacked consistency in your response, added evidence and altered your story as it suited you. 'We concluded that you lied at the outset of the investigation and as the hearing continued. As evidence was put before you you modified your account. 'The panel finds it incredible that the endearments and erotic language you used at no other time than on the occasions on the tape. 'You were deliberately evasive and not consistent but intentionally changed your story.' She added: 'The persistent nature of the telephone calls, late at night and early in the morning and the giving of gifts and eating together in an intimate setting were sexually motivated.' Sir George - who was knighted in 2007. - first treated the woman in November 2008 at Onneley House in. Birmingham, part of the Institute of Ageing and Health. After. the patient told her two daughters that she had begun an affair with. the married father of three, they bugged her phone and were horrified to. hear his repeated professions of love. Distinguished: Sir George was knighted by the Queen in a 2007 ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Mrs Hurds said that the sisters acted solely out of concern for their mother, and were not motivated by financial gain. Sir George, currently a visiting professor at Glyndwr University in Wrexham, insisted that his chats with Patient A were nothing more than 'banter'. He told the hearing: 'Some of the phone calls later were sexual in some respects but it wasn't an offer of having sex with somebody or anything like that. 'One of the times I spoke to her she was having some trouble so I called her and on the telephone we would have banter. It was a befriending role that I had and I was befriending her.' The nurse had previously admitted the contents of his conversations with the woman, and confessed that he had continued to see her even after he was told not to by an official. Sir George formerly sat on the Welsh board of a predecessor to the NMC, and helped draw up the code of conduct for nursing which he has now breached. He is a former assistant dean of the nursing faculty at Birmingham City University, and an ex-consultant at Dudley Group of Hospitals. Highlights:","completion":"1.

(Samim Aktar) Farakka: A homemaker in Murshidabad's Lalgola has lodged a police complaint, accusing her husband and in-laws of getting her right kidney removed in exchange for money on the pretext of an appendicitis operation at a Calcutta nursing home two years back. Rita Haldar, a 28-year-old homemaker, lodged the complaint with the Farakka police on February 2, naming her husband Biswajit Sarkar, mother-in-law and brother-in-law. When the woman had complained of an abdomen pain two years ago, Sarkar discussed the matter with his mother and brother and took her to Calcutta for treatment. \\"Before going to the doctor in Calcutta, we had put up at a relative's house. I was given soft drink at the home, after which I felt drowsy. We went to a nursing home to consult the doctor who told me that I needed immediate operation for appendicitis. The next day, I was operated on,\\" said Rita. After a few months, the homemaker started feeling unwell. \\"I went to Siliguri to visit a cousin. I started having a lower back pain and visited a doctor at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH) who prescribed an ultra-sonography. The USG revealed my right kidney is missing. I was shattered,\\" said Rita. The woman who has an 11-year-old son underwent another USG at a nursing home in Malda and confirmed that her right kidney was missing. Both the USG reports say: \\"Right kidney not visualised.\\" The Telegraph is in possession of the two reports. The USG reports also revealed that Rita's left kidney had become enlarged. \\"Doctors at the NBMCH told me that there was infection in the left kidney,\\" said Rita. Inspector-in-charge of Farakka, Udayshankar Ghosh, said: \\"We suspect the involvement of a racket. A case was registered under provisions of the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act. We have also charged three persons with attempt to murder and bride torture.\\" Contacted, her husband, Sarkar, a trader, said his wife had donated a kidney to a person from Raipur in Chhattisgarh. \\"She had even signed a consent letter,\\" he added.# Asked how he had got in touch with the Raipur person, he disconnected the phone. Told about her husband's claim that she had donated her kidney, Rita said: \\"I knew nothing about this. I was definitely drugged and don't remember signing any paper.\\" ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The victim alleges she had her kidney removed without her knowledge An Indian woman's husband and brother-in-law have been arrested after she told police they stole one of her kidneys in lieu of a dowry. Local media report that the West Bengal woman's husband arranged an appendicitis surgery when she was suffering stomach pain two year ago. Late in 2017, two separate medical examinations revealed she was in fact missing one of her kidneys. She alleges that her husband had frequently made demands for a dowry. The payment of dowries - traditionally paid from a bride's family to a husband's - has been banned in India since 1961. Speaking to Indian media, the alleged victim, Rita Sarkar, said she had been the victim of domestic abuse over the dowry issue for many years. \\"My husband took me to a private nursing home in Kolkata, where he and the medical staff told me that I would be fine after removing my inflamed appendix through surgery,\\" the Hindustan Times quoted her as saying. \\"My husband warned me not to disclose the surgery in Kolkata to anyone.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In Cairo, the BBC spoke to those involved in the illegal kidney trade Months later, she was feeling unwell and taken to a doctor by members of her family.

Translate to English English:","completion":"Let's now create new job opportunities in future environmentally friendly industries instead of protecting the old industries of the past. In the face of numerous environmental challenges, it's essential for any economy to prioritize sustainable growth and invest in the future. The focus should be on promoting environmentally friendly industries that can positively contribute to the well-being of both the planet and its inhabitants. By adopting this approach, we can create new job opportunities and drive innovation that would lead us to a more promising future. There are several reasons why it's crucial to prioritize environmentally friendly industries: 1. Mitigating climate change: Numerous industrial processes emit harmful gases, including carbon dioxide, which contribute to the greenhouse effect. By focusing on green industries, we can reduce these emissions and work towards a cleaner, healthier environment. 2. Conserving resources: Traditional industries often use resources inefficiently and, in many cases, those resources are non-renewable. Eco-friendly industries, on the other hand, typically prioritize the efficient use of resources and the adoption of renewable and sustainable alternatives. 3. Enhancing biodiversity: Deforestation, pollution, and habitat destruction caused by some industries have led to a decrease in biodiversity. Environmentally friendly industries, however, work towards preserving ecosystems and maintaining ecological balance. 4. Improving human health: Air, water, and soil pollution from certain industries negatively impact human health. By promoting green industries, we can help ensure a safer living environment for everyone. To create new job opportunities in environmentally friendly industries, three strategies can be used: 1. Investments: Both government and private sector entities should fund research and development in areas focused on sustainable growth, such as renewable energy, circular economy projects, and eco-friendly agriculture. This will create job opportunities and encourage entrepreneurship in these sectors. 2. Education and training: An essential element of fostering any new industry is having a workforce prepared for it. Governments and educational institutions must ensure that necessary educational and training programs are in place to prepare individuals for careers in green industries. Moreover, re-training programs should be provided for those transitioning from traditional industries. 3. Incentives and policies: Policies such as tax breaks, grants, and subsidies can incentivize businesses to invest in environmentally friendly sectors. Governments should also consider adopting regulations and guidelines that encourage the sustainable use of resources and reduce pollution. By focusing on the growth of environmentally friendly industries and letting go of old industries that do not contribute positively to environmental health, we can create new job opportunities, protect our planet, and build a more sustainable future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is some data: Barny Cakes DISH_VARIATION Strawberry; Barny Cakes PROTEIN 1.8 g; Barny Cakes FAT 4.8 g; Barny Cakes CARBOHYDRATE 18.0 g. Generate a detailed description of this data.","completion":"This data presents nutritional information for a specific type of snack known as Barny Cakes. Barny Cakes are a popular food item that consists primarily of a cake base with various fillings or toppings, providing consumers with a delicious and convenient snack option. In this particular case, the dish variation mentioned is \\"Strawberry,\\" suggesting that the Barny Cake has a distinct strawberry flavor as a key feature of its taste profile. The nutritional properties of these Strawberry Barny Cakes can be broken down into three primary macronutrients: proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. 1. Proteins: Proteins are essential building blocks for the body, playing a vital role in muscle growth, tissue repair, and enzyme creation. In each serving of Strawberry Barny Cakes, there is 1.8 grams of protein content. For the average adult, the recommended daily intake of protein may vary depending on factors such as body weight, activity level, and gender. However, a general guideline for protein intake ranges from 46 to 56 grams per day. Given this information, consuming a Strawberry Barny Cake contributes a modest amount of protein to an individual's daily requirement. 2. Fats: Fats fall into a few different categories: saturated, unsaturated, and trans fats. Saturated and trans fats are typically considered unhealthy, as they can raise LDL (\\"bad\\") cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, can improve heart health and provide necessary energy to the body. The Strawberry Barny Cakes currently contain 4.8 grams of fat per serving. Without details regarding the specific type of fat present in the product, it's difficult to assess the health impact of this macronutrient. However, it is advisable to consume fats in moderation and also choose sources of healthy fats when possible. 3. Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates serve as a pivotal source of energy for the body and can be found in various forms, including sugars, starches, and fibers. The Strawberry Barny Cakes provide 18.0 grams of carbohydrates per serving, which may contain some combination of these different forms. Carbohydrate needs for an individual can vary based on factors such as age, sex, weight, and activity level. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that 45-65% of daily calorie intake should come from carbohydrates. Therefore, this snack contributes a reasonable amount of carbohydrates to an individual's daily consumption, and it's essential to consider other carbohydrate sources and total daily intake to maintain a balanced diet. In summary, the provided data offers a glimpse into the nutritional value of Strawberry Barny Cakes. With 1.8 grams of protein, 4.8 grams of fat, and 18.0 grams of carbohydrates per serving, these cakes serve as a source of essential macronutrients, although it's vital to monitor intake, especially regarding specific types of fats and additional carbohydrate sources. As always, it is crucial to adopt a balanced diet, incorporating various food items to meet the nutritional needs and maintain proper health."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer.

The house had bad insulation in the bathroom but not in the bedroom, so the","completion":"bathroom always felt colder than the bedroom. This made taking a bath or a shower very chilly, especially during the winter months when it's freezing outside. One day, Tom, a little boy, decided that he wanted to fix the insulation in the bathroom, so he could take a nice warm bath. To understand his plan, let's first talk about insulation. Insulation is like a big blanket that keeps your house warm by not allowing the heat to escape outside. The bigger and fluffier the blanket is, the more it keeps you warm, just like during bedtime when the blanket keeps you warm while you're sleeping. So, Tom thought to himself, \\"What can I use to make the bathroom's insulation better?\\" He looked around his house for materials that could act like a big, warm blanket for his bathroom. He saw fluffy towels, blankets, and even some old clothes that he thought might work. He started hanging up the fluffy towels and blankets on the walls of the bathroom, and even stuffed some clothes in the tiny gaps where the cold air was sneaking in. It took him all day, but finally, he managed to cover every wall of the bathroom. The next day, Tom decided to take a bath to see if his insulation plan worked. He filled the tub with warm water and bubbles, and slowly stepped in. To his surprise, the bathroom felt much warmer than before! Tom had successfully made the bathroom more insulated and cozy. Tom's creative solution had worked, and he happily shared the news with his family. From then on, they all enjoyed warm baths and showers throughout the cold winter months, all thanks to Tom's clever idea and hard work on improving the bathroom's insulation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the two facts above, what cannot reproduce by themselves? Possible answers: + fungi + insects + influenza + Leptospirosis + bacteria + ferns + mammals + acetic acid Answer:","completion":"Influenza viruses cannot reproduce by themselves. The first fact states that viruses cannot reproduce by themselves. This includes all viruses, not just a specific type or family. Viruses need a host cell to reproduce, as they lack the necessary cellular machinery to do so. They infect a host cell and hijack its replication machinery to create copies of themselves, which can then go on to infect new host cells. The second fact specifically mentions influenza viruses, which are a part of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Just like other viruses, influenza viruses also rely on host cells for their reproduction. They typically infect epithelial cells in the respiratory tract of humans and animals, using the host cell machinery to make numerous copies of themselves that are eventually released to infect other cells. Hence, given the two facts, influenza viruses cannot reproduce by themselves. While the other possible answers listed include various organisms and a chemical compound (acetic acid), it is important to note that each of these options either has the ability to reproduce on their own (fungi, insects, bacteria, ferns, and mammals) or is not a living organism capable of reproduction (acetic acid).

As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece designed by Robert Jones and sculpted by Richard Westmacott. It was formerly in the Music Room at the Brighton Pavilion. The ornate clock, known as the Kylin Clock, was made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, China, in the second half of the 18th century; it has a later movement by Benjamin Vulliamy circa 1820. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors.

Masami Akita (Qiu Tian Chang Mei , Akita Masami, born December 19, 1956), better known by his stage name Merzbow (merutsubau, Merutsubau), is a Japanese noise musician. He is best known for his style of harsh, confrontational noise exemplified on his 1996 release, Pulse Demon. Since 1980, he has released over 400 recordings, and has collaborated with various artists. During the European tour in September-October 1989, Merzbow could only bring simple and portable gear; this led to the harsh noise style Merzbow became known for in the 1990s. Cloud Cock OO Grand (1990) was the first example of this new style, Merzbow's first digital recording (on DAT), and the first recording made for the CD format. It also includes live material recorded during the tour. But when I started live in late 1980s I didn't like to use tape on stage. I like only live electronics. So, my studio works changed to more live composition style. I'm still using many tapes in studio works, but difference is I treat tapes and instruments. Before, I used tapes as overdubbing concept. But now tapes are crashing together, no static overdub. I found that style on Cloud Cock OO Grand. Beginning in the mid-1990s, Merzbow began to be influenced by death metal and grindcore. Recordings from this time are mostly recorded at extreme volume, some mastered at levels far beyond standard (Noisembryo, Pulse Demon). In 1994, Akita acquired a vintage EMS synthesizer. From 1996, plans were made to release a \\"10 (or maybe 12)\\" CD box set on Extreme Records. In 2000, Extreme Records released the Merzbox, a fifty CD set of Merzbow records, twenty of them not previously released. Throughout most of the 1990s, Merzbow live was a trio with Reiko A. on electronics and Bara on voice and dance. Masami Akita occasionally played drums for Hijokaidan during the early-mid 1990s. In the early 1990s, Masami Akita composed the soundtracks to numerous kinbaku videos by Fuji Planning (Bu Er Qi Hua , Fuji Kikaku) and seppuku-themed videos by their sub-label Right Brain. Akita also directed Lost Paradise (Shi Le Yuan Cheng Ma Fu Nu Fu Qie ri, Shitsurakuen: Jobafuku onna harakiri) for Right Brain. Some of this music was included on Music for Bondage Performance and Music for Bondage Performance 2, co-credited to Right Brain Audile. Director Ian Kerkhof would use a Merzbow track for his 1992 film La sequence des barres paralleles, and Akita composed original music for Kerhof's 1994 film The Dead Man 2: Return of the Dead Man. Kerkhof made the documentary Beyond Ultra Violence: Uneasy Listening by Merzbow in 1998. Akita also created music for Ilppo Pohjola's Asphalto (1998) and Routemaster (2000).

Help as much as you can. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Face-to-face communication involves much more than the spoken word.In fact, we often communicate our feelings to others through our body language without realizing we are doing so.We communicate through posture, gesture and facial expression.But the eyes also play an important part in this unspoken language.William Shakespeare called the eyes \\"a window to the soul,\\" and you can learn to look through that window and better understand a person's body language by reading eye movement. Begin a conversation and ask a simple question.Watch carefully for eye movement during the response.If the person looks up, he or she is thinking or forming pictures.This is also a sign of a visual thinker.Looking up and to the left shows recalling a memory, while looking up and to the right could show imaginative construction or lying. If the person looks down, this could be a sign of obedience or even blame.Looking down and to the left can show a person talking to themselves.Looking down and to the right can show that they are feeling strong emotion. Looking sideways can indicate distraction or checking out a potential threat, hut a sideways glance can also show anger.In addition, eyes that look side to side often show shiftiness and lying. A glance usually indicates a desire for something.Glancing at a door could show a desire to leave the room, while a glance, at a person could indicate a desire to talk to them.A glance is also used when it is forbidden to look at something. A person who is lying to you may hold eye contact longer than normal.In addition, this person might smile with his mouth but not with his eyes.Smiling with the eyes is difficult to do if the emotion is not genuine. Rapid blinking of the eyes can occur when a person is thinking, and this can also be another sign of lying.Again, a person who is aware of this sign might overcompensate and stare. Question: Which of the following eye movement shows a dishonest speaker?

Ross was a prominent political figure who served as the 37th Governor of Delaware, United States. He was born on 2nd of June, 1814, in Laurel, Delaware. Professionally, Ross was a farmer, coming from a humble background. Ross started his term as Governor of Delaware on January 21, 1851, and his governance lasted for four years until January 16, 1855. His predecessor was William Tharp and he was succeeded by Peter F. Causey. During his term, he was a member of the Democratic Party, a major political party in the United States. Ross's tenure was significantly important and met with numerous events that shaped the course of his state. Away from his public service, Ross was also a devoted Methodist, adhering to one of the largest branches of Protestant Christianity, which lays emphasis on good deeds and active expressions of faith. In terms of his personal life, Ross was married to Emeline Hall. The couple made their home in Seaford, Delaware, which was their residence for a significant part of their lives. At the end of his life, Ross moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he passed away on June 30, 1887. He left behind a legacy of service, dedication, and a distinct contribution to the governance of Delaware.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who might have assisted with the underdrawing in Van der Weyden's workshop? , can you please find it? The Annunciation draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre Annunciation, his c. 1455 Saint Columba altarpiece, and the Clugny Annunciation (c. 1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the Columba triptych's \\"Annunciation\\".A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's \\"serpentine\\" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in \\"icy\\" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems \\"bleached by light\\", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, \\"this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber.\\" The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a \\"startling\\" juxtaposition, an effect that is \\"unsteadying\\" and contradictory.

Looks just like any other traveling carnival except this is one of those that charges you a 10 dollar admission just so you can walk around just to decide how much more money to spend on food and/or rides. The concept is basically like Disneyland except on a much more smaller, more ghettoish type of scale. I know, ghettoish really isn't a word but you catch my drift. Yes, I know there is a Groupon and Living Social deal for 5 bucks but that's besides the point. The fact that you have to pay just to get in only to be disappointed is what I consider time lost which equals money lost. The rides they have are basic, nothing really stands out. Each ride takes a certain amount of tickets and of course you have to get just enough tickets just to ride 2 or 3. Really not worth it. Even with the all day ride pass. As for the number 1 reason why most people go here is the food. First stop was the Dole Pineapple Whip booth. I got kind of excited because the only place that I knew had this was Disneyland where the Enchanted Tiki Room was. This place even had the words Tiki Treats in the upper left hand corner of their stand. What I found out was that it was a definite knockoff. Their largest size Float Whip was 5 bucks and my two kids easily devoured it in under 30 seconds meaning it wast that large at all. I tasted it and it was no where near what Disneyland serves. Next stop. Soul Food Cafu00e9 Express. My boys were feenin for Deep Fried Catfish with Fries and Dirty Rice as the sides. I ordered just one combo so they can share since we were gonna be eating other things. Cost 8 bucks. When we got our food, the two breaded filets were really good. As for the fries, they were soggy and was still dripping in grease. It seemed to only have been cooked halfway like they forgot about it after the fish was done so they through it in the fryer real quick only to pull it out prematurely. The Dirty Rice could have literally been dirty like it was dropped several times on the floor making its way to the skinny cardboard food holders they give you. It looked more like oatmeal sprinkled with seasonings. So basically we paid 8 bucks for two filets of breaded catfish. Next stop. Wing King. Now these guys I am definitely familiar with. I got a Review Of The Day (ROTD) for their 6475 W Charleston location. I got Fried Pickle Chips for 5 bucks and 10 Honey Barbeque Wings for 12 bucks. Both items I got my money's worth and just like their home location, it was very good. Last Stop. Mama Ita's Roasted Corn. We came here to get Funnel Cakes. Damn, 7 bucks. At least you get strawberries, powdered sugar, and whipped cream on it. Probably the most expensive Funnel Cake I ever ate. The worst thing I have to mention are the Port O Potties. Not only are they nasty, but according to my wife, none of them even had any toilet paper. Good luck if there is any soap or water left.

Harold then goes to a tailor and barber shop and spends most of his money and bets the rest on a horserace and wins.Some days later, Harold wakes up on the couch in the house of his widowed older sister Flora (Margaret Hamilton). He finds that he has a hangover, but he also has a garish new wardrobe, a ten-gallon hat, a hansom horse-drawn cab complete with a driver, and ownership of a bankrupt circus.Trying to sell the circus, Harold and Wormy visit circus-loving Wall Street banker Lynn Sargent (Rudy Vallee), and then, when he turns them down, so do the rest of the town's bankers.

Answer:","completion":"The product review provided can be characterized as having a mixed sentiment, leaning more towards the negative side. To break down the aspects of the review, one can identify the following: 1. \\"Not as Plump as shown\\": This statement clearly indicates dissatisfaction with the product's appearance as it did not meet the reviewer's expectations based on the images provided. This conveys a negative sentiment. 2. \\"They are OK\\": This statement is neutral and suggests that the product is not bad, but the reviewer is not highly impressed either. The use of the word \\"OK\\" illustrates that they find the product to be average and not particularly remarkable. 3. \\"The chocolate coating is somewhat disappointing\\": Disappointment in the chocolate coating is clearly stated here, which means that the reviewer had higher expectations in terms of taste and may have compared it to other similar products they have tried that presumably had a better chocolate coating. This statement carries a negative sentiment. 4. \\"Not what I expected\\": This statement reinforces the negative sentiment regarding expectations not being met. This further solidifies the overall sentiment leaning towards the negative side. While there are some neutral phrases present in the review, the majority of the statements emphasize disappointment and unmet expectations. The presence of dissatisfaction in terms of product appearance and taste are key factors that lead to the conclusion that this review primarily conveys a negative sentiment with a hint of neutrality, rather than a positive one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyzing the options: The first step is to assess each given option and understand the context of the question. We know it's about a location shared by many companies and a rosebush. 2. Process of elimination: We can eliminate \\"lawn\\" and \\"backyard,\\" as those are specific to personal property and wouldn't necessarily be associated with thousands of companies. Similarly, \\"rose parade\\" is an event, not a place where companies and a rosebush would establish a permanent base. 3. Delaware's reputation as a corporate haven: Delaware is well known for being the home of thousands of companies due to its favorable corporate laws, tax policies, and a strong legal system. Considering these advantages, many corporations choose to incorporate in Delaware, even if they operate elsewhere. 4. Interpretation of the question: Taking into account the context of the question and the given options, a human might interpret the question as asking for a shared location that accommodates both a rosebush and a large number of companies. The more abstract option of \\"planting\\" could be considered but doesn't directly suggest a location. 5. Human association: Though it may not be common knowledge that a rosebush is literally planted in Delaware, the association between Delaware and thriving businesses, plus the existence of rose bushes, could lead a human to select \\"Delaware\\" as the most reasonable answer based on the information provided."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Let's be real--it's not a Digital SLR (I own one of those too)so don't expect this little jem to perform like it is. But for a point and shoot it's a very capable camera that takes wonderful images.

YOU may think you can propose a 15 million renovation of the Central Park Zoo, as the Parks Department just did, but you're going to be hearing about it from Class 5-313. This is, of course, Rita Galett's class of fifth graders in P.S. 158, on York Avenue in Manhattan. The 10-year-olds of Class 5-313 write lots of compositions, and for their last assignment they assumed the role of animals reacting to the news of the imminent change in their environment. Although the new habitat will make life in the zoo much more civilized, frankly, not everyone in Class 5-313 is thrilled about the whole thing. ''I, Sammy the snake,'' wrote Laurie Cohn, ''am very upset about it, because I may lose all of my friends like Mertle the Turtle, Ally the Alligator, and worst of all my best friend Kimmy the Kangaroo!'' ''ROAR,'' wrote Randi Schachter, taking the part of the lion. ''I like it here the way it is. So leave me alone and move everyone else!'' And for the parrots, wrote Gabriel Gross, the change would be nothing short of calamitous: There once was a parrot in a zoo. The birds' surroundings became new. The contrast made him sigh. Then what he did was die. And all of the parrot's friends did too. Of course, some of the animals viewed the change with equanimity. ''I was so excited!'' wrote Ryan Fitzpatrick as Horace the Hippo. However, it was up to Amy McGovern to give us the real zoo scoop. Here, in its entirety, is her composition, titled, ''An Exclusive Interview with The New York Times'': ''Mrs Antelope, what do you think about the changing of the zoo?'' the Rovin' Raven reporter asked. ''Well (sob) (gasp) I think it's a good idea but I don't wanna go (whine),'' she answered. ''Don't you wanna make friends and have your children grow up in a nice environment?'' Mr. Raven asked.''Of course, but I wanna live somewhere nice too. All day I cook and clean so when Mr. Antelope gets back he has a nice home. But no! I won't go!'' she screamed, bursting with anger. That's when the Rovin' Raven reporter ran out. His name should be the Rovin' Chicken reporter.'' STOP THE PRESSES DEPT.: Michael Winship was passing the stacks of newspapers for sale by the checkout counter in the Gristede's at Bleecker and Grove Streets when he noticed a handwritten sign. ''I imagine the manager must be a Mr. Whipple type, who frets about people squeezing the Charmin,'' says Mr. Winship. The sign says: THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS DETERMINED THAT TAKING THE TOP NEWSPAPER IS NOT HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH. CINQUAIN All the birds and bees are mating, Tattered torrid teens are dating, Herring are now marinating, Youngish hearts are palpitating, While my own is fibrillating! Recently in this space, Louis Phillips proposed that if the Knicks or the Rangers have the audacity to move out of New York, a new team should be named the Kismets, ''the New York City team that leaves its final standings up to fate.'' However, Margo Siegel of Manhattan disagrees. ''I think that after the Nets, Jets and Mets, New York's next team should be the Regrets,'' she says. ''That way, when they leave for greener pastures, we won't have any.'' REFLECTION ON WATCHING NUREYEV DANCE The best I do is plod While he leaps high - There but for the god Of grace go I. They are working on the road. Big wheeled yellow machines strip back the paving, and underneath, in rows, lie delicate old women in housecoats. They all have at least one of the features of my mother. Then some workmen come up into the room where I'm sitting. They walk around me over to the wall and start prying at it with crowbars. ''Got to keep at it once you've got the subconscious open,'' the foreman explains to me. A great deal of mortar and bricks clatters to the floor. Dust billows. The men pull objects out of the well and throw them back out of the way - tricycles, cribs, skates, furniture: all of it familiar to me from a long time ago. Peering over their shoulders I can see a scene faintly through the dust. A group of figures sits at a table: my family at a meal. It is all very pale and wobbly. The workmen reach their hands in, poke crowbars right through my father's face, through my brother's shoulder, through the back of a chair, through a bowl of potato salad. The people in the scene go on obliviously, mouthing animated silences. ''Well, that's going to be it for today,'' the foreman announces finally. He points to his wrist. ''Quitting time: got to go home and start the weekend!'' He grins and tips his hard hat and leads his crew out to the street. Their boots crunch in the rubble. I stand at the torn opening, looking at it. It's still much too faint, really; it goes in and out of its forms and I can't hear anything. The dust hurts my eyes and makes me cough. Finally I turn away and go out of the room, shutting the door behind me so the dust won't get into the rest of the house. I go outside and look around. The exposed roadway is covered with tarpaulins; from the edges, the multiple old women's feet stick out. Barricades have been set up to keep people away. I walk back inside slowly with my hands in my pockets. ''Well, there's not really much I can do,'' I think to myself. ''I'll just have to wait 'til they come back Monday.''

Translate \\"Hanson\\" to Finnish?","completion":"Translating names or surnames from one language to another doesn't always have a direct equivalent, especially when it comes to languages with different alphabets and phonetic structures. \\"Hanson\\" is a name of Scandinavian origin, which makes it common in countries like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. It is formed with the prefix \\"Han-\\", which is a short form of \\"Johannes\\" (equivalent to \\"John\\" in English) and the suffix \\"-son,\\" which means \\"son of\\". In Finnish, there is no direct translation for \\"Hanson\\" as a surname, as Finnish surnames typically have different endings and follow different conventions. However, if we were to consider the meaning and origin of the name, the closest equivalent in Finnish for the \\"Han-\\" prefix would be \\"Juhani\\" or \\"Johannes\\" (both Finnish variations of \\"John\\"). The Finnish language doesn't use the patronymic system (the practice of creating surnames based on the father's name with a suffix such as \\"-son\\" or \\"-sen\\") in the same way as Scandinavian languages, but it does have some surnames that reflect family relationships. For example, the Finnish surname \\"Heikkinen\\" is derived from the first name \\"Heikki,\\" meaning that someone with this surname could potentially be referred to as \\"Heikki's son\\" or \\"Heikki's descendant.\\" However, this is not an equivalent form to \\"-son\\" and is specific to Finnish surnames. In conclusion, there is no direct translation of the surname \\"Hanson\\" to Finnish, as the languages have different conventions and structures for surnames. However, you can understand the meaning and origin of the name in relation to the Finnish context by considering its connection to the first name variations \\"Juhani\\" or \\"Johannes.\\" Nonetheless, a person with the surname \\"Hanson\\" would likely keep their surname intact if they were living in or visiting Finland, as it's a proper noun that doesn't require translation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The World Bank wants the governments of poor countries to do more to improve their investment climates, action it described as central to economic growth and poverty reduction. What is a good title for this?","completion":"\\"Strengthening Investment Climates in Developing Countries: The World Bank’s Strategy for Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction\\" In essence, the World Bank is urging the governments of economically-weaker countries to take significant measures to enhance their investment climates. Their rationale is that a better investment climate could encourage both domestic and foreign businesses to invest more in these countries, leading to economic growth. Better investment climates usually translate to improved infrastructure, stable political conditions, and efficient, transparent processes for starting and running businesses. Such conditions not only attract investments but also catalyze the creation of more jobs, thus helping to alleviate poverty by increasing household incomes. Moreover, higher investments lead to an increase in the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), consequently promoting economic growth. Additionally, this refers to improving basic services such as electricity, water, and roads, as well as enhancing the quality of institutions that support commerce, like the legal system enforcing contracts, property rights and commercial regulations. It also includes improving education, skill levels, and health of the employed population, as well as ensuring environmental sustainability. However, this target is not simple to achieve, as it requires considerable systematic changes, proper policy making, strategic planning, implementation techniques, and continuous assessment. It also needs the eradication of corruption, the establishment of a proper judicial system, and the promotion of good governance. The World Bank is playing an instrumental role in this process, providing not just funds but also knowledge resources, technical skills, policy advice, and help in capacity building. They also stress on the importance of private sector participation, international trade, and enterprise development in creating a favourable investment climate. Therefore, addressing investment climates is at the heart of the World Bank's strategy. They see it as central to economic growth and poverty reduction. Their aim is not only to increase investments, but also to make sure that the increase leads to sustainable and inclusive growth that improves the lives of the citizens, especially the poor. In this light, the push for better investment climates is a push for transformation. Hence, while it is a challenge for poor countries, it also presents an opportunity for them to break the poverty cycle and usher in unprecedented economic growth. It underscores that developing countries, with the necessary support and guidance, can create a thriving, conducive investment climate and leverage it for their economic and social advancement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, your question specifically asks for the team that represents the third major-professional ice hockey team in the city of Calgary, which is associated with Ranheim's career. To answer this question, we must first identify the three major-professional ice hockey teams that have represented the city of Calgary. The city has had three teams playing at the highest level of professional hockey in their respective times: 1. Calgary Tigers (1920-1927): The Tigers played in the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) and the Prairie Hockey League (PHL) during their existence, which predates the NHL. As Paul Ranheim hadn't been born yet, he never played for the Calgary Tigers. 2. Calgary Cowboys (1975-1977): The Cowboys were part of the World Hockey Association (WHA) which was a rival league to the NHL at the time. Since Paul Ranheim began his professional career in the late 1980s, he never played for this team either. 3. Calgary Flames (1980-present): The Calgary Flames are the current NHL team from the city of Calgary, which means they are the third major-professional ice hockey team to represent the city. Considering Paul Ranheim's playing history, he played for the Calgary Flames from the 1988 to 1994 season, becoming an important contributor to the team during his tenure.

Article: Millions of stars are travelling about in space. A few form groups which travel together, but most of them travel alone. And they travel through a universe which is so large that one star seldom comes near to another. For the most important part each star makes its journey in complete loneliness, like a ship on an empty ocean. The ship will be well over a million miles from its nearest neighbour. From this it is easy to understand why a star seldom finds another anywhere near it. We believe, however, that some two thousand million years ago, another star wandering through space, happened to come near our sun just as the sun and the moon raised its tides on the earth, so this star must have raised tides on the surface of the sun. But they were very different from the small tides that are raised in our oceans; A large tidal wave must have travelled over the surface of the sun, at last forming a mountain so high that we cannot imagine it. As the cause of the disturbance came nearer, so the mountain rose higher and higher. And before the star began to move away again, its tidal pull had become so powerful that this mountain was torn to pieces and thrown off small parts of itself into space. These small pieces have been going round the sun ever since. They are the planets. Question: Some two thousand years ago, the mountain on the sun was raised probably because _ .

That area is still known as Whitneyville, and the main road through both towns is known as Whitney Avenue. The factory is now the Eli Whitney Museum, which has a particular emphasis on activities for children and exhibits pertaining to the A. C. Gilbert Company. His factory, along with that of Simeon North, and the lively clock-making and brass hardware sectors, contributed to making early Connecticut a powerful manufacturing economy; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state became known as \\"The Arsenal of America\\". It was in Whitney's gun-manufacturing plant that Samuel Colt invented the automatic revolver in 1836.

In this statement, the speaker expresses the hope that Turkey will take advantage of the current situation to solidify its stance and commitment towards European integration. By doing so, Turkey is encouraged to exert pressure on Mr. Denktash (Rauf Denktash, a Turkish Cypriot politician), in order to achieve a compromise. The European course mentioned in the statement might refer to Turkey's aspirations to join the European Union (EU) or to align itself more closely with European values and policies. It is important for Turkey to maintain a European focus, as it will help improve their image, strengthen diplomatic relations, and bring economic advantages if they eventually become a member of the EU. Rauf Denktash, a significant political figure in Northern Cyprus, could be involved in an issue that might impact Turkey's chances of achieving its European goals. By reaching a compromise, it would show that the country is willing to work with others in a constructive manner, which is a crucial aspect of European integration. For Turkey to successfully make use of this opportunity and to bolster its position on the path to becoming a European nation, it needs to adopt a few strategies. These may include: 1. Engaging in diplomatic efforts: Turkey should actively engage in diplomatic discussions, not only with Mr. Denktash but also with other EU member states, to build trust and demonstrate that they are ready to cooperate on various issues. 2. Addressing internal issues: In order to strengthen its European stance, Turkey needs to address internal issues such as human rights, freedom of speech, and the rule of law. Ensuring that these areas align with European values will be essential to increasing their chances of integration. 3. Economic reforms: Implementing economic reforms that adhere to EU guidelines will help improve Turkey's economy and foster better trade relations with European nations. This will contribute to a more cohesive relationship between Turkey and the EU. 4. Promoting cultural exchange: Encouraging cultural exchange between Turkey and European nations will help foster better understanding and appreciation of each other's customs and values, which can be crucial in bridging the gap between the two. By pursuing these strategies, Turkey will significantly improve its chances of strengthening its European course and achieving its long-term goals of integration. Getting Mr. Denktash to reach a compromise would be one essential step on this path, demonstrating Turkey's flexibility and commitment to working collaboratively on regional and international issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

CLICK HERE to read Everton manager Roberto Martinez's comments after the game Ferocious in Europe, flimsy at home. If Everton’s progress in the Europa League has been without a hitch, uncertainty dogs their domestic form. A game at home to Hull City, in theory, should have been a straightforward opportunity for Roberto Martinez’s squad to make up lost ground in their pursuit of a top four spot. When Romelu Lukaku gave them a first-half lead, all seemed to be going to plan. Had this been a contest on a Thursday night, Everton would, in all likelihood, have motored away but there is something about the Barclays Premier League that means their footing is not so sure.","completion":"As the game continued, it became apparent that the consistency of Everton's play in the Europa League was sorely missing. Hull City, though an underdog, seemed determined not to let the opportunity pass without putting up a fight. Their scrappy play and relentless high press unsettled Everton during the second half, and frustration quickly settled in among the home crowd. Despite several attempts to increase their lead, Everton's finishing lacked the precision necessary to translate chances into goals. The Hull City defenders, sensing the mounting pressure amongst their opponents, started playing with renewed vigor and conviction. Throughout the second half, they repeatedly thwarted Everton's attempts to extend their advantage by launching desperate blocks and timely interceptions. In the 78th minute, Hull City's persistence paid off. A corner kick taken by Hull resulted in a scrappy but decisive goal, leaving the Everton defense stunned and the match leveled at 1-1. As Hull City celebrated, the Everton players could only look on in dismay, questioning how they had allowed themselves to be pegged back while playing at home. Ultimately, the game ended in a 1-1 stalemate, dealing a significant blow to Everton's top-four aspirations. Disappointment was palpable amongst the players and supporters alike, as the home crowd filed out of the stadium. In his post-match comments, Manager Roberto Martinez lamented the lack of consistency between his team's European and domestic performances. Martinez vowed to address this gap and to ensure his team pushes on from the setback. He acknowledged the need for stronger mental fortitude in future domestic games and stressed the importance of not taking any opponent lightly. He also urged his players to remember that, despite their recent successes in the Europa League, they must also excel in the Barclays Premier League to truly consider themselves a top team. As the season continued, Everton would have highs, lows, and even more challenging obstacles to overcome. However, it would be that fateful draw against Hull City that served as a turning point for the squad. They would eventually improve their domestic performance and develop the confidence and consistency needed to challenge for the top four. Despite being seen as a missed opportunity, the game against Hull City became a lesson in humility and the importance of treating every game with the utmost seriousness. It would be this newfound knowledge and strengthened resilience that would see Everton's season ultimately end on a more positive note, with the team being heralded for their growth and determination in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: By 2050 there will have been an extra 2.5 billion people on earth. And what will they eat? To solve the problem, we should have to double our food production. We can also develop a diet of algae , insects and meat grown in laboratories. Algae can grow very quickly at sea, in polluted water and in places that would normally kill food crops. They are already eaten widely in Japan and China and they are eaten by almost everything from shrimps to blue whales. They can fix CO2 in the atmosphere and provide fats and sugars. Man-made meat looks like meat, feels like meat and it is meat, although it's never been from a living, breathing animal. Instead, it is grown from cells in big containers. Moreover, studies show that producing man-made meat will use far less water, energy and land. China has developed \\"green super rice\\", a series of rice types which produce more grain and have stronger ability to fight against floods, salty water, insects and disease. We used traditional plant breeding techniques to cross-breed more than 250 rice types. Green super rice, which is enough to feed an extra 100 million people, will be planted widely in the coming years. Insects like ants are not on most European menus but at least 1,400 kinds are eaten across Africa, Latin America and Asia. Now, with rising food prices and worldwide land shortages, such insects are getting more and more popular. Not only are many insects rich in protein , low in fat and high in Ca and Fe, but insect farms need little space. And they can grow well on paper, algae and industrial wastes.

The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether The Tail is the intention of the PersonX from the Head or not. The intention is the likely intent or desire of PersonX behind the execution of an event. For example, given the Head PersonX gives PersonY gifts, an intention might be that PersonX wanted to be thoughtful. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Problem:Head: PersonX beats PersonX's swords into ploughshares<sep>Tail: destructive Solution:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the Head event In the Head event, \\"PersonX beats PersonX's swords into ploughshares\\", PersonX is transforming their swords into ploughshares (an agricultural tool). Step 2: Understand the Tail event The Tail event, \\"destructive,\\" describes something that causes damage or destruction. Step 3: Compare the Head and Tail events The Head event tells us that PersonX is making a change from weapons (swords) to tools for agriculture (ploughshares). This usually indicates a transition from violence or conflict towards peace and productivity.

It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors—school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn’t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead). One night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account. I don’t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he’d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me. I was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms. Whoever called saved me, but in a way I saved my own life that day. What I thought was just another routine post about stress got me the help I so desperately needed. I know without it, I would have ended my own life that day. Funny how that works. After the end of this story, he had probably: A. Continued a bad medication regimen. B. not enough information C. Broke up with his girlfriend. D. Posted more rants about his girlfriend. A:","completion":"B. not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and included other popular singles such as \\"Ignorance,\\" \\"Brick by Boring Brick,\\" and \\"The Only Exception.\\" \\"Playing God\\" is the fifth track on the album and it deals with themes of hypocrisy and judgment. The song's lyrics focus on the idea of someone taking on a self-righteous role and assuming authority over another person's life, much like 'playing god.' Lead singer Hayley Williams co-wrote the song with guitarists Josh Farro and Taylor York. The music video for \\"Playing God\\" was released on November 15, 2010, and was directed by Brandon Chesbro. The video features a darker and more theatrical visual aesthetic, which matches the song's powerful message. \\"Brand New Eyes\\" represented a turning point for Paramore, as internal conflicts within the band began to surface during its creation. Eventually, these conflicts led to the departure of two founding members, Josh and Zac Farro, in December 2010.

Explore alternative solutions: If the raise was not possible, Ash could explore other options such as negotiating non-monetary benefits, discussing a timeline for revisiting the raise conversation, or seeking additional responsibilities within the organization that might lead to future growth. 5. Reflect and decide: Ash should take time to consider whether quitting is the best decision for him, both professionally and personally, by weighing the pros and cons of staying versus finding a new job. Answer: It would be incorrect to choose among options (a), (b), or (c), as they don't fully encompass the necessary steps Ash should take before making a decision to quit over the expected raise. Instead, he should follow the steps listed above to ensure he makes a well-informed and thoughtful decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You need to read the extract and create questions that can be answered from the extract. Once you create a question you also need to provide the correct answer for it. Write your answer like \\"Question: your question, Answer: your answer\\". The questions should be well-formed and grammatically correct. The questions should be completely answerable from the given passage and should not require any external knowledge. Subjective questions are not allowed. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Create questions that result in factoid answers. A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is a factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage. Input: The central and pretty much only plot revolves around students at a college campus who are involved in a role-playing game called TAG which is an acronym for \\"The Assassination Game\\". The game is fairly straightforward, each player is assigned another player who they must assassinate by shooting him or her with a spring loaded dart gun. At the outset of the game each player is given a document called a Tag Victim Profile that contains a photo, the name, address, phone and class schedule of the player who he/she must kill. After a player completes the assignment he/she then takes over the assignment of the person who he/she killed and then notifies the game organizer, Nick Carpenter, of the kill so he can plot the kill on his game progress chart. Play continues in this manner until only one player remains at which point he or she is declared the winner.The movie follows the exploits of 2 TAG players, Susan Swayze who is playing for the first time and Loren Gersh who is the 5 time undefeated TAG champion looking to repeat yet again. He doesn't have much of a life besides playing TAG and devotes all his time to following players around and taking them out. At least one of these two characters is in every scene except for a few isolated occasions where the camera is concentrating on Alex Marsh. The only time other TAG players are shown is when they are interacting with Susan or Gersh.The movie opens with Gersh standing in a dorm hallway wearing a Get Smart style hat and trench coat while hiding behind a newspaper with eye holes cut out. His target approaches but then the target sees him and slowly backs away as he draws his dart gun but for some reason he is carrying an empty gun. When his target realizes he has no darts he turns and runs away as Gersh casually strolls after him Pepe' le Pew fashion. The target goes down a set of stairs and hides under a grate. On the sidewalk above footsteps are heard approaching and then leaving. Suddenly Gersh appears out of the dark, greets him, loads his dart gun and fires. The dart sticks to the forehead of the target and he then utters an expletive as he pulls it off.The next scene features Susan walking outside of a dorm as the clock tower strikes 9pm. While she is looking at the profile of her target, Shooster, she notices a car signaling somone in a dorm room by flashing its headlights then the person in dorm room responds by turning the room lights on and off. In the meantime someone else is in a phone booth in front of the dorm and says, \\"she's right here I can't talk\\". Susan brushes the signaling off and enters the dorm anyway. Shooster makes sure that Susan sees him then walks down the stairs to the laundry room with a laundry basket in his hands. She follows him and enters the laundry room but it appears to be empty. She doesn't see that he is hiding in a dark corner behind a dryer. As she is about to leave she hears him move and opens a washing machine door just in time for it to block a dart that was headed for her. They proceed to shoot at one another until she can't find another dart at which point she runs away. He finds a dart, loads his gun and follows. To escape Susan ducks into Alex Marsh's dorm room to hide. Alex tries to talk to her but she shushes him. Susan leaves almost as abruptly as she entered. Alex gets out of bed and opens his door to see where she went. Susan walks down the hall as Shooster and Charlie, another player, suddenly pop out of different doors with Susan in the middle of them. As they fire Alex tells Susan to look out, she ducks and they end up shooting one another instead. The three players walk away together laughing as Alex stands speechless in his underwear. Alex finds Susan extremely attractive so he is determined to find her to try to get to know her. Alex writes for the school paper and plans to use the pretext of writing an article about TAG to meet Susan and follow her around. He visits the office of Nick Carpenter, the game organizer, locates Susan's file and discovers where she lives.Susan's roomate Nancy is also playing TAG and in fact it is made clear later that she is the one who got Susan involved in the game. Nancy and Susan realize they are being followed by Nancy's assassin, Randy, so Nancy decides to use a trick to get rid of him. Susan observes while Nancy goes to the pool, changes into her bathing suit, hides a mini-dart gun in her bikini bottom and then pretends to drown in the pool. Randy jumps in with his clothes on to save her but after he lifts her out of the pool she shoots him with a dart.In the meantime another TAG player, Swanson, is heading to the bathroom to take a shower. He has his dart gun with him and places it on the soap dish in the shower stall. Gersh is hiding in a stall with his feet on the toilet so that Swanson doesn't know he is in the bathroom. Gersh opens the shower curtain and while lecturing him about not being careful enough, Swanson knocks his dart gun on the floor. The gun hits the floor, fires and the dart hits Gersh. Gersh is extremely upset at being hit for the first time and protests that it doesn't count because it was an accident. He then unsuccessfully tries to bribe Swanson to start over as if nothing had happened. To preventSwanson from reporting him dead to Carpenter, he retrieves a real Beretta 92 from his dorm room, returns to the shower and murders him. He then uses a laundry cart to wheel the corpse to his dorm room closet.Alex goes to visit Susan and tells her that he is writing an article about TAG and needs to follow a player around in order to learn about the game. Susan agrees to let him accompany her only if he helps her win, he agrees and she gives him his first assignment, to go warm up her car. In the meantime, after contemplating his actions, Gersh is somewhat depressed and calls Carpenter to tell him he killed Swanson as if asking for guidance. Carpenter doesn't realize he means he killed Swanson for real, he thinks he meant he shot him with a dart. So Carpenter notes the kill on his progress chart and tells Gersh to keep up the good work. Carpenter's encouragement cheers Gersh up and at that point the limited remaining grasp he had on reality vanishes. Though he has no need to use the real Beretta to silence anyone else, he proceeds to use it to murder the remaining contestants unlucky enough to become one of his assigned kills and also dumps their bodies in his closet.Next Alex starts Susan's car as some girls, who are obviously out to get Susan, are snickering in the background. Susan yells for him to drive and pick her up. As he does the girls come out of the dark giving chase on foot but the car pulls away too fast for them to get a shot off. Susan has Alex park in the Delta House fraternity lot next to the car of her target. Alex questions Susan while they wait for her target to come out. Susan loses track of time and realizes he closed his room light and is approaching. She kisses Alex just as her victim reaches her car with his gun drawn. He figures they are just making out so he turns around to get in his car. Susan then shoots him in the back through her window which was rolled down.In the next scene Nancy and Susan are in class. Nancy tells Susan she is dating Randy and that she is not playing TAG anymore because instead she going to Randy's track practice then she is going away with Randy to his Parent's beach house and the following day to a concert together. Gersh is seen in the widow spying on them. It shortly becomes clear that Nancy is the one he is targeting. He tails her to the track meet and sneaks under the bleachers right behind her. Gersh shoots and kills her at the same exact time the coach fires a blank to start the race. Gersh then reports the kill to Carpenter and transports her body to his room.Frank, who is apparently an editor at the school paper, approaches Alex and tells him that there are two missing students and tries to convince him to write an article about it but Alex tells him he is still busy with his TAG feature. At first blush it appears that the second missing student was Nancy. However, it is implied that both are males because not even their \\"girlfriends\\" know where they are and is later revealed that this second missing student was a different TAG player who Gersh killed. The second kill was never shown on film nor does Gersh report it to Carpenter anywhere in the movie, which would have cleared things up sooner. Thus the audience is not aware of it and most assume the report was referring to Nancy. This makes one wonder why Susan is not worried. Randy eventually reports Nancy missing towards the end of the movie and since Nancy told her that she was going away Susan never suspects anything is wrong by her absence.Alex goes to meet Susan but can't find her at first. Susan calls the Campus Information desk and asks to speak to Alex. She tells him that she is hiding in the nearby phone booth and needs his help because she is out of darts and her assigned assassin, Wallace, is waiting outside the phone booth to get her. He makes an announcement over the loudspeaker that there is a free concert in a different hall and a large crowd including Wallace run to the location of the alleged concert. This permits Susan to escape and they spend the day together.Later that evening while Susan and Alex are spying on Gowdy, her assigned target, she notices that Wallace is again tracking her. She tells Marsh to keep an eye on Gowdy while she goes off to get rid of Wallace. She goes to the pool locker room and changes into her bathing suit, planning to try the same drowning trick that Nancy demonstrated to her. In the meantime Alex sees Gersh lurking about and asks him if he is looking for Wallace. Gersh answers yes and Alex tells him to go to the pool to find him. While Susan is under the water Gersh shoots and kills Wallace. Susan exits the pool perplexed and while searching for Wallace encounters Alex who tells her he took care of Wallace but lost Gowdy. They run to the athletic building and again part company as she says she will take the front and he should take the back.While lying in wait Susan shoots Alex as he walks through the door thinking he is Gowdy. Alex then proceeds to step on the dart breaking it. Susan states that she had only one dart for her mini dart gun and asks Alex to go back to her locker to get her primary weapon while she spies on Gowdy. Gowdy returns and starts searching rooms, the last room is where Susan is hiding. Alex is unable to remember the locker combination and thus fails to get her gun. He sees Gersh and runs up to him and asks if he got Wallace. Then he said he did Gersh a favor and in return wants to borrow Gersh's gun. Gersh gives him the dart gun and Alex tosses it to Susan just in time for her to shoot Gowdy before he found her. Naturally the final two players left at this point are Gersh and Susan.Game rules dictate that a party be held before the final round between the two remaining players can commence so a party is scheduled the next evening and play is suspended for a 21 hour period until after the party ends. Susan and Alex use the break to spend the night together in her room. Alex leaves in the morning but proceeds to smother her throughout the day with flowers and notes professing his love. Susan is put off and tries to avoid him and refuses to answer her phone. When he approaches her at the party she tells him she needs space and is not sure when and if she wants to see him again. She tells him that she wants to handle the final round on her own rather than with his help, despite telling him the previous night that she wanted his help.After the party the final round commences. At 9pm Gersh calls Susan and challenges her to meet him in the quad. During the course of playing cat and mouse Susan hides in Gersh's room to try a sneak attack when he returns but she finds the corpses in the closet and runs away screaming in panic. Interestingly only 3 bodies are shown, Nancy, Swanson and Wallace, despite the fact it is later implied that he murdered 5. Gersh sees her running from his room and tries to get her before she can tell anyone. She runs screaming to the College rent-a-cop but as he loads a round into his revolver Gersh shoots and kills him. He proceeds to chase her to the roof of a building.In the meantime Alex drowns his sorrows with journalistic work, specifically investigating the rash of missing college students. He visits campus security as Randy is reporting Nancy missing. At this point it becomes clear that Nancy was not the second missing student, another player was. Apparently 2 players never shown in the film were killed offscreen, one named M. Homes and the other we are simply given the last name March. Alex recognizes Wallace and pieces together that all the missing students played TAG and were taken out by Gersh. He surmises that Gersh harmed them for real and then sets out in search of Susan to warn her. Alex finds the dead security guard and picks up the gun not realizing there was only 1 round in it. Then he hears the sound of glass breaking coming from the rooftop and runs to investigate. Gersh is about to shoot Susan when Alex appears. Alex fires at Gersh but nothing happens and then fires 4 more times to no avail. Gersh is amused by this and at first simply laughs but after the 5th click he takes aim at Alex. Alex pulls the trigger one final time and at last a bullet fires hitting Gersh who then falls off the roof to his death. The movie ends with Alex consoling Susan.

Kelis Rogers was born and raised in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan in the Frederick Douglass Houses. Her first name is a portmanteau of her father's name, Kenneth (1944-2000), and her mother's name, Eveliss. Her father Kenneth was an African American jazz musician and Pentecostal minister, and was formerly a professor at Wesleyan University. Her mother Eveliss is a Chinese-Puerto Rican fashion designer who inspired Kelis to pursue her singing career. Kelis began recording her debut album, Kaleidoscope, in mid-1998 and was finished within a year. Produced by The Neptunes and released by Virgin Records in 1999, the album peaked at number 144 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and reached the top five on the Top Heatseekers chart. As of 2006, the album had sold 249,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Its lead and most notable single, \\"Caught Out There\\", became a top ten Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs hit and peaked at number 54 on the Billboard Hot 100. During this time, Kelis featured on Ol' Dirty Bastard's U.S. top 40 single \\"Got Your Money\\". The album performed better in Europe, where \\"Caught out There\\" was a moderate hit and reached the top five on the UK Singles Chart. A second single, \\"Good Stuff\\" (featuring Terrar of Clipse), reached number 19; the third, \\"Get Along with You\\", was less successful, reaching number 51. The British Phonographic Industry certified Kaleidoscope gold for sales of 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, where it reached number 43 on the UK Albums Chart. In 2001, Kelis won the BRIT Award for International Breakthrough Act and the NME Award for Best R&B/Soul Act, before joining Moby and U2 on their Area:One and Elevation tours, respectively. Kelis and the Neptunes' output at this time was heralded as foreshadowing an innovation in contemporary R&B, but she later said, \\"I was never an R&B artist. People coined me one but that's because, especially if you're in the States, if you're black and you sing, then you're R&B\\". Her colorful style in both clothing and hair received considerable attention. Kelis's second album, Wanderland, was released in 2001 in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, but did not receive a North American release. According to Kelis, her U.S. record company at the time, Virgin, had laid off those that worked on Kaleidoscope; their replacements did not understand or believe in Wanderland, which led her to leave the label around the time of the album's European release. A commercial failure, Wanderland peaked at number 78 in the UK, although its sole single release, \\"Young, Fresh n' New\\", was a top forty entry on the UK Singles Chart. The album, which was produced in its entirety by the Neptunes and features collaborations with members of Clipse and No Doubt, was well received by publications such as The Guardian and NME. In 2002, Kelis recorded \\"So Be It\\" for the Red Hot Organization's Fela Kuti tribute CD, Red Hot and Riot, from which all proceeds were donated to AIDS awareness charities. The same year, she had a top 20 US club hit with a remix of \\"Young, Fresh 'n' New\\" remix produced by Timo Maas, who subsequently featured Kelis on his single \\"Help Me\\". Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did she have any other albums reach the charts?","completion":"Yes, Kelis had other albums reach the charts. For instance, her debut album, Kaleidoscope, peaked at number 144 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and reached the top five on the Top Heatseekers chart.

Only half true. The real aim of an interview is to obtain the job you want. That often means rejecting job offers you don't want! So before you please an employer, be sure you want the job. Myth 2: Always please the interviewer Not true. Try to please yourself. Of course, don't be hostile--nobody wants to hire someone disagreeable. But there is plainly a muddle ground between being too ingratiating and being hostile. Myth 3: Try to control the interview Nobody \\"controls\\" an interview. When someone tries to control us, we resent it. When we try to control others, they resent us. Remember you can't control what an employer thinks of you, just as he can't control what you think of him. So he is ready to give and take when being interviewed; never control the interview. Myth 4: Never interrupt the interviewer Study the style of the effective conversationalists: they interrupt and are interrupted! An exciting conversation always makes us feel free--free to interrupt, to disagree, to agree enthusiastically. Just _ Try being yourself for a change. Employers will either like or dislike you, but at least you'll have made an impression. Leaving an employer indifferent is the worst impression you can make.

Determine the sentiment: I consider this movie a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to see it, so as to realize what a great movie it was. First, it describes a face of WW2 that we don't usually see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, army and the Nazi government are shown more \\"humanized\\". One of the facts that impressed me most was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's... that forest is the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place: those are the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another clue for those who like the details, is the representation of doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door, or a door is opened. Many doors are shown in the screen, opened and closed. And the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc any time that happens. Have you noticed that?","completion":"The sentiment in the text can be characterized as mostly positive, with some neutral observations and a hint of initial reluctance. The author expresses their admiration for the movie, considering it a \\"masterpiece,\\" and shares how their appreciation grew upon watching it multiple times. They find the unconventional portrayal of German soldiers and the Nazi government as more \\"humanized\\" in the film to be refreshing and unique compared to typical Hollywood movies. The attention to details in the movie is another aspect that the author appreciates, highlighting the inclusion of a historical murder in the plot and the symbolism of doors in the film. The author seems genuinely intrigued by the director, Fassbinder's, technique and seeks to engage other viewers in these observations. However, the author does admit to some indecision and initial difficulty in recognizing the movie's worth, as it took several viewings for them to fully appreciate its greatness. This admission can be seen as a touch of neutrality, as it neither praises nor criticizes the film directly but indicates the complexity of the movie's meaning and the viewer's response. Overall, the sentiment leans heavily towards the positive side, revealing the author's reverence for the film and its elements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - An advocate is a type of professional person in several different legal systems and it is also a commonly used \\"honorific\\" for remarkable lawyers, such as in \\"Adv.

The party was created in 1992 from the former Party for Freedom and Progress (PVV) and politicians from other parties. The party led the government for three cabinets under Guy Verhofstadt from 1999 until March 2008. Open VLD most recently formed the Federal Government (the so-called \\"Swedish government\\") with N-VA, CD&V and the Francophone Reformist Movement (MR). - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot).

The party was the successor of the Liberal Party, which had roots dating back to 1846. It was succeeded in Flanders by the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) and in Wallonia by the Liberal Reformist Party, \\"Parti des Réformes et des Libertés de Wallonie\\" and the current-day Reformist Movement. In the German-speaking Community, it still exists as the Party for Freedom and Progress. - A solicitor is a legal practitioner who traditionally deals with most of the legal matters in some jurisdictions. A person must have legally-defined qualifications, which vary from one jurisdiction to another, to be described as a solicitor and enabled to practise there as such. For example, in England and Wales a solicitor is admitted to practise under the provisions of the Solicitors Act 1974. With some exceptions, practising solicitors must possess a practising certificate. There are many more solicitors than barristers in England; they undertake the general aspects of giving legal advice and conducting legal proceedings. - The Dioxin Affair was a political crisis that struck in Belgium during the spring of 1999. Contamination of feedstock with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) was detected in animal food products, mainly eggs and chickens. Although health inspectors reported the problem in January, measurements were taken only from May 1999 when the media revealed the case. The then Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) opposition leader Guy Verhofstadt claimed that the government was trying to cover up the so-called \\"nota Destickere\\", which proved that several secretaries of state were informed much earlier that the food contained PCBs and dioxins. - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL.

Answer the following question: Martin is moving and he needs to make a ramp so he can load heavy furniture into his truck. He has a bad back, so he wants to use the least effort possible. Before he cuts the wood, he is trying to decide how long the ramp should be so he can move the heavy furniture easily. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Should martin build a long or short ramp? Hint: For an inclined plane, the input distance is the length of the sloping surface, and the output distance is the maximum height of the inclined plane. This was illustrated in Figure above . Because the sloping surface is always greater than the height of the inclined plane, the ideal mechanical advantage of an inclined plane is always greater than 1. An inclined plane with a longer sloping surface relative to its height has a gentler slope. An inclined plane with a gentler slope has a greater mechanical advantage and requires less input force to move an object to a higher elevation. Answer:","completion":"Martin should build a long ramp. A longer ramp will have a gentler slope, which will provide a greater mechanical advantage and require less input force to move the heavy furniture to a higher elevation.

Goal: To determine if an avocado is ripe for eating, Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? OPTIONS: (1). pop the stem off and ensure the texture is slimy and color is brown. (2). pop the stem off of the top and make sure there is a green color....I think the answer is","completion":"The more reasonable method to determine if an avocado is ripe for eating among the options provided is: Option (2): Pop the stem off of the top and make sure there is a green color. This method is considered more reasonable because it involves observing the color beneath the small stem, which is a good indicator of the avocado's ripeness. A green color beneath the stem generally means that the avocado is ripe and ready to eat. In contrast, a brown color may suggest that the avocado is overripe and the flesh inside could be potentially spoiled or have an unpleasant texture. Option (1) is not a recommended method to assess ripeness, as a slimy texture and brown color may be associated with spoilage and overripeness, rather than the ideal stage for consumption. Besides the method mentioned in option (2), there are other ways to check for avocado ripeness that can give you a more comprehensive understanding of its readiness for consumption: 1. Gentle pressure test: Hold the avocado in the palm of your hand and gently squeeze without using your fingertips, as this may cause bruising. A ripe avocado should yield to gentle pressure, feeling slightly soft but not mushy. 2. Skin texture: A ripe avocado usually has a slightly bumpy texture, which is typical for Hass avocados. Green-skinned varieties may be more challenging to judge by the skin texture alone, so gentle pressure and color remain better indicators for these varieties. 3. Color: For Hass avocados, as they ripen, their skin color changes from green to a darker, almost blackish hue. However, note that color alone may not be a foolproof indicator, as some avocados may turn darker but still be unripe. So, it's best to use color as a secondary factor along with the gentle pressure test. For other avocado varieties, color changes might be less dramatic, so get familiar with the specific variety you have to accurately determine ripeness. Combining these methods, it becomes easier to determine the ripeness of your avocado and enjoy its delicious, creamy flavor when it is at its best."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hill village situated 10 miles to the south, left their swamps untouched. Which village took a less protective approach towards the environment? Hint: Ecologically, the expansion of drainage systems has had tremendous negative effects. Hundreds of thousands of wetland species experienced significant population declines as their habitat was increasingly fragmented and destroyed. Although market hunting within the Central Flyway was a contributing factor in the decline of many waterfowl species' numbers in the early decades of the twentieth century, loss of breeding habitat to agricultural expansion is certainly the most significant. Early maps of midwestern states depict many lakes and marshes that are either nonexistent or significantly reduced in area today. Channelization, a related process of concentrating and facilitating the flow of water from agricultural areas, also contributed to this degradation. The answer is:","completion":"Timber village took a less protective approach towards the environment. This is because they initiated a channelization process which involved draining all the swamps near their village. Channelization as explained in the hint provided has negative effects on the environment, resulting in the loss of crucial habitats for hundreds of thousands of wetland species. These species then experience significant population declines as their habitats become increasingly fragmented and destroyed. This process contributes to environmental degradation and negatively impacts biodiversity. In contrast, Hill village situated 10 miles to the south, chose to leave their swamps untouched. By doing so, they allowed the natural ecosystem to continue supporting the various wetland species, maintaining the delicate balance in the environment, and enhancing biodiversity. Allowing the swamps to remain intact not only supports the natural ecosystem but also provides multiple ecosystem services such as water filtration, flood control, and carbon sequestration. The twentieth century saw a decline in waterfowl species' numbers, and while market hunting within the Central Flyway contributed to this decline, the most significant factor was the loss of breeding habitat due to the expansion of agricultural lands. Early maps of midwestern states show lakes and marshes that are either non-existent or significantly reduced in area today, signifying the extent to which these habitats have been lost. Channelization, which is the process of concentrating and facilitating the flow of water from agricultural areas, has also played a significant role in this habitat degradation. Thus, Timber village's channelization process will likely further contribute to ecological harm. In conclusion, Timber village took a less protective approach towards the environment by implementing channelization and draining their swamps, as compared to Hill village, which left their swamps intact. The habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity associated with channelization and swamp drainage make Timber village's approach less ecologically sustainable and less protective of the environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The £100 (160) Pikon is able to produce images with a quality equal to telescopes that cost ten times as much, according to its designers. And with plans available to download online, anyone can create the telescope themselves – as long as they own a 3D printer which costs at least £400 (650). Incredible images showing the surface of the moon are the first ever to be taken with a 3D printed telescope. Physicist Mark Wrigley, one of Pikon's creator, said he believed the telescope would be a 'game changer,' making telescopes available to the general public. Pikon uses a £25 (40) Raspberry Pi camera module and is based on Isaac Newton's reflecting telescope design. The design involves placing a concave mirror to form an image of whatever the telescope is focused on directly onto the Pi camera sensor. The camera is mounted onto components created by 3D printing and, due to its small size, can sit directly in front of the mirror. The telescope has a magnification of times 160, which means that on a cloudless night it will be capable of detailed lunar observation as well as galaxies, star clusters and some planetary observation. £100 (160) Pikon is able to produce images with a quality equal to telescopes that cost ten times as much.

A SpaceX cargo ship rocketed toward the International Space Station on Sunday, carrying the first 3D printer for astronauts in orbit. Dragon should reach the space station Tuesday. It's the fifth station shipment for the California-based SpaceX. The space station-bound 3D printer was developed by Made in Space, another California company. It's sturdier than Earthly models to withstand the stresses of launch, and meets Nasa's strict safety standards. The space agency envisions astronauts one day cranking out spare parts as needed. For now, it's a technology demonstrator, with a bigger and better model to follow next year.

But how much does this internal list define us?

Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Why did the author change his views about what was the best representation of himself?

What is the full name of the person who approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions? Answer the above question based on the context below: In July 1873 the U.S. Navy dispatched USS Juniata to Greenland, to search for survivors from the Polaris expedition which had disintegrated after the death of its leader, Charles Francis Hall. Juniata's second-in-command was George W. De Long, a 28-year-old graduate of the United States Naval Academy, making his first visit to the Arctic. Ice conditions prevented Juniata from advancing beyond Upernavik; De Long volunteered to take the ship's tender, a small steamer named the Little Juniata, in the hope of finding survivors at Cape York, a further 400 nautical miles (740 km) north.The attempt failed; Little Juniata faced extreme weather conditions, and was forced to retreat a few miles from Cape York. De Long returned to Juniata in mid-August, having found no trace of the Polaris crew—who had meanwhile been rescued by the Scottish whaler SS Ravenscraig—but the experience had profoundly affected his outlook. Having earlier described the Greenland coast in a letter to his wife Emma as \\"a dreary land of desolation ... I hope I may never find myself cast away in such a perfectly God-forsaken place\\", he returned home captivated by the Arctic. Emma wrote: \\"The polar virus was in his blood and would not let him rest\\".The abortive Little Juniata mission brought De Long to public notice, and he saw himself as a possible leader of the next U.S. Arctic expedition. He approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions. Grinnell was not prepared to offer financial support, instead advising De Long to approach James Gordon Bennett Jr., owner and publisher of the New York Herald and a known sponsor of bold schemes. De Long met Bennett in New York early in 1874; the newspaperman was impressed by De Long, and assured him that his Arctic ambitions would have the enthusiastic support of the Herald. In the meantime De Long had applied to the Navy Department for an Arctic command, a request that he was informed would \\"receive due attention\\".

Washington (CNN)Few White House hopefuls would ever want to be compared to former President Richard Nixon, but some of Hillary Clinton's pre-campaign moves -- or lack thereof -- are reminiscent of the 37th president. As Clinton eyes another run at the presidency in 2016, some close to her -- especially those who are cheering reports she may wait until summer to officially announce a bid -- point to Nixon's successful 1968 presidential bid as a positive sign, particularly how Nixon's public operation went dark for about six months before entering the race. Despite being the presumed Democratic front-runner since Obama was reelected in 2012, Clinton has been largely absent from the public spotlight since the midterms wrapped in November 2014. And with the exception of the occasional paid speech and non-profit event, she could lie-low through the spring, a months-long hiatus similar to one Nixon took more than fifty years ago before winning the presidency for the first time.

Movie plot title: Rock & Rule Movie plot: This plot is for the original Canadian version of the film. Mok, an aging yet legendary rock musician, is on the search for a very special voice that can unleash a powerful demon from another dimension to fulfill his wish of being immortalized as a musician/Magic Man. After traveling around the world looking for the right voice, he returns to his hometown of Ohmtown, a remote, storm-ravaged village famous for its unique power plant. Meanwhile, at a nightclub, Omar, Angel, Dizzy and Stretch perform in a small rock band. As Angel performs a gentle love ballad to a mostly empty audience, Mok hears her sing and his special ring goes off, and he realizes that Angel has the voice he needs. He invites Angel and the band to his mansion outside of town. Omar goads Mok upon meeting him, annoying Mok enough to suggest the band tries \\"Edison Balls\\"- a modern drug, which Omar and Stretch take, incapacitating them. Dizzy sneaks away. Meanwhile, Mok takes Angel on a stroll through his garden and tries to convince her to join him. Initially unaware of Mok's true intentions, she refuses to abandon her band. Unwilling to admit defeat, Mok kidnaps her and takes his blimp to Nuke York, where his summoning, disguised as a concert, will be performed. After Dizzy snaps his band-mates out of their stupor, the trio find out what happened to Angel and they follow the blimp in a stolen police car. Before they reach Nuke York, they are arrested by a border guard. Meanwhile, Angel attempts to escape with the unwitting help of Cinderella, a sister of Mok's goons. While sneaking through the ventilation system, Angel overhears Mok confirming his plans with his computer. At this time, the computer informs Mok that the only way to stop the demon is with \\"One voice, One heart, One song\\", but when Mok asks who can do this, the computer replies that there is \\"no one\\".

The only con is that it wears VERY close to the skin. After about 30 min or so you don't really smell it unless you put your nose directly to where it was sprayed. However, it is a huge bottle, so spraying it multiple times throughout the day will barely put a dent in it. I have smelled a few other Demeter fragrances, and this one really stands out. Answer:","completion":"There is a generally positive tone to this product review. Step 1: Read the title of the review, which is \\"Wow.\\" The title suggests a sense of amazement or excitement, which can imply a positive tone. Step 2: Analyze the reviewer's experience with the product. The reviewer mentions falling in love with the scent immediately, which indicates a positive response. They also express appreciation for the nice, crisp, earthy smell and share a positive anecdote about their partner's reaction. Step 3: Consider any negative aspects of the review.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass. I am facing a new situation today: In his chemistry lab David is learning about acids. He took three solutions to identify them correctly, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a strong acid; sample B is a weak acid; and sample C is not an acid. David needs to identify the content of each sample by learning about their attributes. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which sample would have lower pH value, sample A or sample B? A:","completion":"Based on the background knowledge provided, a solution with a higher concentration of hydronium ions has a lower pH value, indicating it is more acidic. In the situation with David's chemistry lab, he has three samples - sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a strong acid, sample B is a weak acid, and sample C is not an acid. Comparing sample A and sample B, it is essential to understand the difference between strong and weak acids. Strong acids are those that ionize almost completely in water, releasing a large quantity of hydronium ions. This results in a high concentration of hydronium ions in the solution, and thus a lower pH value. On the other hand, weak acids only partially ionize in water, releasing a smaller quantity of hydronium ions. Consequently, the concentration of hydronium ions is lower in a weak acid's solution, and its pH value is comparatively higher than that of a strong acid. In David's situation, since sample A is a strong acid and sample B is a weak acid, sample A will have a higher concentration of hydronium ions in the solution, thereby resulting in a lower pH value as compared to sample B. Thus, the correct answer to the question \\"Which sample would have a lower pH value, sample A or sample B?\\" is sample A, as it is a strong acid and more acidic than sample B, the weak acid."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Water is transported to the leaves in the xylem - Energy harvested through light reaction is stored by forming ATP - Carbon dioxide and energy from ATP are used to create sugar - Oxygen exits the leaves through the stomata by diffusion - The plant reuses the water or the water exits through the stomata as water vapor. The answer is:","completion":"The missing first step in the given process is the absorption of water and nutrients from the soil by the plant roots. In order to fully understand and contextualize this step, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the entire process, which is known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a vital process that occurs in plants, algae, and some bacteria, enabling these organisms to create food and energy from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The overall process can be broken down into several stages and steps, as follows: 1. Absorption of water and nutrients from the soil by the plant roots: This is the missing first step in the given process. Plant roots are responsible for absorbing water and essential minerals, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, from the soil. Root hairs are specialized structures that increase the surface area in contact with the soil, enhancing absorption capabilities. The absorbed water and nutrients are then transported to other parts of the plant, including the leaves, through specialized tissues called xylem. 2. Water is transported to the leaves in the xylem: Water and nutrients absorbed by the roots are transported to the upper parts of the plant through the xylem. This upward movement is facilitated by processes such as capillary action, root pressure, and transpiration pull, ensuring that water reaches the leaves where it will be utilized in photosynthesis. 3. Energy is harvested through the light reaction: In the chlorophyll-containing cells of the plant leaves, light energy is absorbed and converted into chemical energy through a series of complex reactions known as the light-dependent reactions, or light reactions. Here, light energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen (O2), protons (H+), and electrons. This process generates oxygen and high energy compounds such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which will be used to fuel other reactions in the plant. 4. Carbon dioxide and energy from ATP are used to create sugar: After the light reactions, the plant moves to the next stage of photosynthesis known as the Calvin cycle or light-independent reactions. Here, carbon dioxide is combined with the energy from ATP and the electrons from NADPH to form glucose and other organic molecules, which serve as the building blocks for various cellular structures and functions. 5. Oxygen exits the leaves through the stomata by diffusion: The oxygen produced during the light reaction is no longer needed by the plant and is released into the atmosphere through specialized openings called stomata found on the leaf's surface. The stomata facilitate gas exchange by permitting the entry of carbon dioxide and the exit of oxygen and water vapor. 6. The plant reuses the water or the water exits through the stomata as water vapor: The water produced during the photosynthesis process can be reused by the plant as needed, or it can be released back into the atmosphere through the process of transpiration. This release of water vapor through the stomata aids in maintaining a proper balance of water and minerals within the plant, as well as regulating temperature and pulling more water up from the roots. In summary, the missing first step of the process is the absorption of water and nutrients by the plant roots from the soil. This water, along with the absorbed nutrients, will then be transported and utilized by the plant in various stages of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to the production of energy and essential molecules required for growth, reproduction, and maintenance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – It's a race that's both the most expensive one for a House seat in history and down to the wire: Voters in Georgia will decide on Tuesday whether Democrat Jon Ossoff or Republican Karen Handel will fill a congressional seat for suburban Atlanta. It's incredibly tight, and with hours to go the parties and some super PACs are doing what they can to give their candidate an edge—not all so successfully. President Trump gave Handel a boost on Twitter Monday morning, tweeting, \\"The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good healthcare and Border Security. Their ObamaCare is dead with 100% increases in P's [premiums]. Vote now for Karen H.\\" Cue the analyses of a tweet. The Washington Post thinks Trump is trying to tell supporters that the success of his agenda requires a Handel win. \\"That’s not the case, of course, given the composition of the House. But if Handel falls in a district that leans Republican, it suggests that other similar districts might also go blue next November. And it suggests, too, that Trump may be a drag on the party, not a boon.\\" The Hill reports both candidates are uniting in denouncing a last-minute campaign ad produced by the Principled PAC that suggests a link between Ossoff and the shooting that wounded Rep. Steve Scalise. An image of the majority whip on a stretcher is shown (Kathy Griffin and the severed head later make an appearance) as a voice narrates, \\"The unhinged left is endorsing and applauding shooting Republicans. When will it stop? It won’t if Jon Ossoff wins on Tuesday.\\" The super PAC apparently wasn't the only one to try to make such a connection. The Washington Post has these lines spoken by Brad Carver at a Saturday get-out-the-vote event for Handel. \\"I think the shooting is going to win this election for us,\\" said Carver, the GOP chair of an adjacent congressional district. \\"Because moderates and independents in this district are tired of left-wing extremism. I get that there’s extremists on both sides, but we are not seeing them. ... Democrats have never given this president a chance.\\" Whoever wins, Nate Silver lays out an argument at FiveThirtyEight that the ensuing insights made about the victories will likely be \\"dumb.\\" A narrow win would reflect \\"what we know about the political environment,\\" and he feels that win will \\"be portrayed as a more important predictive signal than it really is.\\" But there's a catch. \\"Sometimes dumb things matter if everyone agrees that they matter.\\" He explains.

Choose which camera you would like to use be it your computer webcam, cell phone, film/digital camera, or disposable camera. If you do not have any of these, go to your nearest electronics store and ask an employee which camera would work best for you. If you are low on cash, buy a disposable camera from places like grocery stores or gas stations. Otherwise, ask a friend if you can use their camera. Decide whether you want a “mug shot” or full-length photo. Facebook profile pictures are small sized, so having either a head shot would be best. If you love your shape, try a pose to the waist. Selfies are self-portraits generally taken by a digital camera or camera phone supported by your hand or “selfie stick”. Taking selfies enable you to have more control over how others see you. For most people, the best angle for a selfie is one that's slightly higher than their line of vision. And you probably shouldn't stare directly into the camera, either. Most people don’t look their best straight on, so angle your face using your “good side”. Selfie sticks are monopods that help you take selfies beyond the range of your hand. Otherwise, elongate your arm and snap a photo of yourself. If you are using a smart phone, flip your phone so you can see your image in the screen. You can position the image exactly as you please and snap a photo Try to keep your arm out of the frame. most phone cameras are higher quality on the back of the phone (not in forward facing mode), so it may be better to have someone take you picture for you, even if it's selfie-style. If you don’t have a smart phone or you are using a camera, find a mirror so you can still see your image. If there is no mirror accessible, angle it toward you as best you can. Most selfie sticks come with mirrors. Find a friend or someone nearby to take a photo of you. Make sure your photographer knows how to focus the camera to avoid blurriness and pixelation. Generally cameras have a little box that pops up when looking through/at the screen. Have them center you in this box and snap the photo. This is the easiest way to center and focus the photo. If the box does not show up automatically, there should be an option in the settings or directions of the camera to show you how to make it appear. To spice up the image, have your photographer zoom in all the way, step back until your image clearly fills the frame (with space around all sides), and snap the photo. Make sure the flash is off to avoid harsh light. Having a timer will enable you to position yourself in the ideal way. Ask your photographer to give you a countdown, or give yourself a countdown. If you are taking a selfie, rest the camera on a stable surface, set the timer, and get into position. Read the directions that come with your camera on how to set a timer. If you lost the hard copy of the directions, a google search should prove fruitful. By taking a lot of photos you have a larger selection to choose from. The first couple snapshots may not turn out the way you envisioned, so take a lot and pick the one you like the best. Throughout the photo-shoot, periodically look at the photos you have taken.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the story that is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata? Answer the above question based on the context below: Rinaldo (HWV 7) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, composed in 1711, and was the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage. The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill, and the work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the First Crusade, is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed Rinaldo quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. Rinaldo is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years; after a successful run at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide. Rinaldo was the first Handel Opera to have found its way to the Metropolitan. The opera's tercentenary in 2011 brought a modernized...

For three generations, Bush men have occupied towering positions in the party pantheon, and the party's demographic and ideological shifts can be traced through the branches of the Bush family tree: from Prescott, the blue-blooded Eisenhower Republican, and George H.W. Bush, the transitional figure who tried and failed to emulate the approach of the New Right, to George W. Bush, who embodied the new breed of tax-cutting, evangelical conservatism. Indeed, the Bushes' metamorphosis from genial centrism to deep-fried conservatism has both anticipated and reflected the party's trajectory. But now, Jeb Bush, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, seems to be bucking the trend. He is seeking to return the party to its ideological moorings -- toward the centrism of his grandfather. Even before the GOP's ignominious defeat in November, Jeb was offering tough love to his party, suggesting that Republicans stand up to Grover Norquist and craft a bipartisan compromise to reduce the deficit significantly. But will Republicans listen? There are many reasons to believe they won't. Prescott was a Manhattan investment banker who called himself a \\"moderate progressive.\\" In the 1952 primary between conservative presidential candidate Sen. Robert Taft and moderate Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Prescott chose Eisenhower -- and became the president's favorite golf partner. Prescott rode Eisenhower's coattails into the Senate, where he focused on urban renewal, spearheading the 1954 Housing Act. An early proponent of the line-item veto, he received national recognition as an advocate of fiscal responsibility. Prescott's son George H.W. left for West Texas in 1948 when Texas was still a one-party state. But change was afoot in the South, and by the time H.W. ran for U.S. Senate in 1964, he encountered a flourishing Texas Republican Party that had recently elected its first U.S. senator by attracting hordes of conservative Democrats. But the new rank-and-file Republicans were nothing like the Connecticut Republicans he knew -- or even like those in the Houston suburbs. Biographer Richard Ben Cramer imagined H.W.'s vexation at this new breed of Texas Republican:. \\"These ... these nuts! They were coming out of the woodwork! They talked about blowing up the U.N., about armed revolt against the income tax. ...The nuts hated him. They could smell Yale on him.\\" Recognizing that his 1964 primary campaign would need to be more Goldwater than Rockefeller, he ignored the social problems Prescott had addressed. \\"Only unbridled free enterprise can cure unemployment,\\" H.W. asserted, contending that government bore no responsibility for alleviating poverty. Though he lost, he began the transition to Sunbelt conservatism that would make him (barely) acceptable to Ronald Reagan as a running mate. But he never fully evolved: He famously reneged on his \\"no new taxes\\" pledge. His son George W. would complete the transition. George W.'s first major legislative accomplishment as president was the enactment of a massive 1.6 trillion tax cut. He rode roughshod over the green-eyeshade types to pass a massive tax cut. When it produced runaway deficits, he accepted Dick Cheney's argument: \\"Reagan taught us that deficits don't matter.\\" In adopting Sun Belt conservatism -- sometimes clumsily -- George H.W. and George W. anticipated the Republican Party's ideological shift. Hence, in evaluating Jeb's prescriptions for fiscal responsibility, today's Republicans should recall the Bushes' past political palm reading. Politics is about addition, not subtraction. Every year, as Republicans maintain the electoral coalition that responds to their platform, they face an inevitable subtraction from their base. That's because unyielding stances on taxes and deficits practically guarantee that young voters will continue opposing them, and the (older and whiter) constituencies who favor them shrink as a percentage of the electorate. Republicans who believe they can continue to win with their current coalition are like rats who believe they can outrun a treadmill. As the nation approaches 16 trillion of debt and grapples with the baby boomer retirement, young voters will grasp that every dollar spent on entitlement programs is a dollar paid by already-strapped young workers. That may well push young voters to support the party with the most credible deficit-reduction plan. According to 2012 exit polls, 60% of young voters (aged 18-29) supported President Barack Obama. Young voters also made up a slightly larger share of the electorate than they had in 2008. This is a huge problem for Republicans for three reasons. One, people tend to vote with higher frequencies once they hit their 30s. Two, generational cohorts tend to stick with the party they supported in their formative years. And most obviously, young voters are more likely to be around to vote in the future. If it were just about math, Jeb could convince the party to adopt what polling shows are clearly winning positions. But as the work of scholars Gary Miller and Norman Schofield suggests, it's not a linear equation: It's about momentum and intensity within the Republican coalition. That's because the newest entrants to a party's electoral coalition are usually its most robust -- and the hardest to roll in intraparty skirmishes. For Republicans, it is the mostly white and older tea partiers, who block electorally beneficial positions on taxes. The next newest entrants to the coalition are Christian conservatives, many of whom also strongly oppose tax increases. Fiscally conservative and socially progressive Rockefeller types are the oldest group, but they've been leaving the Republican Party for decades. Whereas many of them supported Republican congressional candidates in the 1970s, far less did by the 2000s. So while this group is the easiest to persuade of the need for adjustments (indeed, many already share Jeb's views), they hold the least sway in the party. What does all this mean? American parties since the Civil War have periodically shed the coalition elements that are most distant from their activist base. While Jeb's prescriptions are in the party's long-term interest, they will be difficult to execute, given the strength of the party's coalition members. Can Jeb sway a resistant party base? It's quite possible: His family's odyssey has reflected the party's shifts for 50 years, and he's uniquely positioned to convince his peers. If Republicans listen, it will constitute a return to their roots -- and a reckoning with demographic reality. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Smith. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The Bush family has been a significant part of American politics and mainstream Republicanism for three generations. With various members holding key positions in the party, their beliefs and political stances have both anticipated and mirrored the general trajectory of the Republican party. Prescott Bush, the grandfather, was a \\"moderate progressive\\" and Eisenhower Republican. He supported urban renewal and was an advocate of fiscal responsibility. George H.W. Bush, the father, was a transitional figure who embraced Sunbelt conservatism but did not fully evolve with it, recognizing the importance of maintaining a moderate stance. George W. Bush, the son, adopted a tax-cutting, evangelical conservatism approach. Jeb Bush, a potential presidential candidate, is seeking to bring the party back to its roots of centrism similar to the beliefs of his grandfather. He has suggested that Republicans should be open to bipartisan compromise to address the deficit significantly. However, it remains to be seen if the party will listen and adopt this approach. Jeb's prescriptions may be in the party's long-term interest, but the strength of the current Republican coalition makes it difficult to execute. The Bush family's political odyssey has mirrored the shifts in the Republican party for 50 years, and Jeb Bush could be the key figure in swaying a resistant party base towards a more moderate stance that also acknowledges demographic reality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River? The French colonization of Texas began with the establishment of a fort in present-day southeastern Texas. It was established in 1685 near Arenosa Creek and Matagorda Bay by explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle. He intended to found the colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River, but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused his ships to anchor instead 400 miles (640 km) to the west, off the coast of Texas. The colony survived until 1688. The present-day town of Inez is near the fort's site. The colony faced numerous difficulties during its brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny. Although a handful of men reached Illinois Country, help never made it to the fort. Most of the remaining members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony. Spain learned of La Salle's mission in 1686. Concerned that the French colony could threaten Spain's control over the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the unsettled southeastern region of North America, the Crown funded multiple expeditions to locate and eliminate...

Write an article using the following points: U.S. researchers looked at data from 1988-1994 and 2005-2010. More parents in the earlier date range were able to tell if a child was fat. Increasing trend of weight underestimation is 'extremely alarming'","completion":"Title: The Alarming Increase in Weight Underestimation Among Parents of Obese Children Introduction The health and well-being of children are of paramount importance to parents and society at large. This is why it is crucial for parents to be aware of their children's weight and whether it falls within the healthy range. Sadly, recent research has shown an alarming trend of weight underestimations among parents in the United States when it comes to identifying if a child is overweight or obese. This article will discuss the research findings, the implications of this growing issue, and possible steps that can be taken to counteract this phenomenon. Findings of the Study on Weight Underestimation U.S. researchers examined data gathered from two separate time periods, one between 1988-1994 and another between 2005-2010, to identify how well parents are able to recognize when their child is overweight or obese. The study found that more parents in the earlier date range were able to tell if a child was fat as compared to parents from the later period. This increasing trend of weight underestimation is not only shocking but is also considered as \\"extremely alarming\\" by health professionals. A failure to recognize that a child is overweight or obese can lead to a lack of intervention or delay in seeking necessary medical advice, exacerbating the child's situation and contributing to the already growing problem of childhood obesity. Implications of Weight Underestimation This increased discrepancy between the actual weight of children and parents' perception of their weight can have numerous negative implications. First and foremost, it leads to a lack of preventive measures that could help halt the child's weight gain. This could potentially result in an increased risk of obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases. Furthermore, it could affect the child's mental and emotional well-being, as they may suffer from low self-esteem, depression, and social isolation. There are several factors that contribute to this increasing trend of weight underestimation among parents. One possible explanation is the normalization of overweight and obesity in society, causing parents to become less attuned to identifying such issues among their own children. Additionally, parents may avoid labeling their child as \\"fat\\" due to the stigma surrounding obesity and the desire to protect their child's self-esteem. Lastly, there may be a general lack of knowledge about the appropriate weight ranges for children of different ages and height, resulting in misinterpretations of their child's weight. Steps to Counter Weight Underestimation To address this escalating issue, it is crucial to devise strategies and initiatives to better educate parents and society as a whole about childhood obesity and the importance of accurately recognizing a child's weight status. Here are some steps that can be taken: 1. Raise Awareness: Schools, healthcare providers, and government agencies can work together to implement educational programs and campaigns aimed at raising awareness about the issue of weight underestimation and childhood obesity. These can include workshops, seminars, and informative materials for parents and other caregivers. 2. Clear Guidelines: Provide easily accessible and clear guidelines for parents to identify the appropriate weight range for their children based on age and height. This can be done through online resources, educational materials, or consultations with healthcare providers. 3. Remove the Stigma: Address the societal stigma surrounding obesity and promote a culture that encourages healthy behaviors without judgment or shame. Parents should feel comfortable discussing their child's weight with healthcare providers, educators, and other support networks. 4. Promote Healthy Lifestyle: Encourage parents and families to adopt a healthy lifestyle, including balanced diets and regular physical activity. Schools and community organizations can provide supporting programs to facilitate this process, such as fitness classes, sports clubs, and nutritional counseling. Conclusion The trend of increasing weight underestimation among parents in the United States is an extremely alarming issue that should be addressed as a public health priority. By educating parents, removing the stigma surrounding obesity, and promoting a healthy lifestyle, society can help reduce the impact of childhood obesity and ensure a brighter future for the next generation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The available answer choices are provided as options 'a' through 'e'. Guidelines: 1. Harriet drove at a constant speed of 105 km/h from A-ville to B-town. 2. Then, she immediately drove back to A-ville at a constant speed of 145 km/h. 3. The entire trip took 5 hours. Solution: Let x be the time it took to drive from A-ville to B-town, and y be the time it took to drive back. Total time (x + y) = 5 hours The distance between A-ville and B-town is the same both ways. Therefore, we can write the equation using speed*time = distance formula: 105x = 145y Now, we can express y in terms of x: y = (105x) / 145 Substitute this expression for y in the total time equation: x + (105x) / 145 = 5 Multiply both sides of the equation by 145 to eliminate the fraction: 145x + 105x = 725 Combine the like terms: 250x = 725 Now, divide both sides of the equation by 250: x = 2.9 So, Harriet took 2.9 hours to drive from A-ville to B-town. To convert hours into minutes, multiply by 60: 2.9 * 60 = 174 minutes Therefore, the correct answer is 174 minutes.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Information: - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition. - Støvring is a town in Rebild municipality in Region Nordjylland in the geographic region of the Jutland peninsula known as \\"Himmerland\\" in northern Denmark. The town has a population of 6,988 (1 January 2014), and is one of the centres of industry and retailing in the area. - Løgstør is a town with a population of 4,284 (1 January 2014) and a former municipality (Danish, \\"kommune\\") in Region Nordjylland on the Jutland Peninsula in northern Denmark. The municipality, including the island of Livø, covered an area of , and had a total population of 10,270 (2005). Its last mayor was Jens Lauritzen, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party. - The Jutes, Iuti, or Iutæ were a Germanic people. According to Bede, the Jutes were one of the three most powerful Germanic peoples of their time in the Nordic Iron Age, the other two being the Saxons and the Angles. - Zealand is the largest (7,031 km) and most populated island in Denmark with a population of 2,267,659 (39% of Denmark's total as of January 2016). - A heath is a shrubland habitat found mainly on free-draining infertile, acidic soils and is characterised by open, low-growing woody vegetation. Moorland is generally related to high-ground heaths withespecially in the British Islesa cooler and more damp climate. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - Aggersund is a town and harbour with a population of 347 ( 1 January 2014 ) in the Himmerland region of the Jutland peninsula of Denmark . At Aggersund HVDC Cross-Skagerrak crosses the strait of same name on 70 metres tall pylons . Aggersborg , the largest of Denmark 's former Viking ring castles , is located near Aggersund . - Nibe is a town with a population of 5,093 (1 January 2014), located in Region Nordjylland on the Jutland Peninsula in northern Denmark. The town is located in a geographic region known as \\"Himmerland\\". Nibe was the site of the municipal council of Nibe Municipality. The town also holds the Nibe Festival which is held in its very own, Must Forest. - With a length of approximately 35 km (22 statute miles), Mariager Fjord is the longest fjord in Denmark. Mariager Fjord cuts into the Jutland peninsula from the \\"Kattegat\\" sea and ends at the town of Hobro; other important towns along the fjord are Hadsund and Mariager from which the fjord takes its name. Mariager fjord makes up most of the southern limit of the traditional region of Himmerland. - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands). - Hobro [] is an old market and railway town in Region Nordjylland on the Jutland peninsula in northern Denmark. It has a population of 11,736 (1 January 2014). The town is situated in a hilly terrain at the head of Mariager Fjord, close to the former Viking fortress of Fyrkat. It is the seat of Mariagerfjord municipality. - Himmerland is a peninsula in northeastern Jutland, Denmark. It is delimited to the north and the west by the Limfjord, to the east by the Kattegat, and to the south by the Mariager Fjord. The largest city is Aalborg; smaller towns include Hobro, Aars, Løgstør, Støvring and Nibe. In northeastern Himmerland is the Lille Vildmose, Denmark's largest high bog, which sustains a rich bird life of international importance. - Aalborg, also spelled Ålborg, is an industrial and university city in the North of Jutland, Denmark. It has an urban population of 112,194, making it the fourth most populous city in Denmark. With a population of 210,316, the Municipality of Aalborg is the third most populous in the country after Copenhagen and Aarhus. By road Aalborg is southwest of Frederikshavn, and north of Aarhus. The distance to Copenhagen is as the crow flies. - The Cimbri were an ancient people, either Germanic or Celtic who, together with the Teutones and the Ambrones, fought the Roman Republic between 113 and 101 BC. The Cimbri were initially successful, particularly at the Battle of Arausio, in which a large Roman army was routed, after which they raided large areas in Gaul and Hispania. In 101 BC, during an attempted invasion of Italy, the Cimbri were decisively defeated by Gaius Marius, and their king, Boiorix, was killed. Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling Gladiators in the Third Servile War. - Peat, also called turf, is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter that is unique to natural areas called peatlands, bogs, or mires. The peatland ecosystem is the most efficient carbon sink on the planet because peatland plants capture the CO which is naturally released from the peat, thus maintaining an equilibrium. In natural peatlands, the \\"annual rate of biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition\\", but it takes \\"thousands of years for peatlands to develop the deposits of , which is the average depth of the boreal peatlands\\". One of the most common components is \\"Sphagnum\\" moss (peat moss), although many other plants can contribute. Soils that contain mostly peat are known as histosols. Peat forms in wetland conditions, where flooding obstructs flows of oxygen from the atmosphere, slowing rates of decomposition. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Arable land (from Latin \\"arabilis\\", \\"able to be plowed\\") is, according to one definition, land \\"capable\\" of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable lands such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland. - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - The Kattegat or Kattegatt is a sea area bounded by the Jutlandic peninsula in the west, the Danish straits islands of Denmark to the south and the provinces of Västergötland, Scania, Halland and Bohuslän in Sweden in the east. The Baltic Sea drains into the Kattegat through the Danish Straits. The sea area is a continuation of the Skagerrak and may be seen as a bay of the Baltic Sea or the North Sea or, as in traditional Scandinavian usage, neither of these. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - A bog is a wetland that accumulates peat, a deposit of dead plant materialoften mosses, and in a majority of cases, sphagnum moss. It is one of the four main types of wetlands. Other names for bogs include mire, quagmire, and muskeg; alkaline mires are called fens. They are frequently covered in ericaceous shrubs rooted in the sphagnum moss and peat. The gradual accumulation of decayed plant material in a bog functions as a carbon sink. - Jutland , also known as the Cimbric or Cimbrian Peninsula , is a peninsula of Northern Europe that forms the continental portion of Denmark and the northern portion of Germany. The names are derived from the Jutes and the Cimbri, respectively. Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east. - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark. - The Limfjord (common Danish: \\"Limfjorden\\" , in north Jutlandish dialect: \\"Æ Limfjord\\") is a shallow part of the sea, located in Denmark where it is regarded as a fjord ever since the Vikings. However it has inlets both from the North Sea and Kattegat and hence separates the island of North Jutlandic Island (Danish: \\"Nørrejyske Ø\\", which includes the old provinces \\"Vendsyssel\\", \\"Han herred\\" and \\"Thy\\") from the rest of the Jutland Peninsula. It extends from Thyborøn Channel on the North Sea to Hals on the Kattegat. It is approximately 180 kilometres long and of an irregular shape with numerous bays, narrowings, and islands, most notably Mors, and the smaller ones Fur, Venø, Jegindø, Egholm and Livø. It is deepest at Hvalpsund (24 metres). The Limfjord is not a fjord in the English geological sense in - in Danish, as in Norwegian the term \\"fjord\\" can refer to a wide range of waterways. - Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper. - Aars is a Danish town with a population of 8,105 (1 January 2014) in Himmerland, Denmark. Administratively, Aars is the municipal seat of Vesthimmerland municipality, Region Nordjylland since 2007 and it was also the seat of the mayor in the now abolished Aars Municipality. The town was founded in the 14th century.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Process: - You plant vegetable seeds in the ground - You water the seeds - You wait for the seeds to sprout - You keep the area free of pests and weeds while the plants grow - You thin out the plants as they get bigger to give them space to grow - You remove the vegetables from the plants when they are ripe. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more rain happens, how will it affect LESS vegetables. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The Perturbation Hypothesis is an important concept in understanding how changes or disturbances in environmental conditions can affect a system or a process. In this specific case, the process involves planting and cultivating vegetables, and the perturbation is an increase in rainfall. To analyze the effects of this perturbation on the yield of vegetables, we must consider both direct and indirect consequences of increased rainfall on the various steps of the planting and growing process. 1. Planting vegetable seeds in the ground: Increased rainfall can have a direct effect on this phase; the soil may become overly saturated, which could make it more difficult to plant seeds and possibly lead to seeds being washed away if the soil is too loose. Moreover, a higher water content in the soil can contribute to compaction, reducing soil aeration and limiting root growth. 2. Watering the seeds: The need to manually water the seeds would be reduced due to frequent rain. However, excessive rainfall can result in waterlogged soil, drowning seeds and preventing them from germinating. It can also leach important nutrients from the soil, reducing its fertility and potentially leading to weaker, less productive plants. 3. Waiting for the seeds to sprout: Heavy rainfall and subsequent wet conditions can delay seed germination and encourage the growth of mold and fungi, which can cause seeds to rot. This in turn could result in fewer successful sprouts and eventually, a decreased vegetable yield. 4. Keeping the area free of pests and weeds: Increased rainfall can indirectly affect this step by promoting the growth of weeds and the reproduction of pests. Pests such as slugs and snails thrive in wet conditions, while weeds might grow more quickly in the nutrient-rich soil resulting from frequent rain. Both factors can negatively impact the vegetable plants and lead to a lower vegetable yield if not managed effectively. 5. Thinning out the plants as they get bigger: Excessive rainfall may cause some plants to be more robust due to the availability of water, whereas others might struggle due to waterlogged soil or competition for other resources. This variability would require more attention during the thinning process to ensure that the most promising plants are given enough space to grow. 6. Removing the vegetables from the plants when they are ripe: Aside from potentially affecting the size and quality of the vegetables, increased rainfall could make it difficult to determine the appropriate time for harvesting. Excess water can cause some vegetables to rot or become waterlogged, leading to lower yields and decreased quality. Furthermore, frequent rain may create unfavorable conditions for picking and transporting the vegetables, potentially leading to spoilage and waste. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation - increased rainfall - can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of planting and growing vegetables, with consequences ranging from altered soil conditions and germination rates to increased pest and weed growth and challenges related to harvesting. While some of these effects may be mitigated through proper management and cultivation practices, the overall impact of increased rainfall on vegetable yields is likely to be negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Article:Ministers are phasing in new, toughened GCSEs and originally said the old ones would count in league tables during the transition to the new exams. Now old GCSEs will count for students but not for school accountability. The government said the move meant consistency between exams. Ministers have pushed through a range of changes to GCSE and A-level exams which require complete new syllabuses and examinations to be drawn up, approved and accredited. English and maths GCSEs are being introduced this year, with other subjects to reach schools for teaching in 2016. Many schools, however, run three-year GCSE programmes, which start in Year 9, with some exams being taken in Year 10 and some in Year 11. This enables students to spread exams over two years, rather than having to take a large number of exams in one, and creates space in the timetable to focus on key subjects such as English and maths in Year 11. Students starting these three-year courses in September cannot take the reformed GCSEs in Year 10 because they are not yet available. So, schools had planned that GCSEs taken in Year 10 would be in the unreformed older courses. ASCL president Peter Kent said: \\"School leaders are now left with an invidious dilemma. \\"They must either change decisions already made with students and parents, and rip up existing timetables, to make sure everybody takes the new reformed GCSEs, or press on with the plans they already had in place and accept that their performance tables will suffer because they will include unreformed GCSEs. \\"This has plunged schools, students and parents into disruption and uncertainty.\\" Dr Kent said: \\"It is absolute nonsense. These are perfectly valid qualifications which reflect the achievements of students, but which schools will not be allowed to include in their figures. \\"One subject which is particularly affected is religious education because this is a GCSE which is sat in many schools in Year 10.\\" Mr Kent, who is also head teacher of Lawrence Sheriff School in Rugby, said: \\"In my school we have decided to take the hit on performance tables, but there is no right answer. It is a case of damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don't. \\"ASCL is very disappointed that despite clearly showing to ministers and officials that this decision is profoundly unfair, they have refused to budge. We have asked them to be reasonable, but our appeal has fallen on deaf ears.\\" A Department for Education spokesman said: \\"Our new world-class GCSEs are raising the bar so more young people have access to the world-class education they deserve, equipping them with the skills they need to get on and succeed in life. \\"We want pupils to be taught these new gold standard GCSE courses as soon as possible. \\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The UK government has decided that old GCSEs will count for students but not for school accountability during the transition to the new exams, causing disruption and uncertainty for schools, students, and parents.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Information: - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Eusthenodon is a genus of prehistoric lobe-finned fish. \\"Eusthenodon\\" lived during the Late Devonian period (Frasnian to Famennian faunal stages), around 385 to 359 million years ago. Remains of \\"Eusthenodon\\" have been found in Greenland, Russia, South Africa and more recently in Belgium for the first time. This genus belonged to the family Tristichopteridae, a clade which became extinct at the end of the Devonian. This family is known for some large genera, such as \\"Hyneria\\". \\"Eusthenodon\\" was about long, and among palaeontologists it is regarded as one of the most derived form of this group. - Hyneria is a genus of prehistoric predatory lobe-finned fish that lived during the Devonian period around 360 million years ago. - Vascular plants (from Latin \\"vasculum\\": duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term \\"trachea\\") and also higher plants, form a large group of plants (c. 308,312 accepted known species ) that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis. Vascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants). Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta and Tracheobionta. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - In evolutionary biology, adaptive radiation is a process in which organisms diversify rapidly from an ancestral species into a multitude of new forms, particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available, creates new challenges, or opens new environmental niches. Starting with a recent single ancestor, this process results in the speciation and phenotypic adaptation of an array of species exhibiting different morphological and physiological traits. An example of adaptive radiation would be the avian species of the Hawaiian honeycreepers. Via natural selection, these birds adapted rapidly and converged based on the different environments of the Hawaiian islands. - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments. - Tristichopterids ( Tristichopteridae ) were a diverse and successful group of tetrapodomorph fishes living throughout the Middle and Late Devonian . They first appeared in the Givetian stage of the Middle Devonian . Within the group sizes ranged from a few tens of centimeters ( Tristichopterus ) to several meters ( Hyneria and Eusthenodon ) . Some tristichopterids share some of the features of the elpistostegalians , a paraphyletic assemblage of fishes close to the origin of tetrapods . This mainly concerns the shape of the skull and a reduction in size of the posterior fins . An old and persistent notion is that Eusthenopteron was able to crawl onto land using its fins . However , there is no evidence actually supporting this idea . All tristichopterids went extinct by the end of Late Devonian . - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Tristichopterus is a genus of prehistoric lobe-finned fish which lived during the Devonian period. \\"Tristichopterus\\" belongs to the family Tristichopteridae. - The Silurian is a geologic period and system spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the Ordovician Period, at million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Devonian Period, Mya. As with other geologic periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years. The base of the Silurian is set at a major Ordovician-Silurian extinction event when 60% of marine species were wiped out. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Devonian is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic, spanning 60 million years from the end of the Silurian, million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Carboniferous, Mya. It is named after Devon, England, where rocks from this period were first studied. The first significant adaptive radiation of life on dry land occurred during the Devonian. Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land, forming extensive forests which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the first seed-bearing plants appeared. Various terrestrial arthropods also became well-established. Fish reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to often be dubbed the \\"Age of Fish\\". The first ray-finned and lobe-finned bony fish appeared, while the placodermi began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. - Placodermi (from the Greek = plate and = skin, literally \\"plate-skinned\\") is an extinct class of armoured prehistoric fish, known from fossils, which lived from the Silurian to the end of the Devonian Period. Their head and thorax were covered by articulated armoured plates and the rest of the body was scaled or naked, depending on the species. Placoderms were among the first jawed fish; their jaws likely evolved from the first of their gill arches. Placoderms are paraphyletic, and consist of several distinct outgroups or sister taxa to all living jawed vertebrates, which originated among their ranks. This is illustrated by a 419-million-year-old fossil, \\"Entelognathus\\", from China, which is the only known placoderm with a type of bony jaw like that found in modern bony fishes. This includes a dentary bone, which is found in humans and other tetrapods. The jaws in other placoderms were simplified and consisted of a single bone. Placoderms were also the first fish to develop pelvic fins, the precursor to hindlimbs in tetrapods, as well as true teeth. 380-million-year-old fossils of three other genera, \\"Incistoscutum\\", \\"Materpiscis\\" and \\"Austroptyctodus\\", represent the oldest known examples of live birth. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status.

This detailed explanation will help you understand why this phrase is positive and the context in which it may be used. First, let's break the phrase down into its constituent words: \\"mesmerizing\\" and \\"performance.\\" 1. Mesmerizing: The word \\"mesmerizing\\" is an adjective that is used to describe something that has a captivating or enchanting effect on others. Usually, mesmerizing events, objects or people draw great amounts of attention due to their beauty, skill, or unique characteristics. When someone or something is described as mesmerizing, it implies that it is so alluring that one cannot help but pay attention to and be fascinated by it. 2. Performance: In this context, \\"performance\\" is a noun that typically refers to an act of presenting a form of art, such as theater, music, dance, or other creative expressions. A performance could be a live theatrical play, a concert, a ballet, or any other artistic presentation. The word \\"performance\\" in itself doesn't have any particularly positive or negative connotation; however, it can be influenced by the adjectives or other modifiers that come with it. Now, let's combine the two words back together in the phrase \\"mesmerizing performance.\\" When we say that a performance is mesmerizing, we imply that the performance is so engaging, captivating, and enchanting that the audience is completely drawn into it. It points to an exceptional level of skill, creativity, talent, and mastery of the craft from the performers. They manage to evoke a sense of wonder and admiration in the viewers, creating a memorable experience that leaves a lasting impression. In summary, the phrase \\"mesmerizing performance\\" is positive because it conveys a sense of captivation, enchantment, and admiration that emerges from witnessing an exceptional display of artistic talent and creativity. It is often used when referring to performances that excel and leave the audience in awe, reflecting that the performers have truly outdone themselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - student union - mall - department store - library - town or city Explain why a human would choose \\"mall\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"mall\\" as the most suitable option among the provided choices for someone who needs to visit a bookshop after buying the latest fashion because a mall is a centralized location that offers an extensive range of shops, products, and services catering to a variety of needs and interests. It is specifically designed to serve as a one-stop shopping destination, making it a convenient and efficient choice for such requirements. Let's explore the reasons behind this choice in more detail: 1. Diverse Shopping Options: A mall typically houses numerous retail outlets that cater to various product categories, including fashion and books. After shopping for the latest fashion items at the numerous clothing stores available, the person can easily find a bookshop within the same premises, saving time and effort. 2. Convenience: Given the close proximity of different kinds of shops in a mall, customers can effortlessly move between them, thus simplifying the shopping process and eliminating the need to travel between disparate locations, such as a department store and a separate bookshop. 3. Comfort and Atmosphere: Malls are typically designed with customer comfort in mind, providing a well-maintained, temperature-controlled, and pleasant environment to shop in. Additionally, they offer a wide range of amenities such as restrooms, seating areas, food courts, and parking facilities, making the shopping experience enjoyable and less exhausting. 4. Social Experience: Malls serve not just as a shopping destination but also as a social hub, offering abundant opportunities for entertainment, leisure, and interaction with other shoppers. Thus, visiting a mall provides a more comprehensive and engaging experience than simply going to a standalone store or a library. 5. Extended Hours of Operation: Malls usually have longer hours of operation compared to standalone bookshops, department stores, and libraries, allowing customers the flexibility to shop according to their own convenience. Comparing the other options: - Student Union: This option might have a limited selection, targeting students' needs specifically, and may not have the latest fashion or a wide range of books to choose from. - Department Store: While department stores may offer fashionable clothing, they often do not have a dedicated book section, and if they do, the selection can be quite limited. - Library: This option is dedicated to books but typically doesn't cater to retail fashion needs. Moreover, libraries focus on lending books rather than selling them. - Town or City: This option is too broad and does not offer a specific location or direct guidance on where to find both fashion items and bookshops within the city. Thus, considering the diverse shopping options, convenience, comfortable atmosphere, social engagement, and extended hours of operation, a human would choose \\"mall\\" as the most appropriate answer when it comes to visiting a bookshop after buying the latest fashion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Keep its case unchanged (don't change Uppercase to Lowercase or vice versa). 5. Continue the process until all the elements of the list A have been checked. 6. The \\"result\\" list will contain all the alphabets, in the same order they appear in list A. Now, let's solve the given instance: Input list A: ['x', 'a', 'g', 'b', '6033', '65', 'h', '2535', '7303', '8715', '6449', 'O', '8585', '1519', '5547', '8839', 'W', '5501', 'L', '4581', '5349', '4783', 'e'] Follow the steps: 1. Create an empty list \\"result\\". 2. Go through each element of the input list A. 3-6. Check each element and append if it's an alphabet: - 'x' is an alphabet. Append it. - 'a' is an alphabet. Append it. - 'g' is an alphabet. Append it. - 'b' is an alphabet. Append it. Skip non-alphabet elements like '6033', '65', '2535', '7303', etc. - 'h' is an alphabet. Append it. - 'O' is an alphabet. Append it. Skip non-alphabet elements like '8585', '1519', '5547', etc. - 'W' is an alphabet. Append it. Skip non-alphabet elements like '5501', '4581', etc. - 'L' is an alphabet. Append it. Skip non-alphabet elements like '5349', '4783', etc. - 'e' is an alphabet. Append it. After the process is complete, our result list is: result = ['x', 'a', 'g', 'b', 'h', 'O', 'W', 'L', 'e'] So, the Solution is: ['x', 'a', 'g', 'b', 'h', 'O', 'W', 'L', 'e']"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If the Earth gets warmer, it may have various effects on the sizes and structures of bird nests, particularly smaller nests. Warmer temperatures could influence nest materials, bird behaviors, and ecological factors, ultimately impacting the nests. In this response, I will address how these aspects are influenced and their corresponding effects on smaller nests. 1. Nest building materials: As the Earth gets warmer, some building materials that birds commonly use for their nests may become scarce. For instance, plants that provide twigs and grasses may be affected by changing climates and altered rainfall patterns, leading to less availability of these materials for nest building. As a result, birds living in a warmer environment may have to adapt their nest-building habits, leading to less or smaller nests. 2. Thermal regulation: In a warmer environment, smaller nests may provide better thermal regulation due to their compact size. Smaller nests can help birds maintain a cooler temperature for their eggs and chicks as they don't trap too much heat. In this case, a warmer environment could result in more smaller nests as birds adapt their nest building habits to ensure the survival of their offspring. 3. Behavioral changes: Warmer climates can also bring about changes in bird behavior, which can subsequently affect nesting patterns. Birds may adjust their nesting times during warmer periods, either by starting earlier in the spring or delaying their nesting until they can find suitable conditions. This shift in timing could impact the demand for nesting materials and the number of nests built. It might lead to a situation where there are more, less, or no effect on smaller nests due to these changes. 4. Ecological factors: Warmer temperatures also influence ecological factors, such as the availability of food sources and changes in predator populations. In some cases, a warmer climate could increase food abundance for birds, which might lead to an increase in their population size. This could result in more competition for nest-building materials and space, as well as an increase in predator pressure. These factors could have a varied impact on smaller nests - it could lead to an increase in smaller nests due to higher competition, less smaller nests as birds are forced to build nests in locations not suitable for them, or no effect if other factors counterbalance these ecological changes. 5. Habitats: Environmental changes due to global warming may lead to shifts in bird habitats. Some bird species might be forced to find new areas to build their nests due to the loss of their previous habitats. Consequently, birds might have to adapt to new conditions by building different types or sizes of nests, based on the availability of resources and environmental features. These habitat modifications could result in more, less, or no effect on smaller nests, depending on the specific circumstances. In conclusion, the impact of a warmer Earth on smaller bird nests is multifaceted and hard to predict with certainty. The effect could be more, less, or no impact on smaller nests, based on factors like nest materials, thermal regulation, bird behaviors, ecological factors, and habitat shifts. Each bird species might experience unique challenges due to global warming, which will determine the ultimate outcome on their nesting patterns, including the less or smaller nests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Koizumi Exits Office as He Arrived: Defiant on War Shrine TOKYO, Aug. 15 — With each annual visit Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has paid to the Yasukuni Shrine, the war memorial linked to Japan’s imperial past, the damage to the nation’s relations with China and South Korea has worsened. Even as Mr. Koizumi claimed a more assertive role for Japan in the world — and called for China’s and South Korea’s endorsement to realize it — he chose to be unyielding on his visits to Yasukuni, the one issue that was certain to offend them to the core and stir up memories of exactly why they fear a newly assertive Japan. One result was that by Mr. Koizumi’s last year in office, China’s and South Korea’s leaders refused to talk with him. But true to himself to the very end, Mr. Koizumi paid his sixth and most likely last visit as prime minister — he retires next month — to the shrine early Tuesday morning, on the anniversary of the end of World War II and East Asia’s liberation from Japanese rule. Mr. Koizumi not only chose the most provocative of days, but responded angrily to his critics in a news conference after his visit. He blamed China and South Korea for worsening relations, saying he had always been ready to meet with their leaders despite their opposition to Japan’s efforts to gain a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. He waved away their repeated demands that he stop visiting the shrine, adding that he would not have acceded to such a demand even if it had come from President Bush. “But President Bush wouldn’t say anything so immature,” Mr. Koizumi said. The visit drew immediate condemnation from China and South Korea, as well as from Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia. But just as severe was the criticism within Japan, where many political leaders, major business groups and nearly all the major daily newspapers had pressed him to cease the visits. “He may be able to get away with it, but he has to think it over more deeply,” Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former prime minister and the elder statesman of Mr. Koizumi’s governing Liberal Democratic Party, said in a television interview. Mr. Nakasone, who was the last prime minister to visit Yasukuni on the Aug. 15 anniversary, 21 years ago, stopped praying at the shrine after China protested. Unlike Mr. Nakasone, Mr. Koizumi never stopped. Even though he no longer has any elections to face, Mr. Koizumi is said to have wanted to keep a campaign pledge he made half a decade ago to visit the shrine every year, including on Aug. 15. Mr. Koizumi had also painted himself into a corner by turning the Yasukuni debate into a test of wills. Stopping the visits would have meant backing down to China. In turn, the more China and South Korea criticized Japan over Yasukuni, the more the criticism fueled nationalist sentiments here. The focus on China has made it difficult to have a genuine public debate over Yasukuni, and its role in Japanese society. Yasukuni was built in 1869 as part of Japan’s drive to establish a strong, modern country founded on a nationalistic state religion with a divine emperor at the center. The first soldiers deified in Yasukuni were those who fought and died for the emperor in a civil war, ignoring soldiers on the losing side. Other enshrined soldiers died in conflicts that revolved around Japan’s wars against China and the United States and the occupations of Korea and Taiwan. In 1978, 14 prominent war criminals were secretly enshrined there. With only a month left before Mr. Koizumi’s retirement, attention here and in the region has already turned to how his successor will deal with Yasukuni. “The response from Korea and China today was relatively small because Koizumi is an outgoing prime minister,” said Park Cheol-hee, an expert in Japanese politics at Seoul National University. Mr. Koizumi’s most likely successor, Shinzo Abe, the chief cabinet secretary, is a hawk who has strongly supported the Yasukuni visits. In what appeared to be a well-timed leak by his office, the Japanese news media reported recently that Mr. Abe had secretly prayed at Yasukuni in April. But Mr. Abe refused to confirm or deny the report, and said he would not comment on any future visits. Mr. Abe’s strategy is not likely to satisfy fully Yasukuni’s supporters or critics, but it may present a face-saving way for Japan, China and South Korea to resume talking. “If Abe maintains this ambiguity about Yasukuni when he becomes prime minister, it could allow the South Korean government to respond favorably,” Mr. Park said. “It may be a way out of this deadlock issue. At least, he can buy himself some time before looking for a more permanent compromise. “If he sticks to the Koizumi line, he’ll be in trouble with Korea and China.” A version of this article appears in print on , on page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Koizumi Exits Office as He Arrived: Defiant on War Shrine. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"In his last year in office, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's annual visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine further strained Japan's relations with China and South Korea, leading to a refusal of dialogue from their leaders.

Workers at the fast-food joint who pooled their cash for tickets are furious at a colleague who claims she won with a ticket she bought for herself and has no intention of sharing. “We had a group plan, but I went and played by myself. [The ‘winning’ ticket] wasn’t on the group plan,” McDonald’s “winner’’ Mirlande Wilson 37, told The Post yesterday, insisting she alone bought one of the three tickets nationwide that will split a record 656 million payout. “I was in the group, but this was separate. The winning ticket was a separate ticket,” the single mother of seven said as she and her fiancé left her home in the squalid Westport neighborhood to attend church. The Haitian immigrant refused to show what she said was the winning ticket, claiming she had it hidden in another location and would present it to lottery officials today. Pressed as the day went on, she became more cagey. “I don’t know if I won. Some of the numbers were familiar. I recognized some of [them],’’ she said. “I don’t know why’’ people are saying differently. “I’m going to go to the lottery office [today]. I bought some tickets separately.” With winning tickets also sold in Illinois and Kansas, a single Maryland winner would get an after-tax lump sum of 105 million, or 5.59 million a year for 26 years. If Wilson won, and if it was with a pooled work ticket, the situation would be shockingly similar to that of New Jersey lottery louse Americo Lopes, who tried to screw five former colleagues after hitting a 24 million jackpot before a jury ordered him to spread the wealth. Wilson’s co-workers — who make little more than 7.50 an hour — are sizzling with anger over the notion. “She can’ t do this to us!” said Suleiman Osman Husein, a shift manager and one of 15 members in the pool. “We each paid 5. She took everybody’s money!” A man identifying himself as the boyfriend of a McDonald’s manager named Layla, who was part of the pool, said Wilson bought tickets for the group at the 7-Eleven in Milford Mill, where the winning ticket was sold. The group’s tickets — along with a list of those who contributed to the pool — were left in an office safe at the burger joint, said the man, who gave only his first name, Allen, as he stood next to Layla. She declined to comment. Then, late Friday, before the night’s drawing, the owner of the McDonald’s, Birul Desai, gave Wilson 5 to buy more tickets for the pool on her way home from work, and she went back to the 7-Eleven and bought them, Allen said. Wilson took those tickets home with her, Allen said. But Wilson insisted yesterday that she had bought the second batch with an unidentified pal — not for the pool — and that the winning ticket was among them. A day earlier, a delirious Wilson had called co-workers to break the news — tellingly used the first-person singular. “I won! I won!” she cried, Allen said. Another colleague, Davon Wilson, no relation, said he was there when Mirlande Wilson called. “She said, ‘Turn on the news.’ She said she had won. I thought it was a joke or something. She doesn’t seem like a person who’d do this,” he said. Allan said he and Layla went to Wilson’s home and pounded on the door for 20 minutes until she finally came out. “These people are going to kill you. It’s not worth your life!” Allen said he told her. “All right! All right! I’ll share, but I can’t find the ticket right now,” she finally said, according to Allen. Yohannes Michael, a clerk at the 7-Eleven where Wilson bought the tickets, expressed doubts about her story when he said yesterday that lottery officials have reviewed the store’s video and believe that a man bought the winning ticket. Lottery rep Carole Everett would not confirm that. Reached at his Fairfax, Va., home, Desai, the McDonald’s owner, declined to comment except to say, “It’s all bulls–t, if you ask me. It’s speculation.” ||||| The director of the Maryland Lottery says no one in the state has stepped forward with a winning Mega Millions lottery ticket yet. Stephen Martino said Monday on NBC's \\"Today\\" show that the ticket, one of three winning tickets purchased for the record-breaking 640 million prize, has yet to be claimed. The New York Post reported Monday that McDonald's employee Mirlande Wilson claims she holds the winning ticket. The newspaper reports that Wilson plans to contact lottery officials Monday.

Consequently, it is considered improper to use one's left hand for holding food, touching others, or passing objects as it may offend certain guests. It is essential to be aware of these cultural differences to ensure a harmonious and respectful environment for all visitors. Similarly, some Westerners may be offended if you touch them or their personal belongings, even by accident. In such instances, it is vital to apologize politely to maintain a friendly and enjoyable interaction. Furthermore, some elderly Westerners may feel offended if you attempt to help them without their permission. Thus, it is best to ask for their consent before offering assistance to ensure they feel comfortable and respected. Different cultures may have specific beliefs regarding numbers, with some Westerners avoiding the number 13 due to its perceived association with bad luck. Awareness of these beliefs will help provide a considerate and hospitable environment for guests from all cultural backgrounds. Religious dietary restrictions and preferences are also crucial to consider. For example, Muslims are prohibited from consuming pork, and words like 'pig' are considered inappropriate. Being mindful of these restrictions and adjusting the menu and conversation topics accordingly can contribute to a positive and inclusive atmosphere. Various cultural beliefs might also dictate specific gift-giving guidelines. For instance, people from Brazil, Italy, and Pakistan avoid giving handkerchiefs as gifts since they are thought to be associated with unhappy emotions. In many parts of western and middle Asia, where a majority of Muslims reside, wine is not an appropriate gift either. Lastly, regarding the question about Indians and the left hand, the answer is A) unclean. Indians consider the left hand unclean, which is why they avoid using it to hold food. By understanding and respecting these cultural differences and sensitivities, you can create a welcoming and enjoyable experience for guests from all over the world during their August visit."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why is the female narrator so grateful to the man ?","completion":"The female narrator is grateful to the man, presumably named Tyler, for several reasons as inferred from the passage. Firstly, she appreciates his affectionate and caring nature. This is evidenced by the sentence, “He is so sweet to them.” While the passage doesn't provide explicit details on who 'them' refers to, it could presumably be children or other family members, further implying his role as a loving family man. Secondly, he brings joy and positivity into her life, illustrated in the line, “He loves to make us laugh.” This reference to shared humor and the man’s desire to create a light-hearted and joyous atmosphere exhibit a quality in him that significantly contributes to the narrator’s gratefulness. Thirdly, the man offers emotional support to her, making efforts to help her maintain a positive outlook on life, which is indicated by “he tries really hard to help me be a happy mom.” This suggests that he is sensitive to the narrator's mental well-being and actively endeavors to ensure her happiness, revealing an empathetic and considerate personality. The narrator also values their intimate conversations and his willingness to share deeper thoughts and feelings with her, as stated in the line, “I love talking to him at night (when he spills his guts).” Therefore, a level of emotional intimation is maintained between them, contributing to her gratefulness due to the deepened trust and mutual understanding. Moreover, the narrator is impressed with the man's ability to handle daily situations. This is suggested by, “I am always amazed at how he handles the day's situations.” Even though it is not explicitly stated what these situations are, it can be interpreted that he copes effectively with everyday challenges, a trait that the narrator greatly admires. Also, his passion – represented through his love for hockey from a young age – could be another factor because it suggests consistency and commitment, which are desirable traits. This is inferred from the sentence, “Since the day Tyler could walk, he has carried a hockey stick.\\" Overall, these multiple instances of kindness, humor, empathy, emotional transparency, stability, and passion are reasons why the female narrator feels so grateful towards the man."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Goalkeeper Hope Solo has been suspended from the U.S. women's national team for 30 days and won't participate in matches next month in Europe. In a photo provided by the Manhattan Beach, Calif., Police Department, Jerramy Stevens appears in a booking photo. Stevens, a former Seattle Seahawks tight end and the husband of U.S. soccer goalkeeper... (Associated Press) FILE - In this Oct. 20, 2013, file photo, United States goalkeeper Hope Solo pauses on the field during the second half of an international friendly women's soccer match against Australia in San Antonio.... (Associated Press) U.S. Soccer did not specify the reason for the suspension, announced Wednesday night. It comes after the arrest of her husband, former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens, earlier this week on suspicion of driving under the influence. Solo was in the car when Stevens was pulled over in Manhattan Beach, California, about 1:30 a.m. Monday for driving without headlights. Solo was not arrested or detained. It is the latest off-field trouble for Solo. Earlier this month, a judge dismissed two misdemeanor counts of domestic violence against her. The 33-year-old goalkeeper was in Southern California for training camp with the U.S. national team, which is preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June. \\"During our current national team camp, Hope made a poor decision that has resulted in a negative impact on U.S. Soccer and her teammates,\\" coach Jill Ellis said in a statement. \\"We feel at this time it is best for her to step away from the team.\\" Solo, who has won two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. team, was released from camp. \\"I accept and respect the Federation's decision, and more importantly, I apologize for disappointing my teammates, coaches and the Federation who have always supported me,\\" Solo said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Wednesday night. \\"I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team.\\" The domestic violence charges stemmed from an altercation with her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew at a party in Washington last June. Solo had pleaded not guilty in that case, and she continued to play for the U.S. team and with her National Women's Soccer League team, the Seattle Reign, while awaiting trial. Solo married Stevens in 2012. He was arrested just before their wedding for investigation of assault after a disturbance involving Solo, but he was not charged. Her last appearance with the national team was in December, when she started in a scoreless draw against Brazil in the championship game of the 2014 International Tournament of Brasilia. Last September in an exhibition victory over Mexico, Solo logged her 72nd shutout, passing Briana Scurry (1994-2008) on national team's career list. The suspension comes at a critical time for the U.S. team. Following the exhibition matches in February, the U.S. team will play in the Algarve Cup in March. The team will open World Cup play on June 8 against Australia in Winnipeg, Manitoba. An expanded field of 24 teams will compete in the World Cup, which will be played in six Canadian cities. The United States is in Group D, which also includes Sweden and Nigeria. The U.S. women, currently ranked No. 2 in the world behind Germany, are seeking their third World Cup title but first since 1991. Solo will be eligible for reinstatement after the suspension, pending review and approval by U.S. Soccer and Ellis, U.S. Soccer said. ||||| TMZ Sports It's now time to reevaluate who your Valentine is this year ... because UFC star Arianny Celeste is doing a super hot lingerie shoot for Lovers Day ... and she doesn't know you exist.… ||||| Hope Solo, the star goalkeeper of the United States women’s national team, has been suspended for 30 days because of an \\"incident\\" during the team’s ongoing training camp in Southern California, U.S. Soccer announced. The suspension is effective immediately. According to TMZ Sports, Solo, 33, was in a car with her husband, former NFL player Jerramy Stevens, when they were pulled over around 2 a.m. on Monday. Stevens was arrested and charged with driving under the influence. Solo was also heavily inebriated, according to the report. [FC Yahoo: The one lingering problem that MLS must address] The incident occurred just a week after the dismissal of Solo’s domestic violence case in which she had been charged with two counts of assault for a June altercation with her half-sister and nephew. Story Continues \\"During our current National Team camp, Hope made a poor decision that has resulted in a negative impact on U.S. Soccer and her teammates,\\" U.S. head coach Jill Ellis said in a statement. \\"We feel at this time it is best for her to step away from the team.\\" Solo responded on Facebook. \\"I accept and respect the Federation’s decision, and more importantly, I apologize for disappointing my teammates, coaches and the Federation who have always supported me,\\" she wrote. \\"I think it’s best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team.\\" Once again, the incident is exceedingly poorly timed, with the USA getting ready for this summer’s Women’s World Cup in Canada and Solo only just getting out of her latest run-in with the law. She and Stevens had also been involved in a domestic violence case on the eve of their 2012 wedding that was dismissed for a lack of evidence. Solo is inarguably a difference maker on the field and badly needed if the Americans are to finally end their 16-year World Cup drought. There is no way to replace her without suffering a significant talent drop-off at the goalkeeper position. [FC Yahoo: So far, Luis Suarez has been a bust for Barcelona] Plainly, U.S. Soccer had little choice but to suspend her for this latest incident, since it had happened while Solo was with the team (which pays its members a full-time salary). The federation had stood by Solo and allowed her to keep playing while her assault charges awaited trial, allowing the justice system to run its course – even celebrating her record-setting 72nd shutout with the national team and awarding her the captain’s armband the following game. Her case was dismissed when her accusers failed on several occasions to be interviewed by her lawyer. That incident had happened while she was away from the team. U.S. Soccer didn’t have all the information then; it did this time around. So for the sake of its integrity, the federation had to send Solo home. But in Ellis’s build-up to the World Cup, this is a major inconvenience, with testing friendlies in France and England coming up – both of which Solo will miss. There are no guarantees that Solo will be back at all. Ellis and the federation might decide the goalie is more trouble than she’s worth and too much of a distraction as the team heads into the high-pressure environment of a World Cup just across its own border. After her assault case, Solo was on thin ice, and she just dunked right through it. Solo, for her part, is putting a lot at stake by failing to suppress her undeniable talent for finding trouble. At her age, this could well be her last World Cup. And she continues to tarnish a well-established mainstream brand – she has a varied portfolio of endorsements and has appeared on \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" and in ESPN The Magazine’s Body Issue – potentially leaving huge amounts of money on the table. With just 138 days left before the USA kicks off its World Cup, it might have to go looking for a new goalkeeper. Leander Schaerlaeckens is a soccer columnist for Yahoo Sports.

What is the final step of the following process: - A mold spore floats through the air - The spore lands on a piece of bread - The spore grows hyphae into the bread - The mold forms a colony - Sporangiophores grow upward Answer:","completion":"The final step in the process of mold growth on bread, after sporangiophores grow upward, is the formation and release of new mold spores into the environment. This ensures the continuation of the mold's life cycle and its ability to spread to other surfaces. Sporangiophores are specialized hyphae that support the reproductive structures of the mold. At the tips of these sporangiophores, sporangia develop, which are sac-like structures that contain spores. These sporangia are essential for mold reproduction as they produce and store the new spores. As the mold colony matures and establishes a dense network of hyphae, the sporangia at the tips of the sporangiophores fill up with spores. Eventually, the sporangia mature and rupture, releasing the spores contained within. These newly released spores are then carried by airflow, insects, or other means to new locations in the environment, where they have the potential to land on suitable substrates and initiate new mold growth cycles. This process of releasing new spores is crucial for the mold's survival and propagation. Mold spores are incredibly resilient, capable of surviving harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures, dry spells, and other unfavorable environments for extended periods. These hardy spores can remain dormant until they encounter favorable conditions for growth, such as moisture and a suitable nutrient source like bread. Once they land on a suitable surface and the conditions are right, they will germinate, grow hyphae, and start developing a new mold colony, repeating the cycle of growth and reproduction. In summary, the final step after sporangiophores grow upward in the mold growth process on bread is the formation and release of new mold spores, ensuring the continuation of the mold's life cycle and its ability to spread and colonize new surfaces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India. France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India.

Choices: - The unearthliness and the grandeur of its architecture.; - The presence of American super stars.; - The saying made by American writers and journalists.; - The roaring of the river in the Canyon.; Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A famous American John Muir said in 1898: \\"The Grand Canyon... as unearthly in the color and grandeur of its architecture as if you had found it after death on some other star.\\" Like Muir, those of us who stand along the rim are prompted to wonder about the unearthliness and the forces that created and are still changing this place. After more than 100 years of studies, many things are still mysterious. Today visitors come by the thousands -- the great and simple of the earth -- all in a spirit of wonder. Travelers come from every state of the Union, from every country in Europe and Asia. From the depths of the canyon comes welling silence. Seldom can you hear the roar of the river, for all sounds are swallowed in this gulf of space. \\"It makes one want to murmur.\\" A woman once whispered to her companion. This silence is not the silence of death; rather, it is a presence. It is like a great piece of music. But music made of man works up to a climax and stops. Now, visitors to the South Rim alone may number 18,000 in a single day. Some of that number will travel by mule train down Bright Angel Trail to the canyon's floor, cross the raging river by a suspension bridge and walk to the North Rim. Though the two rims face each other across only 12 miles, it is a journey of 214 miles by car from one to the other. Nor can you visit the North Rim except in summer; some 1,200 feet higher than the South Rim, it is snow covered much of the year except in July and August. But there is no day that you may not visit the South Rim and find the sun warm on your face and the air perfumed with the incense of smoke from an Indian hearth .

Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords.

Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects. In the Seleucid empire for example, this group amounted to only 2.5 percent of the official class. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The locales that picked up a lot of the Hellenic culture were primarily the great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. These cities were likely among those that experienced significant influence from Greek culture during the Hellenistic period. It's also notable that some local elites and mid-level administrators throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms, including those in the Seleucid empire, adopted Greek ways too. These people served as intermediaries between the Greek-speaking upper class and their subjects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The latest study about antioxidants is terrifying. Scientists think they may boost cancer cells to spread faster. Since the term \\"antioxidants\\" made the leap from the realm of biochemistry labs and into the public consciousness in the 1990s, Americans have come to believe that more is better when it comes to consuming the substance that comes in things like acai berries, green tea and leafy veggies. A provocative new study published Wednesday in the journal Nature raises important questions about that assumption. Antioxidants — which include vitamins C and E and beta-carotene, and are contained in thousands of foods — are thought to protect cells from damage by acting as defenders against something called \\"free radicals\\" which the body produces as a part of metabolism or that can enter through the environment. That's all great for normal cells. But what researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center found is that antioxidants can work their magic on cancerous cells, too — turbo-charging the process by which they grow and spread. Researcher Sean Morrison and his colleagues conducted experiments on mice that had been transplanted with skin cancer cells (melanoma) from human patients. They gave nothing to one group. To the other they gave doses of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) which is a common antioxidant that's used in nutritional and bodybuilding supplements and has been used as a treatment for patients with HIV/AIDS and in some children with certain genetic disorders. The results were alarming: Those in the second group had markedly higher levels of cancer cells in their blood, grew more tumors and the tumors were larger and more widespread than in the second. \\"What we're starting to learn is that there can be bad cells from cancer that appear to benefit more from antioxidants than normal cells,\\" he said in an interview. Morrison, director of the Children’s Medical Center Research Institute at UT Southwestern, explained that it has to do with something called oxidative stress. Scientists have known for a while now that cancer metastasis — especially when it involves spreading a great distance to another part of the body — is a very inefficient process and that many cells die along the way. This is likely due to oxidative stress, which is an inability by the body to counteract the harmful effect of free radicals. When antioxidants supplements are given, the paper hypothesizes, they may give new life to those cancerous cells that are on the edge of dying. Morrison said that previous studies have shown that the progression of metastasis of human melanoma cells in mice is predictive of their metastasis in humans, which raises concerns about the use of dietary antioxidants by patients with cancer. Moreover, melanoma may not be the only type of cancer to be affected this way. A similar study conducted at Vanderbilt University and published in PLoS One in 2012 involving mice with prostate cancer also showed that antioxidants appeared to increase the proliferation of cells in the pre-cancerous lesions. And another one in rodents with lung cancer published in Science Translational Medicine in 2014 found that normal doses of vitamin E and smaller doses of acetylcysteine, an antioxidant supplement, appeared to lead to a three-fold increase in the number of tumors and caused them to be more aggressive. As a result, the mice given antioxidants died twice as fast the ones in the control group. The reaction appeared be dose dependent with larger doses leading to a more severe reaction. Morrison said that further study needs to be done to confirm the findings and that cancer patients should still consume antioxidants as part of a healthy diet. But, he added, \\"personally, from the results we've seen, I would avoid supplementing my diet with large amounts of antioxidants if I had cancer.\\" Over the past 20 years, numerous studies were launched to ascertain the effect of antioxidants on other conditions ranging from heart disease to memory loss. Early results have mostly been mixed, but that hasn't stopped food companies from hyping their disease-fighting abilities. This post has been updated.

In each bundle, separating the xylem and phloem, is a layer of meristem or active formative tissue known as cambium. By the formation of a layer of cambium between the bundles (interfascicular cambium), a complete ring is formed, and a regular periodical increase in thickness results from the development of xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside. The soft phloem becomes crushed, but the hard wood persists and forms the bulk of the stem and branches of the woody perennial.

An amnesiac Queens woman who vanished 21 years ago may have been spotted walking the aisles of a South Carolina Walmart earlier this month. Fresh Meadows resident Renee LaManna, now 57, suffered a nervous breakdown after her boyfriend of 10 years broke things off in 1994, older sister Margaret LaManna said. She was found barefoot in frigid conditions in Queens on Jan. 8, 1994, and was taken to her sister’s Ocean City, N.J., home after a brief stay at Queens Center Psychiatric Hospital. That’s the last time the sisters saw one another. Renee LaManna ran away that night, and as her sister searched for her as a missing person, occasional reported sightings proved LaManna was alive. The quest is still alive too. The family has doggedly documented motel stays, police booking photos and hired private investigators and even a retired FBI agent along the way. “I have spent 21 years looking for Renee,” Margaret LaManna wrote. “My parents suffered greatly. They died looking for Renee.” The hunt heated up again this year. Since January alone, the family has received reports of LaManna in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, North and South Carolina. North Carolina police issued a Silver Alert for LaManna in March. Then came a break. The Cape May County Prosecutor’s Office sent out an alert Aug. 18 to authorities in Virginia, North and South Carolina. LaManna was spotted at a Walmart in Taylors, S.C. “I’m looking for my family, I can’t understand why they can’t find me,” the woman, who uses several aliases, tells people who try to help her, Margaret LaManna said. LaManna reportedly hitchhikes with truckers and stays in shelters. She is mentally ill, her sister warns, but is a threat only to herself and not others. And she is still on an endless road, far from home. Other people have joined the hunt. “We drive in circles, I go into stores and hand out flyers,” said Linda Craig of Asheville, N.C., told WHNS. “I know that Renee is out there, because I saw her. I know she is alive, I know she is out there.” A Scranton, Penn., transport company painted LaManna’s image on the back of a 53-foot tractor-trailer with the words “Please find me!” Anyone with information regarding the Queens woman can contact Margaret LaManna through Twitter, Facebook or by calling 888-RENEE11.

Article: Doctors fighting malaria---one of the deadliest diseases on the planet--- may soon have a new affordable weapon in their smart phones. Researchers have found a way to use the phone's camera to detect the microorganism in the patient's blood that causes the disease. According to the World Health Organization, almost 600,000 people died of malaria in 2013, making this mosquito-borne disease one of the deadliest in the world. The saddest aspect of this calamity is that it affects mostly young children. Early detection of the infection is important for successful treatment. But since the first symptoms resemble ordinary flu, a microbiologist must look at a drop of a patient's blood under a microscope for a proper diagnosis. Scientists in Britain have now developed a smart phone attachment called Xrapid, that turns the phone into a 200-power microscope, while the attached app---based on facial recognition software - quickly detects the parasitic protozoa in the blood smear . Jean Viry-Babel is the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the app. He says it is cheap and works on the spot. \\"So we take a high-definition picture of a sample of blood. We separate the red blood cells from the rest---the white blood cells, the platelets ---and we start looking at each of the red blood cells individually,\\" said Viry-Babel. Viry-Babel says the app is affordable, easy to use and provides reliability of up to 98 percent. The only additional equipment required is an ordinary glass lab slide - called a \\"slate.\\" \\"There's only one button, which is called \\"Diagnose\\". So you put it on the slate and you put it on the dried blood, and you press diagnose and it tells you yes or no,\\" he said. Researchers say the field-testing of the device will begin in January and February in Tanzania, Benin and Indonesia --- while commercial use is scheduled to start by the end of March. They also plan to expand the versatility of the new device---teaching it to recognize other diseases, such as tuberculosis and Lyme Disease. Question: What can we learn from Viry-Babel? Options: A: The app is cheap but must work in the lab. B: The white cells and the platelets must be studied carefully. C: The accuracy of the app is nearly a hundred percent.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. and the situation: Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted. They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next. Answer the following question: Which person will not have convex lenses in their glasses? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's analyze the information given: 1. Farsightedness (hyperopia) can be corrected with convex lenses. 2. Kathy is farsighted. 3. Jacob is nearsighted. Since Kathy is farsighted, she will have convex lenses in her glasses to correct her vision. On the other hand, Jacob is nearsighted, which means his condition is different from Kathy's, and he requires a different type of lens to correct his vision. Nearsightedness (myopia) is usually corrected with concave lenses. So, Jacob will not have convex lenses in his glasses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Rob Kardashian, an American television personality and member of the famous Kardashian family, has struggled with his weight and related health issues for many years. In 2016, he was diagnosed with diabetes and since then, he has been trying to make lifestyle changes and commit to a healthier routine to improve his overall health. As for surgery, it is not publicly confirmed that Rob Kardashian underwent any specific surgical procedures to address his weight or health issues. However, there have been speculations and rumors regarding potential weight loss surgeries like gastric sleeve or gastric bypass to help him lose weight. It is important to recognize that these speculations may be based on observations of his weight changes over the years but might not necessarily be accurate, especially given the privacy concerns of celebrities. There have also been discussions about potential surgeries for addressing his diabetes. For some people with type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in improving blood sugar control and even achieving diabetes remission. However, again, there is no public confirmation that Rob Kardashian underwent such a surgery. It is worth noting that Rob has made attempts to transform his lifestyle to address his health issues without surgery. This includes changes to his diet, regular exercise, therapy, and possibly working with nutritionists and trainers to shed excess weight and manage his diabetes. Over time, he has shown noticeable progress in his weight loss journey, which could have been achieved without necessarily undergoing any specific surgeries. Some people may mistakenly attribute this progress to surgery, but it is important to recognize the tremendous effort and dedication required for someone to succeed in their weight loss journey. In conclusion, while there have been various speculations about potential surgeries for Rob Kardashian concerning his weight and health, there is no public confirmation or solid evidence indicating that he underwent any specific procedures.

If I tell you that Natural disasters can cause animals to leave their homes, and ask you the question \\"what can cause animals to leave their homes?\\", is the correct answer \\"pesticides\\"? Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is not limited to just \\"pesticides.\\" There are several factors that can cause animals to leave their homes, including natural disasters as mentioned in your statement. These factors can be categorized into natural and human-induced causes. Let's explore them in detail. Natural Causes: 1. Natural disasters: As you have mentioned, natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and wildfires can force animals out of their natural habitats. These events may destroy their homes, deplete their food sources, and uproot their entire population. 2. Climatic changes: Extreme or sudden changes in temperature, precipitation, and other climatic factors can force animals to migrate in search of more suitable conditions. For instance, during an unusually hot and dry summer, animals may have to move to find water and cooler temperatures. 3. Predation: The presence of predators can be a significant reason for smaller animals to leave their homes. When faced with dangerous predators, animals often have no choice but to abandon their habitats in search of safer grounds. 4. Competition for resources: Animal populations need resources like food, shelter, and space to survive and reproduce. When there is a scarcity of resources or an increase of competition due to the expansion of another species, animals may be forced to find new homes. 5. Disease or parasites: An outbreak of disease or parasites can deplete a population or even wipe it out completely. In such cases, animals may need to leave their homes to escape the disease or infestation and find new healthy populations to join. Human-induced Causes: 1. Pesticides: As per your suggestion, pesticides can indeed cause animals to leave their homes. Widespread application of these toxic chemicals in agriculture and other areas can have disastrous effects on animal populations, forcing them to find new habitats or causing entire species to decline or go extinct. 2. Habitat fragmentation and destruction: Human activities such as deforestation, mining, agriculture, and urbanization can destroy animal habitats and fragment populations, often leaving them no choice but to move to new areas to survive. Fragmentation can also lead to restricted genetic gene flow between population segments and reduced population size, making animals more vulnerable to extinction. 3. Pollution: Air, water, and soil pollution generated by industrial and agricultural activities can contaminate animals' environments, causing them to leave their homes in search of cleaner habitats. 4. Noise pollution: Animals that are sensitive to sound, especially those that rely heavily on sonar or other acoustic communication methods, can be adversely affected by noise pollution. This can disrupt their ability to communicate, navigate, or locate food sources, consequently forcing them to leave their homes. 5. Introduction of invasive species: Sometimes, humans inadvertently introduce foreign species to new habitats. These invasive species can outcompete native species for resources, driving native animals to find new habitats or go extinct. In conclusion, various factors can cause animals to leave their homes. Some of these factors include natural disasters, climatic changes, predation, competition for resources, disease or parasites, pesticides, habitat fragmentation and destruction, pollution, noise pollution, and the introduction of invasive species. While \\"pesticides\\" is one valid answer, it is essential to consider other factors as well, as they all play crucial roles in determining the survival and extent to which animals are forced to abandon their natural habitats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the person whose march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 men? When Alexander the Great died at Babylon in 323 BC, his mother Olympias immediately accused Antipater and his faction of poisoning him, although there is no evidence to confirm this. With no official heir apparent, the Macedonian military command split, with one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (r. 323 – 317 BC) as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana, Alexander IV (r. 323 – 309 BC). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323–322 BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319 BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi, the former generals of Alexander's army.A council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexander's death, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321 BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319 BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent...","completion":"The name of the person whose march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 men was Perdiccas.

Communicate with your coworkers or manager if you need help or guidance; they can provide valuable input and support. 2. You feel stressed because you lack concrete sources of energy. It's important to learn how to manage stress effectively, especially when it originates from feeling overwhelmed or under-resourced. Implement self-care practices such as regular exercise, adequate sleep, and a nutritious diet to enhance your energy levels and boost your emotional well-being. Moreover, consider seeking the support of friends, family, or even a counselor who can offer insights and coping techniques to manage stress. 3. You can't figure out how you'll tackle it. In this case, begin by addressing your organization and time management skills. Create a detailed plan of action that outlines specific, achievable objectives, and allocate time efficiently to accomplish these goals. Break tasks into smaller, manageable parts to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Remember to prioritize urgent tasks and utilize tools or resources, such as calendars or to-do lists, to assist with organization. Additionally, consider collaborating with others or seeking advice from those who have faced similar challenges, as they can offer valuable insights and support. 4. You might be working with electrical appliance contractors for a special project. In this scenario, clear communication is key. Make sure to outline your expectations, requirements, and deadlines with the contractor to ensure a mutual understanding and prevent misunderstandings. Keep the lines of communication open with regular check-ins to monitor progress, address issues that arise, and offer feedback to keep the project moving forward efficiently. Maintain a detailed log of the tasks and challenges, as well as the steps you're taking to resolve them. This will not only keep you organized, but also serve as evidence that you're actively working towards overcoming obstacles. In summary, regardless of the specific reason behind feelings of failure, it's crucial to develop a proactive mindset and take constructive action. By breaking down tasks into smaller objectives, prioritizing efficiently, addressing stress and energy levels, seeking support from others, and maintaining clear communication, it's possible to overcome feelings of failure and achieve success in various aspects of life.

Add spaces: Yourveterinarianwillwantacompletemedicalhistorytodeterminetheunderlyingcauseoftheskinallergies,includingaphysicalexaminationofthedog.","completion":"Your veterinarian will want a complete medical history to determine the underlying cause of the skin allergies, including a physical examination of the dog. When you visit the veterinarian with your dog for possible skin allergies, it is essential to provide them with detailed information to help identify the cause and develop a suitable treatment plan. Here's a breakdown of the different aspects they may want to explore: 1. Complete medical history: The veterinarian will ask about your dog's overall health, previous illnesses, vaccinations, and any treatments or medications they have received. This will help them pinpoint any factors that may be contributing to the skin allergies. 2. Allergy triggers: You should mention any potential allergens your dog might have been exposed to, such as pollen, grass, dust mites, flea bites, or specific foods. It is also crucial to note if the skin allergies seem seasonal since this could provide valuable clues about the allergens involved. 3. Onset and symptoms: Providing accurate information about when the skin allergies first appeared and the symptoms exhibited by your dog, such as itching, redness, inflammation, hair loss, or skin lesions, will help the veterinarian determine the severity of the issue and rule out other possible conditions. 4. Home environment: Describe your dog's living environment, indoor and outdoor activities, bathing and grooming routines, and any recent changes in their lifestyle, such as new products, bedding, or food. This information could help identify allergens present in their surroundings that might have prompted the allergic reaction. 5. Physical examination: The veterinarian will perform a thorough physical examination of your dog, focusing on their skin, coat, and overall physical condition. They may also take skin scrapings and hair samples for lab testing to rule out other conditions such as parasites, bacterial or fungal infections, and hormonal imbalances. 6. Allergy testing: If the veterinarian suspects skin allergies resulting from allergen exposure, they might recommend further testing to identify the specific allergens causing the reaction. This could involve blood tests, intradermal skin tests, or elimination diets. Once the underlying cause of the skin allergies has been identified, your veterinarian will develop a customized treatment plan that may include medications, topical treatments, dietary changes, and allergen avoidance strategies. Your dog's progress will be monitored, and the treatment plan may be adjusted as needed to ensure the best possible outcome for your furry companion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. You are given a new situation: Vince had a small rural farm. He needed to increase production and efficiency, so he started using herbicides. Danny was one of his farmer friends, he had a small acreage farm and he practiced permaculture, so no pesticides. and a hint : In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. Please answer this question : Which farmer didn't perform any applications of herbicide as a preventive measure?

Howard Robard Hughes Jr. (December 24, 1905 - April 5, 1976) was an American business magnate, investor, record-setting pilot, film director, and philanthropist, known during his lifetime as one of the most financially successful individuals in the world. He first made a name for himself as a film producer, and then became an influential figure in the aviation industry. Later in life, he became known for his eccentric behavior and reclusive lifestyle--oddities that were caused in part by a worsening obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), chronic pain from several plane crashes, and increasing deafness. As a maverick film tycoon, Hughes gained prominence in Hollywood beginning in the late 1920s, when he produced big-budget and often controversial films like The Racket (1928), Hell's Angels (1930), and Scarface (1932). Beyond extending his business prowess in the manufacturing, aviation, entertainment, and hospitality industries, Hughes was a successful real estate investor. Hughes was deeply involved in the American real estate industry where he amassed vast holdings of undeveloped land both in Las Vegas and in the desert surrounding the city that had gone unused during his lifetime. In 1968, the Hughes Tool Company purchased the North Las Vegas Air Terminal. Originally known as Summa Corporation, The Howard Hughes Corporation was formed in 1972 when the oil tools business of Hughes Tool Company, then owned by Howard Hughes Jr., was floated on the New York Stock Exchange under the Hughes Tool name. This forced the remaining businesses of the \\"original\\" Hughes Tool to adopt a new corporate name Summa. The name \\"Summa\\"--Latin for \\"highest\\"--was adopted without the approval of Hughes himself, who preferred to keep his own name on the business, and suggested HRH Properties (for Hughes Resorts and Hotels, and also his own initials). In 1988, Summa announced plans for Summerlin, a master-planned community named for the paternal grandmother of Howard Hughes, Jean Amelia Summerlin. Initially staying in the Desert Inn, Hughes refused to vacate his room, and instead decided to purchase the entire hotel. Hughes extended his financial empire to include Las Vegas real estate, hotels, and media outlets, spending an estimated 300 million, and using his considerable powers to take-over many of the well known hotels, especially the organized crime connected venues.

A lot of trouble later caused Marwan and some of Ali 's supporters who later became Khawarij . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"These two sentences are not entirely identical in meaning, and the differences can cause confusion. To understand the distinction between them, it is essential to dissect each sentence and analyze their content. In the first sentence: \\"Ali and some of Marwan 's supporters who later became the Khawarij caused a lot of trouble.\\" The subject of this sentence is \\"Ali and some of Marwan's supporters.\\" These individuals later became known as the Khawarij. The sentence implies that both Ali and these supporters were responsible for causing a lot of trouble. Thus, the focus is on Ali and a specific group of Marwan's supporters that transformed into the Khawarij. In the second sentence: \\"A lot of trouble later caused Marwan and some of Ali 's supporters who later became Khawarij.\\" The subject of this sentence is not clear and might be misinterpreted as \\"A lot of trouble.\\" It seems to state that trouble caused Marwan and some of Ali's supporters, who later became Khawarij. The sentence structure is problematic and not equivalent to the first sentence, as it appears to suggest that trouble led to the development of Marwan and these particular supporters. The emphasis is not on the individuals causing trouble but rather on the trouble affecting Marwan and the supporters. In summary, the first sentence emphasizes Ali and some of Marwan's supporters as the agents responsible for causing a lot of trouble, whereas the second sentence is ambiguous, focusing on the trouble that impacted Marwan and Ali's supporters and possibly contributed to their transformation into Khawarij.

Please answer the following question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question. Question: Harry was installing a TV mount. He drills into the wall with a screw that has 20 threads. If he used a screw of the same size with 30 threads, it would take fewer or more turns to put it in? Paragraph : The trade-off when the threads are closer together, is that more turns of the screw or bolt are needed to do the job because the distance over which the input force must be applied is greater. Answer:","completion":"Using the information from the paragraph, we can conclude that if Harry were to use a screw of the same size with 30 threads instead of the one with 20 threads, it would take more turns to put it in. The reason for this is because when the threads are closer together on a screw, more turns are needed to do the job. The paragraph states that the trade-off when the threads are closer together (as would be the case with the 30-threaded screw compared to the 20-threaded screw) is that a greater number of turns are required to fully install the screw because the distance over which the input force must be applied is greater. Simply put, with more threads on the same length of screw, the screw advances a smaller distance into the wall with each turn, which would require more turns overall to accomplish the same depth achieved with the 20-threaded screw. In summary, if Harry used a screw of the same size with 30 threads, it would take more turns to put it in compared to using a screw with 20 threads. This is due to the increased number of threads and the resulting closeness of the threads on the 30-threaded screw, which necessitates a greater number of turns to achieve the same depth as the 20-threaded screw."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He's furious that she left him, outraged over her \\"silly Reno divorce\\" and indignant that she is playing around with young men, in particular a struggling writer staying near them at their retreat on the English coast. They argue vehemently until a furious Christine slaps her husband's face four times. He keeps calm except for his eyes, which twitch uncontrollably, and departs.A day or two later, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney), a local writer, happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore and he sees her body on the beach.

Robert claims innocence, but in the crowd that has gathered, none believe him.

Paragraph: The Department of Homeland Security said it would issue the sixth waiver of Donald Trump’s presidency under a 2005 law that empowers the secretary to waive reviews required under environmental laws if the border barrier is deemed to be in national security interests. Those laws include the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act and Endangered Species Act. The waiver, which was announced Thursday and published Friday in the Federal Register, helps clear the way for work to begin this month on replacing a second layer of barrier in San Diego, a steel-mesh wall that worked like a fortress when it was built about a decade ago but is now often breached with powerful battery-operated saws sold in home improvement stores. The waivers avoid time-consuming reviews and lawsuits challenging violation of environmental laws. The government awarded a 101 million contract to SLSCO Ltd. of Galveston, Texas, to build a barrier of 30-feet-high steel bollards, with options for an additional 30 million. Work is scheduled to begin this month. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a public notice that the Border Patrol’s San Diego sector is “an area of high illegal entry,” with more than 38,000 arrests and seizures of more than 4 tons (3,600 kilograms) of marijuana and 1,800 pounds (816 kilograms) of cocaine in the 2018 fiscal year. San Diego was the third busiest corridor for illegal crossings among the Border Patrol’s nine sectors along the Mexican border in 2018 after Texas’ Rio Grande Valley and Tucson, Arizona. Work on replacing the first layer of San Diego barrier is nearly complete, also 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) long and made of steel bollards up to 30 feet (9 meters) high. Environmental groups criticized the latest waiver. “Trump is ignoring laws that protect public health and endangered wildlife so he can fulfill a hateful campaign promise,” said Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner for the Center for Biological Diversity. “Communities and ecosystems along the border are being upended by this militarization, but Border Patrol won’t even give residents the decency of a public hearing. This is the definition of lawlessness.” President George W. Bush’s administration issued five waivers, paving the way for barriers to blanket about one-third of the border with Mexico. Barack Obama’s administration didn’t issue any waivers. Claim: US to waive environmental reviews for San Diego border wall.","completion":"The US Department of Homeland Security announced that it would issue the sixth waiver of Donald Trump's presidency, allowing for environmental reviews to be bypassed for the San Diego border wall construction. This waiver falls under a 2005 law that enables the secretary to waive mandatory reviews under environmental laws if the border barrier is considered essential for national security. The laws in question include the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Endangered Species Act. The waiver facilitates the commencement of work on replacing the second layer of barrier in San Diego, ultimately avoiding delays caused by lengthy reviews and legal challenges regarding violations of environmental laws."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Islamic State (ISIS) has since claimed responsibility for the day's carnage and has incited fear and terror in the hearts of countless Syrians and the international community. Background: The Islamic State group, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or Daesh in Arabic, has been a severe threat to global security since its inception in 2013. The extremist terrorist group, which originated in Iraq, aims to create an Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq, Syria, and beyond. They have used brutal tactics, executed mass killings, and committed acts of international terrorism that have alarmed nations worldwide. The Situation in Syria: Syria has been mired in civil war since 2011 when peaceful protests calling for political reforms escalated into armed conflict. The situation rapidly deteriorated and created an environment ripe for the emergence of extremist groups like ISIS. As of today, numerous combatants are fighting for control over the country, including ISIS, the Syrian government led by Bashar al-Assad, and various other opposition forces. The Bombings in Damascus and Homs: On February 21, 2016, ISIS carried out a series of coordinated bomb attacks in the historically significant cities of Damascus and Homs. In the southern district of Homs, two car bombings occurred in a predominantly Alawite neighborhood, killing at least 57 people and wounding many. The Alawites, an offshoot of Shia Islam, are seen as supporters of President Bashar al-Assad's government, making them a target for ISIS-led attacks. Around 200 kilometers away, in the Sayyida Zeinab suburb of Damascus, four explosions, including two suicide bombings and two car bombings, left the area devastated. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 83 people were killed, and over 170 were injured. This area is particularly significant as it is home to a Shia shrine, which attracts numerous Shia Muslim pilgrims each year. ISIS specifically targeted these religious sites, aiming to incite sectarian tensions and fuel the existing conflict. The Response and International Implications: The international community swiftly condemned the attacks in Syria, expressing sympathy for the victims and their families. The United Nations and various governments reaffirmed their commitment to supporting international efforts to combat terrorism and restore peace in Syria. These attacks have prompted increased calls among world powers to resolve the Syrian conflict and stem the rise of violent extremist groups like ISIS. The peace talks in Geneva and the concerted action against terrorism demonstrate the willingness of nations to cooperate in efforts to end the war and counter extremism. Additionally, the role of regional actors, such as Russia, Iran, and Turkey, is critical in shaping the future of Syria and ensuring stability in the region. Conclusion: The recent bombings in Damascus and Homs have reaffirmed the pervasive threat posed by the Islamic State group and the urgent need for action. The international community must combine resources and efforts to resolve the crisis in Syria and weaken the strength of extremist groups like ISIS. Only then can the people of Syria and the world hope for a respite from the violence and upheaval that has become all too common in recent years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Meinhoff and her husband are then guests at a party, where Meinhoff reads off a periodical that she wrote about the injustice of the Iranian Government. With the Shah of Persia arriving into Berlin, there is a rally in the streets, where half the people are protesting the injustice and the other half are praising. As the protesting goes on, the Iranian people end up going into the crowd and fighting the innocent German protesters with the help of the German Police; leaving many injured and a man killed. The next scene is of Meinhoff at a television studio arguing why she favors the protesters side instead of the Governments side, and watching the live recording on her television is Gudrun Ensslin, another activist. She explains to her parents how American Imperialism is completely corrupt while Meinhoff walks in on her husband having sex with another woman. Next, we are introduced to Andreas Baader, the ringleader of these revolutionaries who decide to name themselves The Red Army Faction (RAF). Their first major rebellious occurrence takes place in a department store, where they decide to set home made bombs and light it on fire. On a television broadcast we are informed of the many student protests at universities across America and of protests in West Germany, being led by Rudi Dutschke. The film then cuts to a famous rally where Dutschke announced his views on the protest and wars occurring around the world, trying to spark everyone to join their resistance.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellGOP strategist donates to Alabama Democrat McConnell names Senate GOP tax conferees Brent Budowsky: A plea to Alabama voters MORE (R-Ky.) acknowledged late Monday that the chamber’s current approach would fail after two more senators announced opposition to the current healthcare draft. Without the needed votes, he said, the Senate will take up a repeal-only bill that Congress passed in 2015. ADVERTISEMENT “Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,\\" McConnell said in a statement. The repeal-only approach is backed by conservatives, who say Congress should just pass again what it already approved in 2015. President Trump joined the conservatives, tweeting Monday night: “Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!” But that bill does not appear to have the votes to pass, and other GOP lawmakers called Monday for working with Democrats or passing an alternative GOP bill. A separate repeal was the initial GOP strategy at the beginning of this year and ended up being rejected because it lacked the votes to pass. Too many Republicans wanted to reassure their constituents that there would be a replacement at the same time, aimed at making sure people did not lose coverage. “There must be a replace with repeal,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) wrote in The Washington Post last week. In a report that could unsettle moderates, the Congressional Budget Office previously found that the 2015 repeal-only bill would lead to 32 million more uninsured people over a decade, with premiums nearly doubling. But those concerns did not stop conservatives for calling for a clean repeal vote on Monday night. “Clean repeal now!” tweeted Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulLexington mayor launches bid for Congress Trump-free Kennedy Center Honors avoids politics Meet the Iran hawk who could be Trump's next secretary of State MORE (R-Ky.). “Time for full repeal of #Obamacare — let's put the same thing on President Trump's desk that we put on President Obama's desk,” added Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. In contrast, other Republicans called for working with Democrats on a new plan. “The Congress must now return to regular order, hold hearings, receive input from members of both parties, and heed the recommendations of our nation's governors so that we can produce a bill that finally provides Americans with access to quality and affordable health care,” Sen.

Dems demand Tillerson end State hiring freeze, consult with Congress MORE (R-Ariz.) said in a statement. McCain is in Arizona recovering from surgery, which prompted a delay in consideration of the bill this week. Some Republicans have raised the idea of a bipartisan bill to stabilize ObamaCare markets, which could include funding for key payments to insurers known as cost-sharing reductions and possibly funding to bring down premiums for high-cost enrollees, known as “reinsurance.” But conservative members, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn John CornynMcConnell names Senate GOP tax conferees Air Force makes criminal reporting changes after Texas massacre We need a better pathway for allowing civilians to move guns across state lines MORE (R-Texas), have objected to the idea of a stabilization bill as simply throwing more money at the healthcare law.

That approach has been attacked from both the left and right. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Leigh Ann Caldwell WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged Monday night that he lacked the votes to pass the Senate health care bill after two more Republican senators came out against it, leaving the party short of a majority. Instead, he said the Senate would vote on a full repeal of Obamacare, with two years before the repeal goes into effect to allow time to create a new system. The new plan may appear to fulfill a seven-year GOP promise, but it faces extremely difficult odds after many moderate Republican senators have already come out against repeal without an immediate replacement. Sens. Jerry Moran of Kansas and Mike Lee of Utah set the chain of events in motion Monday night when they announced on Twitter that they both would oppose the current bill, which was released just last week. Moran and Lee followed two other Republican senators who had already said they wouldn't support the bill: Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine. \\"After conferring with trusted experts regarding the latest version of the Consumer Freedom Amendment, I have decided I cannot support the current version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act,\\" Lee said in a statement. \\"In addition to not repealing all of the Obamacare taxes, it doesn't go far enough in lowering premiums for middle class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations.\\" Moran issued this statement: \\"We should not put our stamp of approval on bad policy. Furthermore, if we leave the federal government in control of everyday healthcare decisions, it is more likely that our healthcare system will devolve into a single-payer system, which would require a massive federal spending increase. We must now start fresh with an open legislative process to develop innovative solutions that provide greater personal choice, protections for pre-existing conditions, increased access and lower overall costs for Kansans.\\" The senators released their statements just as eight other lawmakers, including most members of leadership, left the White House, where they ate dinner with the president. President Donald Trump has been largely disengaged from the process in the Senate, and his dinner guests were members already supportive of the measure. The president responded to the latest development just after 10:15 p.m. ET: McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, is seeking to give Trump what he wants. McConnell, who had worked to craft the bill that couldn't muster enough support, said he would seek a vote on a full repeal — the same version that passed both the House and the Senate in 2015 — \\"in the coming days.\\" \\"Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,\\" McConnell said in a statement. While straight repeal passed the Senate in 2015, there was no possibility that it would go into effect because then-President Barack Obama vetoed the legislation. Just last week, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., told reporters that straight repeal wouldn't get the support of 50 Republicans. McConnell had expected to hold a vote on the bill this week but was forced to delay it after Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., underwent surgery to remove a blot clot above his left eye over the weekend. McCain is unable to return to Washington while he recovers, and his vote would have been crucial before the latest defections. The Better Care Reconciliation Act has hit numerous roadblocks since it was unveiled more than a month ago. The first version fell short of the support needed to pass when at least 10 Republican senators came out against it, forcing McConnell back to the drawing board to try to win the support of moderate and conservative Republicans who opposed the measure for different reasons. The second iteration, released last week, seemed to have more support. Only Paul and Collins opposed it at the outset, and others with concerns seemed open to ongoing discussions about the bill. But the coalition of 50 began to crack Monday when Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told reporters that he was concerned about McConnell's reassurance to centrists that Medicaid cuts set to go into effect in 2025 would never be realized. \\"I did find the story about Leader McConnell's comments about Medicaid reforms just too far in the future probably never being enacted — I found those pretty troubling,\\" Johnson said. The delay due to McCain's medical emergency didn't help matters, either, as some worried that it would allow more time for opponents to press their efforts. The only polls at measure about 15 percent support, according to public surveys, and Republican Senate offices have been home to nearly daily protests by activists opposed to the Republican plan. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Republicans should \\"start from scratch and work with Democrats\\" on a bill to fix problems with Obamacare. \\"This second failure of Trumpcare is proof positive that the core of this bill is unworkable,\\" Schumer said in a statement. Still, Republican senators are promoting their own ideas on how to move forward. McCain released a statement saying Republicans should forgo the current process, start over and work with Democrats. \\"The Congress must now return to regular order, hold hearings, receive input from members of both parties, and heed the recommendations of our nation's governors so that we can produce a bill that finally provides Americans with access to quality and affordable health care,\\" McCain said. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., tweeted a link to an opinion piece he wrote, promoting his idea of allowing each state to determine whether Obamacare — or another idea — works for the state. ||||| President Donald Trump's top legislative priority was dealt a potentially fatal blow Monday night as two more Republican senators announced their opposition to the party's health care overhaul. Trump quickly called on Republicans to simply repeal Obamacare and begin work on a new health care plan, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced he would try to do so. Story Continued Below “Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,\\" McConnell said. The Kentucky Republican said he planned to hold a vote in the coming days to take up the House-passed bill to replace the 2010 health care law and then call up an amendment to eliminate major parts of Obamacare, such as the Medicaid expansion, insurance subsidies and fines for the employer and individual mandates. Republicans passed a similar bill to effectively repeal Obamacare in 2015 under reconciliation — the fast-track budget procedure the GOP is using to thwart a Democratic filibuster — but it was vetoed by President Barack Obama. McConnell added that the repeal-only bill is \\"what a majority of the Senate has already supported in 2015,\\" but GOP lawmakers have voiced severe doubts that such a plan can win the 50 votes necessary this year given the uncertainty it would throw into insurance markets. The 2015 vote was viewed as mostly symbolic at the time, given Obama’s certain veto. But after his own caucus tanked McConnell's attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare simultaneously and at the prodding of the president, the GOP leader is going to force his caucus to go on the record on health care. If the Senate does vote to open debate on the House bill, which is not guaranteed, the repeal-only bill would be the first amendment. But senators would still be able to offer unlimited amendments to the bill, leading the GOP down an uncertain road once the process began. \\"Republicans should just 'REPEAL' failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!\\" Trump tweeted shortly before McConnell's statement came out. McConnell's announcement followed the news that GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas said they could not support the current bill. They joined Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul in opposition, denying GOP leaders the support to even bring the bill to the floor and upending Republicans' seven-year goal of repealing Obamacare. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who is recovering from surgery, issued a statement advising the party to start over with a bipartisan approach.

The party has spent nearly seven months on a health care overhaul, with hopes it would ease the path to tax reform. Now Trump and the GOP-led Congress are staring at an impending August recess with no major legislative achievements in hand. At a dinner with GOP senators on Monday evening, Trump said the party would look like “dopes” if they couldn’t pass the bill after passing a repeal bill in 2015. “If the Republicans have the House, Senate and the presidency and they can't pass this health care bill, they are going to look weak,” Trump said, according to a source familiar with the meeting. “How can we not do this after promising it for years?” Trump had no idea defections were coming Monday night, according to another White House official with knowledge of the meeting. \\"Why would we have a dinner like that if we knew people were going to drop out?\\" the official said. Even before Lee and Moran's announcement, there were increasingly urgent signs that the GOP's 52-seat majority was too fragile to pass the bill, which would scale back Medicaid spending and Obamacare's insurance subsidies. The vote was already delayed because of McCain's surgery, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) had fumed that McConnell had committed a \\"breach of trust\\" in selling the bill to moderates. Still, just minutes before Moran’s and Lee's statements, aides were toiling to revise the bill so it could win the support of 50 Republican senators. But with Collins and Paul already in opposition, the conservative Lee and typically pragmatic Moran held hands and became the deciding votes in opposition to McConnell's latest plan. Moran criticized the closed-door process for developing the bill and criticized the legislation for not repealing the entire 2010 health care law, concluding that \\"We should not put our stamp of approval on bad policy.\\" Lee said the latest bill \\"doesn’t go far enough in lowering premiums for middle class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations.\\" Democrats, meanwhile, celebrated. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said that the \\"second failure of Trumpcare is proof positive that the core of this bill is unworkable.\\" The announcement from Lee and Moran is just the latest in a long series of obstacles for the Obamacare repeal effort. McConnell pulled a vote on a previous version of the bill last month after skeptical Republicans came out against the plan. Johnson was stunned to read in The Washington Post that McConnell was privately arguing that major reforms to Medicaid were so far in the distance that they would never take effect. Johnson said Monday that he’d confirmed through conversations with other senators that McConnell had made the remarks. “The reported comments from Leader McConnell before last Thursday about ‘don’t worry about these Medicaid changes, they won’t take effect,’ that’s troubling to me. I have talked to senators that basically confirmed that. I’ll see what Leader McConnell says tomorrow,” Johnson said on Monday evening. “From my standpoint, it’s a pretty serious breach of trust, those comments. I’m just troubled by those comments.” In response to Johnson's complaints, McConnell said, “I prefer to speak for myself, and my view is that the Medicaid per capita cap with a responsible growth rate that is sustainable for taxpayers is the most important long-term reform in the bill. That is why it has been in each draft we have released.” Before Lee and Moran announced their opposition, more than a half-dozen key senators were undecided, many wavering over those cuts to Medicaid spending. “I’m reserving judgment. I want a CBO score, analysis and we’re still doing more work on it,” said Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.). “They need more time … we’re still working on it.” The effort stalled over the weekend as McCain's office announced the Arizona Republican, and his vote, would be away from Washington for at least a week. GOP leaders had hoped he would return in a week and they could start work on the bill. “We’re not going to come up short,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) had said earlier in the day. \\"We need a full contingent of the Republican senators. We don’t have any to spare.” Trump had also ramped up his outreach to the Hill — hosting a handful of GOP senators at the White House dinner Monday night, including Cornyn, John Thune of South Dakota, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Steve Daines of Montana and James Lankford of Oklahoma, according to Republican aides. Key swing-vote senators such as Rob Portman of Ohio, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Johnson were not attending. Neither did Lee nor Moran. And a charm offensive from the Trump administration aimed at skeptical GOP governors seemed to have little impact over the weekend. “Governors have a large say. The reason why we’re not at 50 right now is a lot of governors don’t like what we’re doing,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is pitching them on his own plan to block grant federal health care money to the states and keep all of Obamacare’s taxes. Several senators had also raised questions about an amendment from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), which would allow cheap plans to be sold alongside Obamacare-compliant plans that cover pre-existing conditions. Those plans’ premiums would have some subsidies, but senators were confused about whether that money would be drawn from a nearly 200 billion stabilization fund meant to woo moderates. They had hoped to use the time to further modify the bill. But extra time cut both ways. “The delay is what we have,” Alexander said earlier Monday. “So I don’t think we’ll know until we vote whether it’s been good or bad.” Tara Palmeri, Josh Dawsey and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"The Republican party's efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, have hit a significant roadblock as two more senators announced their opposition to the current healthcare draft.

The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

The attack took place at about 05:30 (02:30 GMT) in the remote Rukban area, a few hundred metres from the camp. A number of other vehicles involved in the attack were destroyed. It is not yet clear who carried out the attack, but the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) has threatened in the past to \\"break down\\" Jordan's borders. The kingdom is part of the US-led coalition against IS and has carried out air strikes on militants in Syria. Tuesday's attack, the first of its kind since the conflict in Syria began in 2011, saw an explosives-laden vehicle blown up beside a military post. The blast left four border guards and two personnel from the Civil Defence and Public Security Department dead, a military statement said. \\"Such criminal act will only add to our unshaken determination to fight terrorism and terrorists' ideologies regardless of their motives,\\" it added. Earlier this month, Jordanian intelligence service officers and two other employees were killed in a Palestinian refugee camp near the capital, Amman, in what the government said was a terrorist attack. The Rukban camp is located beside an earthen berm in the desert, about 8km (5 miles) west of the point at which the Iraq, Syria, and Jordan borders meet. The rocky area is devoid of shade, water or vegetation and is far from any towns. Aid workers say more than 50,000 refugees are stranded at the camp, living in deplorable conditions while awaiting entry to Jordan. UN satellite analysts mapped more than 6,400 probable shelters in the area in late April. The Jordanian authorities currently only allow in about 50 to 100 refugees each day, citing security concerns. Many of the refugees are believed to have fled areas controlled by IS in eastern Homs province and neighbouring Raqqa, where forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have made gains in the past year with the support of Russian air strikes. Thousands of other refugees are stranded at another tented camp on the border at Hadalat, about 90km west of Rukban, where the UN mapped 1,900 shelters. The UN acknowledged in December that Jordan had legitimate security concerns, but called on the country to allow all the refugees at the two camps to enter. Jordan is hosting 655,000 of the 4.84 million Syrians registered as refugees with the UN.

In July 1946, which hotel in Jerusalem was bombed by Jewish terrorists because it was the HQ of the British administration?","completion":"In July 1946, the King David Hotel in Jerusalem was bombed by Jewish terrorists because it housed the headquarters of the British administration in Palestine. This attack was orchestrated by a Zionist paramilitary organization known as Irgun Zvai Leumi, or simply Irgun. The King David Hotel bombing took place on July 22, 1946, and resulted in the deaths of 91 people and the wounding of 46 others. The victims included British, Arab, and Jewish civilians, as well as British government officials and military personnel. The Irgun was a militant Zionist group established in 1931, seeking to establish a Jewish state in Palestine by using all means, including violence, against the British Mandate authorities and local Arab populations. The group, led by Menachem Begin, who later became Israel’s Prime Minister, aimed to force the British government to change its policies towards the Jewish community in Palestine. At the time, the British administration was headquartered in the southern wing of the King David Hotel. The hotel also housed the offices of the British Mandatory authorities, including the Secretariat and the British Army Headquarters. The attack on the King David Hotel was meticulously planned and involved the smuggling of explosives into the building over a period of weeks. The Irgun operatives disguised themselves as Arab workers and managed to conceal the explosives in milk churns. On the day of the bombing, they placed these churns in the hotel's basement, which was situated directly under the British Secretariat's offices. They then called a warning to the hotel, urging the British to evacuate the building before the explosion occurred. Despite the warning, the British authorities did not fully evacuate the hotel, as they believed it might be a hoax. Ultimately, the explosion was massive, destroying a significant portion of the hotel and causing serious casualties. The King David Hotel bombing marked a turning point in the fight for the establishment of a Jewish state. The scale of the destruction and the high number of casualties led to widespread outrage and condemnation, both within Palestine and internationally. The attack strained relations between the British administration and the Jewish Agency, the main political body representing the Jewish community in Palestine. Additionally, it contributed to the intensification of violence in the region, as well as increasing international pressure on Britain to find a solution to the ongoing conflict in Palestine. In the years that followed, the United Nations developed a plan to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, ultimately leading to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. The legacy of the King David Hotel bombing continues to be felt in Israel and forms a significant part of its complex and difficult history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a text based on \\"a mental illness that may originate before birth\\" Text:","completion":"Title: The Origins of Mental Illness: Prenatal Factors and Implications Introduction The understanding and acknowledgment of mental illnesses have become increasingly significant in recent decades, particularly as society at large becomes more cognizant of their prevalence and consequences. Various mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders, have demonstrated links to both environmental and genetic factors. A particularly thought-provoking area of study is the possibility that some mental illnesses may originate before birth, influenced by factors during prenatal development. This text aims to explore the potential origins of mental illnesses before birth, highlighting the genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors that can come into play. Genetic Factors The role of genetics in the development of mental illnesses is a widely researched subject. Mental health conditions often run in families, suggesting that hereditary traits may predispose certain individuals to these disorders. Experts estimate that genetic factors may contribute to up to 80% of the risk for certain illnesses, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Specific gene mutations have been identified in connection to numerous mental health conditions, including those related to serotonin transporters, dopamine receptors, and glutamate pathways. Moreover, copy number variations, wherein sections of the genome are either deleted or duplicated, have been linked to an increased risk for autism spectrum disorders. It is important to note, however, that mental illnesses are often polygenic, meaning that several genes likely contribute to the development of the disorder, instead of just one isolated gene. Epigenetic Factors Epigenetics refers to the study of changes in gene expression or function that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. The connection between prenatal development and mental health is becoming increasingly clear as a result of investigations into epigenetic factors. Stress, malnutrition, and exposure to particular environmental factors during pregnancy can lead to epigenetic modifications in the fetus's genetic material. These alterations are often long-lasting and can impact an individual's mental health later in life. For instance, maternal stress during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk for depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring. Similarly, maternal malnutrition, particularly a lack of folic acid and other essential vitamins and minerals, has been correlated with an increased risk for schizophrenia and other cognitive disorders in children. Environmental Factors Various environmental factors that a pregnant woman is exposed to may also have a significant impact on the mental health of the child. Exposure to infections during pregnancy, such as Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, and influenza, has been linked to a heightened risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in offspring. Furthermore, exposure to neurotoxic substances, like lead or alcohol, can also pose significant risks to a developing fetus, potentially resulting in cognitive impairments or neurodevelopmental disorders like fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Another critical environmental factor is the prenatal exposure to maternal stress or trauma. Research has shown that excessive amounts of stress hormones may disrupt the development of the fetus's nervous system, leading to an increased likelihood of mental health issues later in life. Conclusion In conclusion, current research provides strong evidence to support the notion that the origins of mental illnesses may be traced back to prenatal development. A complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, such as gene mutations, maternal stress, and exposure to toxins or infections, can contribute to the development of mental health disorders before birth. Understanding and addressing these risk factors during pregnancy is crucial to enhanced mental health outcomes in future generations. However, it is important to note that mental illnesses often arise from a combination of genetic, environmental, and social influences. Thus, a broader perspective that considers postnatal experiences is vital for developing holistic approaches to mental health."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

In terms of the quality of the food, the reviewer describes it as \\"so so.\\" This statement implies that the food was not particularly impressive nor terrible but rather just average, which may not meet the expectations of the reviewer, especially if the establishment in question is a Gordon Ramsay spot, as suggested in the review. A significant point of contention for the reviewer is the waiting time for their food. They mention having to wait for 30 minutes, which was deemed excessive given the simplicity of their order. The fact that other customers who arrived later were served before the reviewer further contributed to their dissatisfaction.

On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day. Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals. His entry for October 10 recorded that there was \\"nothing for supper but a spoonful of glycerine\\". A few days later Alexey, the group's principal hunter, shot a ptarmigan which provided soup. But Alexey was weakening, and on October 17 he died.On October 20, trapped by the weather and without supplies, the party came to a final halt. Throughout the march De Long had written up his journal each day, but after October 20 his entries became intermittent, largely limited to terse statements of the dying and the dead.

The terrorists' Answer:","completion":"Title: Countdown to Chaos Genre: Action-Thriller Plot: In the year 2025, the United States and key allies face a rising terrorist threat from an extremist group calling themselves 'The Defenders of Purity' who aim to bring down Western governments and establish a new world order. As their attacks grow bolder and more deadly, Western leaders, including the President of the United States, Joseph Hanson, and his team are scrambling to uncover the true motives behind the terrorist plot to stop them before it's too late. The Defenders of Purity are relentless in their pursuit, wreaking havoc on major cities around the world, targeting symbols of wealth, power, and influence. While the world is drowning in fear and confusion, President Hanson receives an anonymous tip about a possible mole within his administration, someone who could provide invaluable information about the terrorist group's next move. Determined to stop the terrorists and expose the traitor, President Hanson assembles a top-secret task force comprised of his most trusted advisors and intelligence experts. However, the more they dig into the terrorists' plot, the more complex and twisted it becomes, leading them to question if there are other forces at play behind the group's radical agenda. The deadline is rapidly approaching as the group's ultimate plan is set into motion: simultaneous attacks on key military installations, government buildings, and key infrastructure, triggering chaos and anarchy on a scale never seen before. As President Hanson and his team race against time to decipher the terrorists' web of deceit, they uncover a chilling truth: a foreign power is pulling the strings of The Defenders of Purity, using them as a pawn in a deadly game of global domination. With the clock ticking and the nation's capital under a direct threat of destruction, President Hanson and his team face a difficult choice: take down the terrorists while risking their lives or sacrifice their own people for a chance at peace. In a high-stakes, heart-pounding finale, President Hanson leads his team on a covert mission to dismantle The Defenders of Purity's' stronghold and foil their destructive plot. Along the way, they expose the government mole and manage to intercept and eliminate the foreign power orchestrating the chaos. In the aftermath of the attacks, President Hanson emerges as a champion for democracy, leading a renewed global effort to combat terrorism and maintain the stability of the world order. As a result, The Defenders of Purity are dismantled, and peace is restored, leaving a lasting impact on the world for generations to come. The movie ends with the message that unity and trust are key to defeating such heinous terrorist plots."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is located between two peaks called the North and South Guardian Angels , deep within the Left Fork of North Creek . It is part of the larger Great West Canyon system , which includes both the Left and Right Forks of North Creek . The Subway is so named for its tube - like , undercut slot canyons . This segment of canyon is less than 0.25 miles ( 0.40 km ) in length , but long approach and exit hikes are necessary for access . - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\". - Utah (or ) is a state in the western United States. It became the 45th state admitted to the U.S. on January 4, 1896. Utah is the 13th-largest by area, 31st-most-populous, and 10th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States. Utah has a population of more than 3 million (Census estimate for July 1, 2016), approximately 80% of whom live along the Wasatch Front, centering on the state capital Salt Lake City. Utah is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast. - Mesa (Portuguese and Spanish for \\"table\\") is the American English term for tableland, an elevated area of land with a flat top and sides that are usually steep cliffs. It takes its name from its characteristic table-top shape. It may also be called a table hill, table-topped hill or table mountain. It is larger than a butte, which it otherwise resembles closely. - Zion Canyon (also called Little Zion, Mukuntuweap, Mu-Loon'-Tu-Weap, and Straight Cañon; \\"weap\\" is Paiute for canyon) is a deep and narrow gorge in southwestern Utah, United States, carved by the North Fork of the Virgin River. Nearly the entire canyon is located within the western half of Zion National Park. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - A slot canyon is a narrow canyon, formed by the wear of water rushing through rock. A slot canyon is significantly deeper than it is wide. Some slot canyons can measure less than across at the top but drop more than to the floor of the canyon. - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera (from the - \\"cheir\\", \\"hand\\" and - \\"pteron\\", \\"wing\\") whose forelimbs form webbed wings, making them the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight. By contrast, other mammals said to fly, such as flying squirrels, gliding possums, and colugos, can only glide for short distances. Bats do not flap their entire forelimbs, as birds do, but instead flap their spread-out digits, which are very long and covered with a thin membrane or patagium. - The Southwestern United States (also known as the American Southwest) is a region of the United States which includes Arizona, the western portion of New Mexico, bordered on the east by the Llano Estacado, southern Colorado and Utah below the 39th parallel, the \\"horn\\" of Texas below New Mexico, the southernmost triangle of Nevada, and the most southeastern portion of California, which encompasses the Mojave and Colorado Deserts. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - The Mojave Desert is an arid rain-shadow desert and the driest desert in North America. It is located in the southwestern United States, primarily within southeastern California and southern Nevada, and it occupies a total of . Very small areas also extend into Utah and Arizona. Its boundaries are generally noted by the presence of Joshua trees, which are native only to the Mojave Desert and are considered an indicator species, and it is believed to support an additional 1,750 to 2,000 species of plants. The central part of the desert is sparsely populated, while its peripheries support large communities such as Las Vegas, Lancaster, Palmdale, Victorville, and St. George. - A natural arch, natural bridge or, less commonly, a rock arch is a natural rock formation where an arch has formed with an opening underneath. Natural arches commonly form where inland cliffs, coastal cliffs, fins or stacks are subject to erosion from the sea, rivers or weathering (subaerial processes). - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A canyon (Spanish: cañón) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering. - Horse Ranch Mountain is the highest summit in Zion National Park, in Utah. Located in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, it rises above Camp Creek to the north and Taylor Creek to the south. - The Life Zone concept was developed by C. Hart Merriam in 1889 as a means of describing areas with similar plant and animal communities. Merriam observed that the changes in these communities with an increase in latitude at a constant elevation are similar to the changes seen with an increase in elevation at a constant latitude. - Springdale is a town in Washington County, Utah, United States. The population was 529 at the 2010 census. It is located immediately outside the boundaries of Zion National Park, and is oriented around the resulting tourist industry. It was originally settled as a Mormon farming community in 1862 by evacuees from the flooding of nearby Northrop. Springdale was named one of the 20 'prettiest towns' in the United States by Forbes Traveler in 2008. - A butte is an isolated hill with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top; buttes are smaller than mesas, plateaus, and table landforms. The word butte comes from a French word meaning \\"small hill\\"; its use is prevalent in the Western United States, including the southwest where \\"mesa\\" is also used for the larger landform. Because of their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in plains and mountainous areas. In differentiating mesas and buttes, geographers use the rule of thumb that a mesa has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height. - Navajo Sandstone is a geologic formation in the Glen Canyon Group that is spread across the U.S. states of southern Nevada, northern Arizona, northwest Colorado, and Utah as part of the Colorado Plateau province of the United States. - Zion National Park is located in the Southwestern United States, near Springdale, Utah. A prominent feature of the park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to half a mile (800 m) deep, cut through the reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest elevation is at Coalpits Wash and the highest elevation is at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park's unique geography and variety of life zones allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. - The Colorado Plateau, also known as the Colorado Plateau Province, is a physiographic region of the Intermontane Plateaus, roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. The province covers an area of 337,000 km (130,000 mi) within western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, southern and eastern Utah, and northern Arizona. About 90% of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries: the Green, San Juan, and Little Colorado. Most of the remainder of the plateau is drained by the Rio Grande and its tributaries. - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location. - Woodland is a low-density forest forming open habitats with plenty of sunlight and limited shade. Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses. Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession. Higher density areas of trees with a largely closed canopy that provides extensive and nearly continuous shade are referred to as forests. - The Great Basin is the largest area of contiguous endorheic watersheds in North America. It is noted for both its arid climate and the basin and range topography that varies from the North American low point at Badwater Basin to the highest point of the contiguous United States, less than away at the summit of Mount Whitney. The region spans several physiographic divisions, biomes/ecoregions, and deserts. - The Virgin River is a tributary of the Colorado River in the U.S. states of Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. The river is about long. It was designated Utah's first wild and scenic river in 2009, during the centennial celebration of Zion National Park.

Summarize this article: TV Weekend: The Bootleg Empire of Ken Burns' Prohibition There may be nothing more gratifying and unifying for people than coming together in disdain for a past idea, now universally agreed on to be stupid. One of the greatest of these in American history is alcohol prohibition, not merely the impetus for the criminal events of Boardwalk Empire, but the case study for the idea that the best way to encourage a personal vice is to forbid it. So for fans of Boardwalk (though its viewership was down from its season 1 premiere) or students of American history, Ken Burns' Prohibition, airing three nights on PBS starting Sunday, provides a detailed, engaging postmortem of a very, very bad idea. One problem I've sometimes had with Burns' documentaries in the past, as I've written before, is that they represent a kind of pledge-drive-safe advocacy: they make impassioned arguments for things the audience already believes. (Slavery was awful, war is hell, baseball represents America.) This is the tradeoff, I guess, for the big platform that PBS provides him. And I'm not sure that three nights of Prohibition would be of that much use if all it did was let us shake our heads for about six hours at America's 14 years of dry madness. That's why, from my barstool, the best night of Prohibition--if you watch only one--is the first, on Sunday, which looks at how Prohibition became law, and the reasons that most American states were motivated to sign on to what, in retrospect, looks like an impossible attempt at social engineering. It wasn't that Americans of the time were simply moralistic prigs and stupider than we are. As Prohibition--based on a book by longtime TIME editor Daniel Okrent--lays out, there were strong motives behind a very bad constitutional amendment. Namely: America was drunk off its ass. And it could be a very, very mean drunk. This situation was different from drinking culture as we think of it today, and Prohibition does an engaging job giving it historical context. When the U.S. was founded, regular drinking was a way of life; not just drinking in the evenings for entertainment, but throughout the day--for thirst, for sustenance, as a way of conserving harvests like apples into cider. The practice goes back centuries; in the pre-industrial world, beer or cider might simply be a safer, more reliable option than water. But the drink of those times was different from today; the founding fathers' beer would have had a far lower alcohol content than what you'd get in a microbrew today. This changed, though, with the development of industrial technology and the growth of America. Suddenly, the country was turning out corn, grain--the raw stuff of hard liquor--and had the means to distill a lot of it en masse. Average Americans now had easy access to far harder booze--by many multiple of alcohol content--than they did in more agrarian times. Americans of the mid-19th century drank three times as much alcohol as we do today. As Prohibition tells it, the country spent much of the 19th century plastered--and paid for it in money, lost jobs and domestic violence. (One of the catchphrases of the early Prohibition movement, related to the early women's rights movement, was \\"the degradation of Saturday night,\\" that is, men going out, spending their paychecks on hard liquor, and coming home to beat their kids and brutally rape their wives.) A confluence of factors--the Progressive movement, religious awakenings--served to make banning alcohol a realistic possibility and then a reality. And yes, it turned out to be as awful and fruitless an effort as you'd think, as the following two nights spell out in interesting detail. (Though the material is much closer to the story that Boardwalk tells and the themes you'd expect from a prohibition film--the rise of crime, the spread of speakeasies, the way banning something makes people want it more.) But Prohibition goes on to say that trying to make America dry was also a case of zealous overreach, which you could apply to any number of political movements and well-intentioned programs. The supporters of prohibition turned the ban into something much more draconian than many of the politicians who voted for it expected. Many \\"supporters\\" of prohibition assumed that beer and light-alcohol wine would still be legal, for instance. But the Volstead Act put the alcohol threshold so low, Okrent notes, as to technically criminalize sauerkraut. The result was a law too sweeping to practically enforce and too rigid for most Americans to respect. Without respect, the law could not take hold, and it had the unintended consequence of not just giving rise to modern organized crime, but encouraging the hedonism of the Jazz Age. Dry America overnight became the world's largest importer of cocktail shakers. As historian Catherine Gilbert Murdock argues in the film, prohibition backers might have built more support if they got rid of the more ridiculous parts of the Volstead Act. Instead, they stuck by it in their extremism, losing any moderate support. \\"That's an important political lesson,\\" she says. \\"You've gotta bend a little.\\" There, of course, is a lesson you could easily apply today, though Burns does not push the viewer to apply it to any one faction in particular. In an interview with Burns on Current, Keith Olbermann put a more specific point on it--comparing anti-alcohol zealots with today's conservatives--though Burns notes that prohibition was an alliance of conservative moralists and progessive advocates of the time alike: In any case, it's a worthy, well, distillation of the documentary's theme: if there's one thing more dangerous than getting drunk on whiskey, it's getting drunk on righteousness. ||||| In the 91 years since the 18th Amendment went into effect, the wonderment surrounding this event has never faded. How, in the United States of America, the land of the free, could Prohibition ever have come to be? For answering that question alone—which Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's \\"Prohibition\\" do in a remarkable first episode—the series would have to be considered a triumph. The story begins with a look at 19th-century America, and at the lives of the obscure, often desperate, Americans—mostly women—who were the... ||||| It's a great subject with many present-day echoes, as the war on drugs ever more loudly raises questions of legislated morality, missed tax revenues and business opportunities created for bad people. As television, it also dovetails, historically, with \\"Boardwalk Empire,\\" whose second season has just begun and, analogously, with \\"Breaking Bad,\\" which is, after all, the story of a bootlegger.With co-director Lynn Novick, his collaborator on \\"The War,\\" Burns tells his story in three chapters, \\"A Nation of Drunkards,\\" \\"A Nation of Scofflaws\\" and \\"A Nation of Hypocrites,\\" locally airing Sunday through Tuesday on PBS SoCal/KOCE. At something more than five hours, \\"Prohibition,\\" while interesting from moment to moment, is longer than it needs to be, and made even longer by Burns' habitual stateliness. (It's easy to imagine him telling narrator Peter Coyote to \\"take that line just a little slower.\\")I prefer this approach to the machine-gun pacing of many modern documentaries, but it doesn't fit every subject equally well — \\"Baseball,\\" yes, \\"Jazz,\\" no — and, as it often does here, can make the material feel remotely historical instead of bringing it to life. (It can also squeeze the humor from his texts.) And though, as the best-known documentary filmmaker of his time, Burns has both the prestige and the resources to acquire a remarkable wealth of visual material, it does not necessarily help his story to use it all.Prohibition did not begin on a whim, certainly: We learn that by 1830 \\"the average American over 15 drank the equivalent of 88 bottles of whiskey a year\\" — you can see how that might lead to a temperance movement. It was in many ways a progressive movement, tied to female suffrage, even as it was a movement that also demonized immigrants, their cultures and drinking habits. But the Volstead Act, the instrument that transformed the 18th Amendment from a general ban into particular law — \\"a law that would imprison Jesus if he turned water into wine,\\" in the words of talking head Pete Hamill — was to be finally not an instrument of sobriety but the starting gun for a national binge that lasted from January 1920 until December 1933, when the 21st Amendment voided the 18th. By one count there were some 32,000 speakeasies operating in New York City at the height of Prohibition; the word \\"scofflaw\\" was coined to describe their innumerable patrons.As usual, Burns largely uses individual case histories to tell his tale. Here is Carrie Nation with her ax, busting up saloons. There is Al Capone with his bulletproof Cadillac, a \\"Prohibition businessman\\" signing autographs and gracing the cover of Time. \\"I got nothing against the honest cop on the beat,\\" he said. \\"You just have them transferred someplace they can't do you any harm.\\" In reality, Capone's Chicago was, as even Lucky Luciano , visiting from New York, described it, \\"a crazy place. Nobody's safe in the street.\\"The drama might flag or grow diffuse, but there is still a lot here to learn. Of the talking heads, the most consistently valuable resources are Hamill and Daniel Okrent, who was also featured in \\"Baseball\\" and whose 2010 book \\"Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition\\" would seem to be the rock on which \\"Prohibition\\" is built.And yet, despite the presence of a few witnesses old enough to recall the time, \\"Prohibition\\" lacks a voice as vibrant as that of Shelby Foote in \\"The Civil War\\" or Buck O'Neil in \\"Baseball,\\" or the reminiscing soldiers and sailors of \\"The War.\\" It remains for Coyote's measured narration, written by frequent Burns collaborator Geoffrey C. Ward, to push the narrative through great expanses of black and white photos and footage, relieved by the occasional newly made glamour shot of a drink being poured. That looks pretty good, you might think to yourself, and are meant to. ||||| Honoring the Volstead Act’s ultimate lesson, I now forbid you to watch “Prohibition,” Ken Burns and Lynn Novick’s latest epic historical documentary. Which will, of course, have the reverse effect of making you want to watch it even more. That’s “Prohibition’s” lone and oft-repeated take-away: Americans don’t like being told what to do. The 18th Amendment, which banned the sale of alcoholic beverages between 1920 and 1933, was a disastrous experiment in government attempting to enforce morals, and it was, in the opinion of “Prohibition’s” many historians and cultural critics, the only time the Constitution was used as a way to limit freedom instead of promote it. Viewers who stay for all five-plus hours of “Prohibition” will stagger away filled but not necessarily satisfied. The era is ripe with many historical-social corollaries and outcomes, and it could not be a more tailor-made subject for America’s Greatest Documentarian. Prohibition is inextricably linked to politics, the suffrage movement, religion, the South, civil rights, immigration, jazz — just a few of Burns’s favorite things. It is packed with bigger-than-life characters who left behind a lot of stirring words and a surplus of photographs and movies. If this documentary were made of alcohol, it could be chugged out of beer bongs at a Ken Burns frat-house blowout. Some viewers will — and should — stop after a sip or two. Those of us who have watched Burns’s many masterly works over the years will recognize the trademark moves: the graceful pan-’n’-scan over archival photos and documents; the surprise treat of high-end celebrity voices reading bits of correspondence and arguments; the soundtrack choices resonating into redundance. Burns’s fans will also await a magical moment that almost always occurs in his work: The epic scope of it eventually takes hold and you become far more absorbed in the subject than you ever thought possible; it’s a moment when you stop to realize that you are learning. Women spurred the early temperance campaigns but eventually led the movement to end Prohibition, after its failures became obvious. A ‘Crusader’ poses in 1930. (Library of Congress/PBS) This has happened to me with his now-legendary takes on baseball and jazz — two subjects I’m not opposed to but also not naturally obsessed with. Once you’re in — once Burns has you hooked — you’re in for the long haul. I got to the end of 2007’s “The War” with something akin to the tingling high that marathon finishers must feel. I even stayed in for the whole of 2009’s “The National Parks: America’s Best Idea,” which was too long by half. Burns has the similar gift of that rare history professor who can captivate even the most reluctant student by bringing the material to life. Thus, he is much beloved all across campus by everyone except other history profs. His tenure is unassailable. Which makes me sad to note the long stretches of sober boredom in the middle of “Prohibition,” even though it is short (three nights, beginning Sunday) by Burns’s standards. At one point, I considered watching the documentary while drunk, to see if it improved. (It might help my writing, too.) “Prohibition” draws on journalist Daniel Okrent’s comprehensive 2010 book, “Last Call.” Part 1 is called “A Nation of Drunkards,” and it is by far the best part of the project, exploring the nation’s colonial and pioneer dependency on booze, which was terrifying. When admiring our forebears’ survivalist resolve, we have to admit just how drunk they were on a daily basis. “Prohibition” eloquently grieves the toll this took on women and children, who lived in the fearful presence of abusive men who drank three times as much as today’s casual imbibers. The degree to which the United States drank in the 18th and 19th centuries is simply astonishing and goes a long way to explain the forces from which the temperance effort emerged, as well as the moral logic behind it. The second episode — “A Nation of Scofflaws” — loses steam just when the buzz of it all should really kick in. As a smart publicity move, “Prohibition” has attempted to ally itself with the freshly arrived (and suprisingly vigorous) second season of HBO’s “Boardwalk Empire,” which is set in Atlantic City during Prohibition. The two seem to be a natural fit, appealing to viewers who will never tire of stories about mob violence. The prohibition portion of “Prohibition” — the gangsters and crime and dirty politics — should be the most exciting part, describing what it was like on the day the booze flow stopped in 1920 and a criminal network immediately rose from grass-roots moonshiners to a deadly cartel that controlled shipping and handling. Thanks to the emerging prevalence of movie cameras by then, Burns and his trusted collaborator, Novick, make use of much footage — too much — that shows men with picks and axes hacking away at barrels of beer and grain alcohol. Again and again and again. The talking heads begin to drone on, less profound this time, not brimming with the same wonder seen in the experts Burns has assembled in the past. It’s rare for Burns and Novick to get lost in their own material, but it happens here. In trying to show the reach of Prohibition, the film gets distracted by the era’s many parallels. At one point, it could have just as easily been a fascinating documentary about sexual liberation. At another point, it could be a movie about the American economy and the Great Depression. (Next up for Burns and company, by the way, is a project due next year called “The Dust Bowl.”) All of it is relevant, but none of it quite coheres. If Parts 2 and 3 (“A Nation of Hypocrites”) could have somehow been as revealing as Part 1, then “Prohibition” might have equaled “Jazz” and “Baseball.” Something I always long for in Burns’s project is something he avoids on principle, which is to link the past to the pres­ent. His sense of denouement and epilogue always feels hurried and tacked on — in “Prohibition’s” case, this means a quick nod to such movements as Alcoholics Anonymous but no correlation to “just say no,” the drug wars, the Mexican cartels or the effort to legalize marijuana. In our current cultural and political skirmishes we often gravitate toward legislative impulses that would force one person’s morality on another, but Burns isn’t going there. He is never about the now. Better, then, to focus one’s 1920s fixations on the dark duplicity and bitter heart of “Boardwalk Empire,” which is two episodes into what looks to be an even better season than the first. The preoccupying arc this time is to make Steve Buscemi’s Enoch “Nucky” Thompson’s life a little more hellish as he staves off bootlegging competition and personal betrayal from all sides. To its array of lowlifes, “Boardwalk Empire” has added the Ku Klux Klan and is giving intriguing dimension to my favorite character, Margaret Schroeder, played by Kelly Macdonald. Charlie Cox (Ishmael from Encore’s recent “Moby Dick”) has joined the cast as Owen Slater, an Irish tough with a charming smile. “Boardwalk Empire” gets so gravely serious, and its men are so thuggishly repugnant by design, that a smile like Owen’s goes a long way toward adding some spark. “Boardwalk Empire” is doing what I wish “Prohibition” had done — it’s tempting me to stick around for one more. Prohibition (five hours over three nights) begins Sunday at 8 p.m. on WETA and MPT. Parts 2 and 3 air Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m. Boardwalk Empire (one hour) airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO. ||||| What should a PBS viewer pour himself to enhance his enjoyment of Prohibition (PBS, Sunday through Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET)? In posing the question, I don't mean to suggest that this documentary, directed by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick, needs any help to go down easy. But it seems correct to celebrate the freedom to get one's buzz on. The freedom is, of course, vastly more important than the buzz itself, as Prohibition notes in its closing words. Here, the writer Pete Hamill, one talking head among a distinguished roster, says that he has hasn't had a drink in three decades. But, hypothetically, he'd be proud to touch the stuff again in a public protest against any legislative attempt to deny his fellow citizens that right. So what to pour? Whiskey—the excessive consumption of which, in the 1800s, provided an early impetus for temperance organization—is a fine choice. You could also mix up a cocktail called the scofflaw. In a nifty aside, the documentary mentions that the word was coined to denote the very common criminals who kept boozing after the Last Night. Watery domestic beer would also work; passage of the 18th Amendment became possible partly because of the World War I-era vilification of German-Americans, some of whom had names like Pabst and Schlitz and Anheuser and Busch. Want to concoct something in your bathtub? Terrific. The notes of Soft Scrub in the bouquet will impart historically accurate odors. Over three nights and five and half hours, Prohibition provides a very fine analytic survey of the noble experiment, and most criticisms of it are quibbles. However, if you are the type of viewer who, after The Civil War and Baseball, gets ticked off by certain Burnsian tics of style, then consider yourself warned. I mean, when the film recounts the moment that Carrie Nation received a message from God to vandalize saloons, a reading of her words plays over an image of yellow sunlight gracing a rural cobweb. There are a couple of corny re-creations of phone calls placed by the blockbuster bootlegger Roy Olmstead to his accomplices. But these seem a small price to pay for the delights of the series' archival footage and sturdy exposition—and for the sozzled trumpet that rings in the ridiculous era stretching from 1920 to 1933. The first installment, titled “A Nation of Drunkards,” proves the most compelling, not least because alcohol and its American foes runs in a clear, easily traceable line. An early segment speeds through the back story of American drinking—the booze in the hold of the Mayflower, the daily ration of rum at Valley Forge, John Adams' hard-cider eye-openers. Then we're on to the religious revival of the Second Great Awakening and then evangelists of the Washington Society, a confederacy of reformed drunkards. Early campaigns for personal responsibility gave way to anti-saloon movements and to calls for enforced abstinence. The documentary quotes an anonymous clergyman condemning the last of these: \\"Very little good has ever been done by the absolute shall.\\" A sound insight into human nature. Also, an idea for a liquor brand: Absolut Shall, the vodka for connoisseurs of auxiliary verbs. Soon, Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton were addressing the problem of epidemic overindulgence. At a time when any number of men would come home wasted and beat their powerless wives, agitation against horrible potomania was largely a distaff cause, and a running thread of Prohibition tracks the shifting status of women. On the one hand, the Women's Christian Temperance Union and its ilk scapegoated alcohol as the cause of all suffering and the root of all social failures. On the other, they represented an important step in the organization of suffragettes and social reformers. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Ken Burns' Prohibition is PBS's three-night documentary that provides a detailed and engaging analysis of the alcohol prohibition era in American history.

Movie title: Goodbye, Mr. Chips Movie plot: In 1920s Britain, Arthur Chipping is an established member of the teaching staff at the Brookfield School. He is a stodgy teacher of Latin, disliked by his pupils, who call him Mr. Chips. Chips meets Katherine Bridges, a music hall soubrette, in the dining room of the Savoy Hotel in London on the eve of his summer holiday. Dissatisfied with her career and depressed by her romantic entanglements, she sets sail on a Mediterranean cruise and is reunited with Chips by chance in Pompeii. Seeing in him a lonely soul similar to herself, she arranges an evening at the theatre after they return to Britain, and the two find themselves drawn to each other. When Chips arrives at Brookfield for the autumn term, it is with his new wife on his arm, much to the shock of the staff and delight of the pupils, who find Mrs Chips' charm to be irresistible. Although her close friend and confidante Ursula Mossbank helps Katherine thwart Lord Sutterwick's plan to deprive the school of a generous financial endowment because of the woman's background, her past eventually deprives Chips of his longheld dream of being named headmaster in 1939. Still, the couple's devotion to each other overcomes all obstacles threatening their marriage, extending through 20 years together, when Katherine is killed in 1944 by a German V-1 flying bomb while entertaining the troops at a local Royal Air Force base. Too late for his wife to share in his happiness, Chips was picked as headmaster of Brookfield that same day, and lives out his years at the school, loved by his pupils and comforted by his happy memories.

Here are the options: * yes * it is not possible to tell * no Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"The statement \\"I stared at Derry\\" is too broad and offers minimal specific information about what part of Derry was being stared at. It could refer to staring at any part of Derry or even Derry as a whole. Consequently, it can't be conclusively determined from the premise that specific focus was placed on Derry's nose. According to the options provided - yes, it is not possible to tell, and no - the most fitting response to the question, \\"Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?\\" would be \\"it is not possible to tell\\". This is primarily because the premise does not provide precise details about what the staring was targeted at. The hypothesis is more specific, stating the staring was focused on Derry's nose. However, without such detail in the premise, one cannot ascertain with certainty that the hypothesis follows directly from the premise. In logic and argumentation, the conclusion (in this case, the hypothesis \\"I was staring at Derry's nose\\") must be a logical result of the premise(s). If the premise is too vague or does not contain enough information to fully support the conclusion, then it is not possible to tell whether the conclusion is true based on that premise. And this is the case with the provided premise and hypothesis. The premise simply states that the speaker was staring at Derry, without specifying what part they were staring at. Therefore, it does not convincingly lead to the hypothesis that they were staring at Derry's nose. It's important to understand that 'impossible to tell' does not necessarily mean 'no'. It merely declares that with the information given, one cannot definitively say 'yes' or 'no'.

Question: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog. Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation. \\"The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,\\" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery. The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are \\"extremely difficult, if not impossible\\" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said. The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face. The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants, Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue. Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers. Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant.

The given sentence in French, \\"Le présent document n’aborde que la section générale portant sur la planification et la gestion des océans fondée sur les écosystèmes,\\" translates to the above statement in English. The sentence indicates that this particular document is focused specifically on the general topic of planning and managing oceans from an ecosystem-based perspective. This particular approach is essential as it emphasizes the importance of considering the various aspects and interactions among living organisms within the marine ecosystem, alongside their respective environments, thus ensuring a more sustainable and balanced management of ocean resources. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) of oceans is crucial for preserving biodiversity and maintaining healthy marine ecosystems for the present and future generations. It is a comprehensive and proactive method that not only takes into account the needs of individual species, but also the complex web of interactions between species and their environment. This form of management ultimately leads to more resilient ecosystems, which can better withstand and recover from disturbances such as climate change, pollution, and overfishing. Ecosystem-based planning and management involves several key elements, including: 1. Identifying and understanding the structure, function, and relationships within an ecosystem – This involves the study and monitoring of species populations, habitats, and environmental factors that influence the marine ecosystem. This knowledge helps to identify critical areas for conservation and potential threats to the ecosystem balance. 2. Establishing clear goals and objectives – Central to any successful ecosystem-based management approach is the establishment of well-defined goals and objectives aimed at the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of marine resources. 3. Integrating social, economic, and ecological considerations – In order for ecosystem-based planning and management to be successful, it must take into account not just the ecological factors, but also the social and economic implications of management decisions. 4. Predictive modeling and scenario analysis – These tools, such as computer simulations and mathematical models, can be used to predict the potential consequences of various management actions and help identify the best strategies to achieve desired objectives and goals. 5. Adaptive management – This approach emphasizes the importance of learning and adapting throughout the management process, recognizing that ecosystems are dynamic and ever-changing and that our understanding of them is continually evolving. 6. Stakeholder involvement – Successful ecosystem-based management must include the participation of various stakeholders, such as local communities, indigenous peoples, industry, scientists, and policymakers. 7. International cooperation – Because marine ecosystems often cross national boundaries, international cooperation is necessary to ensure the effective management of shared resources and the implementation of joint conservation efforts. By emphasizing these key elements, ecosystem-based planning and management of oceans can help contribute to the health and sustainability of our global marine ecosystems. This approach ultimately benefits not only the countless species that rely on healthy oceans for their survival but also the millions of people worldwide who depend on these resources for their livelihoods and well-being."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction.

Information: - The Posavac Hound ( FCI No. 154 ) ( Croatian : posavski goni ) is a breed of dog , originating as a hunting dog of the scenthound type . Croatia is the home country for the breed . The name translates into English as the Scenthound From The Sava Valley , but is usually translated as the Posavac Hound . - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds or landraces of terrier type, which are typically small, wiry, very active and fearless dogs. Terrier breeds vary greatly in size from just to over and are usually categorized by size or function. There are five different groups with each group having several different breeds. - The gray wolf or grey wolf (\\"Canis lupus\\"), also known as the timber wolf or western wolf, is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging , and females . Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other \\"Canis\\" species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur. , 37 subspecies of \\"C. lupus\\" are recognised by MSW3. - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. - A hunting dog refers to a canine that hunts with or for humans. There are several types of hunting dogs developed for various tasks. The major categories of hunting dogs include hounds, terriers, dachshunds, cur type dogs, and gun dogs. Among these categories further divisions can be made based upon the dogs' skill sets. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Zagreb is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level. In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887. It is the biggest metropolitan area in Croatia, and the only one with a population of over one million. - The dachshund (or or ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. - \\"Hound\\" is a synonym for \\"dog\\", also used in a more specific sense to refer to a type of dog used by hunters to track or chase prey. - Gun dogs, or bird dogs, are types of hunting dogs developed to assist hunters in finding and retrieving game, usually birds. Gun dogs are divided into three primary types: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. Some kennel clubs define a Gundog Group for gun dogs, while other kennel clubs include them in the Sporting Group. - A cur is a type of dog. CUR refers to: - Canis is a genus of canids containing multiple extant species, such as wolves, dogs and coyotes. Species of this genus are distinguished by their moderate to large size, their massive, well developed skulls and dentition, long legs, and comparatively short ears and tails. - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia. Responding to political, social and economic pressure, many Croats have migrated throughout Europe (especially Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Italy) and the Americas (particularly the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile), establishing a diaspora.

How to choose a dog fence for your yard<br>Check local fencing regulations. Your community may have laws about the materials and sizes allowed for residential fences. Don't rely on a fencing company to know the regulations. Can we infer the following? Fencing companies have laws about the type of fences allowed","completion":"Choosing the right dog fence for your yard involves several factors and steps. While you mentioned that local fencing regulations should be followed, it is important to note that fencing companies may not always be aware of these regulations. It is essential for homeowners to be well-informed about their community's laws and requirements to ensure compliance. Here is a comprehensive guide to help you select the perfect dog fence for your yard: 1. Check local fencing regulations: As you mentioned, your community may have specific laws regarding the materials, sizes, and styles permitted for residential fences. Contact your local zoning board or homeowners' association to obtain relevant information about these regulations. 2. Determine your objective: Before choosing a dog fence, consider your primary goal, whether it's preventing your dog from escaping, offering safety and security, or enhancing your property's aesthetic appeal. 3. Evaluate your dog's behavior and needs: Different breeds and individual dogs have varying physical abilities and temperaments. Consider your dog's size, energy level, and agility when selecting a fence. For instance, larger dogs may need a taller fence, while those who are prone to digging might require a fence that extends underground. 4. Choose the right fence material: There are several materials available for dog fences, including wood, vinyl, chain-link, metal, and composite. Each material has varying levels of durability, maintenance requirements, and cost. Choose a material based on your budget, maintenance preferences, and the climate of your region. 5. Fence height and visibility: The height of your fence should be adequate to prevent your dog from jumping or climbing over it. Additionally, consider whether you want a fence with an open or closed design. While a closed fence may provide more privacy, an open design, such as a chain-link fence, offers better visibility to monitor your dog's activities from a distance. 6. Include a secure gate: A fence is only as secure as its gate. Ensure that the gate is easy to open and close for you, but difficult for your dog to manipulate. Locks and latches should be durable and secure. 7. Consider incorporating a dog run: If you have a large property or want to provide a dedicated space for your dog to exercise, installing a separate dog run within your fenced yard may be a suitable option. This allows your dog to move around freely without accessing the entire yard. 8. Factor in aesthetics: While the primary purpose of a dog fence is functionality, you should also take into account the fence's appearance and how it will blend with your home's exterior design, landscaping, and overall aesthetic. 9. Obtain multiple quotes: Reach out to several fencing companies or contractors to gather quotes. Discuss your preferences, dog's needs, and local regulations with each company. Make sure you compare the complete costs, including material and installation fees. 10. Seek references and reviews: Once you have narrowed down your selection of fencing companies, research their reputation, previous projects, and customer reviews. This information will give you an idea of the quality and satisfaction you can expect from your chosen provider. In conclusion, while fencing companies may have a general understanding of residential fence regulations, homeowners should always verify their community's specific laws. By considering factors such as local regulations, your dog's needs, fence materials, design, and aesthetics, you will be able to select the perfect dog fence for your yard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier.

Answer the following question: Information: - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation. - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4. - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. - An attack aircraft, strike aircraft, or attack bomber, is a tactical military aircraft that has a primary role of carrying out airstrikes with greater precision than bombers, and is prepared to encounter strong low-level air defenses while pressing the attack. This class of aircraft is designed mostly for close air support and naval air-to-surface missions, overlapping the tactical bomber mission. Designs dedicated to non-naval roles are often known as ground-attack aircraft. - A flight simulator is a device that artificially re-creates aircraft flight and the environment in which it flies, for pilot training, design, or other purposes. It includes replicating the equations that govern how aircraft fly, how they react to applications of flight controls, the effects of other aircraft systems, and how the aircraft reacts to external factors such as air density, turbulence, wind shear, cloud, precipitation, etc. Flight simulation is used for a variety of reasons, including flight training (mainly of pilots), the design and development of the aircraft itself, and research into aircraft characteristics and control handling qualities. - DR-DOS (DR DOS, without hyphen up to and including version 6.0) is an operating system of the DOS family, written for IBM PC-compatible personal computers. It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86. As ownership changed, various later versions were produced with names including Novell DOS and Caldera OpenDOS. - Betrayal at Krondor is a DOS-based role-playing video game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line in the summer of 1993. \\"Betrayal at Krondor\\" takes place largely in Midkemia, the fantasy world developed by Raymond E. Feist in his \\"Riftwar\\" novels. The game is designed to resemble a book, separated into chapters and narrated in the third-person with a quick-save bookmark feature. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use. - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor.

Article: Cops are programmed to pay attention to every detail, and this also applies to their love interests. To keep the attention of a police officer, avoid committing civilian and traffic crimes, such as speeding, running a red light, or shoplifting. If you have a lengthy record full of traffic violations or crime, you likely will not attract a cop. If you are unsure of what is on your record, search online to find free background checks. You can easily run your information and see what information your cop crush can find. If you want to attract an officer, demonstrate your love for fitness and health. You should work out at least 3 times a week for about 30 - 90 minutes, if you can. Limit your consumption of sugar, processed foods, and junk food. Eat 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables on average, and drink 8 glasses of water each day. Police officers must complete particular fitness evaluations to earn their positions, and they must be in good shape to act as a cop. To charm an officer, ask them questions about why they became a police officer and what they like and dislike about their work. Showing genuine interest in their stressful, unconventional career will likely help the officer trust you and further your connection. For example, say something like, \\"So Jack, why did you want to be a cop?\\" When you chat, keep consistent eye contact and smile at them so they know you are engaged in the conversation. It is common for the stress of an officer's duty to follow them home. In these instances, the best way to get the officer to like you is to show them your support. When the officer mentions reasons they are distressed, listen to all the details they give you, and respond with compassionate comments. For example, say something like, “I'm so sorry you had to deal with that today. I am proud you were there to help. Can I get you anything?” This shows them you are appreciative of their sacrifices and there to help take away their burden. There are some instances where the officer will not be able to give you much details, so they don't break any confidentiality agreements. Respect this and be patient with the details they do offer. What is a summary?","completion":"Summary: To attract a police officer, avoid committing crimes or traffic violations, maintain good physical fitness, and show genuine interest in their career by asking questions about their experiences.

Article: At 2 p.m. on December 5, 1945, five Navy aircraft took off in perfect flying weather from a naval air installation in southeastern Florida, on a routine training mission over the Atlantic Ocean. Less than two hours later, the flight commander radioed that he was \\"completely lost\\". Then there was silence. A rescue plane was sent to search for the missing aircraft, and it, too, disappeared. Despite one of history's most extensive search efforts, involving more than 300 planes and dozens of ships, the Navy found nothing, not even an oil stain floating on the water. This is just one of the many frightening stories told of \\"the Bermuda Triangle\\", a mysterious area of the Atlantic Ocean roughly stretching southwest from Bermuda to the Florida coast and down to Puerto Rico. During the past 30 years, the triangle has claimed the lives of some 1,000 sailors and pilots. Stranger yet are the numerous \\"ghost\\" ships that have been found floating crewless within the triangle. On one strange occasion in 1881, the cargo shipEllen Austindiscovered a small sailing ship, sails waving uselessly in the wind. The boat was full of wood with no one on deck. The captain of theEllen Austininstalled a new crew to sail it, but two days later, during a rough storm, the two ships temporarily lost sight of each other. When the captain again boarded the boat, he found his crew had disappeared. After a second crew was assigned, the ship was again lost in a fog bank. This time, no trace of the boat -- or the crew -- was ever found. Charles Berlitz, a man with an interest in Atlantis, the legendary lost island, puts forward his theory that a giant solar crystal, which once was the power generator for Atlantis, lies on the ocean floor. From time to time, according to his theory, passing ships and planes set off the crystal, which confuses their instruments and _ them into the ocean.

Solar energy: In the last two decades, photovoltaics (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286 USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%. By 2012 available efficiencies exceed 20% and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics is over 40%.

Moreover, the collaboration could offer Montenegro valuable insights on how to address similar challenges and align itself with EU requirements to facilitate a smooth integration process. Additionally, Vujanović acknowledges the importance of bolstering the economy by fostering trade and tourism between Montenegro and Bulgaria. Both countries share a common history as part of the former Yugoslavia and have a vested interest in enhancing cultural exchanges to boost tourism in the region. Furthermore, fostering a closer partnership between Montenegro and Bulgaria could lead to increased investments and joint business ventures, contributing to economic growth and job creation in both countries. In the field of education, Vujanović sees great potential for Montenegro to learn from and adapt Bulgaria's educational models and initiatives, which could help boost Montenegro's overall academic performance and the competitiveness of its workforce. Alongside this, collaborations between universities and research institutions can catalyze innovation and strengthen ties between the two nations. Finally, improved cooperation in infrastructural projects can assist Montenegro in taking advantage of Bulgaria's expertise in public transportation and renewable energy.

Zack on the other hand, had a higher metabolic rate, a faster metabolism, and he would eat the correct amount of calories. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which brother had a lower chance of becoming obese? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Zack has a lower chance of becoming obese compared to his brother Vick. There are several reasons that contribute to this conclusion: 1. Different Diets: Zack's diet consists of consuming the correct amount of calories, which implies that he is likely paying attention to the nutritional content and quality of his food. This type of diet, well balanced in nutrients and portion-controlled, makes it easier for an individual to maintain a healthy weight. On the contrary, Vick's diet is high in fat and he frequently overeats, leading to a higher calorie intake. A diet that is high in fat and excessive calories increases the risk of weight gain and obesity. 2. Metabolic Rate: Zack has a higher metabolic rate, which means that his body is capable of converting food into energy more efficiently. A faster metabolism typically requires more calories to function and burns those calories more quickly, leaving fewer calories to be stored in the body as fat. This, in turn, decreases Zack's likelihood of becoming obese compared to his brother with a slower metabolism. 3. Behavior and Lifestyle: While the paragraph does not delve into the brothers' physical activities, good dietary habits like those exhibited by Zack often go hand-in-hand with regular exercise and maintaining an active lifestyle. These factors contribute to a lower risk of obesity as well. In conclusion, Zack's healthier diet, faster metabolism, and likely better lifestyle habits all contribute to a lower chance of him becoming obese compared to his brother Vick, who has a diet high in fat and a tendency to overeat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For Lil, the scene she had sketched was like a vivid, almost tangible expression of her unspoken emotions, fears, and desires. She hadn't planned to create this piece. Still, it seemed as if every stroke, line, and color was demanding to be recognized and understood as she felt its energy coursing through her. It was like her subconscious had taken over, forcing her to confront these feelings she had been avoiding for quite some time. Jake's comment about not taking an office job appeared, at first, to be casual and lighthearted. However, Lil wondered if there was a deeper meaning intertwined with his words. In her mind, an office job represented a symbol of security, predictability, and order. For some, these attributes would provide comfort and stability, while for others, such as Lil, it conjured a foreboding sense of suffocation and restraint. Lil couldn't help but feel touched when Jake reassured her that she was already the mother Colby needed. Her mind ached as it grappled between the vulnerability of motherhood and her desperate longing to maintain her sense of self. This tumultuous storm of emotions manifested in her art, where she sought solace and understanding through the convergence of line and color. As she glanced back and forth between Colby and Jake, she realized that she felt seen in a way she hadn't in a long time. Jake seemed to not only recognize her struggle but also empathize with it to some extent. Perhaps he had experienced a similar tug of war between the competing aspects of life. As the silence enveloped them, Lil found herself experiencing a blend of gratitude and unease. She was grateful that Jake had opened up this door for an honest conversation about her struggles and the expectations society tends to place on mothers. Simultaneously, she couldn't help but feel a bit exposed, making her guarded and anxious about where this discussion could lead. With a subtle, deep breath, she decided to dig a little deeper, searching for the connection between her emotional turbulence and the scene she had sketched. As she carefully looked at each detail, she realized that what she feared the most was not losing herself in the process of motherhood, but rather, losing the part of herself that nurtured her creativity and artistic spirit. With this realization, Lil was able to engage in a meaningful dialogue with Jake about the challenges she was facing. She found solace in their conversation and a renewed sense of purpose for her art. After all, it was through the process of creating and exploring her emotions that she could not only find herself again but also nurture and preserve that essential aspect of her identity. In the end, Jake's words served as a compass for Lil, allowing her to navigate the complex terrain of motherhood and artistic expression. They bonded over their shared understanding while also providing each other with the support and encouragement necessary to continue pursuing their passions. And, as they spoke, Colby gleefully continued to lick the green paint off his finger, reminding them both that sometimes, life's greatest joys stem from the simplest, most unexpected moments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas?, using the article: Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet (French: [ʒyl emil fʁedeʁik masnɛ]; 12 May 1842 – 13 August 1912) was a French composer of the Romantic era best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty. The two most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892). He also composed oratorios, ballets, orchestral works, incidental music, piano pieces, songs and other music. While still a schoolboy, Massenet was admitted to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became best known for his operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Like many prominent French composers of the period, Massenet became a professor at the Conservatoire. He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas. Among his students were Gustave Charpentier, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn and Gabriel Pierné. By the time of his death, Massenet was regarded by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: Massenet Step 1: Understand the question The question asks for the last name of the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"1. Can a government force people to reproduce? Imagine a country is like a big family, and the government is like the parents in that family. In a kind and caring family, parents don't force their children to do things against their wishes. Similarly, a good government cannot force people to have babies if they don't want to. It's important to respect everyone's own choices about their lives. 2. Why is one minus cosine similarity equal to cosine distance? Let's imagine two toy cars facing each other. The angle between them tells us how different their directions are. Cosine similarity is like a way to measure how similar or different the \\"directions\\" of two things are, in this case, the toy cars. The less the angle, the more similar they are. Now, think of the distance between two points. Distance measures how far apart two things are. Cosine distance is a way to measure how different the \\"directions\\" are, just like cosine similarity. But, it tells us in a different way - in terms of distance instead of angle. So, when we subtract the cosine similarity from 1, we flip the way we measure the difference, and we get the cosine distance. This means, if two things are very similar, the distance will be small, and if they are not so similar, the distance will be big. 3. Would you say that these questions are the same? No, these questions are different. The first question is about whether a government can control people's choices related to having babies. The second question is about math and understanding the relationship between cosine similarity and cosine distance. They are about completely different topics, so they are not the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

It was released on July 27, 1973, by Mercury Records. In the years leading up to the album, the New York Dolls had developed a local fanbase by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after forming in 1971. However, most music producers and record companies were reluctant to work with them because of their vulgarity and onstage fashion; the group later appeared in exaggerated drag on the album cover for shock value. After signing a contract with Mercury, the New York Dolls recorded their first album at The Record Plant in New York City with producer Todd Rundgren, who was known for his sophisticated pop tastes and held a lukewarm opinion of the band. Despite stories of conflicts during the recording sessions, lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain later said Rundgren successfully captured how the band sounded live. Their music on the album incorporated carefree rock and roll, Brill Building pop influences, and campy sensibilities, while Johansen's colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explored themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and authenticity. New York Dolls was met with widespread critical acclaim but sold poorly and polarized listeners. The band proved difficult to market outside their native New York and developed a reputation for rock-star excesses while touring the United States in support of the album. Despite its commercial failure, New York Dolls was an influential precursor to the 1970s punk rock movement and has since been named in various publications as one of the best debut records in rock music and one of the greatest albums of all time.

What was the Japanese perception of the Roman Empire?","completion":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They address different topics related to the Roman Empire. The first question, \\"What was the status of black people in the Roman Empire?\\" focuses on the social, economic, and political status of black people within the Roman Empire. This question seeks to understand the experiences, roles, and treatment of black individuals who lived in ancient Rome. To answer this question, it is essential to recognize that the Roman Empire was an extensive and diverse political entity that spanned three continents, including Europe, Africa, and Asia. Consequently, the empire had a multicultural population with various ethnic backgrounds. Black people in the Roman Empire—mostly from regions in North Africa, Egypt, and Sudan—held various roles and statuses. Some black individuals, such as those from Ethiopia or Nubia, were slaves, but others held positions of power and prestige as soldiers, administrators, merchants, or even part of the Roman elite. Roman society was not color-blind, but an individual's social status was generally defined more by their wealth, occupation, and political connections than by their ethnic origin or skin color. The second question, \\"What was the Japanese perception of the Roman Empire?\\" examines the views and understanding of the Roman Empire by the Japanese people. As Japan was geographically far from the Roman Empire and had minimal direct contact, their knowledge of Rome would have been limited and subject to influences from Chinese and later European sources. During the majority of the Roman Empire's existence (27 BC to 476 AD), Japan was in the Yayoi period (300 BC to 300 AD) and Kofun period (300 to 538 AD). During these eras, Japan had limited contact with the rest of the world and was focused on its internal politics and the consolidation of its state. Much of Japanese knowledge of the Roman Empire would have been derived centuries later, during the Edo period (1603-1868). During the Edo period, Japan was exposed to European ideas and learning, as Dutch traders and scholars were allowed to work and live in Nagasaki. These Dutch merchants brought books on history and science, some of which contained information about ancient Rome. As a result, the Japanese perception of the Roman Empire would have been shaped by European understanding and perspectives on Rome. Intellectuals, such as Hayashi Gahō and Arai Hakuseki, wrote about the Roman Empire, often discussing its organization, politics, and military prowess. In summary, the two questions address separate aspects of the Roman Empire. The first question pertains to the status of black people within the empire, while the second question considers the Japanese perception of it. Both questions invite discussions about the historical context and cultural interactions between different societies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

After receiving the request from Melissa to investigate, Ace goes to the stadium and takes a look inside Snowflake's tank, finding a small stone in the filter system. Roger spots a team of reporters heading to the tank and is worried (fearing the negative press that would result from knowledge of Snowflake's abduction). Ace poses as an eccentric animal trainer and manages to drive the reporters (Antoni Corone and Margo Peace) away.Later that day, Ace Ventura stops in at the local police headquarters. After an altercation with Sgt. Aguado (John Capodice), Ace meets his friend Detective Emilio (Tone Loc) to find out what leads the police may have. Emilio admits that a missing animal case isn't a priority for the police but they suspect that one of the local animal rights groups, who have repeatedly protested the Miami Dolphin's ownership of Snowflake, may be responsible.

Do you spit in their eye or swallow your pride ? Do you listen to the problem patiently , not interrupting , and then offer a solution ? or Do you butt in , argue the toss , and stand your ground ? Question What might happen if the writer decides to spit in the customer 's eye ? Answer:","completion":"If the writer decides to spit in the customer's eye, several negative outcomes could occur. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what might happen: 1. Escalation of the situation: Spitting in someone's eye is a highly disrespectful and aggressive action. This could cause the already irate customer to become angrier and escalate the situation into a potential confrontation or argument. 2. Damage to the writer's reputation: If the incident takes place in a public setting, other customers and bystanders may observe the writer's unprofessional behavior. This could lead to negative word-of-mouth, damaging both the writer's personal reputation and that of the business they represent. 3. Loss of business: If the irate customer is a longstanding or significant customer to the writer's business, their mistreatment could result in the loss of their patronage. Furthermore, their negative experience could spread to their friends, family or social circle, causing further loss of business. 4. Potential for disciplinary action: Employers generally expect their employees to handle customer interactions professionally, even when the customer is angry or upset. Spitting in the customer's eye could lead the writer's employer to take disciplinary action against them, including possible termination. 5. Legal consequences: In some jurisdictions, spitting on someone can be considered an assault and could result in legal consequences for the writer, including fines and potential criminal charges. In conclusion, choosing to spit in the customer's eye is not a productive or professional solution to handling an irate customer. Instead, the writer should consider swallowing their pride, listening to the customer's concerns and offering a solution whenever possible without resorting to aggression."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hatfield, a radiologist, and Julie Hatfield, a former Boston Globe features, society, travel writer, and fashion critic who currently works as a freelance travel writer. Hatfield grew up in the Boston suburb of Duxbury. Although well known for the early 1990s hit, \\"My Sister\\", Hatfield has two brothers, but no sisters. Hatfield's father claimed his family were descendants of the West Virginia Hatfields of the Hatfield-McCoy feud following the Civil War. In 1995, following the success of Become What You Are she released her follow-up album, Only Everything, in which she \\"turned up the volume and the distortion and had a lot of fun\\". One reviewer describes it as \\"a fun, engaging pop album\\". The album spawned another alternative radio hit for Hatfield in \\"Universal Heartbeat\\". The video featured Hatfield as an overly demanding aerobics instructor. Prior to the tour for Only Everything, Hatfield released Phillips and brought on Jason Sutter (American Hi-Fi, Chris Cornell, Jack Drag), as well as Ed Slanker (Thudpucker, Tinsel) on 2nd guitar, and Lisa Mednick on keyboards. Two weeks into the tour, Hatfield canceled the tour, which her publicist explained as due to \\"nervous exhaustion,\\" and took a month-long break. In her memoir, Hatfield writes that in truth she was suffering from depression severe enough to the point of being suicidal. Hatfield disagreed with the decision not to be upfront about her depression. The drummer was, once again, replaced, this time by Phillips, and touring resumed with Jeff Buckley as the opening act. In 1996, she traveled to Woodstock, New York where she recorded tracks for God's Foot, which was to be her fourth solo album (third if not counting Become What You Are, which was recorded with the Juliana Hatfield Three), intended for 1997 release. After three failed attempts to satisfy requests from Atlantic Records to come up with a \\"single\\" that the label could release, Juliana requested she be released from her contract. The label obliged, but kept the rights to the songs produced during these sessions (Atlantic had reportedly paid 180,000 to that point on the recordings). Two tracks - \\"Mountains of Love\\" and \\"Fade Away\\" - were eventually released on a greatest hits collection entitled Gold Stars, while still another, \\"Can't Kill Myself,\\" was available for download from Hatfield's official website. The remaining tracks have surfaced only as substandard bootleg versions (which do not meet Hatfield's approval) and she has rarely featured them in her subsequent live performances. In 1997 Hatfield toured with the first Lilith Fair, a prominent all-female rock festival founded by singer Sarah McLachlan. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: hOW LONG WAS SHE TOURING?","completion":"Hatfield was touring for two weeks before she canceled the tour due to \\"nervous exhaustion.\\" However, after taking a month-long break and replacing some band members, the touring resumed with Jeff Buckley as the opening act."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Adiabatic cooling occurs when one or more of three possible lifting agents – cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic – causes a parcel of air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling. As the air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated, water vapor normally condenses to form cloud drops. This condensation normally occurs on cloud condensation nuclei such as salt or dust particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air.Frontal and cyclonic lift occur when stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure by a process called convergence. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds over a wide area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on the stability of the warm air mass just ahead of the front.

While adultery in this day and age might end up in the divorce courts, women guilty of such a crime during the late Middle Ages were forced to endure a very unusual form of retribution - reciting a humiliating ditty while sitting backwards on a ram, holding its tail. This is just one of many punishments that were routinely handed out in Warwickshire for activities banned in the county for more than six centuries. And many of the offences themselves would now be considered equally ridiculous. Ancient history: The manorial documents stipulating the bizarre punishments for outlawed activities have been uploaded to the internet. Ancient documents stipulating the strange laws and have been unearthed and uploaded to the internet so they can be viewed online for the first time on the National Archives' Manorial Documents Register. Historians spent six months collating the records and putting them onto an online database. They include laws against selling shoes before 1pm as well as playing tennis and bowls - 'crimes' which were punishable by a 40 pence fine. Neil Bettridge, manorial documents project officer for Warwickshire County Council, said: 'People were fined for playing bowls [in Temple Balsall] in the 1620s. An ancient map (pictured) detailing the historical boundaries of Warwickshire was also among the haul of manorial documents. Historians spent six months collating the records and putting them onto an online database. 'It was more a question of social order. People weren’t keen on [other] people getting together in large groups and necessarily enjoying themselves. 'I think it was a question of social control that they didn’t want people to be wasting their time on what they thought were frivolous things.' In 1424 tennis was banned from the streets of Atherstone, Warkwickshire, while ale house haunters who did not attend church were fined under charges issued by 17th Century courts. Women who committed adultery were also forced to sit on the back of a ram in front of everyone in the court, hold the animal’s tail and recite a ditty. A rich and fascinating history: A lot of the records are written in Latin and, because of their age, the handwriting is difficult to read. Ancient scrolls: The ancient documents include laws against selling shoes before 1pm as well as playing tennis and bowls - 'crimes' punishable by a 40 pence fine.

Another law reads: 'The churchwardens to search for ale house haunters and others that come not to church on Sunday on pain (fine) of 10s.'

Explanation: A shirtless man is shoving snow outside at the curb, so he's clearly trying to clear the snow. That's why (II) makes sense - getting a shovel is a common way to remove snow. Wrong answers: (I) Laying down on the snow and digging with an ax is not practical for removing snow and it's not safe either. (III) Waving hands and motioning at passing cars is not the main focus of this paragraph, which is about removing snow. (IV) Conditioning a hedge with a stick is irrelevant to the situation of removing snow from the curb."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A 19-year-old Maryland woman who survived being shot by an ex-boyfriend has broken her silence with an emotional Facebook post just two weeks after the attack. Kristen Loetz first thanks both those who've helped her in her speedy recovery and CJ Abbott, the 19-year-old who died while protecting her from her attacker. Loetz then compassionately addresses Ryan Shallue, the angry high school flame who took his own life after forcing his way into her home near Salisbury University, shot her in the face, and murdered her heroic friend. Speaking out: Kristen Loetz (right) took to Facebook to speak for the first time since her jilted ex-boyfriend shot her in the face and murdered her friend who tried to protect her. 'Everyone needs to know how you saved my life that day,' writes the honors nursing student in her loving ode to CJ Abbott. Loetz had spent the 12 days previous recovering from wounds she incurred the night Shallue shot her and Abbott with a semi-automatic rifle before before going into a bathroom and shooting himself in the head. 'My fast recovery is greatly because of all of the love and support I have received from everyone,' Loetz writes. That support came first and foremost from Abbott, whose sister said he died a hero trying to stop Shallue from assaulting Loetz. 'I love ya ceej': Loetz thanks all her friends and family, but she gives extra thanks to the man who helped her keep her life but lost her own--CJ Abbott. 'Thanks for being my hero': Loetz wrote an emotional thanks to CJ Abbott, the 20-year-old who sacrificed himself to help save her life when ex Ryan Shallue pulled out a gun to exact his revenge. Haunting: As Shallue (left) lay dead, this photo of him with the woman he tried to kill remains on his Twitter account. 'It is so unfair that it was you and not me,' she writes. 'CJ, the most kind gentle hearted person who would jump at the chance to lend a hand to anyone.' Loetz writes of Abbott's 'fantastic family' and says 'one day I hope to meet them and tell them how amazing of a person I knew you to be.' 'I can't thank you enough for everything you have done for me,' she writes in a post dated September 15. Loetz goes on to thank the friend named Michelle 'for being so strong during this tragedy' and calling 911 after the shooting. Then Loetz writes something unexpected, a largely friendly acknowledgement of the ex-boyfriend who tried to kill her. 'You were never a bad person,' she writes of Shallue. 'I hope you have found a better place where you can find peace.' The 450 word letter closes: 'I love ya ceej, thanks for being my hero.' Police. say Ryan Shallue became increasingly disturbed after his high school. girlfriend Kristen Loetz, 19, dumped him four months ago. Shallue began stalking her and. bought a gun two weeks before the shooting. On the night of September 4, he showed up at Loetz's off-campus house, where she. discovered her with 20-year-old Charles 'CJ' Abbott. When Shallue began. fighting with Loetz, Abbott tried to intervene, police said. Shallue pulled out a semi-automatic pistol and pulled the trigger. Friends: Loetz, left, took to Facebook to thank all her friends. She especially thankful to CJ Abbott, who tried to stop the enraged Shallue when he entered Abbott's home September 4. The Salisbury Daily Times. reports that Loetz and Shallue graduated high school together in. Stevensville, Maryland, in 2010. The Facebook profiles for both Loetz. and Shallue show dozens of photos of them embracing - appearing a happy. couple at the beach and at prom. After. high school, Loetz left and attended Salisbury University, an hour and a. half away. She became a promising nursing student whom teachers called. bright and attentive. She joined a sorority on campus and worked at a. community center for special needs children and teens. Shallue stayed behind and appears to. have done little with his life. His Twitter page shows a man becoming. increasingly bitter and obsessed with alcohol. High school sweethearts: Police say Ryan Shallue, 21, left, attacked his ex-girlfriend Kristen Loetz, 19, four months after she dumped him. Loetz was critically wounded. Shallue killed himself. Police say Shallue forced his way into his ex-girlfriend's house, just off the campus of Salisbury University on Tuesday night. Police say Loetz dumped Shallue months ago and that he spiraled into obsession and anger. Shallue's. Twitter page includes tweets like 'I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare. me to drive!' and 'I found the cure and its name is vodka!' Abbott was a skilled car mechanic in Salisbury. His bosses described him as hard-working and dedicated. His sister told the Daily Times that Abbott and Loetz had been seeing a lot of each other recently. She. said her entire family - including his twin brother - are devastated by. the shocking murder, but said no one was surprised he died trying to. protect a friend.

It was a classless, shameful, euphoric, and powerfully addictive experience. My sister and I would watch it, rewind it, and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another. So, if you are an 11-year old girl, and you reviewed this film as \\"brilliant\\" or \\"fun\\" or \\"better than the original Grease,\\" you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass. If, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an inane, artless, slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production, distribution, and/or consumption. For the sake of criticism, I will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows 1. In a well-executed musical, the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters. In Grease 2, with a few debatable exceptions, to the music is obscenely pointless. Most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way (\\"Score Tonight,\\" \\"Reproduction,\\" \\"Do It For Our Country,\\" and \\"Prowlin'\\") without making one concrete statement about any of the film's characters or themes. Plus, all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance. 2. The T-birds should be badass, and if not at least somewhat likable, but instead each of them is an annoying wussy-dufus-loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred T-bird jacket and initiates him into the gang, Michael should kick it to the ground, spit on it, and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it. But of course, he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads, there is no greater honor than to be one with the T-birds. 3. Since Michael is beautiful, smart, kind, resourceful, and above average in everyway (his musical impotence notwithstanding), it is feasible that Stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a slovenly, slack-jawed, bubble gum smacking, dirty sweatshirt wearing, gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat. So aside from being pretty (I guess), she harbors no likable characteristics, thus, audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michael's attraction to her. I could go on and on, but I didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. I will say this though, to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time's sake: Grease 2 is an experience akin to re-living your first kiss. Only you are 32 now and kissing a snot-nosed 13-year old kid with acne and slobby braces. The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed. Trust me.

From the warm and attentive staff to the exquisite cuisine and elegant atmosphere, Blue Magnolia has undoubtedly become one of my all-time favorite dining establishments, earning a well-deserved five-star rating. Upon arrival, I was immediately impressed by the attention to detail and the elegant ambience that surrounded me. From the soft lighting to the tasteful decor and the subtle yet enchanting background music, it was evident that the owners had gone to great lengths to create a truly comforting and memorable dining environment. The attentive host welcomed us with a warm smile, promptly escorted us to our reserved table, and made sure that we were comfortable and satisfied with the seating arrangements. Our server, Samantha, was an absolute delight. Not only did she have an extensive knowledge of the menu and its offerings, but she also provided excellent recommendations based on our tastes and dietary preferences. Samantha was very attentive and professional throughout our dining experience, constantly checking in on us and ensuring that our glasses were always full. The menu at Blue Magnolia was extensive and diverse, catering to a wide range of palates. We started with the delectable crab cakes, which were generously packed with succulent crab meat that perfectly complemented the lightly seasoned breading. The accompanying house-made remoulade sauce was tangy and vibrant, providing the perfect balance to the dish. For our main course, I indulged in the pan-seared Chilean sea bass, while my dining companion opted for the tender filet mignon. Both dishes were artfully presented and cooked to perfection. The sea bass was incredibly tender and flaky, bursting with flavor and resting on a bed of delightfully creamy risotto. The filet mignon was cooked precisely to our desired temperature, offering a perfect balance of tenderness and rich, bold flavors. As if things couldn't get any better, we completed our meal with the restaurant's signature dessert, the chocolate lava cake. An indulgent warm chocolate cake with a rich, molten center was surrounded by a delectable raspberry coulis, providing an extraordinary finale to our unparalleled dining experience. To make the evening even more special, the bill was presented to us with a personalized thank-you note from the chef, further emphasizing the Blue Magnolia's commitment to customer satisfaction and attention to detail. In summary, I wholeheartedly encourage both locals and visitors alike to experience the impeccable service and top-notch cuisine that the Blue Magnolia has to offer. It's not just a restaurant – it is an experience that is guaranteed to leave a lasting impression. I can't wait to return for another exceptional meal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \\"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.'' Grimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys’ restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person’s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies. Grimm was born female but identifies as male. \\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote. The ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S. The Obama administration in May directed the nation’s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration. The school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision. The board says it plans to file its petition for Supreme Court review by late August.

Q: Homer uses the terms Achaeans and Danaans (Δαναοί) as a generic term for Greeks in Iliad, and they were probably a part of the Mycenean civilization. The names Achaioi and Danaoi seem to be pre-Dorian belonging to the people who were overthrown. They were forced to the region that later bore the name Achaea after the Dorian invasion. In the 5th century BC, they were redefined as contemporary speakers of Aeolic Greek which was spoken mainly in Thessaly, Boeotia and Lesbos. There are many controversial theories on the origin of the Achaeans. According to one view, the Achaeans were one of the fair-headed tribes of upper Europe, who pressed down over the Alps during the early Iron age (1300 BC) to southern Europe. Another theory suggests that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans. These theories are rejected by other scholars who, based on linguistic criteria, suggest that the Achaeans were mainland pre-Dorian Greeks. There is also the theory that there was an Achaean ethnos that migrated from Asia minor to lower Thessaly prior to 2000 BC. Some Hittite texts mention a nation lying to the west called Ahhiyava or Ahhiya. Egyptian documents refer to Ekwesh, one of the groups of sea peoples who attached Egypt during the reign of Merneptah (1213-1203 BCE), who may have been Achaeans. Question: Who was Gulbahar's child?

The game is the culmination to a season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year. Normally, Roman numerals are used to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held. For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season. The single exception to this rule is Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015 regular season. The next game, Super Bowl LI, scheduled for February 5, 2017, will follow the 2016 regular season. - The Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American football franchise based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Eagles compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. - The Masters Tournament, also known as The Masters or The US Masters, is one of the four major championships in professional golf. The Masters is scheduled for the first full week of April, and it is the first of the majors to be played each year. Unlike the other major championships, the Masters is held each year at the same location, Augusta National Golf Club, a private golf club in the city of Augusta, Georgia, USA. The Masters was started by Clifford Roberts and Bobby Jones. Jones designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie. The tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club. - ESPN (originally an initialism for Entertainment and Sports Programming Networks) is a U.S.-based global cable and satellite sports television channel owned by ESPN Inc., a joint venture between The Walt Disney Company (which operates the network) and the Hearst Corporation (which owns a 20% minority share). - Christmas or Christmas Day (meaning \\"Christ's Mass\\") is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed most commonly on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.

The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family. - The Northeastern United States, also referred to as the American Northeast or simply the Northeast, is a geographical region of the United States of America bordered to the north by Canada, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the south by the Southern United States, and to the west by the Midwestern United States.

Q:Background: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. Paragraph: Mike was visiting the African Savannah.

The increased bombing is the latest evidence the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan is significantly intensifying since U.S. President Donald Trump announced his new military strategy for the country in August. Coalition planes dropped 1,186 weapons on Afghanistan during the first three months of 2018, according to figures released by U.S. Air Forces Central Command. The previous record (1,083) was set during the height of the war in 2011. The U.S. has not released 2001 to 2003 airstrike data. Those figures do not include activity by the Afghan Air Force (AAF), which has stepped up its aerial bombardment since gaining the ability to conduct airstrikes two years ago. The AAF carries out between 4 to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. If recent trends are any indication, 2018 is likely to get even more violent. Fighting traditionally picks up during the warmer months, and the coalition has expanded its bombing campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as narcotic labs and other Taliban revenue sources.

The once safe and friendly neighborhoods were now plagued with violence and crime, leaving its residents in a state of constant fear. This was Fact1: criminal organization rages in the city of Chingleput. Amidst the chaos and uncertainty, there lived a man named Muthaiya who was well-known for his kindness and modesty. Muthaiya had always been a pillar of support for his community, often lending a helping hand to those in need. Despite the mounting crime in Chingleput, Muthaiya remained resilient and did not let the darkness engulf him. This was Fact2: Muthaiya lived a very nice and modest life in Chingleput. The police force, under immense pressure to put an end to the criminal organization, found themselves constantly hitting dead ends in their investigations. Each promising lead turned to dust, and with the city's faith in their ability to protect dwindling, the demoralized police force was struggling. As the crime rate continued to soar, the policemen only met with failure in their pursuit of justice. This was Fact3: policemen repeatedly met with failure in dismantling the criminal organization. One day, Muthaiya's close friend Muthu, a calm and composed man of great intelligence, decided to step in and aid the police in their fight against this formidable organization. Having faced the impact of the escalating crime rates firsthand, Muthu was determined to put an end to the misery plaguing Chingleput. As Muthu began tracking the criminal organization's activities, he found himself discovering surprising connections and unraveling intricate webs of deceit. This was Fact4: Muthu tracked the criminal organization while uncovering a series of surprises. As Muthu continued his investigation, he began to learn the devastating truth beneath the city's crime spree. In a heart-wrenching turn of events, Muthu discovered that some of his closest friends and family members had been coerced into joining the criminal organization. They had been manipulated and threatened, forced to participate in illicit activities to protect their loved ones. This cruel reality weighed heavily on Muthu, as the lines between good and evil blurred. This was Fact5: the truth about the criminal organization was unbearably cruel for Muthu. Faced with the bitter truth, Muthu realized the enormity of the task before him. But instead of shying away, he decided that it was time for him to confront the ruthless criminals and expose their insidious tactics. He knew that to bring about change and restore peace in Chingleput, he had to risk everything and stay true to his integrity. With Muthaiya's support, Muthu embarked on an arduous journey to dismantle the criminal organization from within. The duo worked hand in hand with the police force, persevering through adversity to bring justice and restore the hope of the people of Chingleput. Through their resilience and unwavering determination, good ultimately triumphed over evil, and the once-proud city began its journey towards healing. The story of Muthu and Muthaiya's bravery and commitment to justice eventually spread throughout Chingleput, restoring the residents' faith in the power of community and the importance of standing up for what is right, even in the face of grave danger. In the end, their story served as a powerful reminder that the strength to overcome even the darkest times lies within each of us, if we are prepared to fight for it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It adopted the Columbia Pictures name in 1924, and went public two years later. Its name is derived from \\"Columbia\\", a national personification of the United States, which is used as the studio's logo. In its early years, it was a minor player in Hollywood, but began to grow in the late 1920s, spurred by a successful association with director Frank Capra.

If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains. The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 1015% of cases occur in people who have never smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance. Prevention is by avoiding risk factors including smoking and air pollution. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world. Signs and symptoms.

Would \\"A natural arch produced by the erosion of differentially weathered rock in Jebel Kharaz, Jordan\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"Plant gases, specifically those involved in the process of photosynthesis, can contribute to a reduction in erosion in various ways. However, the answer you provided, \\"A natural arch produced by the erosion of differentially weathered rock in Jebel Kharaz, Jordan,\\" does not directly address how plant gases can slow down erosion. Instead, it is an example of a geological landform resulting from erosion. To give a more comprehensive answer to the original question, let's discuss the role of plant gases in reducing erosion. One of the main processes through which plants slow erosion is by their ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. By drawing CO2 from the environment, they ultimately decrease the overall levels of this greenhouse gas, which can cause increased temperatures and contribute to climate change. Climate change can lead to more extreme weather events, such as heavier rainfall and more powerful storms, which in turn accelerate erosion. Additionally, plants release oxygen (O2) as a byproduct of photosynthesis, which helps maintain a balanced atmosphere, fostering a stable climate and indirectly reducing the potential for increased erosion. Plants also contribute to soil stability through their root systems. Vegetation helps secure soil particles, thus limiting the movement of soil in wind and water erosion events. Roots create networks within the soil layers, making it more resistant to erosion. As plants grow, their root systems expand, stabilizing the soil and diminishing the likelihood of soil erosion. In summary, plant gases can slow erosion through the following ways: 1. Absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, reducing the impact of climate change 2. Releasing O2, promoting a balanced atmosphere and more stable climate conditions 3. Supporting soil stability through their root systems The original answer you provided about the natural arch in Jordan is more representative of a geological feature resulting from erosion rather than an explanation of how plant gases can slow down erosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pick your answer from: [a]. The motorcycle coasted to a halt.. [b]. The motorcycle shot forward..","completion":"[b]. The motorcycle shot forward. In the given sentence, \\"The motorcyclist twisted the throttle,\\" the action being performed by the motorcyclist is twisting the throttle on their motorcycle. The throttle is an essential part of the motorcycle's control system that enables the rider to manage the engine's power output. By twisting the throttle, the motorcyclist is essentially increasing the flow of fuel and air into the engine, causing it to produce more power and accelerate. Therefore, the effect of this action is that the motorcycle shot forward. As the motorcyclist twists the throttle, the engine's power output increases, and the motorcycle gains speed, causing it to move forward at a higher pace. This action can be used to overtake other vehicles on the road, gain speed while riding on highways, or to maintain a higher speed when traveling downhill or uphill. This acceleration effect is crucial for a motorcycle rider to have precise control over their bike and react to various situations while riding, particularly in traffic, where they need to maneuver between lanes or overtake slower vehicles safely. Additionally, having precise control over the throttle allows the motorcyclist to manage their brakes efficiently, which is essential for rider safety, especially at high speeds or when approaching bends and corners. Hence, the correct answer to the question is [b]. The motorcycle shot forward, as twisting the throttle results in an increase in the engine's power output and, consequently, the bike's acceleration.

China's trade declined abruptly in June in a sign growth in the world's second-largest economy might be cooling even more sharply than expected. Exports fell by 3.1 per cent compared with a year earlier and imports contracted by 0.7 per cent, customs data showed today. Both were below forecasts of growth in the low single digits. China's economic growth has slowed this year and is expected to fall further due to weak global demand and an effort by the Chinese central bank to cool a credit boom. Slump: A view of the Yangshan Deepwater Port in Shanghai. Exports from. China have fallen by 3.1% and imports contracted by 0.7%. 'The export sector is faring very badly. It does suggest overall growth momentum is going to be weaker than we initially expected,' said Societe General economist Wei Yao. New communist leaders who took power last year say they want to pursue slower, more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption, reducing reliance on trade and investment. But some analysts say the latest slowdown might be so deep they could be forced to temporarily reverse course and boost lending or government spending to stimulate growth. A decline in Chinese economic activity could have global repercussions, denting revenues for suppliers of commodities and industrial components such as Australia, Brazil and Southeast Asia. Lower Chinese demand already has depressed global prices for iron ore, copper and other raw materials, cooling an economic boom for exporters. The ruling party's growth target this year is 7.5 per cent, down by almost half from 2007's staggering growth rate of 14.2 per cent. Some analysts have suggested growth might dip below 7 per cent in coming months - dangerously low by Chinese standards. Some analysts have suggested growth might dip below 7% in coming months - dangerously low by Chinese standards. Some private sector forecasters cut their growth outlook for the year, though to still robust levels above 7 percent, after a credit crunch hit China's financial markets last month. That came as the central bank tried to rein in a lending boom regulators worry could spiral out of control. 'The most likely outcome, in our view, is the Chinese economy going through a period of sluggish growth and adjustment,' said UBS economist Tao Wang in a report this week. Communist leaders have promised to promote private businesses that generate most of China's new jobs and wealth but have yet to make major changes. Retail sales have fallen short of official forecasts and a HSBC Corp. survey of manufacturers showed activity contracted in June for a second month. Still, Chinese leaders are unlikely to back away from efforts to overhaul the country's growth model, said Societe Generale's Yao. 'The plan is still to induce some short-term pain in exchange for long-term sustainability,' said Yao. 'That is still the most sensible choice, but sure, they need to make some marginal adjustments to make sure the economy doesn't slow too fast.' China's new communist leaders who took power last year say they want to pursue slower, more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption, reducing reliance on trade and investment. Analysts expected China to report slower growth in trade due to a crackdown on misreporting of data by exporters as a way to evade currency controls and bring extra money into the country. But even with that taken into account, Wednesday's figures were below forecasts for exports to rise by up to 3.5 percent and imports to grow by up to 1.5 per cent. June's export growth was down from May's year-on-year gain of 13.5 per cent and import growth was down from 8.2 per cent. China's politically sensitive global trade surplus contracted by 12.4 per cent compared with a year earlier to 27.1 billion. Exports were 174.3 billion while imports were 147.2 billion. Growth in exports to the United States, China's biggest foreign market, fell to 1.8 percent from May's 3.5 percent. Exports to the 27-nation European Union contracted 3.9 per cent. The trade surplus with the U.S. contracted by 15.5 percent from a year earlier to 17.5 billion, but still one of this year's highest levels. The surplus with Europe shrank 20.3 per cent to 10.2 billion.","completion":"China's trade experienced a significant decline in June 2013, with exports falling by 3.1% compared to the previous year and imports contracting by 0.7%.

Answer the following question: Q: Where is the most significant connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Secondary Vesicles The brain continues to develop, and the vesicles differentiate further (see Figure 13.3b). The three primary vesicles become five secondary vesicles. The prosencephalon enlarges into two new vesicles called the telencephalon and the diencephalon. The telecephalon will become the cerebrum. The diencephalon gives rise to several adult structures; two that will be important are the thalamus and the hypothalamus. In the embryonic diencephalon, a structure known as the eye cup develops, which will eventually become the retina, the nervous tissue of the eye called the retina. This is a rare example of nervous tissue developing as part of the CNS structures in the embryo, but becoming a peripheral structure in the fully formed nervous system. The mesencephalon does not differentiate into any finer divisions. The midbrain is an established region of the brain at the primary vesicle stage of development and remains that way. The rest of the brain develops around it and constitutes a large percentage of the mass of the brain. Dividing the brain into forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain is useful in considering its developmental pattern, but the midbrain is a small proportion of the entire brain, relatively speaking. The rhombencephalon develops into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The metencephalon corresponds to the adult structure known as the pons and also gives rise to the cerebellum. The cerebellum (from the Latin meaning “little brain”) accounts for about 10 percent of the mass of the brain and is an important structure in itself. The most significant connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain is at the pons, because the pons and cerebellum develop out of the same vesicle.

In June 2015, Corbyn threw his hat into the ring for the party's leadership contest, winning the backing of 36 MPs, just enough to make it to the ballot. While initially seen as an underdog, Corbyn quickly gained momentum, with a surge of party members and supporters being attracted to his honest and uncompromising style. Corbyn's grassroots campaign knew no boundaries, attracting thousands of new members to the Labour Party, many of them young people looking for a refreshing alternative to mainstream politics. On September 12, 2015, Jeremy Corbyn made history by securing a decisive victory in the first round of voting, with 59.5% of the vote. His triumph sent shockwaves through the British political scene, marking an era-transcending change in Labour's identity. Key Policies and Political Direction Jeremy Corbyn's political direction and the policies he advocates differ substantially from those of the centrist Labour leaders that preceded him, such as Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Among the key policies Corbyn and his supporters are promoting are: 1. Economic reform: Corbyn's economic policies are focused on reducing income inequality and reversing many austerity measures imposed since 2010. He advocates for increased public sector investment, a higher minimum wage, and measures to reduce tax evasion. 2. Public services: Corbyn is a proponent of renationalising key public services, specifically railways and utilities, to ensure that they are run for the benefit of all citizens instead of for private profit. He has also pledged to protect and invest in the National Health Service (NHS) and end the creeping privatisation of healthcare services. 3. Housing and education: Corbyn proposes building affordable social housing and abolishing university tuition fees, providing a fair playing field for all young people, irrespective of their financial background. 4. Foreign policy: Corbyn's approach to international politics is that of diplomacy and negotiation over military intervention. He has consistently spoken out against war, advocating for the United Kingdom to focus on promoting peace and human rights around the world instead. Challenges Ahead Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour leader was not welcomed by everyone within the party, with concerns being raised about his ability to gain broad electoral support. Critics argue that Corbyn's left-wing policies may alienate centre-ground voters, essential for success in a general election. Furthermore, Corbyn will need to unite a party that has become increasingly divided, with some factions threatening to resist or even undermine his leadership. Implications for British Politics Jeremy Corbyn's ascent to the leadership of the Labour Party has undoubtedly altered the course of British politics, with long-lasting implications. His decidedly left-leaning policy platform offers a salient alternative to the centre-right policies of the Conservative Party, presenting British voters with a clear and distinct choice. Corbyn's popular support has also reinvigorated the Labour Party, inspiring new membership and participation at a time when trust in the political establishment has waned. In conclusion, the election of Jeremy Corbyn as the leader of the Labour Party ushers in a new era for British politics. Breaking away from the centrist approach of his predecessors, Corbyn's uncompromising commitment to socialist values, social justice, and fair policies for all resonates with a multitude of Labour supporters and presents a distinct alternative for the British electorate. While challenges lie ahead for Corbyn and his supporters, the impact of his leadership on the Labour Party and British politics as a whole has already been profound."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In London Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street, where the firm of Broadwood provided him with a grand piano.

The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea (£1.05 in present British currency) per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: President Donald Trump's approval rating has headed into unfamiliar territory in recent weeks — upward. Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

Question: What were the organizations that dyers gathered in called? Context: There were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in Venice and other large Europeans cities. The Rubia plant was used to make the most common dye; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans. For the wealthy, the dye used was Kermes, made from a tiny scale insect which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree. For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal; also known as Kermes vermilio or \\"Blood of Saint John\\", which was made from a related insect, the Margodes polonicus. It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes. The finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the \\"Kermes\\" of Armenia (Armenian cochineal, also known as Persian kirmiz), made by collecting and crushing Porphyophora hamelii, an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses. The pigment and dye merchants of Venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color, called Venetian red, which was considered the most expensive and finest red in Europe. Its secret ingredient was arsenic, which brightened the color. Answer:","completion":"The organizations that dyers gathered in were called guilds of dyers.

Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as \\"usurious\\" loans) between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The answer to your question is \\"financial services\\". This is because England, France, and even parts of Germany are identified as locations where expulsions of Jewish people occurred in history, based on the information provided. On the other hand, \\"financial services\\" is not a geographical location, but rather an industry or a field of economic activity that Jewish people were actively involved in, according to the historical context provided. To elaborate, \\"financial services\\" refers to the economic services provided by the finance industry, which encompasses a broad range of businesses that manage money, including credit unions, banks, credit-card companies, insurance companies, accountancy companies, consumer-finance companies, stock brokerages, investment funds, and some government-sponsored enterprises. The extract you provided explains that during the period of the Crusades and the ensuing expulsions of Jewish communities from England, France, and parts of Germany, Jewish migration pushed eastward into Poland, Lithuania, and Russia. During this time, Jewish economic activities were concentrated largely in trade, business management, and financial services. Factors that might have contributed to this concentration include prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, laws preventing certain financial transactions between Christians, high literacy rates among Jewish communities, universal education for males, and the ability of Jewish merchants to rely on family members in different regions and countries. Thus, to answer your question, \\"financial services\\" is not a location where the expulsions of Jewish people occurred as it's not a geographic location at all. It is a sector where Jewish people have traditionally been involved, especially during and following the periods of expulsions mentioned.

Aim for early winter to avoid the flowering period, but pruning in late winter is also acceptable, as long as the plant does not have any new growth. Pruning in the winter also tends to increase flowering in the following years because the branches can heal completely before blooming.

Given the following context: Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art.

He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral.

The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir.

On September 11, 2001, Oskar and his classmates are sent home from school early while his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) is at work. When Oskar gets home, he finds five messages from his father on the answering machine saying he is in the World Trade Center. When Thomas calls for the sixth time, although Oskar is present to answer this call, he is too scared to answer. The machine records a sixth message which stops when the building collapses. Oskar knows his father has been killed and falls to the floor. He replaces the answering machine with a new one and hides the old one so his mother will never find out. A few weeks after what Oskar calls \\"the worst day,\\" he confides in his German grandmother and they become closer. Oskar's relationship with his mother worsens since she cannot explain why the World Trade Center was attacked and why his father died. Oskar tells his mother he wishes it had been her in the building, not his father, and she responds, \\"So do I\\". After, Oskar says he did not mean it, but his mother doesn't believe him. A year later, Oskar finds a vase in his father's closet with a key in an envelope with the word \\"Black\\" on it. He vows to find what the key fits. He finds 472 Blacks in the New York phone book and plans to meet each of them to see if they knew his father. He first meets Abby Black (Viola Davis), who has recently divorced her husband. She tells Oskar she did not know his father. One day, Oskar...

Answer:","completion":"Taramosalata is a traditional Greek dish made from salted and cured fish roe mixed with bread crumbs, lemon juice, onions, and garlic. This appetizer dates back centuries in Greek cuisine and is served as a dip or spread, often accompanied by pita bread, crackers, or raw vegetables. Taramosalata is revered for its rich, flavorful taste that combines the salty, briny essence of the fish roe with the tangy zest of fresh lemon and the subtle notes of garlic and onion. To make taramosalata, the key ingredient used is fish roe, commonly obtained from carp, cod, or grey mullet, known as taramá in Greek. The roe is salted and preserved, which helps to intensify its distinctive flavor. The choice of bread crumbs or, in some cases, mashed potatoes acts as a binding agent to ensure a smooth and consistent texture. Traditional recipes call for stale or day-old bread with the crusts removed, though contemporary variations might use fresh bread for a lighter, fluffier result. The process of making taramosalata begins with soaking the bread in water to soften it. Following this, it's important to thoroughly squeeze out any excess water. The fish roe is then mixed with the softened, moist bread, along with finely minced or grated onions and garlic cloves. A steady drizzle of olive oil is added while the ingredients are mixed, providing a silky and smooth consistency. The olive oil also enhances the taste, as it imparts a mild, fruity undertone to the dish. Lemon juice adds a burst of citrus flavor and acidity, which helps to balance the saltiness of the fish roe. Freshly squeezed lemon juice is preferable, as it imparts the most authentic and vibrant flavor. The entire mixture is then blended or beaten until it achieves a creamy, spreadable consistency. Taramosalata is typically refrigerated and allowed to rest for a few hours before serving, to give all the flavors an opportunity to meld and develop. Once served, it is often garnished with an olive or a sprig of parsley and presented in a small dish or bowl. The dish is a popular choice as a meze (an assortment of small appetizers or dishes) in Greek cuisine, and can be found in many Greek homes and restaurants, particularly during Lent when traditional religious practices restrict the consumption of meat and dairy products. Taramosalata's satisfying and savory taste makes it not just an iconic culinary delight, but also a staple in festive gatherings and social occasions in Greece and among those fond of Greek cuisine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Father was in the army all through the First World War, so up to the age of five, I never saw much of him, and what I saw did not worry me. Sometimes I woke and there was a big figure looking down at me. Sometimes in the early morning I heard the closing of the front door and the sound of shoes walking down. These were father's entrances and exits. Each time he went away, he left me lots of presents--model tanks, knives and all sorts of military equipment which he put in a long box. When he was not there, mother let me get a chair and search through his treasures. She did not seem to think so highly of them as he did. The war was the most peaceful period of my life. Every morning I awoke as soon as it was light and felt myself to be like the sun. Life never seemed so simple and clear and full of possibilities as then. I got up, went into mother's room and climbed into the big bed. She woke and I began to tell her of my plans. I talked but then fell asleep and woke again only when I heard her below in the kitchen, making the breakfast. I often wondered what mother and I should do all day and what present I would get for Christmas. There was that little problem of the baby, for example. Mother and I could never agree about that. Ours was the only house in the street without a new baby, and mother said we could not buy one until father came back from the war as they were very expensive. That showed how simple she was. The Geneys who lived nearby had a baby, and everybody knew that they had hardly any money at all. Maybe it was a cheap baby, and mother wanted something really good, but I felt this did not really matter. The Geneys' baby would have been fine for us.

Inside DreamNet, users can access different realms, each filled with opportunities to interact through vivid simulations and socialize with others - a lifeline to people during a time of strict government-imposed isolation due to a global pandemic. The protagonist, John Walker, is an ex-hacker and computer expert who has made a successful career creating realms within DreamNet, some of them for the government and deep-pocket enterprises. John becomes suspicious about a mysterious realm, \\"The Abyss,\\" which nobody seems to have access to or knowledge of but is rumoured to have monumental consequences on the real world. Intrigued by the forbidden nature and hidden secrets of the realm, John ventures into The Abyss, only to find himself trapped in a seemingly inescapable simulation that defies all known rules of the DreamNet. The world around John seems to bend and twist, causing his perception of time to become unreliable. \\"Has John only been hanging in the net (the DreamNet) for a few minutes, or has it been hours?\\" he wonders. Despite his skills and expertise, the simulation adapts to any effort he makes to escape, creating an endless loop of confusion and obliteration of his sense of reality. Along the way, John encounters other trapped users who have been lured into The Abyss. Together, they form a group to find a way out, all the while discovering terrifying secrets behind the simulation's purpose, which ties into a global conspiracy between powerful corporations and high-ranking government officials. Their goal is to use the DreamNet to gain total control over the human population by making people unable to discern the virtual world from the real world, hence creating subjects that are easy to manipulate and control. As John and his group dig deeper, they collect pieces of a puzzle that reveals the key to their escape lies at the heart of the simulation, a place called the \\"Core Nexus.\\" However, the closer they get to the Core Nexus, the more dangerous and surreal their experiences become, ultimately pushing each member to confront their deepest fears and vulnerabilities. In a climactic race against time, John and his team battle their way through The Abyss, cracking the code that would both grant them freedom and expose the sinister plot that lies beneath the DreamNet. They reach the Core Nexus and disable The Abyss, causing the entire realm and its simulations to come crashing down. Upon disconnecting from the DreamNet, John reports his findings to the authorities and exposes the conspiracy. The government and corporations involved are brought to justice, and preventative measures are taken, ensuring that no other similar atrocity can ever happen again. While the world braces itself in a collective gasp of shock, John begins his journey to rebuild his life and reconnect with reality - a reality that will never be quite the same after the abyss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The already remarkable life of Holocaust survivor George Horner is about to take another exceptional turn. The 90-year-old pianist will make his orchestral debut with renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma tonight at Boston's Symphony Hall. They'll be playing music composed 70 years ago at the Nazi prison camp where Horner was imprisoned. Remarkable: Dr George Horner will perform songs composed in the Nazis concentration camps. 'It's an extraordinary link to the past,' said concert organizer Mark Ludwig. The performance will benefit the Terezin Music Foundation, an organisation dedicated to preserving the work of artists and musicians killed in the Holocaust. Led by Ludwig, the foundation is named for the town of Terezin, site of an unusual Jewish ghetto in what was then German-occupied Czechoslovakia. There, even amid death and hard labor, Nazi soldiers allowed prisoners to stage artistic performances. Horner played piano and accordion in the Terezin cabarets, including tunes written by fellow inmate Karel Svenk. On Tuesday, Horner will play two of Svenk's works solo — a march and a lullaby — and then team up with Ma for a third piece called 'How Come the Black Man Sits in the Back of the Bus?' Memories: Dr George Horner performs a song on the piano at his home in Newtown Square, Philadelphia. Legacy: Horner agreed to do the performance which he described as a 'noble' mission. Svenk did not survive the genocide. But his musical legacy has, due in part to a chance meeting of Ludwig, a scholar of Terezin composers, and Horner, who never forgot the songs that were written and played in captivity. George Horner will join Yo-Yo Ma tonight at Boston's Symphony Hall. Ludwig said he found it hard to ask Horner to perform pieces laden with such difficult memories. 'To ask somebody who played this in the camps, that's asking a lot,' said Ludwig. Yet Horner, now a retired doctor living near Philadelphia, readily agreed to what he described as a 'noble' mission. It didn't hurt that he would be sharing the stage with Ma — even if he thought Ludwig was joking at first. 'I couldn't believe it, because it's a fantastic thing for me.' The program features additional performances by Ma and the Hawthorne String Quartet. In a statement, Ma said he's glad the foundation is 'giving voice through music to those whose voices have been tragically silenced.' Horner was 21 when he was freed by Allied soldiers in 1945 after serving time at Terezin, Auschwitz and Buchenwald. His parents and sister perished in the camps. Although his back still bears the scars of a Nazi beating, he remains sprightly and seems much younger than his 90 years. When Horner found out about the duet with Ma, Ludwig said, 'he was so excited, to me he sounded like a teenager.'

The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) experienced fluctuations in its performance showcasing the resilience and weaknesses inherent in a diverse market. The mixed closing was attributed to various sectors in which some stocks experienced gains while others suffered losses. It is essential to shed light on the primary reasons behind such a market performance. Firstly, the ongoing global health crisis has impacted Malaysia's economy significantly, like many other countries. The sudden imposition of lockdowns to curb the virus spread has slowed down businesses and disrupted supply chains. These circumstances eventually led to job losses, company closures, and consequently affected the consumer purchasing power and confidence in the stock market. As a result, the pandemic directly hindered the consistent growth of the Malaysia stock market. Secondly, geopolitical tensions brewing between major world powers have created uncertainty and apprehension among investors. Trade wars and sanctions significantly affect global economies, and Malaysia is no exception. As the nation's exports are predominantly dependent on stable international relations, the recent trade wars between China and the United States have raised concerns for those invested in Malaysia's stock market. Consequently, the ongoing tensions contribute to the mixed stock market closing as fluctuations are inevitable in such a volatile environment. Thirdly, the Malaysia stock market is profoundly affected by the fluctuations in oil prices. The country is an oil exporter and possesses massive offshore oil reserves. Recent shocks to the global oil market, including the price war between OPEC+ members and reduced oil demand due to the pandemic, have led to uncertainty. Investors in the energy sector become vulnerable to the unpredictable oil market, impacting the stock market performance in Malaysia. However, Malaysia's resilient economy has been able to withstand many challenges over time, and that's evident with some stocks experiencing gains. A variety of factors contribute to the strength exhibited by specific sectors. The country's diverse economy, which consists of numerous industries, such as palm oil production, electronics, automotive, and finance, allows for some growth even in challenging times. As some sectors slow down, others might present new opportunities, enticing investors to capitalize in that particular area. In addition, Malaysia's strategic location in the Southeast Asia region, its well-established infrastructure, and skilled labor force make it an attractive destination for foreign investors. The investments by multinational corporations in several sectors can act as a cushion against significant economic downturns. Thus, these investments may inject life into the already-volatile stock market, ultimately resulting in mixed stock performance. Moreover, the Malaysian government's proactive approach to tackling economic concerns has been relatively successful in mitigating the adverse effects of these challenges. Various stimulus packages and financial support measures have been implemented to assist struggling businesses and households, which in turn, has sparked a slight consumer and investor confidence restoration. This optimism is well reflected in the stock market, with certain stocks showcasing positive gains. In conclusion, Malaysia's stock market mixed closing serves as a microcosm of the current economic landscape's complexity and challenges that investors must navigate. The market reflects both the adverse impacts of the ongoing pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and oil market fluctuations and the economic resilience and various factors that contribute to steady performances across certain sectors. The mixed closing indicates that investors should be cautious and keep an eye on all aspects while considering their investment options in the Malaysian market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms. The answer is:","completion":"Title: Frustrating, buggy, and disappointing: com.google.android.gms Review: I rarely leave app reviews, but my experience with com.google.android.gms has been so unfortunate that I feel compelled to share my thoughts with others. If I could rate this app a zero, I would – but unfortunately, the scale begins at one star. I downloaded this app with positive expectations, mostly due to the fact that it is developed by a reputable company like Google. However, it did not take long for me to realize that this app is nowhere near Google's usual standard of excellence. To put it simply, com.google.android.gms is a buggy, confusing, and exasperating app that leaves users utterly disappointed. First and foremost, the app's interface is far from intuitive. I had a very hard time navigating through its various features and struggled to find specific settings or options that I needed. The layout appears cluttered and haphazard, causing significant frustration whenever I attempted to use the app. And while I understand that every app has a learning curve, the complexity of com.google.android.gms seemed entirely unwarranted – there is nothing groundbreaking or innovative about its offerings or capabilities. Moreover, the app is riddled with bugs and crashes frequently. On multiple occasions, I experienced sudden freezes and unresponsiveness, leading me to force quit the app and restart it, only to encounter the same issues all over again. These constant disruptions began to feel borderline unbearable – I shouldn't need to wait several minutes for an app to load a simple function or suffer through endless crashes and freezes. The developers behind com.google.android.gms have clearly neglected to test it thoroughly, as it should not have been released in such a dysfunctional state. To make matters worse, the app's performance has noticeably degraded my device's battery life. I observed a sharp decline in battery life ever since I installed com.google.android.gms, and removal of the app has resulted in the return of my device's normal battery life. It is unacceptable for an app to sap away my device's power and hinder its overall performance, especially when the app itself fails to provide any significant benefits or improvements to my daily routine. Customer support has been equally disappointing, as my attempts to contact the team behind the app have led nowhere. Emails have gone unanswered, and forums and social media pages seem to be filled with similar complaints. It is a true shame that users who rely on this app – or those like myself who were initially excited about its potential – are left without any meaningful assistance, forced to navigate the app's various issues independently. In short, com.google.android.gms has been a deeply frustrating and exasperating experience for me. Its user interface is counterintuitive, the app is plagued by bugs and crashes, and it has negatively affected my device's performance. While I had hoped that the app could enhance my daily tasks, it has instead become a source of irritation. I would strongly urge users to avoid com.google.android.gms and search elsewhere for an app that meets a higher standard of quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The premise states that beaches tend to be smaller and are located in bays rather than long stretches of shoreline. This information provides us with an understanding of the geographical characteristics of these beaches. However, this premise does not provide enough information to definitively support or reject the hypothesis about the small beaches drawing crowds of tourists every year. Tourism can be influenced by various factors, such as accessibility, surrounding environment, safety, cleanliness, available tourist amenities and activities, among others. Smaller beaches located in bays could potentially attract tourists due to a more intimate setting and sheltered waters providing a safer environment for swimming, snorkeling, and other sea-based activities. These beaches might be popular due to their beauty, unique flora and fauna, or fascinating geological features. On the other hand, the small size of these beaches might not be able to accommodate large crowds of tourists, making it less attractive for visitors seeking a more spacious environment. In addition, being located in bays might imply that these beaches are more secluded and less accessible, which could deter some tourists.

It consists of cells, and the cell walls are composed of micro-fibrils of cellulose (40% – 50%) and hemicellulose (15% – 25%) impregnated with lignin (15% – 30%).\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"Certainly! The main difference between wood cells and human cells lies in their composition, structure, and functions. Let's break it down based on the information you provided and by comparing these aspects. 1. Composition: Wood cells: Wood is composed of cells with cell walls made of micro-fibrils of cellulose (40% – 50%) and hemicellulose (15% – 25%) impregnated with lignin (15% – 30%). These components are all complex organic polymers that provide structural support and rigidity for the plant. The cellulose and hemicellulose micro-fibrils are embedded in a matrix of lignin, which acts to bind these fibers together. Human cells: Human cells consist of a plasma membrane made primarily of a lipid bilayer, while the cell wall is absent. The interior of the cell, called the cytoplasm, contains various organelles, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus, which all play different roles in cellular processes. Human cells also contain a cytoskeleton made of protein filaments, like actin and tubulin, to maintain the cell shape and facilitate movement. 2. Structure: Wood cells: Wood cells exhibit elongated, tubular structures known as tracheids, which play a role in water transport and structural support. There are also specialized cells like fibers for support and parenchyma cells for storage and metabolic functions in the wood. Generally, wood cells are much longer than they are wide, and their cell walls are thick to provide mechanical strength. Human cells: Human cells display a diverse range of shapes and structures, depending on their function. For example, neurons have long axons for transmitting signals across long distances, muscle cells are elongated for contraction, and red blood cells have a biconcave shape for gas exchange. The plasma membrane of human cells is flexible and allows for alterations in shape during various functions or processes. 3. Functions: Wood cells: The primary function of wood cells is to provide support and structure to the plant, as well as facilitate the transport of water and nutrients from the roots to other parts of the plant. Moreover, some wood cells may be involved in storage and metabolic activities. Human cells: Human cells perform a wide range of functions, including growth, reproduction, metabolism, movement, signaling, and immune response, among others. Each cell type has specialized functions and works together with other cells in a coordinated manner to maintain overall organism health and homeostasis. In summary, the main difference between wood cells and human cells lies in their composition, structure, and functions. Wood cells have cell walls made of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin to provide support and rigidity, whereas human cells have a flexible plasma membrane and a variety of organelles to perform diverse biological functions. Wood cells are primarily involved in structural support and water transport in plants, while human cells carry out numerous specialized tasks that maintain the health and well-being of the organism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Running around, throwing balls, and ducking to avoid getting hit were all part of the excitement. Now, as adults, it can be easy to forget the simple joys that came from participating in this classic game. But believe it or not, dodgeball is making a comeback - and not just for kids. It's becoming increasingly popular as a fun and engaging team building exercise for organizations, as well as a recreational activity among friends. In this article, we'll share the rules of the game and explain why it's such a great activity for fostering teamwork, communication, and camaraderie. The Rules of Dodgeball Before we dive into the benefits of dodgeball, let's review the basic rules and guidelines to keep in mind. The following is a simple summary of how to play the game: 1. Gather 3 or more people per team. You can have as many players as you'd like, but remember that the more players you have, the higher the level of intensity and excitement. A good starting point is to form teams of equal sizes. 2. Arrange 1 or more balls at the center of the court. You can use as many balls as you prefer, but a good rule of thumb is one ball for each pair of players (e.g., six people = three balls). This helps prevent monopolization of the balls by a few players and encourages every team member to get involved. 3. Set a timer for 10 minutes. This is a flexible rule and you can adjust the time limit based on your preference and the skill level of the participants. But setting a timer adds an urgency to the game, encouraging fast-paced, energetic play. 4. When play begins, have each team rush to the balls at the center of the court. This adds an element of competition right from the start and gets everyone moving quickly. 5. Throughout the game, players must try to dodge balls thrown by the opposing team. If a player is hit by a ball, they're \\"out\\" and must leave the playing area. 6. Players can throw balls at the opposing team's players in an attempt to get them out. Catching a ball thrown by an opponent means the thrower is out and may also allow a previously eliminated team member to re-enter the game (depending on your specific rules). 7. The team that wins is the one that successfully tags out all of the opposing team's players. Why Dodgeball Is a Great Team Building Exercise Now that we've gone over the basic rules, let's discuss why dodgeball is such an effective team building exercise: 1. Encourages teamwork and communication: Since the main objective is to eliminate the opposing team, it's important for players to work together in order to succeed. This means communicating effectively about strategy, alerting teammates to potential threats, and even coordinating throws to increase the chances of hitting an opponent. 2. Develops trust and camaraderie: In any team-based activity, trust between teammates is crucial. As players work together to dodge and throw balls, they develop a deeper sense of trust in each other's abilities. Sharing a common goal and celebrating successes together can also help build camaraderie and friendship among team members. 3. Promotes physical fitness: Dodgeball isn't just about having fun - it's also a fantastic way to get some exercise. With all the running, dodging, and throwing involved, players will undoubtedly work up a sweat and improve their overall fitness levels. 4. Relieves stress: Like any physical activity, dodgeball can help relieve stress. Playing a competitive game can help boost endorphins and provide players with a much-needed break from the usual routine. 5. Appeals to all skill levels: One of the greatest things about dodgeball is that it can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. Even those who aren't athletically inclined can still participate and have fun. Conclusion Dodgeball is no longer just a nostalgic game reserved for schoolchildren.

The department of geriatrics conducted a study on two groups of people, group V composed of people above 65 years old, and group W which had people under 65 and many under 60 years old. They were studying the effects on aging on the human body. Which group had more people with risk of pneumonia? Answer:","completion":"To determine which group had more people with the risk of pneumonia, we need to analyze the characteristics of the groups and consider any available data or information provided. Step 1: Identifying the pertinent factors in the two groups Group V contains people above 65 years old, while group W has individuals under 65 and many under 60 years old. As the study concerns the effects of aging on the human body, it is crucial to acknowledge the factor of age in relation to the risk of pneumonia. Step 2: Understanding the relationship between age and pneumonia risk Research has shown that older adults, particularly those above the age of 65, are more susceptible to pneumonia. This increased vulnerability is due to various factors, such as declining immunity, decreased lung function, and the presence of other underlying health conditions. Step 3: Comparing the risk of pneumonia in the two groups Given that group V consists of individuals exclusively above 65 years old and group W comprises people under the age of 65 and many under 60, it is reasonable to assume that the older adults in group V would generally exhibit a greater risk of pneumonia due to the factors mentioned above. Conclusion: Based on the information provided and the known relationship between age and pneumonia risk, it seems likely that group V, composed of people above 65 years old, had more people with the risk of pneumonia than group W, which had individuals under 65 and many under 60 years old. However, it is essential to remember that other factors can also contribute to pneumonia risk and a more comprehensive analysis of the study's data would provide a clearer answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When the whale-watching boat Leviathan II capsized near Tofino with 27 people aboard, the waters over much of Clayoquot Sound were glassy smooth and a strong breeze was blowing. In the aftermath of the tragedy, which left five dead and one missing, people have been asking why a 20-metre boat, under the control of a veteran skipper, would roll over so suddenly in such moderate sea conditions. In a news conference on Tuesday, Marc-André Poisson, director of marine investigations for the Transportation Safety Board, said the vessel “broached and then capsized” when most of the passengers were gathered on the top deck, port side. “This would have raised the centre of gravity affecting the vessel’s stability. We also know that the sea conditions were such that a wave approached the vessel from the starboard quarter,” he said, although he did not suggest the wave was exceptionally large. A flurry of media reports have said a “rogue wave” came out of nowhere on Sunday and tipped over the tour boat, which Jamie’s Whaling Station and Adventure Centres has run for the past 20 years on the same route without incident. The rogue-wave theory, which has made headlines around the world, appears to be speculation based largely on the comments of one of the rescuers, Peter Frank Jr. “One of [the survivors] told me … they saw this real big wave coming – bigger than the rest of the big rollers. They said it picked the boat off and it fell off the wave, it started tumbling,” he said. The term “rogue wave” commonly means a massive wall of water (the largest recorded globally have been more than 18 metres high), but it can be used to describe any extreme wave that is three times the size of the average wave height on a given day. Researchers at San Francisco State University in 2009 reported that about three waves in every 10,000 are extreme, but that frequency can increase to three in every 1,000 “in a focal zone” where a feature such as a reef concentrates energy. Fishermen and fishing guides who were on the water on Sunday did not report seeing any huge waves, but they say the area’s intricate pattern of tides and winds can produce dangerous conditions in localized spots. Steve Lawson, who lives year-round on Wickaninnish Island and travels on the waters of Clayoquot Sound almost daily, said that Plover Reef, where the accident occurred, can be such a location. It lies on the outer coast and is exposed to the big, steady waves, known as rollers, that come in from the open Pacific. “It’s a tricky spot,” he said. Mr. Lawson said after the accident he has heard people describe Sunday’s water conditions as both calm and rough, depending where they were. “It is unpredictable,” he said of the sea. “The big waves can come [any time] … and if you are in relatively shallow water, you know around reefs and things, it can be a problem.” Chris McCue, who leads whale-watching tours for Jamie’s Whaling Station, but was not working on Sunday, said the Leviathan II had been “running absolutely perfect” and Plover Reef is a routine stop for Tofino whale-watching boats. “It’s a place we all go, every day,” he said. Doug Palfrey, who runs the Tofino Salmon Enhancement Society, keeps a close watch on the tides and the weather because he has to cross Clayoquot Sound regularly to get to the streams he works on. He was on the water the day of the accident. “It was glassy calm,” he said. But Mr. Palfrey said the tide was going out at the time of the accident, and outflowing water would have been colliding with incoming rollers at Plover Reef. “Whenever you get a tide pushing against an incoming swell, even when it’s calm, your sea heights jump,” he said. “There’s a lot of things at play, swells rebounding off reefs and changing direction into the oncoming swell. You get all those shallows [around Plover Reef] and, ugh.” According to Environment Canada, wind speed at Tofino was 4-10 knots on Sunday, which means a gentle breeze with scattered whitecaps. A weather buoy at La Perouse Bank, 30 kilometres offshore of Tofino, showed winds as high as 22 knots, which is six on the Beaufort scale and strong enough to form large waves. Parks Canada, which manages Pacific Rim National Park Reserve near Tofino, issued a wave hazard rating of “high” on Sunday, which meant waves of one to three metres. One of those waves hit the Leviathan II. Report Typo/Error ||||| A freak wave that struck as sightseers crowded to one side of the top deck caused the sinking of a Canadian whale-watching vessel, killing five Britons and an Australian near Vancouver Island, investigators have said. Canada’s transportation safety board said that after questioning some of the 21 survivors, including three crew, it had initially concluded that the Leviathan II sank on Sunday after it was hit by a wave when most of the passengers were gathered on the top deck watching sea lions. Whale boat disaster: 'people opened their homes for the survivors' Read more “We know that most passengers were on the top deck on the port side,” said Marc-André Poisson, the board’s director of marine investigations. “This would have raised the centre of gravity, affecting the vessel’s stability. We also know that the sea conditions were such that a wave approached from the starboard quarter ... We know that the vessel broached and then capsized.” Earlier in the day the British Columbia coroner said that all of those killed had been standing on the open top deck of the 20-metre long vessel, which had sailed from the small resort town of Tofino on a routine sightseeing trip. Poisson stressed they were early findings and final conclusions could take months. “None of this preliminary information should be used in isolation to draw any conclusions at this point,” he said. However, the speed at which the transportation safety board reached its initial assessment suggests it has little doubt about the cause of the tragedy. Local fishermen and others who work on the seas around Tofino had already reached a similar conclusion, saying that a wave appeared the most likely explanation. The board’s announcement will raise questions about the design of the vessel, which had two decks for better viewing and a relatively shallow draft. The Leviathan II’s owner, Jamie Bray, said it had made the same trip every day for 20 years without incident and the skipper had 18 years’ experience. The transportation safety board’s announcement came a few hours after the coroner released the names of the five Britons who were killed. Stephen Thomas of Swindon was the youngest of the victims. Aged just 18, with Down’s syndrome, he had been indulging his passion for photography when the sinking claimed his life. Stephen’s father, David, died with him. The 50-year-old, a committed Christian who worked for Microsoft, was described as a “huge supporter” by the Down’s Syndrome Association, which also said Stephen Thomas “was a very talented young man and a gifted photographer” who won a national competition with a picture of a lake. Fifth British victim in whale boat disaster named Read more The Swindon Advertiser quoted Stephen’s brother, Paul, as saying that their mother, Julie, survived the ordeal with minor injuries and was in hospital. Paul Thomas was travelling to Canada to be with her. The eldest of the victims was Jack Slater, 76, who was originally from Salford but settled in Toronto. His daughter, Michele Slater Brown, said on her Facebook page that “our hearts are broken today”. “Our dad was larger than life – a charmer, handsome, entrepreneur, engineer in the Navy, he was 76 years old, he was our dad, our lovely dad, I will miss him forever but I’m grateful for all the times I spent with him, I love you dad,” she wrote. Slater was on board the Leviathan II with his wife Marjorie, who was rescued and taken to hospital. The fourth victim named was 29-year-old Katie Taylor who was born in the UK but resided in Whistler, a Canadian ski resort. The fifth victim was named as Nigel Hooker, 63, from Southampton. On Tuesday police resumed their search for a sixth person, a 27-year-old Australian man from Sydney. It was believed he had been travelling with his girlfriend who was the daughter of one of the Britons who died. Matt Brown, coroner for the island region of British Columbia, said none of the five who died had been wearing lifejackets, although they were available. “Lifejackets were on board. I believe that this vessel can occupy up to 50 individuals. There were 27 on board and there were lifejackets available for all of them,” he said. The British consul general in Vancouver, Rupert Potter, went to Tofino to assist survivors who lost relatives. He described the response of the community as “really remarkable”. “What always strikes me in these situations is the bravery that people show, and that’s definitely been the case here – how they manage to continue coping when they’ve had such loss,” he said. Potter, who also visited survivors in hospital, said loved ones were travelling to the town from the UK.. The premier of British Columbia, Christy Clark, visited the town on Tuesday and praised the rescue effort led by fishermen from an indigenous community of the Ahoushat First Nation a few miles to the north. “More lives would have been lost if not for the Ahoushat First Nation. We’re all incredibly grateful,” she said. Although there was not time for a distress call before the boat sank, one of the crew found a flare in the water and fired it. It was spotted by fishermen who raised the alarm by radio and then set off to rescue survivors. The radio call was also picked up in Tofino from where boats also put to sea. Among the first on the scene was Clarence Smith, from the Ahoushat First Nation, who found the vessel mostly underwater with just its bow still above the waves, held up by trapped air. “We saw three people in the water. One guy was clinging to the boat so we picked him first. Then I heard these voices. There were two ladies in the water clinging to each other,” he said. Smith said one of the women was pregnant and another person had a broken leg. The rescuers described people covered in diesel fuel and injured from being thrown against steel bulkheads as the sightseeing boat turned over. Ken Lucas was working with Smith. He said one of the people they rescued was a member of the crew who said the boat had been hit by a wave. Fishermen described a heavy swell in the area during the rescue. Francis Campbell, driving a water taxi, was also early on the scene. He pulled eight survivors from the frigid water. “It’s something you really can’t describe. It’s going to be held with me for the rest of my life,” he said. The flare was also spotted by Peter Frank, who rescued people clinging to a life raft that had run on to rocks. “There was this one guy saying: ‘My wife, my wife. She doesn’t know how to swim. She isn’t a great swimmer,’” he told CBC. “Some of them, when they hopped on the boat, it was just a sense of relief … I did my best to reassure them, to tell them they’re OK.” About 30 boats responded to the rescue call alongside the Canadian coast guard. All 21 of the survivors had been picked up by the time the official vessels arrived. Ambulances met them on Tofino’s waterfront. The fishermen also brought the dead to shore. Survivors were taken to Tofino’s small hospital. But it soon became overwhelmed and so local residents began taking the less serious cases into their homes. Tofino’s mayor, Josie Osborne, praised the townspeople. “This community’s response has been nothing short of phenomenal,” she said. “People opened their homes to keep the survivors warm and comfort them.” ||||| Media caption Marine investigator: \\"It is much too early to say what the causes and contributing factors of this accident might be\\" A whale-watching boat which sank off the coast of Canada, killing five Britons, had no opportunity to send a Mayday call, its operator has said.

As well as interviewing survivors and other witnesses, the Transportation Safety Board will be looking into conditions on Sunday, as well as scouring the wreckage of the whale-watching boat for clues, and examining its maintenance history. The vessel, still submerged, has been towed from the scene to a nearby island so the work can begin. The weather at the time of the accident was reportedly benign but sailors familiar with these waters say powerful currents, rogue waves and rocks are all potential hazards, even when the conditions appear to be favourable. A lengthy investigation will be difficult for some to bear. Those touched by this tragedy may well want to know as soon as possible how this could have happened to the same tour operator for a second time. 'Amazing response' Greg Louie, chief councillor of the Ahousaht First Nation Elected Council, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that had the local community not responded to the accident so quickly \\"possibly everyone\\" could have drowned or died of hypothermia. The incident could have been \\"a lot worse\\", Lt Cmdr Desmond James of the Canadian Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre in British Columbia said. He added that 21 people would not have been rescued were it not for the \\"amazing response\\" by the local community. Three of the victims were tourists on holiday from the UK, while two were UK nationals living in Canada - one woman from British Columbia and a man from Ontario. Australian Associated Press reported the missing 27-year-old Sydney man was on the boat with his girlfriend and her family when it sank. His girlfriend's father was among the five Britons confirmed dead, the news agency said. Another whale-watching boat operated by Jamie's Whaling Station and Adventure Centre capsized in 1998, killing two people, including the boat operator and a tourist from Germany.

Given the question: Information: - Abraham de Moivre (26 May 166727 November 1754) was a French mathematician known for de Moivre's formula, one of those that link complex numbers and trigonometry, and for his work on the normal distribution and probability theory. He was a friend of Isaac Newton, Edmond Halley, and James Stirling. Even though he faced religious persecution he remained a \\"steadfast Christian\\" throughout his life. Among his fellow Huguenot exiles in England, he was a colleague of the editor and translator Pierre des Maizeaux. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Huguenots (or ) is a designation for an ethnoreligious group of French Protestants that follow the Reformed tradition. - A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions. - Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability, the analysis of random phenomena. The central objects of probability theory are random variables, stochastic processes, and events: mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in an apparently random fashion. - In mathematics , Stirling 's approximation ( or Stirling 's formula ) is an approximation for factorials . It is a very powerful approximation , leading to accurate results even for small values of n. It is named after James Stirling , though it was first stated by Abraham de Moivre . The formula as typically used in applications is ln ( n ! ) = n ln ( n ) - n + O ( ln ( n ) ) ( in big O notation ) . The next term in the O ( ln ( n ) ) is 1/2ln ( 2n ) ; a more precise variant of the formula is therefore n ! sim sqrt ( 2 pi n ) left ( frac ( n ) ( e ) right ) ^ n. It is also possible to give a version of Stirling 's formula with bounds valid for all positive integers n , rather than asymptotics : one has sqrt ( 2 pi ) n ^ ( n + frac12 ) e ^ ( - n ) le n ! le e n ^ ( n + frac12 ) e ^ ( - n ) for all positive integers n. Thus the ratio frac ( n ! ) ( n ^ ( n + frac12 ) e ^ ( - n ) ) is always between 2 = 2.5066 ... and e = 2.71828 ... . As an asymptotic formula , Stirling 's approximation has the property that the ratio frac ( n ! ) ( sqrt ( 2 pi n ) left ( frac ( n ) ( e ) right ) ^ n ) approaches 1 as n grows to infinity . - Trigonometry (from Greek \\"trignon\\", \\"triangle\\" and \\"metron\\", \\"measure\\") is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships involving lengths and angles of triangles. The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies. - Pierre des Maizeaux, also spelled Desmaizeaux (c. 1666 or 1673June 1745), was a French Huguenot writer exiled in London, best known as the translator and biographer of Pierre Bayle. - In mathematics, de Moivre's formula (also known as de Moivre's theorem and de Moivre's identity), named after Abraham de Moivre, states that for any complex number (and, in particular, for any real number) and integer it holds that - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. - Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework. - Sir Isaac Newton (25 December 1642 20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, astronomer, and physicist (described in his own day as a \\"natural philosopher\\") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book \\"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\\" (\\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\\"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus. - A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form , where and are real numbers and is the imaginary unit, satisfying the equation . In this expression, is the ' and is the ' of the complex number. If formula_1, then formula_2 - Quantity is a property that can exist as a magnitude or multitude. Quantities can be compared in terms of \\"more\\", \\"less\\", or \\"equal\\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. A small quantity is sometimes referred to as a quantulum. - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change.

Given the question: Besides Floyd, what does Rob find on the Japanese sub? Answer the above question based on the context below: While flying a routine mission for the U.S. Navy from his aircraft carrier, an emergency causes Lieutenant Robin \\"Rob\\" Crusoe to eject from his F-8 Crusader into the ocean. Crusoe drifts on the ocean in an emergency life raft for several days and nights until landing on an uninhabited island. Crusoe builds a shelter for himself, fashions new clothing out of available materials, and begins to scout the island, discovering an abandoned Japanese submarine from World War II. Scouring the submarine, Crusoe also discovers a NASA astrochimp named Floyd, played by Dinky.Using tools and blueprints found in the submarine, Crusoe and Floyd construct a Japanese pavilion, a golf course, and a mail delivery system for sending bottles containing missives to his fiancee out to sea. Soon after, Crusoe finds that the island is not entirely uninhabited when he encounters a beautiful island girl, whom he names Wednesday. Wednesday recounts that due to her unwillingness to marry, her chieftain father, Tanamashuhi, plans to sacrifice her and her sisters to Kaboona, an immense effigy on the island with whom he pretends to communicate. The day Tanamashu arrives on the island, Crusoe uses paraphernalia from the submarine to combat him, culminating in the destruction of the Kaboona statue. After the battle, Crusoe and Tanamashu make peace. But when Crusoe makes it known that he does not wish to marry Wednesday, he is forced to flee to avoid her wrath. Pursued by a mob of irate island women, Crusoe is spotted by a U.S. Navy helicopter and he and Floyd narrowly escape with their lives. Large crowds turn out for their arrival on an aircraft carrier deck, but Floyd steals all the limelight. The answer is:","completion":"Based on the context provided, besides Floyd, Rob finds tools, blueprints, and paraphernalia from the Japanese submarine during his exploration on the uninhabited island.

Summarize: You can wash any pillow by hand as long as the label doesn't say that it's dry clean only. Memory foam and latex pillows usually can't be washed by hand and you'll only be able to spot clean them. If you have a memory foam or latex pillow, it's important to use a zippered pillow protector in addition to a pillowcase. This will extend the life of the pillow. Pull the pillow out of the pillowcase or unzip it first to remove it from the pillow protector. You can usually toss the pillowcase or protector in the washing machine or wash it by hand along with the pillow. If the pillowcase is stained, you may need to pre-treat it before you wash it. If you're using a sink, ensure that it's big enough to hold the pillow. Run very hot water and then put the plug in the sink or bathtub. Turn off the water once it's half full. Hot water will kill dust mites that are living in the pillow. You can use a standard laundry detergent even if you'll be washing the pillow by hand. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of laundry detergent for each pillow into the hot water. Then use your hand to swirl the water around vigorously. This should make the water become bubbly. To make it easier to rinse the pillow, consider using low-sudsing laundry detergent. Put the pillow into the hot soapy water and press down so it absorbs water. Then use your hands to squeeze the pillow and massage the filling. Continue to do this for several minutes so the soapy water reaches the middle of the pillow. If the water is too hot or the soap irritates your skin, wear a pair of gloves. Remove the pillow and squeeze out the soapy water. Then hold it under a faucet with running water and squeeze the pillow once it feels soaked. Keep it under the water until the pillow doesn't feel soapy. Plan on rinsing the pillow for 1 to 2 minutes to completely remove the soap. Leaving soapy residue will stain the pillow and make it harder to dry. Turn off the water and squeeze the pillow with your hands. Then lay the wet pillow on a dry towel. Fold the towel over the pillow and press down to remove excess water. Although you can twist the pillow to get even more water out, you should avoid wringing out feather pillows since this will damage the feathers. the pillow in a dryer or hang it from a clothesline to air-dry. If you have a dryer and the care label on the pillow says to tumble dry it on low heat, put the pillow in the dryer. Add dryer balls to speed up the drying process and turn on the machine. If you don't have a dryer, clip the pillow to a clothesline that's in direct sunlight. Leave the pillow to hang until it's completely dry.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? The author believes that: Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. is bad luck B. plucking grey hairs helps easy feelings of being driven crazy by them C. not enough information D. will make you have bald spots","completion":"B. plucking grey hairs helps easy feelings of being driven crazy by them The beauty myth you're referring to is the belief that plucking a grey hair will cause more grey hairs to grow in its place. This is a common misconception and, as you've noted, is not based on any scientific evidence. Firstly, it's essential to understand why hair turns grey. Hair gets its color from melanin-producing cells called melanocytes, which are present in the hair follicles. As we age, these melanocytes gradually lose their ability to produce melanin, resulting in a decrease in hair color. When there is a complete loss of melanin in the hair shaft, it appears grey or white. This process of greying is natural, and its rate can vary depending on genetics, lifestyle, stress levels, and other factors. Now let's address the myth of plucking grey hairs. When you pluck a hair, you are only removing it from the hair follicle. This action does not affect the surrounding hair follicles or their ability to produce melanin. It also does not change the structure of the hair follicle to suddenly spawn multiple hairs in place of the one plucked. Therefore, plucking a grey hair will not cause seven more grey hairs to grow in its place. However, it's important to note that plucking hair can potentially damage the hair follicle, which may lead to hair growing back weaker, thinner, or not at all. In some cases, excessive plucking could contribute to the formation of bald spots or thinning hair. Still, this is related to the hair follicle's health and not the color of the hair. In conclusion, the notion that plucking a grey hair will cause more greys to grow in its place is a myth and should not deter you from removing them if it makes you feel better. However, it's essential to be gentle when plucking hairs and to consider alternative methods, such as coloring or trimming, if you find that you're plucking excessively to avoid causing potential damage to your hair follicles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If more teenagers die young, there are fewer people transitioning into adulthood. 4.

If your friend is feeling blue and calls you, what will you do? Here are some tips on how you can make her smile again. Listen to her. When people feel sad, they often have the feeling of needing to be heard. So, listen carefully to what she is saying and do nothing else. Your friend will surely thank you for being the shoulder she can cry on. Once you are done with listening, you can offer some advice or remain silent and let her feel everything and let it all out by crying. As a friend, you might think you should give her some advice. But if you have no idea about what to say, just remain silent and be there for her. In order to be able to help your friend in need, don't be sad for yourself. How can you help your friend when you are also feeling down? A hug can make a difference in the word. It makes you feel warm and special. A hug makes you feel safe. So give your friend a hug when she needs it the most. Spend more time with your friend who wants to be happy. Do things together like washing dishes, cleaning, or going out for fun. The more time you spend together, the stronger your friendship will become. Sometimes, it is much better that you avoid a crying friend in your life.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Appliqué is a method of design where one pattern is sewn top of another. You can buy applique templates from a craft store if you don't want to design your own. You can also find patterns in quilting books. If you use a quilt pattern, make sure you resize it when copying so that it fits your greeting card. To make a paper appliqué card, you will need the following: One 4.25 by 5.5 inches (10.8 cm × 14.0 cm) card blank Colored cardstock Decorative paper A fine-tip black marker Glue Scissors A ruler A pencil and eraser What kind of card are you making? If you're making a birthday card, you might consider making a card with a cake, or party hats. Try to customize the card to reflect the interests of who you are giving it to. Make a space scene with astronauts and planets, or make a card with cars and a racetrack. Make a card with snowmen for Christmas, turkeys for Thanksgiving, or clovers for St. Patrick's Day. Your only limit is your imagination. Pick three different patterns for your card. You'll need a pattern for the appliqué pieces, a pattern for the background, and a pattern for the card mat. Select a variety of solid colors and patterns. Depending on the complexity of your design, you may want to choose more than three types of decorative paper. Whatever you decide to go with, make sure all the colors and patterns match. For example, if you're making an underwater scene, pick a variety of blues for your solid colors. Choose patterns that mimic waves or fish scales. If you're following a template, trace the shapes on the back of the your decorative paper. If you're drawing your own shapes, draw them lightly in pencil on the back of the decorative paper. Once you're happy with the designs, cut out the shapes. Since you're working with paper, you won't actually be sewing anything. To give it an authentic appliqué look, take your fine-tip marker and add stitch marks around the border of the shapes. Choose a solid color for your card mat and cut it a little smaller than your card blank. It should almost cover the entire front of the card, but you should still see a little white border. To make the background, take a patterned piece of decorative paper and cut it to about 5 by 3.75 inches (12.7 cm × 9.5 cm). Using your fine-tip marker, add stitch marks to the background pattern. Glue the mat to the card. Remember to leave a small border of white from the card blank. Then, glue the background to the card mat. Once the card mat and the background are glued to the card blank, start arranging your shapes to build a scene. Take some time to make sure you have everything arranged where you want it. If you find that you need to add more shapes to flesh out your scene, grab more decorative paper and start cutting. Don't forget to add the stitch marks! Once everything is to your liking, glue your shapes down.","completion":"The article provides a step-by-step guide on creating a paper appliqué greeting card by selecting patterns and materials, cutting and arranging shapes, and giving an authentic appliqué appearance with stitch marks using a fine-tip marker."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely. Question: \\"Why did Bin Laden tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave Sudan?\\" Answer: \\"Because the Libyan government was not sheltering them anymore\\" Is this answer to the question correct? OPTIONS: (A). no; (B). yes;","completion":"(A). no The answer to the question is incorrect because it was the Sudanese government, not the Libyan government, that was no longer going to protect the Libyans in Bin Laden's Islamic army. The Sudanese government advised Bin Laden of their intention to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies, which is why Bin Laden told the Libyans they had to leave Sudan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This is my first official on-line review and I am charged with \\"electrical ecstasy\\" after having chosen \\"Meatball Machine\\" as my first endeavor. This is a review, so I'll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion. I mean, this is one creative piece of work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic TETSUO! So what if it's not all original? I own both of these films and though Tetsuo is one strange son of a bitch, Meatball Machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify film significance. Meatball Machine is as elaborate in it's story as it is in its high influx of blood and gore. Thank you Jesus for Japanese Cinema! Simply put, the last time my dreams were overrun by visions of horror happened after watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 7 or so. I could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a telephone for weeks on end. This time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring. In this film human bodies are host to Aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending quench for human flesh and blood. Humans become flesh eating cyborgs!!! There's more!!! Fight scenes!! Great Music!! Great point-of-view shots! Decent acting by the woman Cyborg (at least better than her male counterpart). The fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times. Oh, and did I forget to mention it's a Love story! Wow, I hate love stories but this takes the cake! I can't wait to have friends over to watch this film once more just to see the reaction on their faces. Sadly, I took time to write this review because I'm afraid most friends and family wont understand Meatball Machine. The truth is America as a whole is not prepared for Meatball Machine. Lastly, My wife walked in while I was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless. Normally she says something like \\"why are you watching that junk?\\" This time she had nothing to say. I was glad! This is not junk.

Earth II ,however, was much more conscious about the environment and protected it from anthropogenic changes. But I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. What is an answer for this question: Which planet caused more climate change? Answer:","completion":"Earth I caused more climate change due to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Write an article based on this summary: Plans to axe IVF treatment for new couples in part of Essex is an \\"insult\\" to those seeking fertility treatment, a patient body has said. Article:","completion":"Title: Axing IVF Treatment in Essex Sparks Outrage Among Fertility Patients Introduction Recent plans to terminate NHS-funded IVF treatment for new couples in parts of Essex have left numerous patients, campaigners, and medical professionals in the region frustrated and concerned. The decision, which many have deemed an \\"insult\\" to those looking for fertility aid, has led to an outcry among local patient bodies and has raised questions about the future of healthcare services in the UK. Background In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is a groundbreaking technique that has revolutionized reproductive medicine, offering a lifeline to many couples struggling with infertility. Since its development in the late 1970s, IVF has helped millions of people worldwide become parents, transforming countless lives in the process. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) has been offering subsidized or free IVF treatment for eligible couples for several decades, making this vital service accessible to a broad range of patients. However, the recent proposal in Essex to cut IVF funding for new couples seeking treatment has taken many by surprise and brought the conversation around access to fertility services back into the spotlight. This move has reignited debates on rationing healthcare services and raised concerns about the potentially detrimental effects on couples already facing emotional and physical challenges. Patients and Advocates in Essex Respond For many affected by this decision, the axing of IVF treatment in Essex is an \\"insult\\" to those maintaining hope of conceiving through medical intervention. The patient body in the region has made it abundantly clear that it feels let down by these proposed changes, fearing that countless residents will be impacted and left with no options for conceiving children. Healthcare professionals specializing in reproductive medicine have also added their voices to the mix, stating that cutting off access to an essential service like IVF is a backward step. Furthermore, they argue that the decision will likely result in higher levels of emotional distress among patients, adding to the increased mental health challenges witnessed throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Crunching the Numbers While it's difficult to predict the exact number of couples affected by this proposed cut, it's clear that a sizable portion of the Essex population stands to lose access to essential fertility services. The loss of this crucial treatment avenue may also disproportionately impact lower-income families, robbing them of the chance to become parents. This potential financial bias only heightens existing divides based on wealth, further limiting access to care for those struggling to make ends meet. The Broader Context Though it is still too early to tell whether the decision to axe IVF treatment in Essex is part of a wider trend, it does raise concerns about the future of fertility treatment and access to healthcare services more broadly. Around the globe, healthcare systems continue to face pressure from increasing populations, stretched budgets, and divergent expectations. The repercussions of limiting access to IVF and other fertility treatments are not limited to emotional stress, as they extend to social and economic consequences as well. If this trend continues, it could signal a shift toward more restricted access to healthcare, with untold implications for future generations. Conclusion The recent decision to terminate IVF treatment in Essex highlights the critical importance of equitable access to healthcare and the challenges many individuals face in securing essential medical support. As patients, advocates, and healthcare professionals push back against these proposed changes, the ongoing debate will no doubt remain a focal point of healthcare conversations in the UK and beyond. In the coming months and years, it will be crucial for stakeholders to work together to address the burgeoning crisis, balancing the need for cost efficiency with the obligation to provide accessible and quality care to those in need. The choice to axe IVF treatment in Essex serves as a stark reminder that, in an increasingly complex and globalized healthcare landscape, many difficult decisions lie ahead."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who is assumed to have attacked the professor's fiance?, using the article: The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer. As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Professor Kristan is assumed to have attacked the professor's fiance in an entranced state.

Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): Why did the Nicaraguans come to America?","completion":"The Nicaraguans came to America mainly due to political instability, economic hardship, and the search for a better life. Their migration began during the end of the 1970s and continued throughout the 1980s as a result of the following factors: 1. Political instability: The Sandinista revolution, which took place in 1979, toppled the Somoza dictatorship and left many Nicaraguans fearing for their safety and wellbeing. People who opposed the Sandinistas, the new ruling party, were particularly inclined to migrate in order to escape persecution and further conflict in their home country. 2. The Contra War: Throughout the 1980s, the United States supported the Contras, a rebel group fighting the Sandinista government. This counter-revolutionary war continued until 1988, with battles and skirmishes creating an atmosphere of danger, chaos, and insecurity for Nicaraguans. This, in turn, prompted many Nicaraguans to leave their homeland and seek refuge in safer countries, such as the United States. 3. Economic collapse: The persistent conflict and political instability in Nicaragua during the Sandinista era took a heavy toll on the country's economy. Inflation, unemployment, and dismal conditions led to a decline in the overall quality of life, ultimately driving many Nicaraguans to migrate in search of better opportunities and improved living conditions. In summary, Nicaraguans migrated to the United States primarily to escape the political instability and economic hardship that plagued their home country during the late 1970s and 1980s. They were seeking stability, safety, and improved opportunities by moving to states such as Florida, California, and Texas."},{"prompt":"What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who is hired by Cora and Nick? from the following article ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Ministers are considering applying for an exemption to European Union laws which prohibit electro-fishing. They have launched on consultation on the proposal. Razor clams - or spoots - are increasingly in demand by overseas markets and fishermen can command a high price for their catch. An environmental group said law enforcement agencies had \\"lost the battle\\" to stamp out illegal electro-fishing. And Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing admitted that Marine Scotland had found it difficult to clamp down on the activities of some fishermen. Mr Ewing said: \\"Electro-fishing is currently illegal in Scotland and Marine Scotland Compliance has taken a range of measures to tackle this illegal activity. \\"Enforcement has proved to be very difficult, and changes need to be made to either make it easier to enforce the current law or, if electro-fishing is to be legalised, to ensure any electro-fishing is undertaken safely and sustainably in a properly regulated environment. \\"As a result of this advice and extensive consultation with the industry, we have now decided to consult on proposals to amend the current law to allow electro-fishing to be a legal method for catching razor clams. \\"This is an issue that has evoked much interest and debate. This is why I would urge all those with an interest, in particular from fishermen and people in coastal communities where such fisheries might be conducted, to respond to the consultation.\\" The move comes after a report by Marine Scotland found that electro-fishing had a lower environmental impact than methods like dredging and it had little short-term effect on other species. As part of the practice of electro-fishing, electrodes shock razor fish in the seabed, causing them to rise up. At that point they are easily collected by divers. It is the \\"least worst option\\", according to RSPB Scotland. Alex Kinnimouth, the charity's head of marine policy in Scotland, said: \\"The status quo of an illegal, unregulated and unreported razor clam fishery is clearly unacceptable. \\"Marine Scotland and the police seem to have lost the battle to stamp it out and so there is a real risk that this highly efficient fishing method could cause 'spoots' to be wiped out in areas that are being repeatedly targeted. \\"Alternative capture methods such as dredging are highly disruptive to the seabed. \\"So on the basis of the most recent published research, a closely regulated fishery using electricity, perhaps on a pilot basis, with tight controls on method, quantity of catch, and where it can occur could be seen as the least worst option.\\" Food journalist and campaigner Alex Renton told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that he believed the practice was extremely dangerous. \\"When you put enormous voltages of electricity down on to beaches in Scotland, you can cause enormous damage. \\"And the reports say that the other fish - and of course beaches are where young fish grow - suffer epileptic fits, haemorrhages, their spines break.\\" High-profile chefs Andrew Fairlie and Tom Kitchin have also voiced their opposition to the \\"idiocy\\" of uncontrolled electro-fishing. In a letter published three years ago, they warned that, unless the practice was done very carefully, it could kill \\"nearly everything else in the vicinity\\" as well as the razor fish. The consultation was welcomed by the Scottish Conservatives whose fisheries spokesman, Finlay Carson, called for further scientific research into the sustainability of the razor clam beds. He added: \\"I also hope that every effort will be made to seek as many views and expert opinions as possible during the consultation. \\"It's imperative that the potential positive economic impact on coastal communities from razor clam fishing is founded on proper scientific research with sustainability as a primary concern.\\" The Scottish government has previously taken a hard line with fishermen caught using the technique. In May 2014, it announced tougher licensing measures in a bid to clamp down on the illegal practice. In the two years before that announcement, 11 vessels were issued with a fixed penalty of up to Â£2,000 for electro-fishing. Diver Graeme Mackie drowned during an electro-fishing expedition for razor clams in the Firth of Forth in 2011. Dunfermline Sheriff Court heard that there was no evidence that the electric current directly caused Mr Mackie's death. Skipper Ronald MacNeil was ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work after admitting safety failings.","completion":"Scotland is thinking about allowing electro-fishing for razor clams, even though it is illegal in the European Union. People want more razor clams from the sea, so fishermen can get good money for them. But some people say electro-fishing can hurt other sea animals, like breaking the spines of young fish. Scotland's government is asking people what they think about allowing electro-fishing, because it could be better than other ways of getting clams from the sea."},{"prompt":"What key details about gustavo gómez can be extracted from the following bio?

A good book may be among the best of friends. It is the same today that it always was, and it will never change. It is the most patient and cheerful of companions. It does not turn its back upon us in times of adversity or distress. It always receives us with the same kindness; amusing and instructing us in youth, and comforting and consoling us in age. Men often discover their affinity to each other by the mutual love they have for a book just as two persons sometimes discover a friend by the admiration which both entertain for a third. There is an old proverb, 'Love me, love my dog.\\" But there is more wisdom in this:\\" Love me, love my book.\\" The book is a truer and higher bond of union. Men can think, feel, and sympathize with each other through their favorite author. They live in him together, and he in them. A good book is often the best urn of a life enshrining the best that life could think out; for the world of a man's life is, for the most part, the world of his thoughts.

Here's a detailed explanation of the various elements of this phrase that contribute to its positive nature: 1. \\"Crisp\\": When describing something as \\"crisp,\\" it signifies clear, concise, and well-defined qualities. This word is often used in a positive context to praise the precision and clarity of something, such as communication, decision-making, or even physical appearance. 2. \\"Purposeful\\": This term suggests that there is intention or meaning behind the subject of the phrase, indicating that it serves a specific goal or function. This can be perceived as positive since purposeful actions or items generally have a desired outcome or effect, reflecting that the person or object in question is working towards a particular goal or behaving in a targeted manner. 3. \\"Without overdoing it\\": The inclusion of this part of the statement is important, as it highlights a sense of balance or moderation. It implies that although the subject is crisp and purposeful, it does not go to an extreme or excessive level. This creates a perception of a \\"happy medium\\" or a reasonable approach, which is generally viewed as positive, as it shows restraint and fine-tuning of actions or qualities.

In fact, the given premise contradicts the hypothesis. Allow me to provide a detailed explanation to support this conclusion. The premise provided presents the following information: 1. Sharon, presumably Ariel Sharon, the former Prime Minister of Israel, exploited the situation in Kosovo to appeal to a specific demographic in Israel – Russian immigrants. 2. There are 1 million new Russian immigrants in Israel. 3. The votes of these Russian immigrants are critical in deciding the outcome of an election. Based on these three points, it is clear that there are Russian immigrants residing in Israel. Moreover, their number is significant enough to potentially impact an election's outcome. In this context, the term \\"exploited\\" is being used to indicate that Sharon utilized this situation to gain political advantage, not that there was any injustice or mistreatment of Russian immigrants. Now, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"No Russians were allowed in Israel.\\" This statement suggests that no Russian citizens were granted permission to enter and reside in Israel. However, as mentioned earlier, the premise clearly states that there are 1 million Russian immigrants in Israel. This directly contradicts the hypothesis, as the presence of Russian immigrants confirms that they were allowed entry into the country. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the premise, we cannot support the hypothesis that \\"No Russians were allowed in Israel.\\" The presence of a significant number of Russian immigrants in Israel directly disproves the statement. It is important to accurately analyze and evaluate the information available before drawing conclusions, especially when the conclusions may impact the understanding of complex social and political situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Luckily the dvd itself was not damaged, but I wouldn't be surprised if others were. A:","completion":"After analyzing the given review, it appears that the chances of buying the product would likely decrease due to several factors presented in the review. There are various reasons to support this conclusion: 1. Damaged case: The reviewer mentions that the case of the DVD was \\"very damaged,\\" which raises concerns about the packaging and handling of the product during shipping and delivery. A damaged case can be an indicator of poor quality control or inadequate shipping protection. 2. Risk of damage to the DVD: While the reviewer states that their specific DVD was not damaged, they also mention that they \\"wouldn't be surprised if others were.\\" This suggests that the condition of the case might have been severe enough to potentially damage the DVD itself, which is a crucial element of the overall product experience. 3. Quality concerns: The mentioned issues in the review could raise concerns about the overall quality and care with which the product is treated by the manufacturer or the seller. Damages to the product, even if they don't affect the functionality directly, could still lead potential buyers to question the durability and reliability of the product. 4. Customer satisfaction: Reviews are essential sources of information for potential buyers to gauge the experiences of others who have purchased and used the product. A negative review, as is the case here, can dissuade potential customers from buying the product due to fears of having similar experiences with a damaged or potentially unusable product. 5. Other reviews: Considering that people tend to share their negative experiences more readily than positive ones, this review might influence potential buyers to look for alternative similar products that have better reviews or fewer reports of damaged packaging and potential for damaged DVDs. 6. Price and alternative options: The mentioned issues in the review could lead potential buyers to weigh their options, considering the price of the product and the availability of alternative options in the market. If the price of this product is higher than its competitors, or if potential buyers find similar products with better overall reviews or expressed satisfaction, they might choose to purchase those alternatives. In conclusion, the mentioned review would likely decrease the chances of a potential buyer purchasing the product due to concerns related to the damaged packaging, potential risks of damage to the DVD, overall quality concerns, and the impression it leaves on customer satisfaction. As a result, potential customers might be inclined to look for alternative options with better reviews or reassurances of product safety and quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Humor has been evaluated by many great minds such as Thomas Hobbes, who, in \\"On Nature\\", disliked humor, \\"Laughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from sudden thought of feeling far better than others.\\" He thought humor to be a negative quality of human narrow-mindedness. However, Mordechai Gordon, Ph. D of Education, insists, \\"Humor allows us to view the world from an angle that is amusing rather than serious.\\" I agree with Gordon. Learning to look at the world through humor is important. In the United States, every four years an election occurs. Without humor as a way to express their feelings, how else would Americans keep from clawing their eyes out and going the way of lemming? Television shows like \\"The Daily Show\\" have become important parts of American culture. They are mothering the masses by metaphorically airplane-ing politics into our mouths. They make politics fun. Of course, politics is only one type of humor. Social humor helps people through the twists and turns of the human condition. American pop culture promotes an unhealthy self- image. On the topic of self-image, Hari Kondabolu stands out. He has a joke about the popular musical group \\"The Pussycat Dolls\\", describing their hit song \\"Don't Cha\\" as a negative representation of women. He points out an obvious offence in American culture. A study from Loyola University of Maryland has shown that humor is one determining factor for selecting a mating partner. Amongst other things, mates look for an outstanding funny bone in a potential partner. Of course, humor is not always used for good purposes. Humor can be linked to vulgarity and racism, but, like everything else, it has potential to unite human beings by allowing us to laugh at ourselves, our failures and our connection with one another. Though 1ife may seem tough and depressing at times, all I have to do is look in the mirror at my increased wrinkles to know that there is a comedy out there that even Chaplin wasn't aware of.

According to the author, humor is not always used to help. It can sometimes have negative consequences as well. 14. In the author's view, less positive aspects of humor might include it being used to promote or reinforce harmful stereotypes or offensive behavior. 15. The author suggests that humor might be linked to vulgarity and racism, implying that it can sometimes be used to either support or diffuse disparaging views or discriminatory practices. 16. In his reflection, the author sees his increased wrinkles - a sign of ageing and life experiences. 17. The wrinkles remind him of the ongoing comedy in life, a sort of humor that even legendary comedian Charlie Chaplin wasn't aware of, as per the author. 18. Besides ourselves, we should also laugh at our collective failures and our shared human condition. This suggests the author's belief in humor as a social bonding tool, uniting people through shared laughter despite, or perhaps because of, our common imperfections and mishaps."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First question: Do we have to rinse our face after using a face mask? Second question: How many times should I use face mask? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices: A). no. B). yes.","completion":"First, I will answer both questions: 1. Do we have to rinse our face after using a face mask? To answer this question, I need to consider the type of face mask being used. If it's a wash-off face mask, it typically requires rinsing with water to remove it once it has dried. Peel-off masks can be peeled off and may not need water for removal, but it's still a good idea to rinse the face to get rid of any remaining residue. Overnight masks or leave-on masks usually do not require rinsing until the next morning. For sheet masks, you should not rinse your face; instead, gently pat the remaining essence into your skin. Step-by-step justification: - Determine the type of face mask - Assess the instructions for removal - Provide the appropriate response based on the face mask type 2. How many times should I use a face mask? The frequency of using a face mask depends on the type of mask and your skin type. In general, using a face mask 1-3 times a week is recommended for most people. However, if you have sensitive skin, you may want to use a mask less often, like once a week. It's essential to follow the instructions on the specific face mask product and adjust based on your skin's needs and reactions. Step-by-step justification: - Refer to the type of face mask and skin type - Consider general recommendations - Advise adjusting frequency based on skin reactions and product instructions Now, I will answer if these two questions are asking the same thing: Based on the given choices: A). no.

As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. I am facing a new situation today: Students learned about protozoa in school this week. Dan and Jim were interested and read more on the subject. Dan read more about predatory protozoa, while Jim read more about herbivore protozoa. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which student read more about protozoa preying upon single-celled organisms? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, the correct answer to the question is that Dan read more about protozoa preying upon single-celled organisms. To elaborate, protozoa can be classified into different functional groups depending on their feeding habits and roles in the ecosystem. Some protozoa are predators, consuming other single-celled organisms, like bacteria. These predatory protozoa help maintain the balance of bacterial populations in nature. On the other hand, herbivore protozoa primarily feed on algae, functioning as primary consumers in aquatic ecosystems. In the new situation, Dan and Jim both learned about protozoa in school and chose to investigate further into the topic. Dan decided to focus on predatory protozoa, which prey on other single-celled organisms. Thus, it is Dan who read more about protozoa preying upon single-celled organisms.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which came first, University of Erfurt or monastic schools? Context: European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century. The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries.","completion":"From the given context, monastic schools came first.

Robert Neville, M.D. is a scientist based in Los Angeles. As he begins to succumb to the plague himself, he injects himself with an experimental vaccine, rendering himself immune. By 1977, Neville believes he is the plague's only immune survivor. Struggling to maintain his sanity, he spends his days patrolling the deserted city of Los Angeles, hunting and killing members of \\"The Family\\", a cult of plague victims who were turned into nocturnal albino mutants. The Family seeks to destroy all technology and kill Neville, who has become a symbol of the science they blame for humanity's downfall. At night, living atop a fortified apartment building equipped with an arsenal of weaponry, Neville is a prisoner in his own home. One day, as Neville is in a department store helping himself to new clothing, he spots a woman who quickly runs away. He pursues her outside but later decides he is hallucinating and dismisses the sighting. On another day, the Family finally captures Neville. After a summary trial he is found guilty of heresy by the family's leader, Jonathan Matthias, a former news anchorman. Neville is sentenced to death and nearly burned at the stake in Dodger Stadium. He is rescued by Lisa, the woman he had earlier dismissed as a hallucination, and Dutch, a former medical student. Lisa and Dutch are part of a group of survivors, some of whom are children. Although their youth has given them some resistance to the disease, they are still vulnerable to it and will eventually succumb to mutation. Neville realizes that even if it is possible to duplicate the original vaccine, it would take years to salvage humanity. However, he believes it may be possible to extend his immunity to others by creating a serum from his own body.
