Unbeknownst to Mickey, a sinister plot is brewing in the background. Pete, the primary antagonist and notorious leader of a criminal gang, is on the verge of executing his most ambitious and nefarious plan. The aim: to take control of Toon Town and bend its citizens to his will. Wanting to secure his victory, Pete requires a powerful and unique item, \\"The Crystal of Toon\\", which holds the essence and spirit of Toon Town. With this, he can manipulate the vibrant world and its residents. Unfortunately for Pete, Mickey, who works at a museum showcasing Toon Town's history and artifacts, is the one responsible for guarding the Crystal. Act 2: In a twisted turn of events, Pete kidnaps Pluto, Mickey's trusty canine sidekick, while they are enjoying a beautiful day together in a park. From there, Mickey receives a ransom message from Pete: deliver the Crystal of Toon to him or Pluto's life will be in peril. Worried and heartbroken, Mickey confides in his friends - Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy.

Throwing a rock is a physical action often borne out of frustration or anger. However, it does not address the root cause of these emotions or lead to a resolution of the underlying problem. Once the immediate emotional response subsides, Riley may recognize this. She might feel empty, unsatisfied, regretful, or even escalated frustration because her action did not deliver the wanted outcome, which is typically resolution or change. She may also feel anxious or fearful about potential consequences, such as retaliation or punishment for her actions. It's also worth noting that everyone reacts and handles anger or conflicts differently. Some people might feel catharsis after such an act, while others would feel regret immediately.

Does the word \\"point\\" mean the same thing in \\"It's rude to point at other people.\\" and \\"The dancers toes pointed outward.\\"?","completion":"While the word \\"point\\" is used in both sentences, it carries distinct meanings and functions in each context. It must be noted that \\"point\\" possesses various definitions in the English language, ranging from providing direction to emphasizing a topic. Analyzing the given sentences will help elucidate the differences between its uses. In the sentence, \\"It's rude to point at other people,\\" the word \\"point\\" refers to the action of directing one's finger toward someone or something, typically with the intention of drawing attention to it. That said, this usage is considered impolite and disrespectful, particularly when aimed at a person. When using \\"point\\" in this manner, it functions as a verb, encapsulating the physical action of extending an index finger to single out a particular individual or object. On the other hand, \\"The dancers' toes pointed outward\\" employs \\"point\\" to describe the position or alignment of a body part. By stating that the toes are \\"pointed outward,\\" the sentence aims to convey that the dancers are angling their feet away from each other, achieving a specific pose or form for their performance. Consequently, \\"point\\" represents the state of being directed toward a particular orientation, especially in terms of physical position. In summation, the word \\"point\\" conveys different meanings in the given sentences: in the first, it refers to the discourteous action of aiming one's finger at another, while the second illustrates the alignment of a dancer's toes.

Ferrante that throws the idea of a predictable, formulaic disaster flick to the wind - or rather, into a tornado. With its unique premise, simple yet charming storytelling, and charismatic cast, \\"Sharknado\\" delivers a wildly entertaining and unforgettable experience. Step 1: Start by praising the film's unique premise and tension-building elements. \\"Sharknado\\" sets itself apart from other disaster films by adding a sea full of deadly creatures to the mix, making nature's wrath even more terrifying. The seemingly outrageous idea of sharks being hurled into a city through a tornado creates suspenseful moments that keep the viewer engaged and glued to the screen. Step 2: Highlight the film's charismatic cast and their energetic performances. The cast, led by Ian Ziering as Fin and Tara Reid as his estranged wife April, wholeheartedly invest in the ridiculousness and fun of the movie. Their camaraderie and animated performances create a dynamic, enjoyable atmosphere that makes it easy for viewers to suspend disbelief and become invested in the story. Step 3: Mention the simplicity of the storytelling and its charm. The straightforward plot of \\"Sharknado\\" contributes to its charm. It maintains a fast pace, never leaving the viewer bored or bogged down by overly complicated subplots. The simplicity allows the focus to be on the pure entertainment and excitement of a city fighting against a shark-infested tornado. Step 4: Point out the movie's campy, self-aware nature that adds to its cult-following. \\"Sharknado\\" cleverly takes on a campy vibe, fully embracing its absurd premise without taking itself too seriously. This self-awareness attracts a cult following of fans who enjoy the movie for its over-the-top humor, action sequences, and surprisingly engaging plot. Step 5: Wrap up the review by reaffirming the film's overall positive qualities. In conclusion, \\"Sharknado\\" delivers a whirlwind of thrills and chills by blending a unique premise, charismatic cast, and fast-paced storytelling. If you're seeking a film that will provide pure, unabashed entertainment, \\"Sharknado\\" is a must-watch.

Finding Joe an irresistable target for his sarcastic on-air wit, a Howard Stern-like deejay named Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller), puts Joe on the air to tell his story. For three days Zander and a growing legion of listeners are surprised to find themselves captivated, delighted, and occasionally repelled by Joe's incredible tale of his search to find the parents who referred to him as \\"Joe Dirt\\" (rather than by his real last name, which he can no longer remember) and left him sitting in a garbage can at the Grand Canyon when he was 8 years old. Thorughout the film, the story reverts for short periods back to the KXLA studio for dialogue between Joe and Zander.Pivotal to Joe's story is the past relationship he reveals between himself and Brandy (Brittany Daniel), a beautiful farm girl from his adopted hometown of Silvertown, Idaho. Joe feels that Brandy and his dog, Charlie, were the only real friends he ever had. After living in and leaving a series of bizarre foster homes, Joe met Brandy one winter when he was living in the woods outside Silvertown and Charlie's testicles became frozen to the front porch of Brandy's house. Brandy helped Joe and Charlie and for the next few years the three spent most of their time together.Believing that Brandy is \\"too hot\\" to ever love a guy like him, Joe is blind to the fact that she obviously has very real feelings for him. Complicating their relationship is Brandy's alcoholic father (Joe Don Baker) and the local Trans-Am-driving bully, Robby (Kid Rock).

An angry cat will have dilated pupils and stare at whatever it's angry at. The fur on it’s body will usually also stand on end. The tail may also flick from side to side as it holds it in an upside down U. In addition, an angry or scared cat may have its ears flattened back. In contrast, a friendly cat will approach you with its tail up, erect ears, and rub against your legs. It may give a friendly meow or series of meows and may even be purring. Cats are affectionate and responsive creatures. To get your attention, cats will often sit close to you or brush up against your legs while meowing. This solicitation for attention is normal cat behavior. It places the cat’s scent on the recipient, helps them bond with you, and probably, although we can’t know for certain, has other significant meanings. When a cat rubs up on a human it’s an important bonding ritual. If your cat is rubbing up against you, don't shoo it away.

Kittens knead their mother’s mammary glands as they are nursing to get the milk flowing. It is thought to be comforting for a cat to do so on a beloved human being.

It's not often that the wine makers of Champagne are left feeling a little bit flat. But vineyards across the north of England are toasting extraordinary success - as climate change makes the region ideal for wine-making. Just over 25 years ago, Renishaw Hall, near Sheffield, was the most northern vineyard in the world. Toasting success: Kieron Atkinson, who runs the English Wine Project, at Renishaw Hall which is planning to double output to 6,000 bottles per year. Yet as they celebrate their 40th anniversary this year they are planning to double the number of white wines they produce from 3,000 to up to 6,000 per year. Vineyards across the north of England have seen demand soar as the quality of their grapes improves - and they are giving their more illustrious French rivals a run for their money in the sparkling wine stakes. As temperatures increase because of climate change, grapes become more acidic. But unlike in Champagne, northern France, it is not too hot in northern England. Improved trellis systems and management techniques have also helped British manufacturers close the gap on their continental rivals. Chateau Doncaster: The town in northern England has become the unlikely home of sparkling white wines rivaling those from Champagne. Even in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, vineyards have been able to produce wine with 12 per cent natural alcohol. The Summerhouse vineyard on the outskirts of the northern town started production in 2005 and has rapidly seen its output increase. But despite their growing success, their are still only a small number of northern vineyards spread across Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire. Across England, winemakers have seen demand soar in recent years - although until now it has largely been manufacturers in the south getting all the accolades. Last year, two English rosés, produced just a few miles from the M25 in Surrey and Kent, scooped top international awards at the wine world's 'Oscars', proving the nation does not need Mediterranean heat to turn out a top tipple. Toasting success: The head gardener works on the vines at Renishaw Hall, Derbyshire. Kent-based Chapel Down, the winemaker which provided white wine for Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton, picked up a gold medal for its sparkling Vintage Rosé Brut at the International Wine Challenge, the world's biggest and most important wine competition. And just a few miles down the road, Denbies Chalk Ridge Rose 2010, produced on the hillsides of Dorking, Surrey, beat off stiff competition from more than 360 producers from 21 countries across the globe to win the still rosé gold medal prize. Kieron Atkinson, who runs the English Wine Project, told The Times that northern winemakers are giving Champagne a run for their money. 'We are cooler than Champagne, which means we have nicer levels of acid in our grapes. That makes for a better sparkling wine,' he said. 'We are still relatively young at doing this in comparison with the Champagne region but our techniques are catching up, hence our ability to get better and better wine every year.' He added: 'I guess the alarm bells for the Champagne region are ringing because the summers are so much hotter.' Running scared?

We have 14776*b - 13895*b = 26430. Now, let's think about what we're doing when we multiply. If we have b apples and a number tells us how many more or fewer apples to add or remove, we'll get a new number of apples. Imagine we have 14776 toy trucks, and we want to add some more toy trucks (*b). Then, we have 13895 toy trucks, and we want to remove some of those trucks (*b). We want to know what the number (b) should be if the difference between these two actions results in 26430 toy trucks. To find b, here's what we can do: Step 1: Look at the equation 14776*b - 13895*b = 26430. Step 2: Let's rearrange 14776*b and 13895*b. Think of it like this: instead of adding some toy trucks (*b) to 14776 and removing some toy trucks (*b) from 13895, we can think about the difference between these two numbers first, then multiply it by b. So, we can rewrite the equation like this: (14776 - 13895) * b = 26430 Step 3: Now, let's find the difference: 14776 - 13895 = 881 So the equation becomes: 881 * b = 26430 Step 4: To find b, we need to figure out how many times 881 can fit into 26430. In other words, we need to divide 26430 by 881: 26430 ÷ 881 = 30 So, the answer is b = 30. In simple words, if we add 30 toy trucks to 14776 and remove 30 toy trucks from 13895, the difference between these two actions will be 26430 toy trucks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Labour's Andy Burnham says he is considering standing to be mayor of Greater Manchester when the position is created in 2017.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Andy Burnham Considers Run for the Position of Greater Manchester Mayor in 2017 Introduction: As the political landscape in the UK continues to evolve, a new opportunity has presented itself for Labour MP Andy Burnham. The veteran politician has announced that he is entertaining the possibility of running for the mayoral office in Greater Manchester when the position is inaugurated in 2017. This move has piqued the interest of political spectators, Labour party supporters, and the general public as it marks a potential shift in Burnham's political career and sheds light on the unfolding dynamics of the UK's political climate. Andy Burnham's Background: Andy Burnham has had an extensive political career, serving as the MP for Leigh since 2001. He has held various positions within the Labour Party, such as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Secretary of State for Health, and most recently, the Shadow Home Secretary. Widely respected for his dedication to public service, Burnham ran for Labour leader in the 2015 leadership election, only to lose to Jeremy Corbyn. Despite the loss, Burnham has remained a key figure within the party, often standing as a voice for the working-class and advocating for social justice. The Mayor of Greater Manchester Position: In 2014, the UK government announced plans to create a series of devolved elected mayoral positions throughout England. This decision came after widespread debates on how to address the growing inequality between London and other regions within the UK. The aim was to empower local governments and implement significant political reform, allowing regions to better manage their finances, infrastructure, and public services. Greater Manchester was chosen as one of the pilot areas and is set to elect its first mayor in May 2017. The successful candidate will have control over a budget of £1 billion and responsibilities that include housing, transport, and policing within the region. The emergence of the mayoral position has attracted diverse political personalities. Burnham's Potential Candidacy: Andy Burnham's decision to consider a run for the mayoral office could significantly impact the political landscape in Greater Manchester. His experience in national politics and deep understanding of the local communities make him a strong contender. Burnham has expressed that he would like to use the opportunity to return power to the people and reduce economic inequality. Burnham has voiced his concerns about the devolution plans, saying they offer an “illusion of power” and risk provoking a “Whitehall power grab.” However, his potential candidacy represents an opportunity to reshape the plans to better serve Greater Manchester's citizens. Furthermore, his presence in the mayoral race could lead the Labour party to bolster its support and determination to ensure the new mayoral position delivers real change to the area. Implications of Burnham's Potential Run: Should Burnham be successful in his bid for the mayoral office, he would ultimately have to resign from his position as MP and Shadow Home Secretary, prompting changes within the Labour party. His departure from national politics could spark debates as to whether his focus on local politics signals a loss of faith in the central party or if it's simply a strategic move to strengthen Labour's presence in the UK's changing political structure. Conclusion: As the creation of the Greater Manchester mayoral office approaches, Andy Burnham's consideration of a mayoral run marks an exciting development in UK politics. His potential candidacy may have significant implications not only for the region but also for the Labour Party and the future of devolution in the UK. As observers watch Burnham make his final decision, the nation takes a step into a future with greater regional autonomy and evolving political dynamics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His father is a former professional footballer and played for clubs such as Chester City and Everton. Owen was introduced to football at the age of seven by his father who soon saw Michael as the most promising athlete in the family. A boyhood Everton fan, Owen attended Rector Drew Primary School in Hawarden, Flintshire, north Wales and by the age of ten, some of the nation's leading scouts were monitoring his progress. On 3 July 2009, it was announced that Owen had signed a two-year deal with reigning Premier League champions Manchester United. He said that the approach from manager Alex Ferguson came from \\"out of the blue\\". He signed a pay-as-you-play deal and was handed the number 7 shirt vacated by the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid. The shirt had previously been worn by many of United's other illustrious players over the years, including Johnny Berry, George Best, Steve Coppell, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Owen scored his first goal for United on his debut, scoring an 84th-minute winner after coming on as a substitute in a pre-season friendly against a Malaysian XI; he followed this up by scoring three more goals in United's pre-season games. Owen made his league debut for United when he came on as a substitute against Birmingham City on 16 August in a 1-0 win, and scored his first competitive goal in a Manchester United shirt against Wigan Athletic on 22 August in a 5-0 away win. On 20 September, Owen scored his first goal at Old Trafford as he netted in the sixth minute of stoppage time against local rivals Manchester City to give United a 4-3 derby win. This meant that Owen had now scored in his fourth derby, after netting in the Merseyside derby, El Clasico and the Tyne-Wear derby in previous years. Owen struggled to recall the moments immediately after the goal, and said that it ranked as one of his most important.

Write an article based on this summary: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Paris to commemorate the victims of a mass arrest of Jews in Nazi-occupied France in 1942.","completion":"Title: Israeli PM Netanyahu Commemorates Nazi-Era Victims in Paris Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was recently in Paris, France, to commemorate the victims of an infamous mass arrest of Jewish individuals in Nazi-occupied France, which took place in 1942. Netanyahu, renowned for his efforts to safeguard the memory of the Holocaust, made this dedicated visit to Paris, thereby, once again, emboldening a stand against historical acts of inhumanity. The step here is to acknowledge that Netanyahu's visit is a continuous part of his commitment as the Prime Minister of Israel to uphold the memories of holocaust while fostering relationships with countries in Europe. The mass arrest, known as the 'Vel d'Hiv Roundup,' is regarded as one of the most horrific episodes of Jewish persecution in France during the Second World War. On July 16 and 17, 1942, over 13,000 Jews were detained by French police collaborating with the Nazis. The detainees, which included thousands of children, were confined under the direst conditions in the Velodrome d'Hiver, a winter cycling track in Paris before being transported to Auschwitz. This information provides context regarding the historical event that prompted Netanyahu’s visit. Through his visit, Netanyahu aims to immortalize the memories of these innocent lives tragically cut short. His visit is a symbolic gesture, signaling the enduring commitment of Israel and its allies to ensure that such atrocities are never repeated. This sentence epitomizes the symbolic and diplomatic function of Netanyahu's visit. Despite seven and a half decades after the event, the 'Vel d'Hiv Roundup' continues to be a raw wound for Jewish communities worldwide. Netanyahu's Paris visit brings this historical outrage back into sharp focus, urging the global community to remember and learn from our past. Here, we mention the current effect of this historical event on the global Jewish community and discuss the role of Netanyahu's visit in maintaining awareness of past atrocities. Netanyahu's visit to Paris also serves to reinforce ties between France and Israel. It is an important diplomatic step asserting Israel's pursuit for worldwide recognition not just of the horrors of the Holocaust but of the continued need for vigilance against anti-Semitism. This sentence connects Netanyahu's memory preservation mission to a more comprehensive diplomatic effort aimed at reinforcing international relationships. In conclusion, Netanyahu's visit to Paris as a commemorative endeavor reminds us of the unutterable atrocities of the Second World War, particularly the mass arrest and extermination of Jews in the 'Vel d'Hiv Roundup. ' It is also an adamant call for the world to remain vigilant and hold a united front against anti-Semitism and all forms of hatred and bigotry. The conclusion is necessary to summarize the main points of the article. Overall, the process of writing this article involved breaking down the given summary into several key points and elucidating each one by one. The focus remained to provide a background while dwelling on the implications and motivations behind Netanyahu's Paris visit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It is also used for tool handles and cutlery, such as chopsticks, toothpicks, and other utensils, like the wooden spoon.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"People have been utilizing wood for various purposes since ancient times, due to its widespread availability and versatility. Among these uses, wooden materials have been employed in crafting various cutlery and utensils that are widely used in different cultures for eating and culinary purposes. In the given context, some of the most common wooden eating implements are: 1. Chopsticks: Chopsticks are a pair of slender sticks made from wood, bamboo, or other materials, used in Asian countries as an eating utensil. These cultural staples have been used for thousands of years, mostly in countries such as China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. People hold chopsticks in one hand, typically the dominant one, and use them to pick up small pieces of food from their plates, bowls, or from shared dishes. 2. Wooden spoons: These age-old utensils are found in various kitchens across the globe. Made from hardwoods such as maple, olive, or walnut, wooden spoons serve multiple purposes, ranging from stirring and mixing ingredients to serving food. The gentle touch of a wooden spoon makes it ideal for use with non-stick or delicate cookware, preventing damage to surfaces. Wooden spoons are often carved from a single piece of wood, offering the advantage of not hosting bacteria in crevices or seams. 3. Toothpicks: Wooden toothpicks, made from small slivers of wood or bamboo, have been in use for centuries. They are often used to remove small pieces of food stuck between teeth after a meal. Toothpicks can also be utilized for serving small appetizers or finger foods, providing a convenient and disposable method of handling food without getting hands messy. 4. Skewers: Skewers are long, thin wooden or metal sticks used to pierce and hold together pieces of food for grilling, roasting, or barbecuing. Wooden skewers, typically made from bamboo, are an eco-friendly and economical option for threading and cooking various meats, vegetables, or fruits. Soaking wooden skewers in water before use helps prevent them from burning during cooking. 5. Wooden spatulas and turners: Used for flipping, lifting, serving, and scraping food while cooking, wooden spatulas and turners are preferred by many chefs since they are gentle on cookware surfaces and prevent scratching. These utensils come in various shapes, sizes, and designs, catering to different cooking needs. 6. Mortar and pestle: Although not a direct eating utensil, wooden mortar and Pestle have been widely used in global culinary traditions for grinding and crushing herbs, spices, and other ingredients to create pastes, sauces, and seasoning mixes. The wooden version provides a rustic and traditional alternative to stone or ceramic mortar and pestles. In conclusion, many wooden utensils and cutlery like chopsticks, spoons, skewers, toothpicks, and turners have been used for eating and cooking purposes throughout history. These items provide an eco-friendly, durable, and aesthetically pleasing option for meal preparation and consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that was affected by the foggy weather?, using the article: In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The name of the person affected by the foggy weather is Gustav Holst.

However, maintaining good eye health goes beyond simply choosing the appropriate lenses. It involves the correct cleaning, storage, and handling of contacts, ensuring they are comfortable and safe to use on your eyes. In this comprehensive guide, we'll outline some critical steps for cleaning your contact case, washing your hands, finding an ideal space, and safely inserting your contact lenses. Section 1: Start with a Clean Contact Case Cleaning your contact lens case is a crucial, yet often overlooked aspect of contact lens care. Here are some essential tips for maintaining a clean contact case: 1.1 Rinse with care When cleaning your contact lens case, always use either a sterile contact lens solution or fresh multipurpose solution. Avoid using water as it may introduce bacteria or other impurities into the case. 1.2 Clean regularly Aim to clean your case after each use, and never leave your contacts soaking in the same solution for an extended period. Replace the solution daily to maintain a hygienic environment for your lenses. 1.3 Air dry Once you've cleaned your case, air-dry it upside down on a clean tissue or towel, ensuring any additional moisture evaporates. Avoid drying the case with a cloth as it can transfer lint or bacteria. 1.4 Replace your case Your contact lens case should be replaced at least every three months, even if it shows no visible signs of wear. A new contact case will reduce the risks of contamination and infection. Section 2: Proper Hand Hygiene Thorough hand hygiene is crucial before handling your contact lenses. Here are some tips for ensuring clean hands: 2.1 Use soap and water Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, ensuring you clean all surfaces, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your fingernails. 2.2 Dry with a lint-free towel After washing your hands, use a clean, lint-free towel to dry them. Avoid using a towel with lint or fabric threads to reduce the transfer of debris to your lenses. 2.3 Keep fingernails short and smooth Long or uneven nails can harbor bacteria and make it challenging to hold your contact lenses properly. Maintaining short nails will help reduce the risk of contamination and lens damage. Section 3: Finding the Right Environment Inserting your contact lenses safely and comfortably takes practice and the right conditions. Here are some guidelines to create the perfect environment: 3.1 Choose a well-lit room Ensure the room you're using has ample lighting to help you see better when inserting your contacts. Good lighting conditions will make it easier to spot any imperfections such as dirt or tears on the lens. 3.2 Use a clean mirror A clean, clear mirror is essential for successful contact lens insertion as it allows you to see what you're doing while ensuring proper lens placement. It can be helpful to use a freestanding or wall-mounted mirror that doesn't require holding. 3.3 Stand over an appropriate surface Select a surface that is stable and easy to clean. A bathroom countertop or a table with a clean, flat surface is ideal. It will help prevent your lenses from falling and getting contaminated if you drop them during the insertion process. Section 4: Inserting Your Contact Lenses Now that you have a clean contact case, washed hands, and a suitable environment, it's time to insert your lenses. Follow these steps for seamless contact lens insertion: 4.1 Inspect your lenses for damage or debris Before inserting, make sure your lenses are free from rips, tears, or any debris. Discard any damaged lenses and clean off debris as necessary. 4.2 Identify the lens orientation Hold the lens on the tip of your finger to check if it's inside out. A correctly oriented lens should resemble a smooth bowl. If it looks flared or has a lip, it's inside out, and you need to flip it. 4.3 Hold your eyes open Using your other hand, gently hold up your upper eyelid, minimizing the blinking reflex. At the same time, use the middle finger from the hand with the lens to pull down your lower eyelid. 4.4 Place the lens on your eye Look upward and gently place the lens on the whites of your eye. Release your eyelids slowly and blink a few times to help the lens position itself correctly. Conclusion Maintaining proper hygiene and handling techniques are essential for successful contact lens wear. By having a clean contact case, washing your hands, using a mirror in a well-lit room, and standing over an appropriate surface, you'll maximize your chances of comfortable, safe contact lens insertion. By following these guidelines, your eyes will stay healthy, and your vision will remain clear and comfortable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Assuming that: As you increase the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon, the number of isomers quickly increases. The answer is:","completion":"More isomers. Step 1: Understand the terms - A hydrocarbon is a compound containing only hydrogen and carbon atoms. - An isomer is a molecule with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements of atoms. Step 2: Interpret the question The question states that \\"a doubling of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon will cause more or less isomers\\" and assumes that \\"as you increase the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon, the number of isomers quickly increases.\\" Step 3: Analyze the assumption Based on the given assumption, it is clear that adding more carbon atoms to a hydrocarbon increases the number of potential isomers of the compound. Step 4: Reach a conclusion By doubling the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon, we are increasing the number of carbon atoms according to the assumption. This increase results in a more complex molecule, allowing for more possible structural arrangements to form different isomers.

B. ball was provided. Option A does not adequately explain why the girl didn't bring a ball because it focuses on the racket being provided, which doesn't seem relevant to the reason for not bringing a ball. Option B directly addresses the lack of a ball brought by the girl - the ball was provided, meaning that it was available at the practice and that's why she didn't bring one.

Write a summary based on this article: An eagle-eyed cop hit the scofflaw jackpot after pulling over a motorist for a routine infraction — and discovering the driver had more than 12,000 in unpaid tolls and penalties, official said Wednesday. Oscar Sanchez, 45, was headed east into the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City on Tuesday afternoon when Port Authority Police Officer Tomasz Grel noticed he didn’t have a front license plate and traveled through an E-ZPass lane as the “toll unpaid” sign lit up, authorities said. Sanchez’s 2001 Mercedes-Benz was pulled over and Grel found that the suspect didn’t have an E-ZPass in his window, officials said. Sanchez insisted that he still pays tolls, even without the E-ZPass, saying, “I don’t have it (an E-ZPass device) but they always charge my tag,” according to the Port Authority. But a routine driver’s license check showed that Sanchez was wanted for allegedly beating local bridge and tunnel tolls 204 times, officials said. That added up to 2,771 in unpaid tolls and 10,200 in penalties. The Jersey City resident Sanchez was arrested and charged with alleged theft of service, driving without a front license plate and driving with a suspended license. Sanchez had a valid New York license but records showed his New Jersey driving privileges had been suspended. He was released without bail and ordered to appear in a Jersey City courtroom on Tuesday of next week. ||||| JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) — Authorities say a New Jersey man who owes 12,000 in unpaid EZ Pass tolls has had his black Mercedes Benz impounded and is facing charges. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesman Joe Pentangelo said Wednesday that Oscar Sanchez, of Jersey City, was pulled over by agency police on Tuesday because the car didn't have a front license plate. Pentangelo says the officer discovered Sanchez had an expired driver's license and more than 200 counts of missed EZ Pass toll payments amounting to about 12,000. Sanchez faces charges including theft of service, operating a vehicle on a suspended license and not having a front license plate. Sanchez was not immediately available for comment, and it's unclear whether he has an attorney who could speak on his behalf. |||||","completion":"Imagine this. A police officer named Tomasz Grel noticed a car moving into the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City without a front license plate. Also, when the car went through a special toll lane, a sign lit up saying that the toll wasn't paid. So, officer Grel decided to stop the car. The driver of the car was a man named Oscar Sanchez. When the officer checked Mr. Sanchez's car, he didn't find a device called E-ZPass that usually helps in paying tolls automatically. Even though Mr. Sanchez said he pays tolls without the device, when the officer checked his records, he found out something surprising. Mr. Sanchez hadn't paid for crossing bridges and tunnels 204 times! He owed 2,771 for the unpaid tolls and an additional 10,200 for fines. That adds up to more than 12,000 overall! Furthermore, Mr. Sanchez had a valid New York driving license but his New Jersey driving rights had been taken away. Because of all these issues, Mr. Sanchez was arrested and his car was seized.

A large sea turtle lays around 150 eggs at a time. She lays all these eggs in just a few minutes. Large sea turtles live in the warm seas of the world. Except for when they lay their eggs, they spend their whole lives in the water. When it is time to lay their eggs, the females swim to land. They usually return to the place where they themselves were born. How they find their way back there is unknown. When they reach shore, the big, heavy turtles crawl slowly up to the high water mark. Using their flippers, they pull themselves along the sand. They must struggle like mountain climbers. When they finally reach dry sand, they rest before beginning the difficult task of laying eggs. The turtles lay the eggs in deep holes and cover them with warm sand. The sand protects the eggs from harm. Then the females leave them. After a few weeks, if you happened to be walking along the beach, you might see the sand begin to shake. You may see tiny black balls coming out of the sand. The tiny heads of baby turtles! Question: Turtles bury their eggs to protect them from _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"danger\\"? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"danger.\\" Turtles bury their eggs to protect them from various dangers that can harm the eggs and decrease the chances of survival for baby turtles. These dangers can include potential predators like birds, crabs, or other animals, as well as environmental factors such as extreme temperatures, flooding, or human activities like beach development and pollution. By digging deep holes and covering their eggs with warm sand, the female turtles create a protective barrier that hides the eggs from predators and safeguards them from harmful environmental factors. The sand acts as an insulator, providing a controlled environment for the eggs to incubate and the baby turtles to develop properly. Moreover, the natural camouflage offered by burying the eggs in the sand makes it difficult for predators to find them. This concealment is crucial for the survival of the baby turtles, as many species face high mortality rates due to predation, both at the egg and hatchling stages. Additionally, the buried eggs have a greater chance of survival when exposed to potential flooding caused by high tides or storms, as the sand can provide some resistance to being washed away. In summary, the answer is \\"danger,\\" as turtles bury their eggs to protect them from the multiple risks they might face, such as predators and harsh environmental conditions, ensuring the continuation of their species and maintaining the delicate balance of the marine ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It could be an expression of genuine surprise or disbelief in the listener's inability to comprehend something. Alternatively, it could also be a rhetorical question, which conveys a degree of sarcasm or frustration rather than seeking an actual response. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the truth of the hypothesis \\"You cannot understand that.\\" As such, the question leaves room for ambiguity, and it is not possible to definitively answer with a simple yes or no. In order to arrive at a more accurate conclusion, one would need to consider the context in which the statement is made, the tone of the speaker, as well as any additional information that might shed light on the situation. For instance, if the speaker is aware that the listener has struggled with the subject matter in the past, the hypothesis might be more likely to be true.

Write an article based on this summary: A rights group says it has evidence of Myanmar's government discriminating against Muslim Rohingya, restricting their movements and family size. Article:","completion":"Title: Rights Group Reveals Disturbing Evidence of Discrimination Against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar Introduction A prominent human rights group has recently reported alarming evidence of discrimination practiced by the Myanmar government against the Muslim Rohingya community. The group's research indicates that the Rohingya are facing movement restrictions and family size limitations imposed by state authorities, highlighting the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Southeast Asian nation. Evidence of Discrimination The mentioned rights group claims to have gathered substantial documentation pointing to the discriminatory treatment of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. The group asserts that the government is implementing policies that deliberately restrict the movements of the Rohingya population, forcing them to remain in small areas with limited access to basic resources such as food, water, healthcare, and proper sanitation. Additionally, the rights group also states that it has found evidence of policies dictating family size limitations among the Rohingya community. These policies, purportedly designed and enforced by state authorities, create an undue burden on one of the world's most vulnerable and persecuted minority groups. Implications and International Response This new evidence of discrimination adds weight to the long-standing calls for the international community to intervene and address the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar. Various human rights organizations and activists have been urging governments worldwide to pay attention to the plight of the Rohingya people and find a way to ensure their safety, dignity, and access to essential rights. The United Nations has repeatedly referred to the Rohingya as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world, and in 2017, the organization declared a \\"textbook example of ethnic cleansing\\" in Myanmar. Additionally, in 2019 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered the country to protect the lives of its Rohingya citizens and preserve evidence of possible genocide. The Future for the Rohingya Community Despite the growing body of evidence and the international community's efforts to bring attention to the Rohingya crisis, the discrimination and persecution of this minority group continue. Accountability remains a significant challenge, and the Myanmar government has often denied any wrongdoing, which complicates finding an effective resolution to the situation. While some positive steps have been taken, such as the repatriation plan signed between Myanmar and Bangladesh in 2017 for the voluntary return of Rohingya refugees to their homes, any real progress remains limited. The international community must continue its efforts to hold the Myanmar government accountable and push for an end to discriminatory practices against the Rohingya people. Conclusion The recent evidence gathered by the rights group highlights the persistent discrimination and systemic persecution faced by the Rohingya community in Myanmar. The international community must keep the spotlight on the Rohingya crisis and strive to find a lasting solution that respects human rights and offers a sustainable future for this vulnerable minority."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The solids built up in the tank and I believe the added weight made the whole thing collapse. Not happy with the product this time around.Now we are faced with digging it out of the ground. We plan to make a larger flange out of plywood to slip over the doggie dooley before we replace it in the ground. Hopefully this will work. Since I have to clean out the whole thing to get it out of the hole, I'll try restarting it again. Hopefully it will work this time.We have one lab on high end dog food so the stools are relatively small and hard. Answer: Select from: a). No; b). Yes; Answer:","completion":"a). No; This product review is not positive. The reviewer shares their dissatisfaction with the Doggie Dooley #3000, stating that after 18 months, the whole thing collapsed into the hole and they could not get the product to digest properly, resulting in a buildup of solids in the tank. They also mention having to dig the product out of the ground and try restarting it, hoping it would work better the second time. Overall, the reviewer's experience with this product has been negative, and they express their unhappiness with it in their review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The game was the first at the newly christened University of Phoenix Stadium, which signed its naming rights deal with the Cardinals two days after Arizona's last home game vs. St. Louis. The Cards started off hot as Matt Leinart, making his first NFL start, threw two touchdowns in the first quarter to his two top targets, Anquan Boldin and Larry Fitzgerald. The Chiefs responded early in the second quarter with a 45-yard field goal by kicker Lawrence Tynes, and a touchdown pass from quarterback Damon Huard to running back Larry Johnson. Cards kicker Neil Rackers added a 41-yard field at the end of the first half. Another Rackers field goal, this time from 45 yards, accounted for the only score in the third quarter. The Chiefs then scored 13 unanswered points to win the game, with a touchdown pass from Huard to Samie Parker, and two field goals by Tynes (40, 19). Tynes' last field goal was set up by a 78-yard screen pass from Huard to Johnson. Johnson suffered a sprained neck at the end of the play on a violent face mask tackle by Cards' cornerback Antrel Rolle, who was fined 12,500 for the penalty. A last second 51-yard field goal attempt by Rackers to send the game to overtime failed, giving the Cards their fourth straight loss. During the game Larry Fitzgerald pulled a hamstring and missed 3 games, returning Week 10 against Dallas.

A:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the process and the perturbation hypothesis. Process: - Owls have specially adapted eyes that see better at night - Owls sit at high points in trees and look around - When an owl spots a rodent they track it - When the rodent is standing still the owl swoops down - The owl grabs the rodent with their talons - The owl uses their beak to eat the rodent Perturbation hypothesis: Suppose less air pollution is produced, how will it affect more owls seeing rodents? Step 2: Analyze the relationship between air pollution and the process. Air pollution can affect visibility due to the presence of contaminants and particulate matter in the atmosphere. This can potentially influence owls' ability to see rodents at night. Step 3: Determine the potential effect of the perturbation on the process. If there is less air pollution, it can be expected that the visibility of the environment would improve. As a result, owls, which have adapted eyes to see better at night, could potentially see rodents more clearly. This may help owls to more efficiently track and locate their prey during the night. Step 4: Assess whether the perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the process. The supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process, as it potentially affects the visibility in the environment where the owls find their prey. Improved visibility due to less air pollution may enhance the owls' ability to spot and track rodents, supporting the process of hunting and eating by owls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fruit retained their quality longer peaches or cherries? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]","completion":"Since Mary received peaches and decided to candy them, and Ann received cherries and ate them fresh, it can be inferred that the candied peaches would retain their quality longer. Candied fruit can last up to a year due to the preservation process, while fresh fruit does not have the same extended shelf life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, he dismisses her, but later comes to their home upon receiving a phone call from Pete saying he would go to Central America himself.

At points, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius sounded downright Orwellian in her testimony before Congress on Wednesday, such as when she explained that \\"the website never crashed. It is functional, but at a very slow speed and very low reliability and has continued to function.\\" Prolonged periods of minimum usefulness, perhaps, but don't call it a \\"crash,\\" she said with a straight face. On the other half of the television screen, CNN showed a live shot of HealthCare.gov with the message displayed, \\"The system is down at the moment.\\" But in the world of Obamacare, a mandate is an \\"option,\\" expensive is \\"affordable,\\" and now apparently failure is \\"function.\\" Of course, the problem with Obamacare isn't just the website, and the loss in credibility isn't just the secretary's. President Barack Obama and other supporters of the law spent years telling the American people that \\"if you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period.\\" They said detractors who suggested otherwise were lying. They said Republicans were just trying to scare people. The President and his allies were the dishonest ones, as is now clear to everyone. Even while they were promising Americans nothing would change if they liked their policies, \\"the administration knew that more than 40 to 67 percent of those in the individual market would not be able to keep their plans, even if they liked them,\\" as NBC News reported this week. Already more than 2 million people have had their insurance plans canceled -- three times as many as have signed up for Obamacare. Yet the President continues to insist, as he did Wednesday in Boston, that \\"if you had one of these substandard plans before the Affordable Care Act became law\\" -- of course, it was the law that made them \\"substandard,\\" by definition -- \\"and you liked that plan, you were able to keep it.\\" In the same speech, he took credit for liberating Americans from those \\"substandard\\" policies. This is as good an example of \\"double-think\\" as anything we've seen in American politics. While the President and the other pitchmen of Obamacare have certainly lost credibility, however, Sebelius in particular needs to be held accountable for the launch failures. She added the problem of terrible management on top of the law's many flaws, and in doing so has put the health, financial security and personal information of hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk. Across the country there are people who will have to buy insurance through the exchanges in just a few months, some because Obamacare caused their policies to be canceled, some because Obamacare caused their employers to dump their coverage. Many of these people will face steep new costs that they weren't anticipating. But today, a full month after the exchanges went live, Americans who visit HealthCare.gov to find out what coverage they and their families will have and how much it will cost them must spend hours of frustration trying to navigate a broken system. Even more alarming, the secretary's bad execution of the President's bad plan could put thousands of Americans' personal information at risk. Sebelius told Rep. Mike Rodgers on Wednesday that she would have to get back to him on whether there had ever been a complete security test of the system. When the person who is supposedly overseeing a system into which hundreds of thousands of people are entering their personal information says she will \\"get back to you\\" about whether there has been thorough security testing, it is terrifying. And on top of everything else, the exchange website is a complete boondoggle. Sebelius testified the government has spent almost 175 million on HealthCare.gov so far, and the real tab will surely be much higher after the emergency repairs. Already, this is substantially more than Apple spent to develop the iPhone, and even (as I pointed out recently) more than NASA spent on the Mars Pathfinder mission. It likely makes HealthCare.gov the most expensive website ever built, and certainly the most expensive not to function -- although perhaps that word no longer means what we thought it did. These failures of management make the pain of a bad law even worse. I oppose the law. I have always opposed the law. I believe it will fail and cannot be improved. But most of all, honesty counts in public officials, and after Sebelius' testimony Wednesday she should have lost her credibility even in the eyes of Obamacare's supporters. It's time to offer her the option of mandatory retirement. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of Newt Gingrich. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article focus on the issues surrounding the launch of Obamacare, specifically the problematic website HealthCare.gov, and the perceived dishonesty from the Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius and President Barack Obama. The author highlights the following points: 1. Sebelius' claim that the website never crashed, despite it being slow and unreliable. 2. The broken promise that \\"if you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan\\" made by President Obama and other supporters of the law. 3. Over 2 million people having their insurance plans canceled, while only around 675,000 have enrolled in Obamacare. 4. The challenge faced by Americans trying to navigate through the broken HealthCare.gov, which has caused frustration for many users. 5. The potential risk to Americans' personal information due to inadequate or unknown security measures on the HealthCare.gov website. 6. The extremely high cost of developing HealthCare.gov, which is estimated at almost 175 million and is considered by the author as possibly the most expensive website ever built. 7. The loss of credibility and accountability that has resulted from the launch failures and dishonesty of key public figures, such as Sebelius and President Obama.

The answer is:","completion":"To find the answer, let's break down the key information provided in the question: 1. Italian painter 2. 19th-century art movement 3. Small, thin, yet visible brush strokes 4. Open composition 5. Emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities 6. Ordinary subject matter 7. Inclusion of \\"movement\\" as a crucial element of human perception and experience 8. Unusual visual angles Now, we can start our search by identifying the art movement that fits these characteristics. In the 19th century, the art movement that matches these features is Impressionism. However, Impressionism is typically associated with French artists, such as Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. So, it is unusual to attribute an Italian painter as the best known for Impressionism. Italian painters during that period mostly embraced other styles, such as Macchiaioli and Divisionism. Based on the characteristics, Giovanni Boldini has some similarities to the Impressionist movement, although he is more closely associated with portraiture and genre painting. Additionally, another Italian painter, Federico Zandomeneghi, did become involved with the French Impressionists and exhibited his works in their exhibitions. Considering these factors, the answer is: Federico Zandomeneghi, an Italian painter who was associated with the French Impressionist movement during the 19th-century."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When he tried to do so, Howe ran into the same problem as before. The thread kept getting caught around the needle. The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe. They came up towards him with their spears raised. But suddenly the inventor noticed something. There was a hole in the tip of each spear. The inventor awoke from the dream, realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem. Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle, he should make a small hole in the center of the needle and have the thread run through it. This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the electric light, said his best ideas came into him in dreams. So did the great physicist Albert Einstein. To appreciate the value of dreams, you have to understand what happens when you are asleep. Even then, a part of your mind is still working. This unconscious , but still active part digests your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day. However, the unconscious part expresses itself through its own logic and its own language.. It uses strange images which the conscious part may not understand at first. This is why dreams are sometimes called \\"secret messages to ourselves\\". Question: Thomas Edison is mentioned because _ . Answer: A:","completion":"Thomas Edison is mentioned because he, along with other great inventors and thinkers like Albert Einstein, also credited some of his best ideas to his dreams.

Bure was born in Moscow in 1971 to Vladimir and Tatiana Bure. At age 12, his parents separated, and he remained with his mother. Vladimir Bure, a Russian swimming legend, had dreams of Pavel becoming a professional swimmer, but he aspired to play hockey at an early age. He attended his first tryout with the CSKA Moscow hockey school at the age of six, despite his limited skating ability. The New York Rangers acquired Bure on March 18, 2002, along with Florida's second-round pick in the 2002 draft (Lee Falardeau) for Igor Ulanov, Filip Novak, as well as the Rangers' first and second-round choices in the 2002 draft (Petr Taticek and Rob Globke, respectively) and a fourth-round choice in the 2003 draft. The Rangers had shown interest in Bure when he requested a trade from the Canucks in 1997. After losing their initial bid for Bure, Wayne Gretzky, who retired the same season Bure was dealt to Florida, announced prior to the 1999-2000 season he would have extended his career had the Rangers been able to pull off the trade. Bure made his Rangers debut against the Vancouver Canucks the day after his trade on March 19, scoring a goal against his former team. He scored 12 goals and 20 points in 12 games after being traded, bettering his pace with Florida that season. Between the two teams, he finished the season with 34 goals and 69 points. Bure suffered another knee injury in the 2002-03 pre-season; combined with a case of strep throat, he missed the first three games of the regular season. After returning to play, he had 14 goals and 21 points in his first 27 games, including two goals and an assist in his first game back, before a knee-on-knee collision in December forced him back out. After undergoing surgery 10 days later, it was revealed that there was no damage to the ACL as previously feared, but instead a tear to the meniscus in his left knee, which was repaired. Bure returned that season to appear in 39 games, managing 19 goals and 30 points. Even after two operations, Bure did not play in 2003-04 due to the lingering effects of the knee injury. He failed a pre-season physical and was declared medically unable to play. Left with his fully insured 10 million salary (80 percent of which would be reimbursed to the team), the Rangers left him unprotected in the NHL's Waiver Draft, where he was unclaimed.

Q:Given the following context: The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier. answer the following question: What was the full name of the person that had to change their plans when money was withheld?

The sentence provided information about General John W. \\"Iron Mike\\" O'Daniel going to Vietnam for studying and assessing the French forces but does not discuss any party that provided supplies to the Vietnamese communists. In order to answer the question about who was providing supplies to the Vietnamese communists fighting against France, we need to provide context and historical background information. During the First Indochina War (1946-1954), which was a conflict between the French colonial forces and the Viet Minh, the Vietnamese communists were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh aimed to gain independence from France and establish a communist government. To effectively fight against the French, the Viet Minh received assistance in the form of supplies and support from several sources, primarily the Soviet Union and Communist China. Both of these nations were interested in assisting the spread of communism in Asia and viewed Vietnam as a crucial front in the struggle against Western imperialism. The Soviet Union began to provide military aid in 1950, with supplies including small arms, ammunition, trucks, and military communications equipment. They also sent military advisors to assist in the strategy, planning, and training of Viet Minh troops, as well as offering them economic and political support. In the case of China, which shared a border with Vietnam, they provided more substantial support. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Mao Zedong's government took a more prominent role in backing the Viet Minh. Chinese military aid to the Viet Minh included weapons, ammunition, skilled military advisors, and logistical support through supply routes that stretched across China's southern border. Moreover, the Chinese government provided financial assistance, diplomatic backing, and even sent volunteer troops to help bolster Vietnamese forces. In summary, the primary suppliers of the Vietnamese communists fighting against France were the Soviet Union and Communist China. Both nations played a crucial role in supporting the Viet Minh's struggle for independence and the establishment of a communist regime in Vietnam."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed.

The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added. The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\" Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs. Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security. \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\" Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports. Question: When was trade a major topic of discussion for Trump? Options: - While renegotiating the US-Korea free trade deal - While renegotiating the NAFTA - During his presidential campaign - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"During his presidential campaign."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: CD-ROMs are popularly used to distribute computer software , including video games and multimedia applications, though any data can be stored (up to the capacity limit of a disc). Question: How many pages of text can you store onto a cd? Answer:","completion":"Yes, your statement about the CD-ROM is correct. To answer your question about how much text can be stored onto a CD-ROM, we first need to determine the capacity of a standard CD-ROM and then calculate the storage requirement for textual data. A typical CD-ROM has a storage capacity of around 650-700 Megabytes (MB). It's important to note that there are other variants like CD-R and CD-RW, but we will use the standard CD-ROM capacity for this calculation. Now, let's assume that one page of text contains approximately 2000 characters, including spaces and formatting. A single character requires 1 Byte for storage (using ASCII encoding), so 2000 characters would need 2000 Bytes or approximately 2 Kilobytes (KB) of space. To calculate the number of text pages a CD-ROM can hold, we need to first convert the CD-ROM's storage capacity to Kilobytes: 1 MB = 1024 KB For a 700 MB CD-ROM: 700 MB * 1024 KB/MB = 716800 KB Now, dividing the CD-ROM's capacity in KB by the storage requirement for one page: 716800 KB / 2 KB/page ≈ 358,400 pages Hence, a standard CD-ROM can store approximately 358,400 pages of text.

Michel Richard, Acclaimed Chef at Citronelle, Dies at 68 Michel Richard, a French-born chef whose French-Californian hybrid Citrus was one of the top restaurants in Los Angeles for more than a decade, and who gave Washington a major claim to be a serious dining city after he opened Citronelle there in 1993, died on Saturday in Washington. He was 68. The cause was complications of a stroke, said Mel Davis, his longtime publicist. Mr. Richard (pronounced ree-SHAR), a pastry chef by training, was an adventurous, jovial chef, fond of experimentation and open to the myriad culinary influences of his adopted country. He loved to cook, to please, to amuse and to astonish. His many signature dishes included “begula” (a play on “beluga”), a trick caviar made from Israeli couscous cooked in squid ink and served in a tin. His trompe l’oeil “lemon egg-ceptional” fooled diners by presenting them with an eggshell made of white chocolate encasing a “yolk” made of lemon meringue. On one occasion, at Citronelle, he served an entire dessert plate made to resemble breakfast foods: French toast with butter, a fried egg, a strip of bacon. “I want to create a festive feeling,” he told The Washington Post in 1998. “I want people to be surprised, to be happy. It doesn’t take a genius to do this. Just someone like me.” His sense of play rested on a solid foundation in French classical technique, although he was self-taught as a savory chef. In 2007, the James Beard Foundation named him outstanding chef of the year. Michel Louis-Marie Richard was born on March 7, 1948, in Pabu, Brittany. His laborer father, André, seeking construction work, moved the family to the Ardennes region. An abusive drunk, he left when Michel was 6. Michel’s mother, Muguette, supported the family, barely, by working in a factory. Michel found his vocation early, cooking for the family while still a child. When he was 9, a friend took Michel on a visit to his parents’ restaurant. “When we opened the back door of the restaurant and I entered the kitchen, it was for me paradise,” he told The Washington Post in 2006. “I helped the pastry chef to make a little tart. I looked into the dining room and saw these elegant people having a good time. I fell in love with it all.” At 14, he signed on as an apprentice with a baker in Reims, France, where he showed early signs of his inventive nature. “I began doing dinners at night in the pastry shop,” he told The New York Times in 2013. “You could say they were the first pop-ups.” He satisfied his military obligation by serving as a cook in the Army and then found work at a mediocre pastry shop in Paris. His luck turned when he was hired by the famed caterer and patissier Gaston Lenôtre, who sent him to New York in 1974 to open an American outpost, the Château France. The venture failed after three years, but Mr. Richard decided to stay, traveling to Santa Fe, N.M., to run the French Pastry Shop in La Fonda Hotel. In 1977 he opened a pastry shop on Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles, where he began experimenting with savory dishes on the side as he expanded the menu. With Citrus, he came into his own. The restaurant, which opened in 1987, offered a French interpretation of the local cuisine that Mr. Richard sometimes described as California Provençal. Influenced by nouvelle cuisine, he cut back on butter, cream and heavy sauces. Making use of his pastry training, he delighted the eye with fanciful forms and striking color combinations. Dishes like crab coleslaw and fried shrimp wrapped in filaments of shredded phyllo pastry became overnight stars, copied by chefs throughout the United States. Critics were dazzled by his oyster custard in spinach sauce, and by a “lasagna” of escargots and fried parsley. “Citrus has captured the mood of Los Angeles right now, and it has thereby captured the city’s imagination,” Ruth Reichl wrote in her review of the restaurant for The Los Angeles Times. The restaurant closed in 2001. In 1997 Mr. Richard sold half his interest in Citrus to the hotel management company Meristar, his partner in the first Citronelle, which opened in the Santa Barbara Inn Hotel in 1989. Subsequent versions of Citronelle opened in Baltimore, Tokyo and Carmel, Calif. His home base was the Citronelle in Washington, in the Latham Hotel in the Georgetown neighborhood. It became the city’s premier restaurant virtually overnight, a shooting star in a city long dominated by old-line steakhouses and embassy kitchens. It closed in 2012 after its building developed structural problems. In 2007 Mr. Richard opened Central Michel Richard on Pennsylvania Avenue, six blocks from the White House. Described on its website as a “modern American bistro with a French twist,” it was named the best new restaurant in the United States by the James Beard Foundation the next year. Mr. Richard, who lived in Potomac, Md., returned to New York to open Villard Michel Richard in the Villard Houses on Madison Avenue, formerly home to Gilt and Le Cirque 2000, in 2013. It was greeted with a punishing review by Pete Wells in The New York Times and closed in less than a year, although a bakery in the same building, Pomme Palais, remains open. Mr. Richard’s first two marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Laurence Retourné; five sons, Michael, Sebastien, Christophe, Luc and Clement; and a daughter, Christelle Richard. He was the author of “Richard’s Home Cooking with a French Accent” (1993) and “Sweet Magic: Easy Recipes for Delectable Desserts” (2010), but the title that best expressed his philosophy was “Happy in the Kitchen: The Craft of Cooking, the Art of Eating” (2006). “The way we should represent France is to make the food fun, charming, good, not pretentious,” Mr. Richard told The Times. “It should be like Renoir, Manet.” A version of this article appears in print on August 16, 2016, on page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Michel Richard, Chef, Is Dead at 68; Embraced ‘California Provençal’ Style.

The three films were directed by Vincenzo Natali , Andrzej Sekua , and Ernie Barbarash respectively . All three films are based on the same premise : there is a gigantic , mechanical , cubical structure of unknown purpose and origin , made up of lots of smaller cubical rooms . Each of these rooms has six doors , one on each face of the cube , which lead into adjacent , identically decorated rooms , only differing by colour . Some of these rooms are \`\` safe '' , while others are equipped with deadly booby traps such as flamethrowers and razorwire . In some cases it is possible to detect a trap by throwing an object into the room first , although this method is not always reliable due to the trigger mechanism of certain traps . In each case , a group of strangers awakens in this mysterious structure , without any knowledge of how or why they are there . In order to escape from the prison , they must band together and use their combined skills and talents to avoid the traps and navigate out of the maze , while also trying to solve the mystery of what the cube is and why they are in it . However , the pressure of being in the Cube generally turns one of the prisoners into a homicidal maniac who preys on the others . Cube Zero was slightly different from the first two films in that it also dealt with the people on the outside of the Cube whose job it was to control the cube and oversee those within . In March 2011 , Lionsgate announced it was considering an additional film in the series , tentatively titled Cube 3D . In April 2015 , The Hollywood Reporter announced that Lionsgate Films are planning to remake the original movie under the title Cubed , with Saman Kesh as director . - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County.

Answer: At one of the very worst sites, around Sandakan in Borneo, only six of some 2,500 British and Australian prisoners survived. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: Sandakan is located in the Sabah province of Malaysia, which is situated on the northeastern part of the island of Borneo. Sabah is one of thirteen states of Malaysia and shares its borders with the Malaysian state of Sarawak to the southwest, and with the Indonesian provinces of East Kalimantan and North Kalimantan to the south. The region's history dates back to the prehistoric era, with evidence of human habitation found in archaeological sites. In the 15th century, it became part of the Sultanate of Brunei, a powerful empire that controlled much of Borneo and the surrounding region. Over the years, European powers, such as the British, became interested in the area, resulting in the establishment of British North Borneo in 1881. During World War II, the Japanese invaded and occupied Borneo, including the town of Sandakan. The Sandakan POW camp was established, where around 2,500 British and Australian prisoners were held captive. The prisoners were subjected to forced labor, harsh living conditions, and frequent torture by the Japanese guards. One of the most notorious events that took place at the Sandakan camp was the series of death marches in 1945, where prisoners were forced to march over 260 kilometers through the Borneo jungle to the camp in Ranau. Many perished during these marches, and by the end of the war, only six of the original 2,500 prisoners had survived. Following the end of World War II, British North Borneo became a British Crown Colony, and it was merged with Sarawak and Singapore to form the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 - eventually becoming the state of Sabah. Today, Sandakan is an important port city, serving as a gateway to ecotourism destinations in Sabah, such as the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre and the Kinabatangan wildlife sanctuary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a young man, Gandhi studied law in London. The Hindu leaders had threatened to punish him. But he went to London anyhow. Gandhi believed in fighting without weapons or force. He called his method non-violence . He would simply disobey any unfair law or policy. He was willing to be punished for his actions. Gandhi thought that the law would be changed if enough people protested in this way. It would show how strongly the people felt about his beliefs. Gandhi wanted all Indians to understand the independence movement. He walked barefoot through the villages, speaking to all people. Many people loved and understood Gandhi. His movement grew. The British flag came down in 1947. The Indian people honored Gandhi with the title Mahatma, which means \\"Great soul\\". Gandhi was an unusual kind of leader. He promised never to make money for himself. He always wore simple clothes and sandals. He was shot and killed in 1948.

The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition. Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \\"futile\\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto. But it was House conservatives who defeated the 867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed. The House Freedom Caucus — a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House — had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow — it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive.

Unfortunately, my experience was deeply disappointing, and I feel it necessary to share my thoughts, as I don't want others to face the same letdown I did. Firstly, upon entering the restaurant, I found the ambiance to be quite dull. The lighting seemed too bright for a fine dining environment, while the tables were arranged too close together, leaving little room for privacy. As for the background music, it was an odd mix of dated pop songs and electronic beats that seemed out of place. Our server appeared promptly, but he seemed disinterested and lacked any genuine warmth. My initial enthusiasm began to wane as he brought out the menus without any enthusiasm or recommendations. Moreover, he left us waiting for far too long before taking our orders. I expect better service from an establishment that presents itself as upscale. The food, however, was the coup de grâce to the dismal evening. We began with the crab croquettes and truffle mushroom ravioli as recommended by other online reviewers. Both appetizers were underwhelming— the crab croquettes were overcooked and lacked any discernable crab flavor, while the mushroom ravioli contained only a stingy dollop of truffle filling. My partner's main course of steak frites was passable, but my seared scallops were severely overcooked and rubbery. To cap it all off, the accompanying mashed potatoes tasted like the packaged instant variety. In conclusion, \\"The Tasty Palette\\" simply does not live up to its name or the online hype. The uninspiring atmosphere, lackluster service, and sub-par food left me regretting my decision to dine here. I will not be returning and cannot recommend \\"The Tasty Palette\\" to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience. Rating: 1/5 stars --- B) Positive Yelp Review: Title: An Unexpected Culinary Delight I had the pleasure of dining at \\"Flavorful Oasis\\" recently, accompanied by a close friend who could not stop raving about the place. Truth be told, her praises hardly do justice to the culinary gem that is this charming eatery. As soon as we walked through the doors, we were enveloped by an enchanting ambiance. The thoughtful decor combined rustic and modern elements seamlessly, while the soft string lights and flickering candles set the stage for a cozy dining experience. The friendly hostess greeted us with warmth and promptly led us to our seats. Our server, Janet, approached us with genuine enthusiasm, showcasing her extensive knowledge of each dish and helping us navigate the menu, which featured a tempting array of dishes prepared with locally-sourced, seasonal ingredients. Her recommendations did not disappoint. We started with a beautifully-presented beet salad and a creamy burrata with heirloom tomatoes. Both appetizers left us craving more. For the main courses, I opted for the pan-seared salmon with lemon-dill sauce and my friend selected the perfectly cooked wild mushroom risotto. It surpassed all expectations— the flavors and textures melded together seamlessly, creating an absolutely divine experience. We couldn't resist ending our meal with their signature chocolate lava cake, served with fresh berries and a delightful scoop of house-made vanilla ice cream. It was without a doubt, one of the best desserts I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. Our entire dining experience at \\"Flavorful Oasis\\" was nothing short of spectacular. The ambiance, warm service, and extraordinary dishes make this restaurant a must-visit destination. I am already eagerly planning my next reservation and look forward to exploring more of their exquisite offerings. Rating: 5/5 stars"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However Armstrong makes a stand, trips, falls and is killed by the Alien that then leaves. A terrified Tammy finds Lee and they call the local authorities but their car is destroyed by the Alien. They run to a local cafÃ© where they meet Hilary, Javier, Figgus and Marcy who do not believe them. Together they go back where they find Garrison wounded and the other passenger gone. Garrison says that everyone else died. The Alien then appears and kills Marcy, and while the others flee it fights a cyborg-like Hunter.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Have you ever noticed that your fingertips are winked when you've just finished swimming or washing dishes? It seems as if your hands have aged 30 years in a second. But is this an accident? Or is it something that nature has built into our bodies? If your finger's wrinkling up had no use at all, \\" it wouldn't need to.\\" Professor Tom Smulders from Newcastle University, UK, told BBC News. By studying wet fingers closely, Smulders and his partners found that the wrinkles looked a bit like the patterns on the car tire or on the bottom of the running shoes. So they made a guess that wrinkles on fingers might be able to help the hand hold things more tightly. To test _ , researchers asked 20 people to pick up marbles from water with their hands. But before they started, some of the people had to keep their hands in water for half an hour. The researchers found that the people with wrinkled fingers completed the task the task faster than those with dry hands. But when they were asked to move dry marbles, all the people performed equally well, no matter they had the wrinkled fingers or not. Our ancestors might not have played with marbles, but wrinkled fingers could have made it easier for them to climb around in the wet forests and catch fish from rivers, researchers say. Similarly, our toes also get wrinkled in water. This may have developed from our ancestor's need to run on wet ground. But the question is, if wrinkled fingers are so helpful, why don't our hands just stay that way all the time? Researchers explained that wrinkling has its disadvantage: wet fingertips are far less sensitive than smooth ones, reducing our sense of touch.

After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber.

It shook upper Manhattan for blocks -- and when it was over, a five-story apartment building and its neighbor were gone. After Wednesday morning's deadly building explosion in East Harlem, squads of firefighters dug through piles of shattered bricks and beams. Ladder trucks sprayed water into the gap where the buildings once stood. As Detective Martin Speechly, a New York police spokesman, put it: \\"1644 Park Avenue appears not to be there anymore.\\" Along with that five-story apartment building, with a Latino evangelical church on the first floor, a neighboring piano store and the four floors above it collapsed in the blast. One nearby resident, Angelica Avila, told CNN she was trapped in her apartment down the block for a short time afterward. Her stepmother had to sneak in through the back to try and open the door for her, she said. \\"My neighbors came banging on my door. I guess they were evacuating the building, and I couldn't get out -- my door was jammed,\\" she said. \\"Everything off my windowsill fell, and I guess the impact of the explosion jammed the door as well.\\" Something similar happened to Aisha Watts, who had just returned to her apartment in one of the adjoining buildings after taking her children to school. Then the windows broke out, and \\"the walls came tumbling down,\\" Watts said. A neighbor helped her out of her apartment, because the door was stuck in its frame.

Movie plot title: The Cat o' Nine Tails Movie plot: Franco Arno (Karl Malden) a middle-aged blind man is walking down a street at night with his niece Lori (Cinzia De Carolis) when they pass by a man in a car. Franco overhears him mention blackmail. Franco bends over, feigning tying his shoes and asks Lori to describe the man in the parked car. Lori does, but says that she cannot see the other man clearly. They walk back to Franco's apartment nearby and while Lori sleeps, Franco works on a puzzle when he hears a noise. Outside, the unseen man in the parked car gets out and knocks out a night watchman by the gate of a large medical complex that stands right next to the apartment building where Franco lives. The unseen man uses a screwdriver to get inside the building, goes to Dr. Calabresi's office, unlocks it and gets inside. A doctor preparing to leave for the night sees the nightwatchman unconsicious and sees a dark figure running away.The next day, the police arrive at the Terzi Institute investigating the break-in. Carlo Giordani (James Franciscus) arrives and bumps into Franco outside the institute and helps the blind man up. Carlo introduces himself and says that he's a reporter investigating the break-in.

To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. But I can use this background: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. What is an answer for this question: Would test C see higher or lower concentration of the reactants than test D? The answer is:","completion":"Test C would see a lower concentration of reactants than Test D. Here's why: First, it's important to understand the core of Le Chatelier's principle. The principle explains how a system at equilibrium, when subjected to changes or 'stress,' will respond by trying to resist the change and restore equilibrium. Different kinds of 'stresses' such as changes in concentration of reactants or products, temperature, or pressure, can disrupt the chemical equilibrium. The system then reacts by shifting its equilibrium position to either favour the forward or the reverse reaction, depending on the type and direction of the stress applied. Now, in the context of John's experiment, Tests C and D involve a system responding differently to disruptions to its equilibrium. In Test C, John observes a forward reaction. This means that the reaction has shifted towards the product side. In terms of Le Chatelier’s principle, this is the system's response to counteract some stress, and the result is that the reactants are being consumed to produce more products. Therefore, the concentration of reactants would decrease as they're consumed in the forward reaction, leading to an increase in the concentration of the products. Conversely, in Test D, John observes a reverse reaction. In this case, the previously-formed products are being converted back into reactants. The system is again seeking to counteract some stress and regain equilibrium, but this time by minimizing the amount of products and increasing the amount of reactants. Therefore, in a reverse reaction, the concentration of products decrease, and the concentration of reactants increase. So, when comparing Test C and Test D, the concentration of reactants after Test C, where the forward reaction is favored, would be lower than after Test D, where the reverse reaction is favored. The forward reaction consumes reactants, reducing their concentration, and the reverse reaction generates reactants, increasing their concentration. Thus, according to Le Chatelier's principle and the given descriptions of Tests C and D, Test C would see a lower concentration of reactants than Test D."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Tip the flour into the sieve, and patting the sides, gently sift it through to the bowl below. Add the egg to the flour.","completion":"After adding the egg to the flour, the next steps in making a Melton Mowbray pork pie are as follows: 1. Create a well in the center of the sifted flour and egg mixture. Using a fork or your fingers, make a small indentation in the middle of the flour to create a well. 2. Incorporate the lard or butter into the flour mixture. Cut in the cold lard or butter into small cubes and add to the flour mixture. Using either a pastry cutter, your fingertips, or two knives, rub the fat into the flour until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. A food processor can also make this process relatively quick and simple. 3. Prepare the hot water crust pastry. In a small saucepan, heat the water and lard or butter together until they reach a boil. Once boiling, carefully pour the hot liquid into the well in the flour mixture. 4. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until it starts to come together. As the boiling liquid is added, the pastry will begin to form. Continue to stir until a rough dough forms. 5. Once the dough is cool enough to handle, use your hands to knead it slightly until it becomes smooth and even. Avoid overworking the dough, as it should remain pliable and easy to handle. 6. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. During this time, the dough will cool down further and become easier to shape. 7. Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) and prepare the filling. Mix the coarsely ground pork, finely chopped onions, and seasonings such as salt, pepper, sage, and thyme in a large bowl. 8. Roll out two-thirds of the rested dough to create the base and sides of the pie. Use a pie tin or a round mold as a guide for cutting out a circle slightly larger than your tin. Gently press the dough circle into the bottom and sides of the tin. 9. Fill the pie with the prepared pork mixture, packing it tightly to minimize air gaps. Make sure the filling is evenly distributed. 10. Roll out the remaining dough and cut a circle for the top of the pie. Lay the circle on top of the filled pie and press the edges firmly together to seal. Trim any excess dough. 11. Cut a small hole in the center of the pie lid to allow steam to escape during baking. Optionally, decorate the pie with remaining dough scraps, creating patterns or shapes if desired. 12. Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg to create a golden and glossy finish. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown, and the filling is cooked through. 13. When finished baking, let the pie cool for a few minutes in the tin before removing it. Transfer the pie to a wire rack and allow it to cool completely. Once your Melton Mowbray pork pie has cooled, cut it into slices and enjoy either warm or cold. The pie can be stored in the refrigerator for up to four days or frozen for later consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times, he says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened. In his... Question: Why do young people seem more willing to take adventures?

Premise: \\"niceties amenities and you'd probably like the pool there\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"You would enjoy the swimming pool.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"niceties amenities and you'd probably like the pool there,\\" the hypothesis \\"You would enjoy the swimming pool\\" appears to be true. The premise suggests that the individual, presumably the person for whom this statement was made, would likely appreciate or value the various pleasant characteristics of the place in question, with specific emphasis on the swimming pool as a notable and enjoyable feature. Let's break down the premise into its three main components: 1. \\"Niceties\\" - This refers to the attractive or enjoyable aspects of the location, hinting at an overall positive environment or setting. 2. \\"Amenities\\" - This term refers to the convenient features or facilities provided at the location, which typically contribute to an individual's comfort, leisure, or well-being. 3. \\"You'd probably like the pool there\\" - This statement explicitly mentions an assumption that the individual would be drawn to or find enjoyment in the swimming pool at the location. Given these three components, it is reasonable to assume that the hypothesis \\"You would enjoy the swimming pool\\" is indeed true, as the premise itself highlights the swimming pool as an aspect that the individual is likely to find appealing within the context of the other positive aspects of the location. Essentially, this hypothesis is a reasonable conclusion to draw based on the information provided in the premise. Of course, it's important to consider that the premise is making an assumption about the generalized preferences of the individual. Personal tastes and preferences can vary, and while the statement suggests that the swimming pool is expected to be a source of enjoyment for the individual, there might be circumstances or factors that could impact the individual's experience, such as swimming pool functionality, cleanliness, or personal reasons (e.g., an inability to swim).

Question: The Doctor studied two teams of people. Team N had no viral infections, while Team W had many people with HIV among its members. Obviously, team N had fewer health issues. Which team had fewer people receiving vaccinations for viral diseases? Hint: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it cannot be explicitly determined which team, Team N or Team W, had fewer people receiving vaccinations for viral diseases. However, we can make certain inferences and provide some context surrounding vaccinations and antiviral drugs. Vaccinations have been used for hundreds of years to prevent viral diseases. They work by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight against specific viruses, thereby preventing infections or lessening their severity. Vaccinations usually target specific diseases, such as measles, mumps, and influenza. While vaccinations are an effective preventative measure for many viral diseases, they are not necessarily an indication of a team's overall health status. On the other hand, antiviral drugs, like interferon and antiretroviral therapy (ART), are medications specifically designed to treat viral infections. These medications have been developed more recently, particularly in response to the AIDS epidemic. Antiviral drugs can help manage the symptoms and progression of diseases caused by viral infections, such as HIV. In the context of the question, Team N had no viral infections and potentially fewer health issues compared to Team W. It is possible that Team N had a higher rate of vaccination for certain viral diseases, as this could have contributed to their lower prevalence of infections. However, this is not a guaranteed assumption, as other factors such as immunity and health behaviors could also play a role in their overall health. Team W, with many people suffering from HIV infections, would likely have a higher use of antiviral drugs, specifically ART, to manage their health. While it is possible that some members of Team W had also received vaccinations for other viral diseases, the information given does not allow us to definitively determine which team had fewer vaccinations. In summary, it is not possible to conclusively identify which team had fewer vaccinations for viral diseases based solely on the information provided. However, it can be inferred that Team W would have a higher use of antiviral drugs such as ART to manage their HIV infections, while Team N may have had a higher rate of vaccinations for certain viral diseases, although this is not a guaranteed conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the below context: Elgar was contemptuous of folk music and had little interest in or respect for the early English composers, calling William Byrd and his contemporaries \\"museum pieces\\". Of later English composers, he regarded Purcell as the greatest, and he said that he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvořák and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Saëns and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.Elgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889–91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the...

Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen McAllister, a divorced small-town nurse whose depression... over the fact that the hospital ER she maintains may be forced to shut down because of a 100,000 debt is briefly lifted when she spots a newspaper picture taken by photojournalist Noah Greeley (David Cubitt). The picture shows an act of bravery performed by Noah's firefighter brother Hank (William Russ), who mysteriously left town 25 years ago and hasn't been seen since. Hank would like to quietly slip back into town without explanation or fanfare, but this proves impossible when Noah's newspaper posts a 50,000 reward to identify Hank, known only to the public as \\"John Christmas.\\" And there's something, very, very curious about that photo: It also shows a Santa Claus suit seemingly floating in midair without an occupant.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. This week on The Big Three, we tackled the George W. Bush library opening, frustration over flight furloughs (complete with congressional finger-pointing) and Dean Obeidallah's CNN.com column, \\"I'm a Muslim and I hate terrorism,\\" which seems sadly necessary in the wake of Boston. The opening of a presidential library is supposed to be a time for national unity. All the living presidents attend, standing together for a photo op and offering complimentary speeches about the newest inductee to the ex-presidents' club. But during all the same pageantry in Dallas at the opening of Bush's library, a less civil debate on the Big Three (and across the country) was going on about 43's legacy. Margaret Hoover is a proud Bush administration alumna and attended the opening in Dallas. Dean, it is fair to say, is not a Bush fan. At all. And so the debate raged, with Margaret citing his investment in foreign aid to stem the tide of AIDS in Africa and keeping the nation safe from terrorism after the attacks of 9/11. Dean acknowledged that Bush might be a nice guy to hang out with but asked whether the library would consist primarily of coloring books. As the card-carrying centrist in the group, I try to find common ground. And so it goes. At the time of our discussions, the sequester cuts were kicking in, and airline travelers were feeling the pain, with 40% of flights delayed this week because of the furlough of air-traffic controllers. Congress has since overwhelmingly approved a measure to get the air travel system up to speed again after the delays provoked a round of the blame game on Capitol Hill, with conservatives accusing the president of \\"playing politics\\" with these particular cuts. Margaret agreed with this assessment. I ain't buying it. The sequester was supposed to be so dumb and painful that it would compel Congress to reason together and find deficit and debt reduction to more strategic means. It didn't. And while the rhetoric of cutting government spending is popular, the reality is predictably less so. And so we're being treated to the absurdity of conservative activist groups such as Americans for Prosperity -- whose sole purpose is to argue for cuts in government spending -- complaining about the practical effects of those very cuts on which they insisted. This is the old dynamic we see too much of -- cuts for thee but not for me. Finally, in the wake of the Boston terror attacks, America and the American Muslim community have navigated the tricky territory of confronting the ideology of radical Islam that apparently inspired the attacks without engaging in group blame. Dean's excellent CNN.com column tries to clarify some of the bigoted myths by making the point that American Muslims might hate jihadis even more than typical Americans do because the murderers claim to represent their faith and cause a massive backlash against this growing American community. Read the column -- and then listen to our conversation, tackling subjects such as why extremists of other faiths tend not to blow things up. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The Big Three discussions this week covered the George W. Bush library opening, flight furlough frustrations, and Dean Obeidallah's CNN.com column about being a Muslim who hates terrorism. The Bush library opening sparked debates about his legacy, with Margaret Hoover praising his efforts in foreign aid and securing the nation after 9/11, while Dean Obeidallah remained critical. Regarding flight furloughs, conservatives accused the president of playing politics with the sequester cuts, while others pointed out that the reality of cutting government spending is predictably unpopular. Finally, Dean's column addressed the need for understanding between Americans and the American Muslim community, emphasizing that American Muslims hate jihadis for misrepresenting their faith and causing backlash against their community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Holly crap this place actually exists. I must enter and EAT. ....Pull...PULL...the door is locked!!!! Damn Sundays!!!! I must return. Well I finally made it Monday night. I surely hope the food lives up to my anticipation. I walk in to rather large dining room with the menu on the wall in the back. As I gaze at the menu I see alligator sausage (mmmmm), crawfish, shrimp, andouille, catfish, and Po' Boys. We started with the Gator Bites. Wonderful cornmeal breading fried and served with two sauces. This is actually the best deep fried pieces of gator I've had. Not even close to chewy. The GF decided to get the BBQ shrimp and Andouille ( comes with 2 sides and salad ). She chose the Red Beans and Rice and the Sweet Potato Hush Puppies. This was a huge meal. Loaded with shrimp and andouille. This almost came as a gumbo with rice an excellent Cajun sauce that had the right amount of seasoning and heat. WOW this was a wonderful dish. The red beans and rice were awesome but the Sweet Potato Hush Puppies are where it's at. I do not know how I have lived my life for the past 23 yrs with out eating these. Our server said her mom came up with the recipe one day. OMG these are worth a trip there alone. I got the Catfish plate ( comes with one side and a salad ), I chose the Jambalaya. The catfish brought back memories to the last time I was in New Orleans and I ate catfish at a restaurant right on the river with my great grandparents. It was fried perfectly with a wonderful cornmeal batter. The catfish basket had two huge filet's ( probably 8-9 in. each ). This was the best catfish I have had in a VERY long time. The Jambalaya was excellent as well. This was a lot of food. We took home our salads and some of our entrees. I eat A LOT and I was full. My whole family consists of Louisiana natives and some still live their. This food takes me right back. I cannot explain how authentic this is. For those of you out there that want to try some great food hit this place up. They also have Seafood, Cold, and hot PO' Boys for those a little less adventurous.

Possible answers: --yes --it is not possible to tell --no...I think the answer is","completion":"After analyzing the given information, the answer is a more detailed and long explanation as follows: According to the statement, \\"A baby smiles at a woman across the table,\\" we understand that a baby is looking at a woman and showing happiness or amusement by smiling. In this scenario, there exists a subject, a verb, and an object. The subject is the baby, the verb is 'smiles at,' and the object is 'a woman across the table.' This information showcases an interaction between the baby and the woman. On the other hand, the statement \\"The woman is asleep\\" adds another layer of context to the situation. Here, the subject is 'the woman,' the verb is 'is,' and the predicate adjective is 'asleep.' This statement implies that the woman is not conscious or aware of her surroundings, as she is sleeping. Now, let us examine the question: Is it possible to conclude that \\"A baby smiles at a woman across the table\\" if \\"The woman is asleep\\"? To answer this question, we should consider the possibility of interaction between these two individuals based on the given information. Since the baby is smiling at the woman, it indicates that there might be a connection between them. However, this information is insufficient to discern whether the woman is aware of the baby's smile or not. Furthermore, the fact that the woman is asleep suggests that she is not conscious and actively interacting with the baby. Thus, it is not possible to conclusively infer whether the baby's smile at the woman is due to the woman's awareness or response. Consequently, we can neither definitively affirm nor negate the connection between the baby's smile and the woman.

It suggests that the current system, where convicted individuals can sit on death row for months or years, causes the punishment to lose its intended meaning. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that capital punishment would make more sense if it was immediately carried out after the crime.

The hypothesis proposes that capital punishment's immediacy would make it more sensible.

The premise provides information about how capital punishment was conducted in the past and its potential loss of meaning due to delays in the modern era. The hypothesis suggests that capital punishment would make more sense if it was immediate.

Jeanette Anna MacDonald (June 18, 1903 - January 14, 1965) was an American singer and actress best remembered for her musical films of the 1930s with Maurice Chevalier (The Love Parade, Love Me Tonight, The Merry Widow and One Hour With You) and Nelson Eddy (Naughty Marietta, Rose-Marie, and Maytime). During the 1930s and 1940s she starred in 29 feature films, four nominated for Best Picture Oscars ( Unlike Nelson Eddy, who came from opera to film, MacDonald in the 1940s yearned to reinvent herself in opera. She began training for this goal with Lotte Lehmann, one of the leading opera stars of the early 20th century. \\"When Jeanette MacDonald approached me for coaching lessons\\", wrote Lehmann, \\"I was really curious how a glamorous movie star, certainly spoiled by the adoration of a limitless world, would be able to devote herself to another, a higher level of art. I had the surprise of my life. There couldn't have been a more diligent, a more serious, a more pliable person than Jeanette. The lessons which I had started with a kind of suspicious curiosity, turned out to be sheer delight for me. She studied Marguerite with me--and lieder. These were the ones which astounded me most. I am quite sure that Jeanette would have developed into a serious and successful lieder singer if time would have allowed it.\\" MacDonald made her opera debut singing Juliette in Gounod's Romeo et Juliette in Montreal at His Majesty's Theatre (May 8 and 10, 1943). She quickly repeated the role in Quebec City (May 12), Ottawa, and Toronto. Her U.S. debut with the Chicago Opera Company (November 4, 11 and 15, 1944) was in the same role. She also sang Marguerite in Gounod's Faust with the Chicago Opera. In November 1945, she did two more performances of Romeo et Juliette and one of Faust in Chicago, and two Fausts for the Cincinnati Opera. On December 12, 1951, she did one performance of Faust with the Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera Company at the Academy of Music. Claudia Cassidy, the music critic of the Chicago Tribune wrote: \\"Her Juliet is breathtakingly beautiful to the eye and dulcet to the ear.\\" The same critic reviewed Faust: \\"From where I sit at the opera, Jeanette MacDonald has turned out to be one of the welcome surprises of the season... her Marguerite was better than her Juliet...beautifully sung with purity of line and tone, a good trill, and a Gallic inflection that understood Gounod's phrasing....You felt if Faust must sell his soul to the devil, at least this time he got his money's worth.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What other operas did she sing?","completion":"Jeanette Anna MacDonald sang in several operas.

Marty is a high-powered single literary agent in Manhattan. Marie (also Moore) is a widow in Provence with two daughters and a peaceful life. Marty has been seeing a therapist to deal with her vivid dreams of Marie's life; when Marie falls asleep she dreams Marty's life, but is much less disturbed by it. Each woman is convinced that the other is a figment of her imagination. When Marty meets Aaron they become friends and eventually lovers; terrified that her vivid other life means that she's losing her mind, Marty does not want to tell Aaron about it but finally does. Marie, meanwhile, has met William; she too is reluctant to tell William about her dreams, particularly since she (as Marty) is falling in love with Aaron, but realizes that she cannot keep such an important part of her life a secret. The two men react very differently: William is jealous, while Aaron is skeptical but not at all threatened, and wants only for Marty to be happy. Dreams and real life begin to merge when Marie goes on holiday with William to Paris, and Marty wakes up with an ashtray from the hotel on her night stand.

Summarize the following: Before you can accept Jesus, you must first believe. Christians believe God created the heavens and the earth. When Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, mankind became cursed with original sin. However, God sent down his son Jesus Christ to die for everyone’s sins, granting forgiveness. John 3:16 reads, “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” By believing in Jesus, you can gain eternal life by going to Heaven. As a born again Christian, you will also accept Jesus into your heart as your personal savior. You are acknowledging that Jesus died for your sins and, through him, you are made righteous before God. It’s very easy to accept Jesus! You just need to believe and pray to him, asking him into your heart. Here’s an example prayer: “Dear Lord Jesus, I know I am a sinner, but you died for those sins. I welcome you into my heart as my personal savior. Thank you for dying for my sins so that I can be forgiven. In your name I pray, Amen.” You can find many example prayers online. Repenting means to feel regret and remorse for your sins. Essentially, you’re acknowledging that you did wrong and are sorry for it. You can repent by telling God in prayer that you know you sinned and are very sorry for it. In the future, do your best to avoid sinning, as part of regret is trying to do better. Say, “God, I know I have sinned. I am very sorry for the things I’ve done wrong and want to do better through you. Thank you for forgiving all of my mistakes. In the name of Christ I pray, Amen.” Some Christians believe you don't need to join a church to be a born again Christian, while others believe you must. Joining a church can help you learn more about the Bible, connect with other believers, and grow in your faith. It's a good idea to visit a few churches before you pick one to join. As an alternative, you can watch religious services on TV or online. You can find a minister at a local church. Baptism is very important for being born again. The minister will dunk you underwater, then bring you back up. It symbolizes passing away and re-emerging from the water a new person. Through it, you are born again. Mark 16:16 reads, \\"He that believes and is baptized shall be saved, and he that disbelieves shall be condemned.\\" How and where you are baptized will depend on your church. You may be baptized in a tub inside the church, or you might be baptized in a lake or other waterway. Some churches will only baptize you if you are a member. You could join the church, or you could look for a church that does not require membership. The Holy Spirit is a comforter sent by God after Jesus left the earth. You will also receive the gifts and fruits of the Holy Spirit, which help you be a stronger Christian. All you need to do to receive the Holy Spirit is to welcome Him into your life, such as through prayer. Say, “I welcome the Holy Spirit into my life, Amen.” The 9 fruits of the spirit include love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self control. The 9 gifts of the spirit include knowledge, wisdom, prophecy, faith, healing, working miracles, discerning of spirits, speaking in tongues (holy languages), and interpretation of tongues (holy languages).","completion":"To accept Jesus, one must first believe in him. Christians believe that God created everything and that humanity inherited original sin after Adam and Eve's disobedience. God sent Jesus to die for everyone's sins, granting forgiveness and eternal life to believers. By accepting Jesus into one's heart as a personal savior, a person becomes born again. Repentance involves admitting and feeling sorry for sins, while baptism represents the individual's rebirth. Joining a church, though debated, can aid in spiritual growth. Receiving the Holy Spirit involves welcoming it into one's life, after which believers receive spiritual gifts and fruits to strengthen their faith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

UPDATED:. 12:42 EST, 7 January 2014. Dennis Rodman has lashed out at a CNN anchor after being asked to explain his motivations for his second trip to North Korea. The former NBA star started screaming at New Day anchor Chris Cuomo after the host pressed him about whether or not he would advocate on behalf of imprisoned American Kenneth Bae. While he maintains that the trip is not a political one, Rodman went on to imply that Bae, a missionary, was at fault for his 15-year prison sentence even though the North Korean government has yet to announce the charges against him. Scroll down for video. Angry: Dennis Rodman started yelling during a CNN interview Tuesday morning when pressed about why he felt it was appropriate to go to North Korea in spite of the regime's dictatorship. Looking for answers: CNN anchor Chris Cuomo asked if Rodman was going to advocate on behalf of imprisoned missionary Kenneth Bae and the former basketball player snapped. 'The one thing about politics, Kenneth Bae did one thing. If you understand — if you understand what Kenneth Bae did. Do you understand what he did? In this country?' Rodman said to Cuomo. 'What did he do? You tell me,' Cuomo said. 'You tell me. You tell me. Why is he held captive?' Rodman said, growing visibly agitated. Cuomo and Rodman began speaking over each other and fellow basketball player Chris Smith tried to calm Rodman down but he waved him off, saying 'I would love to speak on this' before deflecting and focusing on the team of former NBA players who traveled to the rogue nation to participate in what they see as a diplomatic sports trip. At one point during the interview, Rodman yelled out at Cuomo, saying: 'I don't give a rats ass what you think!' Group effort: The whole team of nine Americans were seated for the CNN interview but only two spoke. Support: Rodman praised the players that joined him, calling them the 'sole survivors' after others dropped out. 'It's amazing how we strive on negativity. This guy this leader, do [sic] anyone know this guy is only 31 years old?' The eccentric Chicago Bulls star went from praising 'my friend' Kim Jong Un to praising the sacrifices that his fellow Americans have made by traveling with him- 'We've got ten guys here who left their families... do you understand that?' he said at one point. He started off by explaining that the trip is 'not a good idea, the one thing that we're doing- it's a great idea for the world- for the world. People always come down on things I do and it's weird, it's like \\"Wow, really?\\" You got Michael Jordan, you got LeBron James and they can do all the cool things in the world but me its like why North Korea?' After listing off some of his better-known former NBA stars that traveled with him, Rodman praised the men for being 'the last sole survivors' who agreed to go with him. 'I've had a lot of guys pull out,' he said. Dennis Rodman coaches from court side as North Korean and US basketball players practice in Pyongyang. A bottle of vodka with handmade illustrations of Rodman with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was presented to the flamboyant athlete. Dennis Rodman reaches to take a personalised bottle of vodka from his bodyguard. He sees the game as a 'birthday present' for Kim and his country. Former Knicks star Chris Smith was far calmer during his talking points, saying that the group just saw the trip as another opportunity to use basketball to connect people. 'We're apologetic. We did not know it was going to take this type of negative spin,' Smith said, though at another point he said that 'you'd have to live under a rock not to know the press that was coming'. Rodman's squad - featuring ex-All Stars Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson and Vin Baker - will play against a team of North Koreans on Wednesday, which is believed to be Kim's birthday. Upon their Monday arrival in Pyongyang, Rodman told The Associated Press he was glad to be in North Korea for the game, though he said he has gotten death threats for his repeated visits. He said proceeds from the game would go to a charity for the deaf in North Korea.

Rodman, center, is surrounded by media as he arrives at the departure hall of Beijing International Capital Airport on Monday. ‘The marshal is actually trying to change this country in a great way,’ Rodman said of Kim, using the leader's official title. ‘I think that people thought that this was a joke, and Dennis Rodman is just doing this because fame and fortune.’ Instead, he said, he sees the game as a ‘birthday present’ for Kim and his country. ‘Just to even have us here, it's an awesome feeling. I want these guys here to show the world, and speak about North Korea in a great light,’ he said. ‘I hope people will have a different view about North Korea.’ NBA Commissioner David Stern issued a statement Monday night. ‘The NBA is not involved with Mr Rodman's North Korea trip and would not participate or support such a venture without the approval of the U.S. State Department,’ Stern said. ‘Although sports in many instances can be helpful in bridging cultural divides, this is not one of them.’ Rodman is the highest-profile American. to meet Kim since the leader inherited power after his father, Kim Jong. Il, died in late 2011. Dennis Rodman holds a cigar as he speaks to North Korean basketball players during a practice session in Pyongyang, North Korea. Dennis Rodman meets with former North Korean basketball player Ri Myung Hun, left, in Pyongyang, North Korea. Kim. Jong Un announced recently that he ordered the execution of his uncle. who previously served as his number two, but Rodman avoided answering. any questions about the execution when pressed by Cuomo. ‘It's. about trying to connect two countries together in the world, to let. people know that: Do you know what? Not every country in the world is. that bad, especially North Korea,’ Rodman told The Associated Press in. an interview outside his Beijing hotel before his flight to North Korea. ‘People say so many negative things about North Korea. And I want people in the world to see it's not that bad.' The. U.S. is at odds with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program, and. Rodman has been faulted for not talking about North Korea's human rights. record, described as one of the world's worst by activists, the U.S. State Department and North Korean defectors. The. defectors have repeatedly testified about the government's alleged use. of indiscriminate killings, rapes, beatings and prison camps holding as. many as 120,000 people deemed opponents of authoritarian leader Kim Jong.

Horseplay: Dennis Rodman on Kim Jong Un's steed last year. The U.S. players are to compete in an exhibition game against a North Korean team on Wednesday, Kim's birthday. ‘Somehow we have to get along, and no matter what disagreements or what discrepancy we have in life,’ Rodman said. ‘It's. like saying: Why do we have the Olympics? When everyone one comes. together in the Olympics, there's no problems. That's what I'm doing. That's all I'm doing.’ The fact that Rodman has developed a friendship with Kim Jong Un will seem surreal to many. A. picture surfaced on Monday of the former basketball player riding the. tyrant’s horse last summer, which makes the relationship seem even more. bizarre.

Florence Fuller was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 1867, a daughter of Louisa and John Hobson Fuller. She had several siblings, including sisters Amy and Christie, both of whom subsequently became singers. The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of Jane Sutherland, referred to in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as \\"the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature\\".Fuller's uncle was Robert Hawker Dowling, a painter of orientalist and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age thirty. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the Royal Academy. He returned to Australia in 1885, and Fuller became his pupil. In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for Barak–last chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines, a formal oil on canvas portrait of the Indigenous Australian leader, William Barak. Ultimately, that painting was acquired by the State Library of Victoria. Although the painting is an important work regularly used to illustrate this significant figure in Australia's history, interpretations of Fuller's portrait are mixed: one critic noted the painting's objectivity and avoidance of romanticising Aboriginal people, while another concluded that \\"Fuller is painting an ideal rather than a person\\".In 1886, Dowling returned to his native England.

Write a title: The Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association blasted Alaska Air Group Inc. yesterday over its plan to cut roughly 900 jobs, saying the effort violates its contract and quot;flies in the face quot; of past calls to improve in-house maintenance.","completion":"Title: The Turbulent Skies: AMFA Denounces Alaska Air Group's Job Cuts as a Breach of Contract and Neglect of In-House Maintenance Introduction: The Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA) expressed its vehement criticism of Alaska Air Group Inc.'s recent announcement to eliminate around 900 jobs in a cost-cutting measure. According to the AMFA, this decision not only breaches the terms of their existing contract but also directly conflicts with previous calls made by industry leaders to enhance in-house maintenance capabilities. This article delves into the details of this contentious issue, evaluating the implications created by the job cuts and exploring the underlying factors that have led to this situation. Background: Alaska Air Group Inc., the parent company of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, has had a long-standing relationship with the AMFA, which represents the interests of its aircraft mechanics and related employees. The airline industry has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including the unprecedented impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a financial strain on airlines worldwide. Amid these trying times, Alaska Air Group announced its intention to reduce its workforce by approximately 900 jobs, affecting various departments, including their in-house maintenance team. AMFA's Denouncement: The AMFA staunchly opposed this decision and expressed its concerns in a public statement, asserting that the job cuts violate the terms of the contract between the association and Alaska Air Group. Moreover, the AMFA argued that these cuts starkly contradict earlier calls by industry leaders and experts, who emphasized the importance of bolstering in-house maintenance capabilities to ensure optimal safety, efficiency, and financial stability within the airline industry. Potential Implications and Impact: The proposed job cuts by Alaska Air Group have far-reaching implications. Firstly, the cuts could lead to a legal dispute as the AMFA claims the decision breaches their contract. This might result in a lengthy and costly court battle, further straining the airline's financial resources. Furthermore, these job cuts may have an adverse effect on employee morale, as the affected workers face uncertainty regarding their livelihoods. This could potentially lead to a decline in productivity, impacting the airline's overall performance. Additionally, the AMFA's concerns regarding the reductions in in-house maintenance workforce raise valid questions about the long-term effects on the airline's operations. A diminished maintenance team could result in deferred maintenance work, potentially leading to safety risks and additional costs for outsourcing maintenance tasks to third parties. The Underlying Factors: Alaska Air Group's decision, while seemingly sudden, can be traced back to an array of factors, including the ongoing financial pressures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing competition in the industry, and a trend towards cost-saving measures. While airlines must make tough choices to remain financially viable in this highly competitive sector, it is crucial to consider the long-term implications of such decisions carefully. Conclusion: The Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association's denouncement of Alaska Air Group's job cuts speaks to broader concerns within the airline industry. While cost-cutting measures may seem like a necessary response to the unprecedented challenges facing airlines, it is essential to analyze the potential impact on contractual obligations, employee morale, and operational safety. As this situation unfolds, all stakeholders will need to engage in open dialogue and carefully assess the implications of their actions, ensuring that the long-term sustainability of the airline industry is not compromised."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

This ruling, handed down by the court, comprises four women and one man, all from the insular Amish sect in Bergholz, Ohio. This surprising case revolves around their unprovoked, aggressive campaigns targeting members of rival Amish groups. In what is seen as a display of dominance and hostility, these individuals sought to attack the symbol of manhood within the Amish culture - hair. The sentences imposed range from one to seven years, reflecting the severity of each offender's actions. This conviction and resulting incarceration bring into sharp focus the unforeseen victims of this crime of hate - the children left behind by their imprisoned parents. For these innocent young ones of the Bergholz sect, the consequences run deep. Being Amish means living within a tightly-knit community, strongly centered on family. However, their parents' sentencing disrupts their normalized lifestyle. Despite this unfortunate circumstance, the children will not be left to fend for themselves. Committed to the communal ethos, other parents within the Bergholz sect have stepped forward to assume the responsibilities of the convicted individuals, ensuring a continued nurturing environment for these children. The collected community aim to protect them from the harsher realities of their parents' actions and incorporated jail term. This unforeseen circumstance puts the spotlight on the previously unheard-of hostility between different Amish groups. Known for their dedication to a simple, peaceful lifestyle, such incidents represent a significant departure from the typical conduct within the Amish community. While this situation serves a significant blow to the close-knit Bergholz community, it could be viewed as a potential turning point. It has shown that even within insular societies, transgressions cannot be hidden and will be addressed by the law. Moreover, the stepping up of other parents to care for the children left behind portrays a resilient community ready to face hardship while still maintaining their core value of communal support. In conclusion, as the ripple effects of this crime continue to unfold, the Amish group in Bergholz, Ohio, remains more united than ever. Their collective response to adversity is a testament to their resilience, while the enforced sentences serve as a firm reminder that hate crimes will not be tolerated, regardless of the societal structure within which they occur. One cannot help but hope that this episode indeed marks the end of an era of rivalry between the Amish sects and initiates a renewed emphasis on the traditional communal Amish values of peace and harmony. Step-by-step justification: 1) Started by providing a background on the incident, including details of the group and the nature of the crime. 2) Explained the significance of the \\"hair\\" in Amish culture and the severity of the crime. 3) Relayed information about the sentencing. 4) Highlighted the impact of the incarceration on the children and how the community would support them. 5) Brought attention to uncommon hostility within the Amish community. 6) Ended by emphasizing the resilience of the community and hope for the future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tim knew his father didn't believe he could be a racer: only last year, he had sent Tim to a doctor to ask why his son wasn't a better runner. The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he didn't like to run. Tim, who had always preferred a good book to P.E. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school's Spring Fun Run. Tim answered, \\"I'm going to try to win, but Angela is so quick! No one ever beats her at recess.\\" \\"Well, we'll be there for you, either way\\" his mother said. Tim took an apple and walked to the bus. Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. He didn't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be. 3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. All the other students had brought running shorts, but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants. Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him. It was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run. By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. Tim's father asked, \\"What took you so long? I'm surprised to see you here at all! Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn't win?\\" Tim thought about why he signed up. It wasn't about winning the race, or making his father proud. It was about finishing, and showing himself that the doctor was right: he could be anything he wanted to be, like his favorite character, Simon. 1. What did Tim say? 2. to whom? 3. when? 4.

The nigiri looked as if a first time sushi maker made them the cut of the fish was a joke. I would avoid this place at all cost as the price does not match the quality.","completion":"The review is negative. The reviewer provided several reasons indicating their dissatisfaction with both the food and service at the restaurant. Firstly, the reviewer mentioned that their wife could not eat more than two of the salmon skin rolls, which implies that they were not pleased with the taste or quality of the dish. The use of the adjective \\"horrible\\" further supports the negative sentiment towards this particular meal. Secondly, the reviewer criticized the appearance and quality of the nigiri, stating that it looked as if it was made by an inexperienced sushi maker. The phrase \\"the cut of the fish was a joke\\" suggests that the reviewer believes the skill level and technique of the sushi preparation were inadequate and failed to meet their expectations. Lastly, the reviewer urged others to avoid the restaurant, stating that the price does not match the quality. This implies that the reviewer found the restaurant to be overpriced given the quality of food and service they experienced. This further solidifies the negative tone of the review. In summary, the reviewer expressed unhappiness with multiple aspects of their dining experience, from the food preparation and taste to the overall value for money spent.

As the question asks for an alternative description of where phytoplankton get their energy for food, and given all the choices provided, the only sound option is \\"sunlight energy.\\" This is because the question didn't propose any change, shift or alternative scenario but simply repeated the original condition, hence, the answer should remain the same. All the other answer choices relate to different types of energy or matter that were not mentioned in the original statement. The phytoplankton's method of food production as described is directly linked to sunlight, and not to any of the other forms of energy or matters listed in the options.

The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the 21st most extensive in area. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state. Humans have inhabited the land now known as Missouri for at least 12,000 years. The Mississippian culture built cities and mounds, before declining in the 1300s. When European explorers arrived in the 1600s they encountered the Osage and Missouria nations. The French established Louisiana, a part of New France, and founded Ste. Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. After a brief period of Spanish rule, the United States acquired the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Americans from the Upland South, including enslaved African Americans, rushed into the new Missouri Territory. Many from Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee settled in the Boonslick area of Mid-Missouri. Soon after, heavy German immigration formed the Missouri Rhineland. Missouri played a central role in the westward expansion of the United States, as memorialized by the Gateway Arch. The Pony Express, Oregon Trail, Santa Fe Trail, and California Trail all began in Missouri. As a border state, Missouri's role in the American Civil War was complex and there were many conflicts within.

Given the question: Question: When giving assistance to family members in need you may feel what? Options: - death - pleasure - reward - satisfaction - sadness The answer is \\"pleasure\\" because The answer is:","completion":"\\"Pleasure\\" - because when giving assistance to family members in need, it is common to experience positive emotions such as pleasure, satisfaction, and a sense of reward. This is due to a variety of psychological, social, and emotional factors that are at play when we help those we care about, particularly our family members. Firstly, family members typically hold a special place in our hearts and lives. They are often our primary source of support, love, and connection. Therefore, when we see them in need, it is natural for us to want to provide help and comfort. Doing so allows us to strengthen the bonds we share with them, which can lead to feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. Secondly, giving assistance taps into our innate altruistic nature. This desire to help others is built on empathy and compassion – the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes and understand their emotions, needs, and experiences. When we act on that empathy by offering help to a struggling family member, we not only feel good about our actions but also experience an increase in self-esteem and self-worth. This positive reinforcement can lead to feelings of pleasure as we realize that we possess the ability to make a meaningful difference in someone's life. Moreover, when we help others, particularly family members, we often receive gratitude and appreciation in return. This positive feedback can contribute to feelings of pleasure as we recognize that our efforts were valued and appreciated by the person in need. Finally, assisting family members can help us develop a sense of purpose in our lives. When we see the direct impact that our actions have on improving someone's situation, we gain a deeper understanding of our role within the family and our ability to contribute positively to their well-being. This sense of purpose can be incredibly rewarding and fulfilling, further enhancing the pleasurable sensations we may experience when providing aid to family members in need. It is worth noting that negative emotions, such as sadness, may also arise when aiding family members, particularly when the situation is challenging or emotionally intense. Nevertheless, the overall experience of helping family members is typically dominated by positive emotions such as pleasure, satisfaction, and a sense of reward, which is why the answer to the given question is \\"pleasure.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Collections of beautifully shot images of people's passions -- food, fashions, architecture, etc. -- helped make Pinterest a hit. Now Houzz, the interior-design platform, is turning similar photos into extremely popular mobile apps that tap into the home improvement craze. At its core, Houzz is an addictive, never-ending gallery of luscious images of home interiors and exteriors. Its website and apps are popular resources for people who idly dream of redoing their homes or moving into new ones. Home improvement and design, both the real and daydream variety, is a hot industry right now. Just look at the glut of home improvement and house-flipping shows that fill up channels such as HGTV. The home improvement product market is expected to hit 287 billion in 2013, according to the Home Improvement Research Institute. Houzz gently guides people through the process. You begin by looking at bathrooms, graduate to having a scrapbook of dream bathrooms, then read the Houzz tutorials on bathroom renovation and eventually hire someone through its directory or local experts on bathroom renovation. \\"Many times people start on the inspiration side but end up taking actions because of that,\\" said Houzz founder Adi Tatarko. \\"People became very obsessed with it.\\" Tatarko and her husband, Alon Cohen, were working full time and raising their two children in the Bay Area when they started a home renovation project four years ago. They had difficulty finding professionals and found that contractors too had their own frustrations with customers expecting too much. \\"There was lots of miscommunication in the process,\\" Tatarko said. The couple started Houzz in 2009 as a side project, but the next year it went from a hobby to a full-fledged business. The Palo Alto, California-based company now has 120 employees, and its iOS app has more than 100,000 five-star reviews in the Apple App Store. Every month, 15 million people search Houzz by room, style or metro area -- more than half through a smartphone or tablet. The company has a library of more than 2 million images. The sheer volume of photos housed in Houzz means you can spend hours drilling down into your particular project, say, ideas for Mediterranean-style storage closets in Austin, Texas. Browsing high-resolution photos is the initial draw. You can save favorites into Ideabooks for later -- for example, a selection of outdoor wall gardens or midcentury modern living room chairs in a particular shade of yellow. But for Houzz, the money comes when people take action. Interior designers, contractors and architects upload many of the images. There are more than 250,000 such professionals active on Houzz. What makes the app more than just pretty pictures is the information that goes with each image. You can click to see the companies and people who worked on a project, ask questions about how they did certain things or where to find furniture or other products. The people who post images are good about providing answers. There also is a directory of professionals with reviews, sort of an Angie's List but with splashier visuals. Going local is a key part of Houzz's business. If you see a dreamy spread in a magazine such as Dwell, the information disclosing who worked on a house is only useful if you live in that area. Houzz shows examples of work from people close enough to hire, divided into 425 metro areas. A Houzz survey (PDF) of 100,000 people found that 84% of respondents were planning to decorate or redecorate, 40% were considering remodeling or building an addition, and 10% were planning on building a custom home. Online tools are an increasingly important resource for the people diving into these projects and the professionals hoping to get their business. Also, 18% of people said they were renovating to incorporate new technologies into their homes. While free to users, Houzz is making money from brand-name partnerships with big companies such as Kohler and Nest, and through a subscription marketing program for professionals. Investors said they are confident the company will be profitable -- it's raised 48.6 million in funding so far. Tatarko said she hopes Houzz will help more people jump from fantasizing about home improvement to picking up a hammer themselves or a phone to reach someone who uses hammers professionally. \\"Our homes are a very significant part of our lives,\\" she said. \\"I think it (home improvement) was just so hard before, so people just stayed away from it.\\" Highlights:","completion":"- Houzz is a popular interior-design platform that offers a gallery of home interior and exterior images, acting as a valuable resource for people looking to redesign or renovate their homes. - The home improvement product market is expected to reach 287 billion in 2013, making it a promising industry to tap into. - Houzz gently guides users through the process of home improvement, starting with inspiration and leading to tutorials and a directory of local professionals. - More than 250,000 professionals are active on Houzz, providing an extensive library of images and a wealth of information on various projects. - Houzz is free for users, but generates revenue through partnerships with big companies like Kohler and Nest as well as a subscription marketing program for professionals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times","completion":"The given phrase can be considered negative for several reasons. The main indicators of negativity in this phrase are the choice of words and the overall sentiment expressed. 1. Use of the word \\"stupid\\": The use of the word \\"stupid\\" to describe the subject's inability to realize they have seen the movie before puts a negative judgment on the subject's intelligence. Calling someone or something \\"stupid\\" generally has negative connotations. 2. Reinforcement with \\"too\\": The adverb \\"too\\" in \\"too stupid\\" intensifies the negative characterization of the subject. This emphasizes the subject's shortcomings. 3. Criticism of repetitiveness: By stating that the subject has seen the \\"exact same movie a hundred times,\\" the phrase implies that they lack discernment or seek unoriginal content. This repetition highlights the redundancy and trivial nature of the situation, further reinforcing the negative sentiment. 4. Use of past perfect tense: The phrase \\"they 've already seen\\" suggests that the subject should have been aware of the repetition earlier, yet they continue to overlook it. This further emphasizes the subject's failure to recognize the repetitiveness. In conclusion, the given phrase can be regarded as negative due to its use of critical language and the sentiment it conveys. The statement implies that the subject is not smart enough to notice an obvious repetition in their choice of movies and offers no positive or encouraging perspective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyzing the hypothesis: The hypothesis states \\"Two women arguing with each other\\". Arguing is a specific kind of conversation, one that typically involves disagreement or conflict. 3. Comparing the two: While it's true that argument is a form of conversation, not all conversations are arguments. A conversation could be about sharing information, planning, discussing various topics, etc, not necessarily arguing. 4. Conclusion: As the premise isn't explicit about the conversation being an argument, we can't confirm the hypothesis to be true based on the information we have from the premise.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: For some people, music is no fun at all. About 4% of the population is what scientists call \\"amusic\\". People who are amusic are born without the ability to enjoy musical notes. Amusic people often cannot tell the differences between two songs. As a result, songs sound like noise to an amusic. Many amuics compare the sound of music to pieces of metal hitting each other. Life can be hard for amusics. In fact, most people cannot begin to understand what it feels like to be an amusic. Just going to a restaurant or a shopping center can be uncomfortable or even painful. That is why many amusics have to stay away from places where there is music. However, this can result in social loneliness. \\"I used to hate parties,\\" says Margaret, a seventy-year-old woman who only recently discovered that she was amusic. By studying people like Margaret, scientists are finally learning how to identify this unusual condition. Scientists say that the brains of amusics are different from those of people who can enjoy music. The difference is complex , and it is not connected with poor hearing. Amusics can understand other non-musical sounds well. They also have no problems understanding common speech. Scientists compare amusics to people who just can't see certain colors. Many amusics are happy when their condition is finally diagnosed . For years, Margaret felt embarrassed about her problem music. Now she knows that she is not alone.

Ohio (1961), the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the defendant, Dollree Mapp. This landmark case dealt with the issue of whether evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable search and seizures could be used in state court proceedings. The Court's decision effectively established the \\"exclusionary rule\\" for state courts, expanding the rule beyond federal courts which had already been applying it since the early 20th century. The case arose when police officers in Cleveland, Ohio, searched Dollree Mapp's residence without a valid warrant while looking for a suspected bombing fugitive. During their search, they discovered illegal pornographic material, which was unrelated to their initial investigation. Consequently, Mapp was charged and convicted under Ohio state law for possessing obscene materials. Mapp appealed her conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the confiscated materials should not be admissible as evidence because they were obtained in violation of her Fourth Amendment rights. At that time, the exclusionary rule only applied to federal courts as established in the Weeks v. United States case (1914). The decision in Mapp v. Ohio would determine whether the exclusionary rule would extend to state courts as well. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Dollree Mapp, agreeing that the evidence obtained in violation of her Fourth Amendment rights should be excluded in state criminal trials. The Court's opinion, delivered by Justice Tom C. Clark, highlighted the need to deter police misconduct and protect citizens' constitutional rights. Alongside the majority were Justices Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, William J. Brennan, Jr., Potter Stewart, and Chief Justice Earl Warren. Justices John Harlan II, Felix Frankfurter, and Charles Evans Whittaker dissented. The ruling in Mapp v. Ohio had a profound impact on American criminal law and police procedure. By applying the exclusionary rule to state courts, it established a significant safeguard against unlawful search and seizure, effectively forcing police to follow proper legal protocol when collecting evidence in criminal investigations. Today, the exclusionary rule continues to play a pivotal role in ensuring the protection of individuals' constitutional rights during the criminal justice process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: The White House has announced sanctions against 38 Russian individuals and companies, saying the United States is standing up to ongoing \\"malign activity\\" by the Russian government against Western democracies and around the world. At Friday's White House briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. still wants to work with Russia. \\"Again, what we would like to see is the totality of the Russian behavior change. We want to continue having conversations and work forward to building a better relationship,\\" Sanders said. The sanctions will be imposed on seven Russian oligarchs — including Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — and 12 companies they own or control. Seventeen senior Russian government officials, as well as a state-owned Russian weapons trading company and its subsidiary, a Russian bank, also will be targeted. The group includes key members of Putin's inner circle. Those sanctioned will have their assets blocked in the U.S. and people in the U.S. are barred from doing business with them. Friday, a number of U.S. lawmakers and foreign policy experts welcomed the measure, saying the sanctions are overdue. Representative Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the move is the strongest action taken by the Trump administration to date for Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and \\"its murder of dissidents at home and abroad.\\" \\"The sanctioning of oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska, who is linked to Paul Manafort, Alexander Torshin and Putin's son-in-law, will send a strong message to the Kremlin,\\" Schiff said in a statement. Florida's Marco Rubio, a Republican senator and former presidential candidate, also welcomed Friday's announcement. \\"These new sanctions send a clear message to Vladimir Putin that the illegal occupation of Ukraine, support for … war crimes [under Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime], efforts to undermine Western democracies, and...

I have been a fervent Hal Hartley supporter since I saw his short \\"Surviving Desire\\" in high school, and even then was still completely unmoored by his searingly brilliant \\"Henry Fool.\\" But this 10-year-later sequel is not only unnecessary, it's disgraceful. After a choppy and expeditious start, \\"Fay Grim\\" devolves into pseudo-intellectualism, flat out boredom, and finally unwarranted - and unwanted - nihilism. And that's just the plot. The majority of the new faces are as frivolous and poorly-developed as the movie: one particularly flat character ends up hogging half the time we spend with the infamous Henry Fool himself, and it's his only spoken scene in the film! Jeff Goldblum's Agent Fulbright, it seems, is the only bright character (a pun surely intended by Hartley as well). How, then, is he left? **SPOILER** Dead via a car bombing, easily making this the gentle-natured Hartley's most violent film to date, and tonally all wrong in a film that's already all wrong from the word go. As for the other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or is it Grim?), not to mention Fay herself... well, I won't spoil their fates, as the movie does a good enough job of that all on its own (when it isn't busying itself with yet another godawful canted angle, which gives the disconcerting impression that Hartley is moving backwards from Auteur to crappy film student). This piece is a complete disaster, a dreadful mess that isn't even good-humored enough to revel in its messiness. Instead it self-indulgently crams the typically fun hipster pretenses of its director into the \\"real world\\", one uglier and meaner than it need be but not nearly ugly or mean enough to come close to having anything to say. In doing so, Hartley tracks sh*t all over my memories of these people and the marvelous world he originally created for them. I have rarely been so depressed at the movies, and I'm counting \\"Leaving Las Vegas,\\" which at least developed fresh new characters we grew to love before destroying them, instead of immediately disregarding characters already beloved.

She has a fascination with panthers, but animals don't seem to like her very much. When Oliver brings her a Siamese kitten as a gift, for example, the cat hisses at Irena, so they return to the pet store and exchange it for a bird.

The statement \\"No strategies are needed to meet the current and future capital needs\\" does not follow from the given information. In fact, the original statement directly emphasizes the importance of implementing sound training and career development strategies in a finance organization. This is to ensure that the organization is well-equipped to meet its current and future human capital needs. In today's fast-paced and competitive business environment, having a robust strategic plan for training and developing employees is crucial. This plan should be aimed at fostering growth within the organization, helping individuals realize their potential, and creating a talent pool that can address evolving business demands. Proper strategies for the finance organization may include: 1. Identifying skill gaps: Assessing the existing workforce to determine which skills are lacking and which must be developed to meet future demands. This can involve conducting comprehensive skills assessments and utilizing data-driven insights to create targeted plans for addressing these gaps. 2. Creating tailored training programs: Developing training modules that cover essential finance domains, such as financial modeling, data analytics, risk management, and regulatory compliance. These programs should be designed in a manner that caters to employees at different stages of their careers – from new hires to seasoned professionals. 3. Developing career paths: Establishing clear and structured career paths that outline growth opportunities within the organization. This not only provides employees with a roadmap for progression but also aids in retention efforts, as employees can visualize their long-term prospects within the organization. 4. Promoting continuous learning: Encouraging employees to consistently update their knowledge and skills through continued professional development. This may involve access to e-learning platforms, external workshops, conferences, or industry certifications. 5. Offering mentorship programs: Facilitating connections between experienced professionals and learners within the organization. This can help transfer valuable knowledge, skills, and insights, contributing to the overall growth and development of the workforce. 6. Monitoring and measuring outcomes: Regularly evaluating the effectiveness of training and career development initiatives. This can be done through feedback surveys, pre-and post-assessments, and tracking key performance indicators related to employee engagement, satisfaction, and overall performance improvement. In conclusion, it is vital to have a well-thought-out approach to workforce development, especially in a finance organization, to ensure the organization remains adaptable and competitive in the face of constantly changing market dynamics.

Q:Combine facts and answer this: The Aerotrain is an automated transport network that moves people around the main international airport of which Asian country? A:","completion":"The Aerotrain is an automated transport network that moves people around the main international airport of Malaysia, specifically, the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). Kuala Lumpur International Airport is an important aviation hub not only for the Southeast Asian region but also for international flight connections. The airport, located around 45 kilometers south of the capital city, Kuala Lumpur, commenced operations in 1998 and is managed by Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad. Constructed to maintain the smooth functioning of the airport and passenger convenience, the Aerotrain system operates as an essential link between the Main Terminal Building (MTB) and Satellite Terminal A within the airport. The system uses a fleet of driverless electric trains, each with a seating and standing combined capacity of approximately 250 passengers, traveling at a maximum speed of 56 kilometers per hour. The Aerotrain facilitates the rapid transit of international passengers between the terminals, covering the 2.35 kilometers distance between the two terminals in less than 3 minutes with trains arriving at the stations every 2 to 3 minutes. Designed and built by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, in conjunction with Adtranz (now known as Bombardier Transportation), the Aerotrain system uses a third rail power supply with an overhead monorail track design. Monorail technology provides the advantage of a smaller footprint, enabling it to be easily integrated into the existing airport infrastructure. The Aerotrain system not only enhances the KLIA airport experience for passengers but also aids in efficient gate management and timely operation of flights. Through seamless connectivity, passengers can quickly transfer between terminals, access duty-free shopping, and enjoy various dining options as well.

Output:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the problem and identify the variables. In this problem, we have the following variables: - Initial price of the TV sets (P1) - Initial number of TV sets sold (S1) - Increased price of the TV sets (P2) - Decreased number of TV sets sold (S2) - Effect on the revenue receipts (R) Step 2: Express the given information in terms of the variables. We are given that the price of TV sets increases by 40%. Therefore, P2 = P1 + 0.4 * P1 = 1.4 * P1 We are also given that their sale decreases by 20%. Therefore, S2 = S1 - 0.2 * S1 = 0.8 * S1 Step 3: Calculate the initial and final revenues. The initial revenue (R1) is the product of the initial price and the initial number of TV sets sold, which is: R1 = P1 * S1 The final revenue (R2) is the product of the increased price and the decreased number of TV sets sold, which is: R2 = P2 * S2 Step 4: Determine the effect on the revenue receipts. We want to find the percentage change in revenue receipts, which can be calculated using the equation: R = ((R2 - R1) / R1) * 100 Step 5: Substitute the equations in the revenue equation and solve. Using the equations for P2, S2, R1, and R2, we can substitute and simplify the R equation as: R = (((1.4 * P1) * (0.8 * S1) - (P1 * S1)) / (P1 * S1)) * 100 First, we can cancel out the common terms P1 and S1: R = ((1.4 * 0.8 - 1) * 100) Now, we calculate the result: R = ((1.12 - 1) * 100) = 0.12 * 100 R = 12 Output: The effect on the revenue receipts of the shop is an increase of 12%."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which some of the particles settle out of the mixture upon standing. The particles in a suspension are far larger than those of a solution and thus gravity is able to pull them down out of the dispersion medium (water). The typical diameter for the dispersed particles (the sand) of a suspension is about 1000 times greater than those of a solution (less than approximately two nanometers for particles in solution, compared to greater than 1000 nanometers for particles in suspension). Unlike in a solution, the dispersed particles can be separated from the dispersion medium by filtering.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The New York Times Not all of the recipes in “Seven Fires” call for a pulley. While some of the dishes are the sort of gonzo cooking sure to be documented, mid-flame, on Twitter (pork leg buried in salt, lamb roasted in a wheelbarrow), most of what’s in this captivating book about cooking over wood is as straightforward as it is appealing. Take the oranges and rosemary sprinkled with sugar and caramelized on a cast-iron skillet. The charred, sugary rosemary is both rough and refined, a gratifying end to a grilled meal. A wide cast-iron griddle, like the ones from Lodge (lodgemfg.com), heats exceptionally well over an open flame. Along with long-handled tongs, fire-resistant gloves, an instant-read thermometer and a broad stainless steel spackle knife from a hardware store (narrower and stronger than most spatulas), it’s one of the basic tools for grilling over wood. But the most essential piece of equipment is an adjustable cast-iron grill. The grill fits into a freestanding bracket, and can be raised well above the flames or lowered until it kisses the coals. Mr. Kaminsky, who has written about food and the outdoors for The New York Times, has a fairly elaborate setup in the yard of his Cobble Hill brownstone. In addition to an adjustable grill, he has two Tuscan grills (like the adjustable grills, these are available at spitjack.com), heavy cast-iron grates on four-inch legs. He also had a local wrought-iron shop fabricate an Argentine infiernillo, which looks like a pair of stacked metal coffee tables and works like an open-air oven: you start a fire under one and on top of the other, and roast food between the two. But to cook Mr. Mallmann’s trademark rib-eye, modestly called “A Perfect Steak,” all you need is medium-high heat, with a grill set about two inches above the embers. I joined Mr. Kaminsky in his backyard, where he explained the technique: patience. The one-and-a-half-inch-thick rib-eye was cooked for nine minutes on one side, then seven minutes on the other, timed on an iPhone. Mr. Kaminsky hardly touched it, rotating it 45 degrees on each side, and flipping it only once. “You want to get that nice crust, so you want it hot, and you don’t want to mess with it,” Mr. Kaminsky said. “The idea is to get it pink all the way through, with none of that well-done gray part around the edge.” IT seemed like a long time to cook a steak, but when he cut it open it was rosé-red, juicy and delicious. Indeed, it was a perfect steak. And Mr. Kaminsky demonstrated perfect technique. He stacked split pieces of well-seasoned, thoroughly dry oak, and started a fire using some newspaper and fatwood, a resinous pinewood that flames easily. (Pine is fine for starting fires, but because it burns quickly and imparts an acrid flavor it should never be used for cooking.) Mr. Kaminsky used a fireplace shovel and a poker modified so that it looked like a croupier’s rake to gather the hot embers, carefully placing them under the grill, adding more oak to the fire as the wood turned into embers. But at its most basic, grilling over hardwood is campfire cooking. My backyard cooking falls somewhere between Mr. Kaminsky’s control and a campfire’s chaos. I’ll ignite oak and applewood in a fire pit, and while the flames are still burning I’ll heat a griddle for searing vegetables for a salad (sliced fennel, tomato halves and wedges of radicchio all char nicely). Or I’ll put clams, white wine and herbs in a cast iron caldron and set it directly on the burning wood, then toast some bread for a simple appetizer. Once the wood turns into hot embers — between 20 and 30 minutes — it’s ready for grilling. Because a wood fire can be much hotter than what you’ll get from charcoal or gas, you should use canola oil or another neutral-flavored oil with a high smoke point for seasoning the grill and griddle or for brushing meat, fish and vegetables. Olive oil, which breaks down over high heat, can be drizzled on later, for flavor. Wood fire might seem to have a greater environmental impact than charcoal or gas, but it’s not so easily assessed. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, a wood fire emits more gases and particulate matter than clean-burning propane, but it also has a smaller carbon footprint. The E.P.A. does not endorse one form of grilling over another. THAT smoke is a guilty pleasure. It gives so much flavor, it makes most marinades and rubs unnecessary. But a bright and balanced sauce, like the honey-sweetened gremolata in “Seven Fires,” adds a note of sophistication. So does the fresh dried chili oil from Russell Moore, the chef and an owner of Camino, in Oakland, Calif., a restaurant where almost everything is cooked with a wood fire. This time of year Mr. Moore grills asparagus and spring onions, then tops them with a chili oil he makes from mild dried New Mexican chilies, pounded garlic and chopped mint. The result has so much body and flavor it’s more salsa than sauce. Mr. Moore describes it as “a super-rough harissa.” The recipe is really a template — you can use any mild chili, such as chihuacle or mulatto, and any herb — and drizzle it over whatever vegetable looks good that week, from artichokes to new potatoes to escarole to summer chanterelles. “You want all the freshness of the seasons in there, and three strong flavors,” Mr. Moore said. Many of the dishes in Adam Perry Lang’s “Serious Barbecue” (Hyperion, 2009) call for indirect heat — this could become a bible for disciples of the ceramic outdoor cooker known as the Big Green Egg — but some dishes, like his Crisp and Unctuous Pork Belly, do just as well when braised in a conventional oven and finished on the grill. Mr. Lang, the chef and owner of Daisy May’s BBQ in Manhattan, builds flavor whenever possible, and the pork belly calls for a marinade, a bourbon glaze (preferably applied with a bundle of herbs), and a dressing applied directly to the cutting board: you squeeze lemon on the board and add olive oil, chives and pepper, so that the resting slab of pork draws in even more flavor. Mr. Lang suggests serving slices of the belly in a bun with applesauce and mustard, the latest iteration of the pork bun. It’s also good on watercress or arugula, tossed with a sharp dressing. For all the technique he details in the book, when I spoke to Mr. Lang he drove home one point: Never use a spray bottle to douse flares from dripping fat. Instead, he suggests moving the food to a cooler corner of the grill, or stacking meat so that it’s exposed to less heat. “A lot of people fear the flame,” Mr. Lang said. “I tell them: Don’t. Because when you’re cooking on wood the flavor is like nothing else.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D1 of the National edition with the headline: Grilling Over Wood as a Sweaty, Smoky Sport.

Not trees down mind you , but Blowing . In . Why is it hard to get a weather report from any of the news stations ? Options: + The weather coverage is focusing on the impending hurricane .. + The person can only get the Cubs game on tv .. + The person is not watching local tv .. + The person does not have the right channel on tv ..","completion":"It appears that the primary reason it is hard for the person to get a weather report from any of the news stations is because the weather coverage is focusing on the impending hurricane. News stations often focus on sensational, \\"breaking news\\" events, as these stories tend to attract more viewership. When a major weather event like a hurricane approaches, it is not uncommon for news channels to dedicate a significant portion of their programming to covering the event, often to the detriment of other, more regular content such as standard weather reports. This can make it difficult for people looking for a simple weather report to find the information they seek. In the particular case mentioned in the question, it seems that the news stations are focusing on the dramatic visuals of their cub reporters standing out in the wind and ankle-deep water, discussing power outages and trees blowing in the wind. Even though these visuals help to capture the attention of the viewers, they do not provide a direct and succinct weather report. Some of the other options mentioned might also be factors contributing to the difficulty in obtaining a weather report: 1. The person can only get the Cubs game on TV: If the person only has access to one channel on their television and it is broadcasting a sports event like a Cubs game, they won't be able to find weather information there. However, this option seems unlikely as the person specifically mentions the presence of news stations showing reporters standing out in the storm. 2. The person is not watching local TV: Although it is possible that the person is not receiving local news channels on their television, they mention that they are watching news stations with reporters discussing the storm situation. Therefore, this option can also be ruled out as they are clearly receiving some form of local news coverage. 3. The person does not have the right channel on TV: This could be another reason for not finding a proper weather report; if the person is focused on specific channels that are providing the dramatic hurricane coverage, they might miss out on other channels providing regular weather updates. However, as mentioned above, the primary issue still seems to be the focus on the impending hurricane. In conclusion, it is primarily difficult to get a weather report from any of the news stations because they are focusing on the impending hurricane and the dramatic visuals associated with it rather than providing clear and concise weather reports. Other factors like the channels available on the person's television may contribute to the issue, but the main reason is the news stations' preference for dramatic and attention-grabbing coverage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

More than 15 percent of Chinese youths have been found with mental problems, and about 30 million young people under 17 are suffering from depression, the Shang-based Wenhui Daily reported. The World Health Organization estimates that before 2020, the rate of children with mental problems will increase to 50 percent, and mental problems will become a major factor behind deaths and illness in the young worldwide. Deng Xiaohong, the spokesperson for the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, said rapid changes are one of the reasons behind the rising number of youngsters with psychological problems. If these mental diseases are not addressed on time, occurrence of crimes, drug-taking and other dangerous behavior are expected to rise. Experts said mental diseases could be caused by many factors, such as the inability to handle interpersonal relations well, unstable emotions and pressures from an overload of studies. A number of experts have also said the one-child policy is another reason leading to poor mental health in the young. Children are said to be too \\" spoiled\\" and \\"selfish\\" in a one-child family. It's reported schools in many cities are rolling out measures to help students maintain their mental well-being.

This means that a 5% reduction in operating voltage will more than double the life of the bulb, at the expense of reducing its light output by about 16%. This may be a very acceptable trade off for a light bulb that is in a difficult-to-access location (for example, traffic lights or fixtures hung from high ceilings). Long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off. Since the value of the electric power they consume is much more than the value of the lamp, general service lamps emphasize efficiency over long operating life. The objective is to minimize the cost of light, not the cost of lamps. Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 a cartel agreed to limit life to 1000 hours.

In this case, this involves isolating the variable k by eliminating it from one side of the equation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 1. Start with the given equation: -533k = -530k + 18 2. The goal is to isolate k, so we need to eliminate -530k from the right side of the equation. To do this, add 530k to both sides: -533k + 530k = -530k + 530k + 18 After performing the operation, the new equation is: -3k = 18 3. Now, all that remains is to isolate k. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by -3: -3k / -3 = 18 / -3 After performing the division, the new equation is: k = -6 So, the solution to the equation -533k = -530k + 18 is k = -6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the question: Information: - Herodium (Latin), Herodeion, best known in Israel as Herodion and in Arabic as Jabal al-Fureidis (lit. \\"Paradise Hill\\") is a truncated cone-shaped hill, located south of Jerusalem and southeast of Bethlehem, in the Judaean Desert, West Bank. Herod the Great built a palace fortress and a small town at Herodium, between 23 and 15 BCE, and is believed to have been buried there. Herodium is 758 meters (2,487 ft) above sea level, the highest peak in the Judaean Desert. Today, the site is managed by the Israel National Parks Authority. - The Second Temple was an important Jewish Holy Temple (\\"Beit HaMikdash HaSheni\\") which stood on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem during the Second Temple period, between 516 BCE and 70 CE. According to Jewish (and subsequently, Christian) tradition, it replaced Solomon's Temple (the First Temple), which was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE, when Jerusalem was conquered and a portion of the population of the Kingdom of Judah was taken into exile in Babylon. - Antipater II ( Greek : ; c. 46 -- 4 BC ) was Herod the Great 's first - born son , his only child by his first wife Doris . He was named after his paternal grandfather Antipater the Idumaean . He and his mother were exiled after Herod divorced her between 43 BC and 40 BC to marry Mariamne I. However , he was recalled following Mariamne 's fall in 29 BC and in 13 BC Herod made him his first heir in his will . He retained this position even when Alexandros and Aristobulos ( Herod 's sons by Mariamne ) rose in the royal succession in 12 BC , and even became exclusive successor to the throne after their execution in 7 BC ( with Herod Philip I in second place ) . However , in 5 BC Antipater was brought before Publius Quinctilius Varus , then Roman governor of Syria , charged with the intended murder of his father Herod . Antipater was found guilty by Varus ; however , due to Antipater 's high rank , it was necessary for Caesar Augustus to approve of the recommended sentence of death . After the guilty verdict , Antipater 's position as exclusive successor was removed and granted to Herod Antipas . Once the sentence had approval from Augustus in 4 BC , Antipater was then executed , and Archelaus ( from the marriage with Malthace ) was made heir in his father 's will as king over Herod 's entire kingdom ( with Antipas and Philip as Tetrarchs over certain territories ) . We know two of Antipater 's wives through the writings of Josephus . First was his niece Mariamne III , daughter of Aristobulus IV. The second was a high - ranking Hasmonean princess whose first name is lost to history . She was the daughter of Antigonus the Hasmonean , the last Hasmonean king who also served as high priest . This wife of Antipater was also a first cousin of Mariamne I , renowned royal wife of Herod the Great . Josephus records that she was at the palace with Doris , Antipater 's mother , in support of her husband during his trial before Varus in 5 BC. - Aristobulus II was the Jewish High Priest and King of Judea, 66 BC to 63 BC, from the Hasmonean Dynasty. - Antipater I the Idumaean (died 43 BC) was the founder of the Herodian Dynasty and father of Herod the Great. According to Josephus, he was the son of Antipas (I) and had formerly held that name. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Judea or Judæa (from , \\"Yhuda\\", \\"Yhûh\\", , , \\"Yahudia\\") is the ancient biblical, Roman, and modern name of the mountainous southern part of Palestine. The name originates from the Hebrew, Canaanite and later neo-Babylonian and Persian name \\"Yehudah\\" or \\"Yehud\\" for the biblical Israelite tribe of Judah (Yehudah) and associated Kingdom of Judah, which the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia dates from 934 until 586 BCE. The name of the region continued to be incorporated through the Babylonian conquest, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods as Yehud, Yehud Medinata, Hasmonean Judea, and consequently Herodian Judea and Roman Judea, respectively. - Mariamne I (died 29 BCE), also called Mariamne the Hasmonean, was a Hasmonean princess and the second wife of Herod the Great. She was known for her great beauty, as was her brother Aristobulus III. Herod's fear of his rivals, the Hasmoneans, led to him executing all of the prominent members of the family, including Mariamne. - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. - Titus Flavius Josephus (37 100), born Joseph ben Matityahu (Hebrew: , \\"Yosef ben Matityahu\\"; Greek: ), was a first-century Romano-Jewish scholar, historian and hagiographer, who was born in Jerusalemthen part of Roman Judeato a father of priestly descent and a mother who claimed royal ancestry. - The Herodian Dynasty was a Judean dynasty of Idumaean/Edomite descent. The Herodian dynasty began with Herod the Great, who assumed the throne of Judea, with Roman support, bringing down the century long Hasmonean Kingdom. His kingdom lasted until his death in 4 BCE, when it was divided between his sons as a Tetrarchy, which lasted for about 10 years. Most of those kingdoms, including Judea proper, were incorporated into Judaea Province in 6 CE, though limited Herodian kingship continued in Northern Levant until 92, when the last Herodian monarch, Agrippa II, died and Rome assumed full power over his domain. - Herod (\\"Hordos\\", Greek: , \\"Hrds\\"; 74/73 BCE 4 BCE), also known as Herod the Great and Herod I, was a Roman client king of Judea, referred to as the Herodian kingdom. The history of his legacy has polarized opinion, as he is known for his colossal building projects throughout Judea, including his expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem (Herod's Temple), the construction of the port at Caesarea Maritima, the fortress at Masada and Herodium. Vital details of his life are recorded in the works of the 1st century CE RomanJewish historian Josephus. Herod also appears in the Christian Gospel of Matthew as the ruler of Judea who orders the Massacre of the Innocents at the time of the birth of Jesus. Despite his successes, including singlehandedly forging a new aristocracy from practically nothing, he still garnered criticism from various historians. His reign polarizes opinion amongst scholars and historians, some viewing his legacy as evidence of success, or a reminder of his tyrannical rule. What is the relationship between 'antipater ' and '4 bce'? The answer is:","completion":"Antipater II, the first-born son of Herod the Great, was implicated in a plot to murder his father. In 5 BCE, he was found guilty by Roman governor Publius Quinctilius Varus. However, due to Antipater's high rank, his death sentence needed approval from Caesar Augustus. Following the approval, Antipater was executed in 4 BCE. Therefore, the relationship between 'Antipater' and '4 BCE' is that Antipater II was executed in 4 BCE after being found guilty of plotting to murder his father, Herod the Great."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Bacteria do not have a membrane-bound nucleus, and their genetic material is typically a single circular DNA chromosome located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid. The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA. The phylum Planctomycetes and candidate phylum Poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria, because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures. Like all living organisms, bacteria contain ribosomes, often grouped in chains called polyribosomes, for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea. Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S (measured in Svedberg units): their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S. Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80S ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What are the exceptions of non-internal membrane bacteria?","completion":"The main exceptions to the absence of internal membranes in bacteria are the phylum Planctomycetes and the candidate phylum Poribacteria. Planctomycetes are a phylum of aquatic bacteria. They are unique among bacteria in that they divide by budding, a process typically seen in yeasts and other fungi. In addition, they possess a characteristic feature that discredits the general belief that bacteria lack internal membranes: Planctomycetes contain an enclosed compartment - the pirellulosome, which nests the nucleoid and ribosomes. The nucleoid of the Planctomycetes is surrounded by two membranes, organizing it into a structure functionally similar to the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. The internal organization of Planctomycetes is so unusual for bacteria that generates discussions about the boundaries between the fundamental domains of life - Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Some studies suggest that Planctomycetes could represent a separate domain of life close to the bacterial-eukaryotic boundary, highlighting the importance of studying these bacteria to understand the evolution of cellular complexity. In contrast, Poribacteria is a candidate phylum -which means it is not yet fully described or accepted- of bacteria tentatively placed within the Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae superphylum (PVC group). Like Planctomycetes, the bacteria of the Poribacteria candidate phylum also seem to contain internal membranes. These membranes potentially segregate the genetic material of these bacteria, enclosing it in an organelle-like compartment, making them another exception among bacteria. It should be noted that the presence of internal membranes in these bacteria might be more related to a common ancestral trait shared by the PVC superphylum rather than an independent evolution or convergence towards eukaryotic complexity. This discovery also raises the possibility that other, as-yet-undiscovered groups of bacteria may contain internal compartments as well. Therefore, the exceptions to the \\"bacteria do not have internal membranes\\" rule may extend beyond just the Planctomycetes and Poribacteria. So while most bacteria are characterized by a lack of internal membranes, these examples show that there are unusual exceptions to that rule, highlighting the immense diversity of structural organization that exists within the bacterial world. This diversity makes many aspects of bacterial biology fascinating subjects for ongoing research."},{"prompt":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Ice, water, and steam appear quite differently to the eye.

However, his hold on Lan Na and Tenasserim coast was still nominal. The Siamese who originally were concerned about the rising power of Restored Hanthawaddy now actively supported the ethnic Mon rebels operating in the upper Tenasserim coast. In December 1759, Alaungpaya and his 40,000-strong armies invaded the Tenasserim coast. They crossed over the Tenasserim Hills, and finally reached Ayutthaya on 11 April 1760. But only five days into the siege, the Burmese king suddenly fell ill and the Burmese withdrew. The king died three weeks later, ending the war. The 1760 war was inconclusive. Although Burma had regained the upper Tenasserim coast to Tavoy, they still had to deal with Siamese supported rebellions in Lan Na and at Tavoy . The warfare resumed in August 1765, when two Burmese armies invaded again in a pincer movement on the Siamese capital. The Burmese armies took Ayutthaya in April 1767 after a 14-months' siege. The Burmese armies sacked the city and committed atrocities that mar the Burmese-Thai relations to the present.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: I've seen some crappy movies in my life, but this one must be among the very worst. Definately bottom 100 material (imo, that is). We follow two couples, the Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and the Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in one car on a roadtrip to Reno. Apparently, Lonnie isn't too happy with his sex-life, so he cheats on his wife with Candy, who's despirately trying to have a baby. Roy, meanwhile, isn't too sure if his sperm is OK so he's getting it checked by a doctor. Now, I had read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend didn't, and she blurted out after about 20 minutes: 'oh yeah, she's gonna end up pregnant but her husband can't have any baby's'. Spot on, as this movie is soooo predictable. As well as boring. And annoying. Meaningless. Offensive. Terrible. An example of how much this movie stinks. The two couples set out in their big car towards Nevada, when they are stopped by 2 police-officers, as they didn't stop at a stop-sign. The guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer. Not only is this scene pointless and not important (or even relevant) for the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talk and talk and talk, without ever going somewhere. I still have to puke thinking about the ending though. Apparently, Roy ISN'T having problems down there so he IS the father of the child. How many times does that happen in the movies... try something new! The cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after. Yuck. Best scene of the movie is right at the end, with a couple of shots of the Grand Canyon. Why couldn't they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutes?

The answer is:","completion":"No, the suggested answer provided does not effectively address the question posed. The question inquires about the purpose and use of metaphors in general, while the suggested answer only discusses an example from a specific political cartoon. A more appropriate and detailed answer would be: Metaphors are used for various purposes in language, literature, and communication, including: 1. Simplification: Metaphors help simplify complex ideas or concepts by comparing them to familiar and easily understandable situations or objects. This enables individuals to grasp and process abstract or intricate ideas more easily, as they can relate to the comparison drawn. 2. Visualization: By comparing abstract or intangible ideas with concrete images, metaphors create a vivid and easily imaginable mental picture for the audience. This enhances their understanding of the concept and helps them visualize scenarios or ideas in their minds. 3. Emotional Appeal: Metaphors appeal to the emotions of the listener or reader, adding depth and meaning to the message being conveyed. This creates a stronger connection between the communicator and the audience, making the message more persuasive or impactful. 4. Creativity and Aesthetics: Metaphors are often used in literature and other forms of creative writing to add richness, beauty, and uniqueness to the text. They allow authors to express ideas in a more imaginative, poetic, and engaging manner that captures the reader's attention and interest. 5. Clarification: Metaphors can help clarify ambiguous or vague ideas by providing a comparison to something more concrete and tangible. This allows for a clearer understanding of the concept and its implications. 6. Communication and Persuasion: By making abstract ideas more relatable and digestible for the audience, metaphors facilitate communication and serve as persuasive tools. They can help bolster arguments or emphasize certain points by making them easier to understand and remember. 7. Cultural Expression: Metaphors often draw on cultural values, symbols, and shared experiences to create meaning and connection. They function as a way to reflect and reinforce cultural identities and beliefs. In conclusion, metaphors serve various purposes in communication, from simplifying and clarifying complex ideas to creating emotional appeal and adding aesthetic value. They play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of abstract concepts, facilitating effective communication, and expressing emotions and cultural values."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. and the situation: Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well.

Here is a news article: The clash between Amazon and Disney is the consequence of a concoction of dynamics in the entertainment and retail industries as online players become increasingly dominant. Amazon wants to turn its dominance in the market into larger profits for its investors and low prices for it customers, which is the principle on which Jeff Bezos created the business. However, film studios and record labels are cautious about the growth of Amazon. Not only does the online retailer want to sell its products for a lower price than they do, but there are concerns that online platforms do not allow a film studio or record label to promote their products in the same way as a high street store. This is why HMV has re-emerged on the high street in Britain despite falling into administration last year. The film studios and record labels want HMV to survive and are offering the retailer exclusive products and promotions to take on Amazon. However, Amazon's share of the entertainment market is growing all the time. The latest data from the UK shows that it accounts for 22pc of the music, video and gaming market and is the largest entertainment retailer in the UK. The company appears to be using its size to try to drive down pricing. Amazon's clash with Disney and Hachette is similar to rows that Tesco has had with suppliers in the past. The supermarket group can respond by delisting products, Amazon has responded by blocking pre-orders on Disney films including Captain America, Maleficent, Muppets Most Wanted and Million Dollar Arm. This move by Amazon can be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, it is acting in the best interests of consumers around the world by lowering the price of popular entertainment products. Through the Kindle and ebooks, Amazon has provided up-and-coming authors with an unprecedented platform to reach readers around the world. “Just as paperbacks did not destroy book culture despite being ten times cheaper, neither will e-books,” Amazon said last week in an open letter. However, the alternative views is that Amazon is simply using its corporate muscle to try to drive down prices. After posting a loss in its most recent financial results, the company is under growing pressure from investors to deliver improved results. Amazon would not be the first retailer to respond to such pressures by leaning on suppliers, but the difference this time is that the suppliers are as a well-known as the retailer and the clash is very public. ||||| When Amazon.com Inc. wants to fight, it turns to a familiar playbook.

It was the paperback book. This was a time when movie tickets cost 10 or 20 cents, and books cost 2.50. The new paperback cost 25 cents — it was ten times cheaper. Readers loved the paperback and millions of copies were sold in just the first year. With it being so inexpensive and with so many more people able to afford to buy and read books, you would think the literary establishment of the day would have celebrated the invention of the paperback, yes? Nope. Instead, they dug in and circled the wagons. They believed low cost paperbacks would destroy literary culture and harm the industry (not to mention their own bank accounts). Many bookstores refused to stock them, and the early paperback publishers had to use unconventional methods of distribution — places like newsstands and drugstores. The famous author George Orwell came out publicly and said about the new paperback format, if \\"publishers had any sense, they would combine against them and suppress them.\\" Yes, George Orwell was suggesting collusion. Wellâ€¦ history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. Fast forward to today, and it's the e-book's turn to be opposed by the literary establishment. Amazon and Hachette — a big US publisher and part of a 10 billion media conglomerate — are in the middle of a business dispute about e-books. We want lower e-book prices. Hachette does not. Many e-books are being released at 14.99 and even 19.99. That is unjustifiably high for an e-book. With an e-book, there's no printing, no over-printing, no need to forecast, no returns, no lost sales due to out of stock, no warehousing costs, no transportation costs, and there is no secondary market — e-books cannot be resold as used books. E-books can and should be less expensive. Perhaps channeling Orwell's decades old suggestion, Hachette has already been caught illegally colluding with its competitors to raise e-book prices. So far those parties have paid 166 million in penalties and restitution. Colluding with its competitors to raise prices wasn't only illegal, it was also highly disrespectful to Hachette's readers. The fact is many established incumbents in the industry have taken the position that lower e-book prices will \\"devalue books\\" and hurt \\"Arts and Letters.\\" They're wrong. Just as paperbacks did not destroy book culture despite being ten times cheaper, neither will e-books. On the contrary, paperbacks ended up rejuvenating the book industry and making it stronger. The same will happen with e-books. Many inside the echo-chamber of the industry often draw the box too small. They think books only compete against books. But in reality, books compete against mobile games, television, movies, Facebook, blogs, free news sites and more. If we want a healthy reading culture, we have to work hard to be sure books actually are competitive against these other media types, and a big part of that is working hard to make books less expensive. Moreover, e-books are highly price elastic. This means that when the price goes down, customers buy much more. We've quantified the price elasticity of e-books from repeated measurements across many titles. For every copy an e-book would sell at 14.99, it would sell 1.74 copies if priced at 9.99. So, for example, if customers would buy 100,000 copies of a particular e-book at 14.99, then customers would buy 174,000 copies of that same e-book at 9.99. Total revenue at 14.99 would be 1,499,000. Total revenue at 9.99 is 1,738,000. The important thing to note here is that the lower price is good for all parties involved: the customer is paying 33% less and the author is getting a royalty check 16% larger and being read by an audience that's 74% larger. The pie is simply bigger. But when a thing has been done a certain way for a long time, resisting change can be a reflexive instinct, and the powerful interests of the status quo are hard to move. It was never in George Orwell's interest to suppress paperback books — he was wrong about that. And despite what some would have you believe, authors are not united on this issue. When the Authors Guild recently wrote on this, they titled their post: \\"Amazon-Hachette Debate Yields Diverse Opinions Among Authors\\" (the comments to this post are worth a read). A petition started by another group of authors and aimed at Hachette, titled \\"Stop Fighting Low Prices and Fair Wages,\\" garnered over 7,600 signatures. And there are myriad articles and posts, by authors and readers alike, supporting us in our effort to keep prices low and build a healthy reading culture. Author David Gaughran's recent interview is another piece worth reading. We recognize that writers reasonably want to be left out of a dispute between large companies. Some have suggested that we \\"just talk.\\" We tried that. Hachette spent three months stonewalling and only grudgingly began to even acknowledge our concerns when we took action to reduce sales of their titles in our store. Since then Amazon has made three separate offers to Hachette to take authors out of the middle. We first suggested that we (Amazon and Hachette) jointly make author royalties whole during the term of the dispute. Then we suggested that authors receive 100% of all sales of their titles until this dispute is resolved. Then we suggested that we would return to normal business operations if Amazon and Hachette's normal share of revenue went to a literacy charity. But Hachette, and their parent company Lagardere, have quickly and repeatedly dismissed these offers even though e-books represent 1% of their revenues and they could easily agree to do so. They believe they get leverage from keeping their authors in the middle. We will never give up our fight for reasonable e-book prices. We know making books more affordable is good for book culture. We'd like your help. Please email Hachette and copy us. Thanks for your support.

Amazon has grown to account for 22% of the music, video, and gaming market in the UK, causing tensions with suppliers such as Disney. Amazon's move to block pre-orders on Disney films can be seen as either an attempt to lower prices for consumers or a demonstration of corporate muscle.

Both of these stories take place in modern-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF MR. VALDEMARJessica Valdemar (Adrienne Barbeau), an attractive 40-year-old woman, rides in a taxi to the downtown Pittsburgh office of Steven Pike (E.G. Marshall), her husband's lawyer with some paperwork for Mr. Pike approval. Pike sees that Jessica's elderly 63-year-old husband, who is dying from an unnamed terminal illness, is liquidating a number of his assets for cash and suspects Jessica of having undue influence on him. Jessica denies the allegations that shes any negative influence over her husband, while Pike makes a phone call to the house to talk with Ernest Valdemar (Bingo O'Malley), who speaks over the phone in a weak but coherent voice explaining about his decision to let Jessica take control of his money and assets from his personal signature on the written documents.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I have seen \\"Miracles Still Happen\\" now at least four times. I never tire of this fantastic movie. From the very beginning, it holds a person's interest. As the movie progresses and the plane crashes the story becomes very intense as we watch this young girl trying to survive alone and frightened in the Amazon, following a plane crash in which she was the only survivor. Losing her mother in this plane crash as well makes this movie even more dramatic as we see the perils this young girl had to endure during her ten days in the Amazon. To think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could actualy survive this is unspeakable as we see the wild animals, snakes and other reptiles, the enormous forests and wildlife as well as countless insects. As the movie progresses we see the many dangers this girl has to face as she tries to follow the river in hopes of it leading her to a town. Remembering what her father told her about how a stream will always lead to a river and then into an even larger river and this means it will eventually lead to a community, this young girl keep track of the tiny stream which eventually lead into a huge river all throughout the movie. At times having to swim in dangerous waters, alone, frightened, injured, she always managed to keep going. Towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her perils. Eventually as she sees a canoe, she realizes there has to be a village and men find her and they take care of her and then take her to a hospital where her father comes to see her, after fearing she was dead along with the many other passengers. Such a dramatic movie and so heartwarming to see her father's face when he sees his daughter is actually still alive after all this time in the Amazon! Movies like this aren't made much those days. I will still see it again and I know I will never tire of it! To think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable! Also the fact she only maintained a few very slight injuries was even more remarkable, whereas everyone else on this airplane perished in the horrific crash into the wilds of the Amazon. A brilliant movie, superbly acted out indeed and one I will treasure forever and love to continue watching! Strongly recommended by me for sure! Choose your answer.

A funeral for Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a noted foreign policy expert and thinker, will be held Friday at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters. He served as a counselor and trustee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a professor at Johns Hopkins University. Brzezinski went on to ruffle the feathers of Washington's power elite with his 1983 book, \\"Power and...

Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed. Mary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity. At the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. \\"A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,\\" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college. \\"One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,\\"says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control. However, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills. Wherever the homework debate goes next, it's worth taking a moment to examine if we're doing the right thing about our children's education. The good news is -- it's never too late to start. Mary Jane Cera believes that _ . A) learning should develop creativity B) homework should be done at home C) learning remains to be a difficult task D) homework serves as a ticket to success Answer:","completion":"Mary Jane Cera believes that learning should develop creativity (A). At the Kino School, she implements a no-homework policy across all grades in order to ensure that learning remains a joyful experience rather than a chore that takes away from social time and creative activity. Instead of assigning homework, the school encourages students to willingly take their favorite learning experiences home, such as practicing music with friends or conducting experiments to showcase to their parents. The Kino School's approach is based on the belief that the traditional practice of assigning homework might not necessarily be the key to academic success, as pointed out by Alfie Kohn in his book \\"The Homework Myth.\\" Kohn argues that no study has ever found a direct correlation between homework and academic achievement. Furthermore, he asserts that if students have no say in their homework assignments, they are deprived of the opportunity to exercise judgment, leading to a loss of self-control. On the contrary, many supporters of homework claim that it teaches self-discipline, time management, and other non-academic skills essential for life. They argue that life is full of tasks we may not enjoy, yet must carry out, and homework serves as an opportunity to develop the skills needed to face such tasks. The debate on the value of homework in fostering academic success and personal growth continues, but one thing is evident: it is essential to examine our approaches to education and ensure that we are encouraging creativity and the joy of learning, rather than just focusing on test scores and measurable outcomes. The good news is that it is never too late to make changes and reassess how we teach our children."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Get out a small bowl and pour 1/4 (60 ml) of water into it. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of powdered gelatin evenly over the water.","completion":"Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes to allow the gelatin to soften and absorb the water. While the gelatin is setting, prepare the strawberries by washing and hulling 2 cups (about 16 oz or 450 g) of fresh strawberries. Place them in a blender or food processor and blend until they form a smooth puree. Set the puree aside momentarily while you prepare the remaining ingredients. In a medium-sized, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine 1/2 cup (100 g) of granulated sugar, a pinch of salt, and 1/3 cup (80 ml) of water. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally to help the sugar dissolve. Once the sugar is completely dissolved, allow the mixture to come to a boil and cook for an additional two minutes before removing it from heat. While the sugar mixture is cooling, carefully melt the softened gelatin in the microwave by heating it on high for about 15-20 seconds, or until it's fully liquified. Next, prepare the whipped cream component by pouring 1 cup (240 ml) of cold heavy cream into a large mixing bowl. Using a hand mixer or stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whip the cream on medium speed until soft peaks form. This should take around 4-5 minutes. Once you've achieved the desired consistency, gently fold in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the whipped cream, taking care not to deflate its airy texture. Returning to the reserved strawberry puree, gently mix in the melted gelatin until it's well incorporated. Then, add the cooled sugar mixture to the strawberry and gelatin mixture, stirring until it's fully combined. Gradually fold the strawberry mixture into the whipped cream, thoroughly but gently combining the two ingredients. Be careful not to overmix, as you want to preserve as much of the whipped cream's lightness as possible. Once everything is evenly incorporated, spoon the mousse into individual serving dishes, glasses, or ramekins. Cover the dishes with plastic wrap and refrigerate them for at least 4 hours, or until the mousse has set and reached a firm consistency. For optimal flavor and texture, it's best to allow the mousse to chill overnight. When you're ready to serve, optionally garnish each dish with a dollop of whipped cream, a fresh strawberry slice, and a sprig of fresh mint. Enjoy your delightfully light and creamy strawberry mousse, a luxurious and refreshing dessert that's sure to impress your family and friends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: By Charles HavilandBBC News, Colombo The country has not carried out a judicial execution since 1976 but has over 400 prisoners on death row. The authorities want to have an executioner ready in case hangings resume. But three recruits have now abandoned the job within a year after the previous hangman was promoted to become a prison guard. Commissioner-General of Prisons Chandrarathna Pallegama told the BBC that the new recruit - reported to be 40 and from the town of Anuradhapura - \\"got shocked and afraid\\" after seeing the gallows, which came after several days of training. He had written a letter saying he wanted to resign and had failed to report for training since Monday. Mr Pallegama said the man would be given one month to consider his decision. If there was no change, fresh applications would be called for through a government gazette. The last permanent hangman had also said the gallows made him nervous, and he felt he was lucky only to have done clerical work despite his job title. Two men were then recruited from among 176 applicants but quit the job last year after going on unauthorised leave, reports said. The man who has just resigned is reported to have been the third-placed applicant from that process. Any new execution in Sri Lanka would have to be authorised by President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

To begin with, the rack offered a structured layout with designated spaces for each type of tool, which enabled him to maintain a clutter-free and orderly workspace. This feature was particularly appealing as it allowed him to effortlessly locate and retrieve the exact tool he needed to complete a given task, thereby saving precious time and energy. Moreover, the rack was designed with space efficiency in mind, making it a more suitable alternative to hanging tools on the wall. By consolidating the storage of his tools, the rack enabled him to economize the horizontal wall space, freeing up valuable room in his workspace for other essential items and components. This optimizes the overall efficiency and utilization of his limited workshop area. Additionally, the rack was equipped with adjustable and customizable features that allowed him to tailor the storage system to fit his unique collection of tools, as well as accommodate any new acquisitions in the future. This flexibility ensured that the rack could continue to meet his evolving organizational needs, without necessitating any modifications to the wall or the need to purchase additional storage equipment. Furthermore, using the rack also provided an added layer of protection to the tools, as compared to hanging them directly on the wall. Unlike the wall, the rack was designed specifically to hold tools securely in place, minimizing the risk of accidental falls or damages that could be encountered when attempting to hang tools on the wall haphazardly. This aspect of the rack ensured that his investment in high-quality tools remained protected and well-maintained for a longer period. Lastly, the visually appealing aspect of the rack should not be overlooked. The clean, professional appearance created by using a dedicated tool rack, as opposed to an assortment of tools hanging randomly on a wall, contributed to a more productive and motivating working environment. A well-organized and aesthetically pleasing workspace has been proven to foster improved focus and efficiency in completing tasks. In conclusion, the decision to hang the tools on the rack instead of the wall was driven by a multitude of factors, including superior organization, space efficiency, ease of access, adaptability, protection, and aesthetics. All of these combined advantages made the rack an ideal and practical choice for managing his collection of tools effectively, ensuring a more streamlined, productive, and enjoyable working experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That month, the group contributed \\"Error: Operator\\" to the video-game adaption of Fantastic Four, and it was later added to the film's soundtrack as well. On September 21, 2005, it was announced that Taking Back Sunday had begun recording their third album with Eric Valentine. The group chose Valentine because he had produced Queens of the Stone Age's Songs for the Deaf (2002) and Third Eye Blind's self-titled album (1997). On April 25, 2006, Taking Back Sunday released their third album, entitled Louder Now, on Warner Bros. Records. The members' comments on the album reflected the dramatic change the band had undergone in the two years since their last release. Matt Rubano noted that the move to a major label was not something the band took lightly, but it was a move that made sense given the band's tumultuous past. Lazzara stated that fans seemed to feel their live shows had more energy than their recordings, and that Louder Now brought more of that across. Taking Back Sunday received mainstream exposure by appearing on the late night talk shows The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and Late Night with Conan O'Brien, as well as the teen drama Degrassi: The Next Generation in an episode entitled \\"What's It Feel Like To Be A Ghost?\\". In December 2006, the band released its first documentary, Louder Now: PartOne, featuring behind-the-scenes tour footage and four live concerts. Following months of touring to support Louder Now, Taking Back Sunday appeared in the American leg of Live Earth on July 7, 2007. During the summer of 2007, Taking Back Sunday was also a part of Linkin Park's Projekt Revolution tour, along with My Chemical Romance, HIM, and several other bands. On October 30, 2006, the band's former record label, Victory Records, released Notes from the Past, which featured four songs from Tell All Your Friends, six songs from Where You Want To Be, and two B-sides: The Ballad of Sal Villanueva and Your Own Disaster ('04 mix). The band then released Louder Now: Part Two on November 20, 2007, a DVD of unreleased live concert footage from their show at Long Beach Arena in Long Beach, California, which included special features such as the video for \\"Twenty-Twenty Surgery\\", made to be released in Europe. The DVD was packaged with a companion CD featuring eight live tracks, two B-sides that were previously unreleased in America, and a special \\"Twelve Days of Christmas\\" track. In 2007, the band contributed the song \\"What's It Feel Like to Be a Ghost?\\" to the soundtrack for the science fiction action film Transformers, although the song did not appear in the film. Did they tour to support the album?","completion":"Yes, Taking Back Sunday toured extensively in support of their album, Louder Now.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In architecture Durer cites Vitruvius but elaborates his own classical designs and columns. In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective. Question: \\"In which book does Durer show the understanding of Euclidean principles?\\" Response: \\"His last book\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"Yes, sweetie, the response to the question is factually correct.

Help as much as you can. Question: I can use this background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Now, I have a new situation: Bimmy and Harold are both four years old and are about to start attending school. Before that though, it is important that they have adequate supplies to be prepared. Bimmy's parents, who both have worn glasses their whole lives, took him to the store to pick up folders and pencils. While there, they bumped into Harold and his parents, who do not wear glasses. They quickly exchanged hellos before moving on with their shopping. Answer this question please: Which boy will more likely struggle to see the chalkboard when they start school? Answer:","completion":"Bimmy will more likely struggle to see the chalkboard when they start school since there is some evidence that myopia (nearsightedness) is inherited and both of his parents wear glasses. This increases the chance that Bimmy will need glasses too. On the other hand, Harold's parents do not wear glasses, which may indicate a lower likelihood of him developing nearsightedness at a young age."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What York-based Quaker family created several substantial social reform trusts as a legacy of its chocolate business?","completion":"The York-based Quaker family that created several substantial social reform trusts as a legacy of its chocolate business is the Rowntree family. The Rowntrees were prominent members of the Society of Friends (Quakers) and established the chocolate company Rowntree's in 1862, which would eventually become one of the largest confectionery manufacturers in the United Kingdom. The founders, Henry Isaac Rowntree and his younger brother, Joseph Rowntree, were deeply concerned about the social conditions prevalent in York and other parts of England during the 19th and 20th centuries. They were particularly moved by the poverty, squalor, poor living conditions, and lack of education for the working classes. Their religious convictions, as Quakers, motivated them to use their wealth to improve the lives of those less fortunate. To create a lasting social impact, the Rowntrees established several trusts as part of their legacy. These trusts focused on various social reform areas, such as education, housing, public health, and social welfare. Some of the key trusts founded by the Rowntree family include: 1. Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust (1904): Established by Joseph Rowntree, this trust had a broader focus of \\"searching out the underlying causes of weakness or evil in the community, rather than remedying their more superficial manifestations.\\" This trust supports a range of activities, including peace and security, power and responsibility, and social justice. 2. Joseph Rowntree Social Service Trust (1919): Later renamed as the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, it aimed at promoting political, constitutional, and electoral reform. It provides financial support to organizations and individuals who are engaged in campaigns and policy-making processes to bring about change. 3. Joseph Rowntree Foundation (1904): Originally founded as the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust, its purpose was to create model housing in line with the Quaker belief that suitable living conditions were critical for a person's development and well-being. Over time, the trust expanded its interests to involve research and policy development. Today, it is a well-respected independent research organization addressing poverty and social issues in the UK. 4. Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust (1968): Established to focus on providing high-quality social housing, the trust remains active today, running several housing projects. In addition to owning and managing rental properties, it seeks to innovate in housing design, construction methods, and community building. The Rowntree family's legacy, built on their Quaker values, still influences societal issues in the UK today. Their trusts' continued support helps address contemporary challenges, such as poverty, inequality, and human rights, reflecting the Rowntrees' commitment to social reform and ensuring their chocolate business's lasting positive impact on society."},{"prompt":"My daughter was away at college preparing for her final exams and nursing boards.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. I am facing a new situation today: David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which case the products concentration would decrease, case A or case B? A:","completion":"In case B, the products concentration would decrease. This is because the reverse reaction is favored, which means the concentrations of the products will decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants will increase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The police chief said the actions were 'proper' to get a gun from Jackson. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Controversial Actions of Police Officers Under Investigation Following Arrest of Auto Theft Suspect As recent footage has come to light displaying the actions of two police officers while apprehending a suspect, citizens have collectively expressed concern about the use of force and the potential for abuse. The video shows the officers repeatedly punching and kicking the suspect during arrest, prompting the Prosecutor's Office to consider whether to file charges against the officers involved. The incident occurred when police officers were attempting to arrest Andrew Jackson Jr., who had allegedly stolen a car at gunpoint earlier that day. According to law enforcement, Jackson had fled from the officers and was known to have parole violations. When the arresting officers finally caught up to him, the subsequent events that unfolded raised questions about the officers' approach and adherence to protocol. In the video, the two officers are seen repeatedly striking Jackson while they arrest him. A third officer arrives at the scene later and engages in a fist bump with one of the arresting officers, raising the question of the intention behind their actions. Amidst growing scrutiny, the police chief offered reassurances that the actions of the officers were appropriate given the circumstances. He argued that the use of force was necessary for disarming Jackson and securing the gun he had illegally possessed. The police chief also noted that Jackson's background in criminal activity and parole violations warranted a more cautious and forceful approach during arrest. However, this perspective has not been universally accepted. Critics argue that the display of excessive force goes against the responsibility of law enforcement to protect the rights and wellbeing of all citizens, regardless of their alleged infractions. The emergence of this footage has spurred an ongoing debate about the extent of appropriate police intervention, particularly in relation to potentially violent and dangerous suspects. The Prosecutor's Office, responsible for determining whether or not to file charges against the involved officers, will be the deciding factor in how this case proceeds. Their decision will undoubtedly set a precedent for how future incidents of a similar nature are handled. Additionally, their response will likely inform public discourse surrounding the role of law enforcement in maintaining safety while respecting the rights of the community members they serve. In an era of increased discussion and awareness about police brutality and the use of force, this case brings to light the complexities inherent to navigating between law enforcement obligations and ethical conduct. As the debate between what constitutes necessary force and what amounts to abuse of power continues to evolve, all eyes will be on the Prosecutor's Office and the outcome of this case to determine the future of policing within the community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jesse is also romantically involved with Abby, but is unaware that she's the one who tipped off Reynolds as to his brothers' whereabouts. Reynolds is treated fairly by Morgan, the warden, but not by Captain Wells, a sadistic guard. Abby ends up sent to Devil's Canyon herself for a robbery. To keep her as far as possible from the male inmates, Abby is assigned to work with Dr. Betts in the prison infirmary. She treats Reynolds' wounds after Jesse injures him in a fight. Abby plots a jailbreak. Sneaking guns to Joe and Red, outlaw partners of Jesse, she tries to persuade Reynolds to join them. He refuses, respecting the law and also not trusting Jesse a bit. Wells finds knives in Reynolds' cell, planted there by Jesse. The warden and Wells are tipped off about the breakout, but Jesse guns down Wells in cold blood. Guards are taken hostage and the other prisoners are set free. Abby, now afraid of Jesse and his violent ways, is slapped by him and left behind. She manages to free Reynolds, who takes over the guards' machine-gun nest, kills Jesse and orders the others back to their cells. The warden vows to do everything in his power to grant Reynolds and Abby a pardon for their crimes. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person who treats Reynolds' wounds is Dr. Betts. In the given article, Abby Nixon is assigned to work with Dr. Betts in the prison infirmary at Devil's Canyon.

Even though the review starts with a seemingly negative opinion, it quickly turns into a highly positive description of a French movie that the reviewer holds remarkably high regard for. The individual states that their favorite movie is the 'longest and talkiest French movie,' which contradicts their initial statement about disliking over-long and over-talky French films. This usage of contrast can be seen as an ironic appreciation. They then talk about how they've seen it twice in the mid-70's, implying a fond memory or experience, and reaffirm this by saying they 'fell in love all over again' when they got to see it in 1999. This enduring love for the movie portrays a deep sense of attachment and positive sentiment. Furthermore, the reviewer goes on to call the movie 'remarkable', indicating that it had a significant impact on them. Finally, they comment on how fresh it feels today as it did 25 years ago. This endurance testifies to the quality of the movie and the positive attitude of the reviewer towards it.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: A prospective client sent me a link to this in-depth article on IBM's design thinking revolution, where Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design, has hired over 1000 designers into the firm, and pushed for over 8000 of its managers and staff to get 'trained' in design thinking. They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history. However, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago. I'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why. Since design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking. There is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money....

Most excitatory synapses in the brain are housed on dendritic spines, small actin-rich protrusions extending from dendrites. During development and in response to environmental stimuli, spines undergo marked changes in shape and number thought to underlie processes like learning and memory. Improper spine development, in contrast, likely impedes information processing in the brain, since spine abnormalities are associated with numerous brain disorders. Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate the formation and plasticity of spines and their resident synapses is therefore crucial to our understanding of cognition and disease. Rho-family GTPases, key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, play essential roles in orchestrating the development and remodeling of spines and synapses. Precise spatio-temporal regulation of Rho GTPase activity is critical for their function, since aberrant Rho GTPase signaling can cause spine and synapse defects as well as cognitive impairments. Rho GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and inhibited by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). We propose that Rho-family GEFs and GAPs provide the spatiotemporal regulation and signaling specificity necessary for proper Rho GTPase function based on the following features they possess: (i) existence of multiple GEFs and GAPs per Rho GTPase, (ii) developmentally regulated expression, (iii) discrete localization, (iv) ability to bind to and organize specific signaling networks, and (v) tightly regulated activity, perhaps involving GEF/GAP interactions. Recent studies describe several Rho-family GEFs and GAPs that uniquely contribute to spinogenesis and synaptogenesis. Here, we highlight several of these proteins and discuss how they occupy distinct biochemical niches critical for synaptic development..

The sentence includes GPS monitoring and probation as part of multiple consequences for her actions. The case warrants further examination to understand the context and complicated circumstances leading up to the incarceration. Bonita Lynn Vela faced accusations of holding the teenage boyfriend of her daughter against his will and interrogating him due to suspicions of inappropriate conduct. The 18-year-old victim vehemently denied Vela's accusations and maintained his innocence throughout the traumatic episode. The ordeal began with Vela exhibiting extreme rage, something the victim later recounted in his statement to authorities. He described her emotional state as \\"extremely mad\\" and \\"out of control\\" – a dangerous mix of emotions that made the situation even more volatile. Vela's actions escalated to the point of allegedly holding the victim captive for an agonizing three hours. During this time, the 18-year-old was subjected to her unfounded suspicions and relentless questioning. The terror and helplessness experienced by the victim is unimaginable, and the case serves as a stark reminder that the consequences of acting on anger and deeply held mistrust can be severe, both legally and emotionally. Upon further investigation, it was found that Vela was under the influence of marijuana during the incident, which may have fueled her erratic behavior. Vela herself admitted to smoking the substance and couldn't be sure if she had consumed any other drugs along with it. The role of substances in her reckless actions remains unclear, but it is important to consider the impact they may have had on her capacity to discern right from wrong, control her emotions, and make sound decisions in a highly charged situation. The 16-month sentence passed down by the Johnson County judge, which incorporates GPS monitoring and probation, offers a multifaceted approach towards rehabilitating Vela and working to prevent similar incidents in the future. The sentence is designed to provide the justice system with the necessary oversight to monitor her whereabouts, ensuring her actions align with the terms of her probation and keeping her under close supervision. Additionally, the inclusion of probationary measures is aimed at helping Vela reform her behavioral patterns and make appropriate decisions that prioritize the well-being and safety of others, including her family members. As the case of Bonita Lynn Vela unfolds, it brings to light the far-reaching implications of uncontrolled anger and the use of substances that can negatively influence behavior. This tragic story serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of maintaining emotional stability and addressing personal issues responsibly. Furthermore, it highlights the critical role of our justice system in identifying and implementing measures that aim to protect both individuals and communities from dangerous situations created by unchecked emotions and potentially destructive actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two continents were separated by a large ocean. Oceania had milder weather and experienced common weather phenomena, while Lemuria experienced natural disasters. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which continent experienced more tornadoes? Hint: On Earth, the common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere). Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity). Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.","completion":"Based on the information provided, Oceania experienced common weather phenomena such as wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog, and dust storms, while Lemuria experienced natural disasters.

Write a text based on this summary: vatican revises path to sainthood Text:","completion":"Title: Vatican Announces Revisions to the Path to Sainthood: A Look at the Modernization of Canonization The Vatican has recently announced a revision of the process and guidelines for the path to sainthood, signaling a shift toward modernization in one of the Catholic Church’s most spiritually significant aspects. The recognition of saints and the path to their canonization bear significant importance to millions of Catholics worldwide, as believers seek guidance, intercession, and inspiration from these holy individuals. One may ask, \\"Why revise the path to sainthood?\\" While much of the traditional teachings and practices of the Catholic Church have been upheld for centuries, this change reflects the Church’s ongoing efforts to adapt and respond to the ever-transforming world. The Vatican's decision places emphasis not only on what the Church values in its canonized saints but also on how society has evolved in its understanding of sanctity. Having journeyed through history, the process of becoming a saint has experienced various modifications and adaptations. The most recent reform took place under Pope Paul VI in 1969 and has remained largely unchanged since then. However, recognizing the need for a more responsive and flexible approach, Pope Francis has now undertaken the task of reevaluating the existing guidelines and structure surrounding the canonization process. This reformation aims to streamline the path to sainthood by providing clearer instructions and criteria, as well as revisiting the understanding of martyrdom, heroic virtue, and the \\"Equipollent Canonization\\" procedure. Specifically, Pope Francis delineated an additional category for sainthood - those who have experienced a \\"free and voluntary\\" offering of their lives, often referred to as \\"oblatio vitae.\\" In an increasingly interconnected world, there is a broader awareness of heroic acts, social activism, and selflessness demonstrated by people from various walks of life. With this revision, the Vatican acknowledges the need to appreciate and recognize the diverse ways individuals can exhibit holiness and devotion to their faith, even in situations where such acts may not explicitly fit traditional definitions of martyrdom or heroic virtue. Furthermore, the modernization of the canonization process highlights the fact that the Church is seeking engagement and relevance with its ever-growing global community. By revisiting and refining the requirements for sainthood, the Vatican encourages a deeper connection between believers and the individuals they revere as saints. In rewriting the path to sainthood, the Catholic Church affirms its willingness to adapt and better serve its congregation. Pope Francis's revision does not diminish the sanctity of attaining sainthood, but instead underscores the importance of recognizing the myriad ways one can exhibit holiness and serve God in our contemporary world. This change also invites increased dialogue around the lives and legacies of those who may be considered for canonization. Through this open conversation, Catholics can better understand the saintly qualities that transcend time and borders and recognize that sanctity can take many forms, requiring a modern interpretation of the spiritual journey. In conclusion, the Vatican's revisions to the path to sainthood exemplify the Catholic Church's commitment to a contemporary understanding of faith in the modern world. With a more inclusive and responsive approach, not only does the Church strive to better connect with its congregation, but it also highlights the universality of faith and holiness along both traditional and newly-defined pathways."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 0 = 41*f + 33*f + 1584 + 2042 for f.","completion":"The given equation is 0 = 41f + 33f + 1584 + 2042. To solve for 'f', first we need to simplify the equation. Looking at the equation, you can see that there are two terms containing 'f'. Add those together. We can also add together the two constants, the numbers without 'f': 0 = (41f + 33f) + (1584 + 2042) Upon adding these, we get: 0 = 74f + 3626 Now, the objective is to isolate 'f'. We do that by first moving constant term from one side of the equation to the other side. When we do that, the sign of the term changes, so 3626 becomes -3626: 74f = -3626 Next, to solve for 'f', we divide both sides of the equation by 74 since 74 is the coefficient of 'f' (the number before 'f'): f = -3626 / 74 When this division is done, we get: f = -49 So the solution to the problem 0 = 41f + 33f + 1584 + 2042 is f = -49. Remember, you can always check your work by substituting the calculated 'f' value back into the original equation to see if both sides balance. In this case, when we substitute 'f' as -49 into the original equation, both sides will be equal which confirms that the solution f = -49 is correct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"No, no, no!\\" said in Finnish?","completion":"In Finnish, the phrase \\"No, no, no!\\" can be translated as \\"Ei, ei, ei!\\". Finnish, like English, allows for repetition of short words or phrases to emphasize the meaning. Here are some more details about the phrase in Finnish: - \\"Ei\\": This is a negative particle in Finnish, which means \\"no\\" or \\"not\\". It is commonly used in response to a question, to negate a statement, or to express disagreement. - Repetition: Just like in English, repeating the word \\"Ei\\" three times strengthens the emphasis and makes the response more forceful, similar to the phrase \\"No, no, no!\\" in English. Here is an example to help illustrate the use of \\"Ei, ei, ei!\\" in Finnish: - In a conversation where someone asks another person if they want to go to a party, the person who does not want to go might say \\"Ei, ei, ei!\\" to emphasize their unwillingness. It's important to note that inflection, tone, and gestures also play a critical role in understanding and using the phrase \\"Ei, ei, ei!\\" effectively. The way it is said might change the meaning, making it sound more friendly and disapproving, or more serious and firm, based on the context and non-verbal cues. In summary, \\"No, no, no!\\" is translated as \\"Ei, ei, ei!\\" in Finnish, and it can be used in different contexts, similar to its English counterpart.

Choices: [+] yes [+] it is not possible to tell [+] no These choices provide possible answers to a question that could be related to the premise and/or hypothesis, where \\"yes\\" affirms, \\"no\\" negates, and \\"it is not possible to tell\\" indicates uncertainty or lack of sufficient information to make a definite conclusion. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis: If the premise is true (i.e., \\"it's amazing\\"), does it automatically mean that the hypothesis is also true (i.e., \\"it is the best experience in my life\\")? While the two statements are similar in that they both express a positive view about the experience, they differ in the extent of the emotions or valuation implied. The premise simply declares that the experience is amazing, without necessarily comparing it to other experiences. On the other hand, the hypothesis is a bolder claim, asserting that the experience is not only amazing, but is also the best among all the life experiences of the person making the statement. Therefore, it is not possible to directly conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. This is because an experience can be amazing without necessarily being the best of one's life. There might have been other amazing experiences in the person's life that were even better or more exceptional than the one being discussed. Now, let's relate this to the choices provided: It is not possible to conclusively determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis based solely on their contents and the given choices. The best choice among the ones provided would be \\"it is not possible to tell\\" since there isn't sufficient information to definitively link the truthfulness of the premise to the hypothesis. In conclusion, while both the premise and the hypothesis share a common theme of positivity, they convey different degrees of emotional intensity and valuation. It is not possible to directly conclude that if the premise is true (i.e., \\"it's amazing\\"), then the hypothesis is also true (i.e., \\"it is the best experience in my life\\"), as being amazing does not inherently imply being the best in one's life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: Dozens of prominent art galleries have set up shop in Santa Monica, with the result that it is now a major center of the contemporary art scene. Hypothesis: Dozens of art galleries have drawn in many investors and tourists to Santa Monica. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Alright kiddo, let me explain this to you. There's this place called Santa Monica, and many, many art galleries have opened there. Because of this, Santa Monica has become a very important place for modern art. Now, the big question is whether these art galleries make a lot of people, like investors and tourists, come to Santa Monica. Well, the first part tells us that Santa Monica is a popular place for art because of the galleries. So, it's possible that lots of people, including investors and tourists, come there because they like art and want to see the galleries. That's what the hypothesis is trying to say.

Question Why would the narrator be narrowing down the list of SUVs ? Possible answers: Choose your answer from: (i) They want something somewhat fuel efficient . (ii) None of the above choices . (iii) They want something from Honda . (iv) They want something from Nissan . The answer:","completion":"(i) They want something somewhat fuel efficient. The narrator in this context is specifically looking for an SUV that gets at least 20 miles per gallon, indicating that fuel efficiency is an important factor in their decision-making process. While they have considered a few different models, including the Honda Pilot, Toyota RAV4, and Honda Element, the common factor among these choices is their focus on achieving better fuel efficiency. This preference helps to narrow down their list of potential vehicles, since not all SUVs on the market can boast such fuel economy. Although they have considered options from Honda and Toyota, the narrator's focus on fuel efficiency does not mean they are exclusively interested in vehicles from these brands. Rather, it seems that these specific models happen to meet their criteria for fuel efficiency and potentially other factors. Therefore, it is possible that the narrator would be open to considering fuel-efficient SUVs from other manufacturers, as long as they align with their requirements. In summary, the narrator is narrowing down their list of SUVs mainly because they are particularly interested in finding a vehicle that offers better fuel economy, without limiting their search to a specific brand. This criterion allows them to filter out potential options that do not align with their desires for a more eco-friendly and cost-effective driving experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - govern peopple - desk - drawer - office - purse The answer is \\"desk\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"desk\\" because a ruler is a measuring tool commonly used in various activities such as drawing, designing, or even simple measurement tasks. It is typically found in workspaces like desks, where activities related to its purpose are often performed. A desk provides a flat surface to place a ruler on top of for easy access, or you can store it in one of the desk's compartments, like a drawer, to keep it secure and organized. While the other options might be related to a ruler in some sense, they don't explicitly pertain to putting the ruler \\"on top\\" or \\"into\\" something. - Governing people is an abstract concept and doesn't directly involve using or placing a ruler. - A drawer is a compartment within a larger piece of furniture (such as a desk), and while you can put a ruler into a drawer, the most comprehensive answer is \\"desk,\\" as it covers both placement options. - An office refers to a working space or room where tasks are performed, but it doesn't define the specific location of where the ruler would be placed within that space. - A purse is designed to carry various items, and although it is possible to place a ruler inside a purse, the context and purpose are less aligned and less common compared to placing a ruler on a desk."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: The Truth About Cats & Dogs Movie plot: This article needs an improved plot summary. (August 2015) Abby Barnes (Garofalo) is a veterinarian and host of a radio show called The Truth About Cats and Dogs. When she makes a blind date with Brian (Chaplin), a caller to her show, her insecurity about her appearance leads her to persuade her more conventionally attractive (though less intellectual) friend Noelle (Thurman) to pretend to be Abby on their date. Both women develop feelings for Brian, leading to a series of comic misunderstandings. Brian's persistence in pursuing Noelle in person is thwarted as Noelle tries to maneuver him toward the real Abby. After Abby behaves jealously while drunk and embarrasses herself at a photo shoot, she leaves and it appears to her that Brian and Noelle sleep together. However, Noelle actually leaves too, and Brian, distressed by Noelle's changing attitude, corners Abby in her apartment where he finds evidence of her real identity as the radio host he fell for through her voice. As Abby and Noelle attempt to explain, Brian decides he has been the victim of a practical joke and leaves in disgust. Abby later approaches Brian at his regular bar and explains what happened, and although initially dismissive, he eventually meets with Abby and he has fallen for the real Abby and was only attracted to Noelle because of their deception.

Q:Given the fact that: If blood volume in the body decreases, blood pressure decreases. Answer the question: If Jim increases a lot of blood from a cut he sustains, what will happen to his blood pressure it will become lower or it will become higher? A:","completion":"If Jim loses a significant amount of blood from a cut he sustains, his blood pressure will become lower. This decrease in blood pressure is due to a reduction in blood volume, which directly affects the pressure exerted on the walls of Jim's blood vessels. Blood pressure is determined by two primary factors: cardiac output (how much blood the heart pumps per minute) and peripheral resistance (the resistance provided by blood vessels). Blood volume plays a crucial role in maintaining normal blood pressure. When there is a decrease in blood volume, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance are affected, leading to a drop in blood pressure. As Jim loses blood from the cut, his body will respond by constricting blood vessels and increasing his heart rate to try and maintain blood pressure at a stable level. However, if the loss of blood is significant, these compensatory mechanisms may not be sufficient, and Jim may experience a decrease in blood pressure. Low blood pressure, also known as hypotension, can lead to a variety of symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, and even shock if left untreated. The severity of these symptoms depends on the amount of blood lost and the rate at which it was lost. In addition to the body's initial response to blood loss, other factors may affect Jim's blood pressure and his body's ability to compensate. These factors include his age, overall health, and the presence of any pre-existing medical conditions. In summary, if Jim experiences significant blood loss from a cut, his blood pressure will likely become lower due to the consequential decrease in blood volume. It is essential that Jim receives prompt medical attention to address the bleeding and restore his blood volume in order to stabilize his blood pressure and minimize the risk of any complications or long-term effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Short movie review: replete with the pubescent scandalous Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the short movie review provided, it seems that the critic is leaning towards a negative perception of the movie. The phrase \\"replete with the pubescent scandalous\\" suggests that the film is filled with scandalous content or situations related to teenagers, which might be inappropriate or distasteful for some viewers. The critic could be implying that the movie prioritizes shock value and scandalous material over genuine storytelling or emotional depth. Movies that heavily rely on the portrayal of controversial or outrageous subject matters often face criticism for lacking subtlety, nuance, or sensitivity. As a result, this type of content might not always be appealing to a particular critic or audience. However, the ambiguity of the review and its brevity do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the movie, making it difficult to firmly determine if the critic's opinion is entirely negative. It's important to recognize that different viewers may interpret \\"scandalous\\" content in various ways, and some may appreciate the movie's daring or controversial elements. A more detailed review examining additional aspects of the film such as the plot, characters, performances, cinematography, and direction would provide better insight into the critic's overall opinion. For now, it appears that the critic is viewing the movie in a negative light, mainly due to its reliance on pubescent scandalous content."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I generally sleep poorly at night, but in the woods on a tour, I sleep like a baby with the music of insects. In the morning, birds wake me up. I eat a snack before getting up, and then I quickly pack my sleeping bag, tent, and other things and get on the road. Usually I have less speed. Traveling by bike allows me to stop anywhere, such as lakes(especially places to swim), woods, and scenic spots . Somewhere near lunch, I find a small drugstore and buy some bread, sandwich materials, and fruit. In the afternoon, my speeds are higher, and I spend less time at stops. In the late afternoon, I start thinking about stopping. I finally find a place in the early evening, cook a simple meal, and rest and cool off. As it starts to get dark, I put up my tent, and fall asleep. There are exciting times and difficult times as well. Visiting strange or famous places are always exciting to me. I meet and talk with interesting people along the way. Enjoying beautiful scenes, meeting wild animals(usually at my camping site), and traveling up and down hills also make me cheerful.

Passage:Following the conclusion of the 2011 season, Braves general manager Frank Wren highlighted several important areas to improve during the offseason. Since most players were committed contractually to the team in 2012, Wren acknowledged that he would likely make few major changes. One spot that was mentioned for a major overhaul was the shortstop position, where Alex González had played since the Yunel Escobar trade with Toronto in July 2010. González entered the offseason as a free agent and proved too expensive for the team. Wren ultimately allowed prospect Tyler Pastornicky the starting duties in 2012, until he was replaced by Andrelton Simmons in mid-June. When Simmons was hurt in July, Jack Wilson, Paul Janish, and Martín Prado filled in for him. While center fielder Michael Bourn returned to his position in 2012, Wren also suggested that the corner outfield positions were areas of contention. In 2011, the Atlanta outfielders finished the season last in the National League in on-base plus slugging and slugging percentage. Wren stated that right fielder Jason Heyward and left fielder Martín Prado had no guarantee of getting the starting jobs in 2012. On the day after the Braves were eliminated from the playoffs in 2011, Wren said that veteran starter Derek Lowe was unlikely to have a spot in the starting rotation in 2012, due his poor performance in 2011 and a plethora of rookie pitching talent in the Braves farm system. With Lowe guaranteed 15 million in 2012, Wren projected that any of Lowe's salary picked up by another team would significantly assist his efforts to find a shortstop or outfielder. By the end of October, Lowe was traded to the Indians. A:","completion":"b"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn). Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fiancÃ©e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Which candidate will Mike not vote for? Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is evident that Mike, as an avid environmentalist, would be concerned with the issues related to saving the planet, particularly the harmful effects of global warming caused by the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. He is likely to be aware of the scientific consensus on the matter, as expressed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In the debate, Jessica's statement that we should emit more anthropogenic gases suggests she might be in favor of increasing the release of greenhouse gases, which are known to have adverse effects on the Earth's atmosphere, climate, natural environment, and wildlife population. This stance appears to go against Mike's primary concern of saving the planet and protecting its animals. On the other hand, Milly's proposal to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere aligns with Mike's environmental beliefs and appears to be a more responsible approach to tackling the issue of global warming. By advocating for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, Milly's position aligns more closely with the international scientific consensus, aiming to mitigate the detrimental effects of climate change on both the natural environment and human existence. Considering this information, the candidate that Mike would most likely not vote for is Jessica, due to her support for emitting more anthropogenic gases, which, as an environmentalist, Mike would likely view as harmful to the planet and contradictory to his beliefs in preserving the Earth's atmosphere and protecting its inhabitants. Milly's stance on reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be more appealing to Mike, as it addresses the environmental concerns he prioritizes in a more responsible and scientifically endorsed manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In many ways, the Paleocene continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period. During the Paleocene, the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents. Europe and Greenland were still connected. North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate. The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the Neogene); the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart, with Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other.

If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a \\"time slice\\" until the event it is waiting for has occurred.

This is a concept in multitasking where the processor's time is divided into intervals and these intervals are distributed among the tasks. Each task gets a \\"slice\\" of time to execute before it's moved to a waiting state and the next task is attended by the processor. Although the term can be used broadly in computer scheduling programs, in this context, we understand it within the operations of a computer switching between several programs.

Context: Justin Nelson, Jr., pounded the last of the stakes of his new cattle pen into the dry dirt. Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Is that possible to increase height after age 21? If possible, how? Does height increase after 21? How can I get taller? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Yes, both questions are essentially the same as they are asking if height can increase after the age of 21 and seeking guidance on how to do so if it is possible. Now, let me address the question: Increasing height after the age of 21 can be challenging since, for most individuals, the growing plates in their bones have fused by then. However, there might still be ways to slightly increase your height or give the appearance of being taller. Here's a step-by-step approach: Step 1: Exercise Regularly Engaging in physical activities, such as swimming, playing sports, or performing yoga, can help keep your spine flexible and maintain good posture, which contributes to achieving your maximum height potential. Step 2: Maintain Good Posture Ensure that you maintain good posture throughout the day. Sit and stand straight, with your shoulders back and chin up, as poor posture can lead to spinal compression, which can cause you to appear shorter. Step 3: Stretch Incorporate stretching exercises in your daily routine, such as toe touches and backbends. These stretches can help elongate your spine and alleviate minor compression between the vertebrae, which can lead to slight height increase. Step 4: Healthy Diet Ensure that your diet includes essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, proteins, and carbohydrates. A healthy diet contributes to overall bone health and maintaining your optimal height. Step 5: Get Adequate Sleep Sleep is crucial for overall well-being, including growth and body maintenance. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night, and practice good sleep hygiene to optimize your health. Step 6: Consult a Physician If you believe that you have a growth disorder or if you are concerned about your height, consult a doctor for a professional opinion and potential growth hormone supplements. It's important to note that genetics play the most significant role in determining one's height. While the above steps might help in some cases, they may not lead to substantial changes in height, especially after the age of 21."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. - Snow pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when it precipitates from clouds and accumulates on surfaces, then metamorphoses in place, and ultimately melts, slides or sublimates away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts, seasonally, and causes runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater. - North Rhine-Westphalia (, commonly shortened to NRW) is the most populous state of Germany, with a population of approximately 18 million, and the fourth largest by area. Its capital is Düsseldorf; the most populous city is Cologne. Four of Germany's ten largest citiesCologne, Düsseldorf, Dortmund, and Essenare located within the state, as well as the largest metropolitan area on the European continent, Rhine-Ruhr. - Vulkaneifel is a district (\\"Kreis\\") in the northwest of the state Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is the least densely populated district in the state and the fourth most sparsely populated district in Germany. The administrative centre of the district is in Daun. Neighboring districts are Euskirchen (North Rhine-Westphalia), Ahrweiler, Mayen-Koblenz, Cochem-Zell, Bernkastel-Wittlich, and Bitburg-Prüm. - Jünkerath is an \\"Ortsgemeinde\\" a municipality belonging to a \\"Verbandsgemeinde\\", a kind of collective municipality in the Vulkaneifel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the \\"Verbandsgemeinde\\" of Obere Kyll, and is home to its seat. - Groundwater (or ground water) is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology. - A Verbandsgemeinde (plural Verbandsgemeinden) is an administrative unit in the Germanfederal states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - A glacier (or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water. - Ormont is an \\"Ortsgemeinde\\" a municipality belonging to a \\"Verbandsgemeinde\\", a kind of collective municipality in the Vulkaneifel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the \\"Verbandsgemeinde\\" of Obere Kyll, whose seat is in the municipality of Jünkerath. - The Eifel is a low mountain range in western Germany and eastern Belgium. It occupies parts of southwestern North Rhine-Westphalia, northwestern Rhineland-Palatinate and the south of the German-speaking Community of Belgium. - Snowpack forms from layers of snow that accumulate in geographic regions and high altitudes where the climate includes cold weather for extended periods during the year. Snowpacks are an important water resource that feed streams and rivers as they melt. Therefore, snowpacks are both the drinking water source for many communities and a potential source of flooding (in case of sudden melting). Snowpacks also contribute mass to glaciers in their accumulation zone. - The German-speaking Community of Belgium (, \\"DG\\"; ) is one of the three federal communities of Belgium.

It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.

It runs from Brandscheid near Prüm in a northeasterly direction to Ormont . The name Schneifel has nothing to do with the German words Schnee ( snow ) and Eifel . It is derived from the former dialect of this region and means something like Schneise ( \`\` swathe '' ) . This swathe ran over the mountains . The term was \`\` Germanised '' during the Prussian era and the term Schnee - Eifel ( \`\` Snow Eifel '' ) was born , albeit referring to a larger area . Winters in this low mountainous region are unusually cold and snowy for western and parts of central Europe and snow lies here for longer than anywhere else in the Eifel . As a result , the winter sports season is longer here than in the surrounding region . The highest point of the Schneifel is the 699.1 - metre - high Schwarze Mann ( \`\` Black Man '' ) , which is also the third highest point of the Eifel range after the Hohe Acht and the Erresberg ( Ernstberg ) . There is a winter sports area on the Schwarze Mann with the same name . The Schneifel is covered along its entire length by the ruins of bunkers which formed part of the Siegfried Line .

Here is a hypothesis: Trauma centers are not concerned with the testing for alcohol and other clinical procedures because the main goal is the get the patient stabilized. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if it is possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the given premise, we must analyze both the premise and hypothesis carefully and consider the available literature and evidence on the topic. Premise: Alcohol and other an assessment of testing and clinical practices in U.S. trauma centers. The premise suggests that there is a focus on investigating the testing and clinical practices in U.S. trauma centers, specifically relating to alcohol consumption and potentially other substance use. It implies that there is an interest in understanding the extent to which these substances are being tested for, and the possible impact they have on clinical endeavors within trauma centers. It is important to mention that the premise appears to be missing a word or phrase, possibly referring to \\"Alcohol and other drugs\\". Hypothesis: Trauma centers are not concerned with testing for alcohol and other clinical procedures because the main goal is to get the patient stabilized. The hypothesis claims that trauma centers do not prioritize testing for alcohol and other possible substances, as their primary goal is to stabilize the patient. It might suggest that because of this, other clinical procedures or protocols may be compromised or considered of secondary importance. In order to determine if the hypothesis is true based on the premise, we would need to analyze the data available on both the clinical practices in U.S. trauma centers and recent research on the topic. A detailed examination of evidence on alcohol and substance testing in trauma centers, as well as an understanding of clinical priorities and procedures in these facilities, would be necessary. It is essential to recognize that trauma centers have a primary goal of stabilizing their patients to prevent further harm or complications arising from the traumatic injury. In this regard, life-saving interventions and time-sensitive treatments are indeed prioritized. However, this does not automatically imply that trauma centers are not concerned with testing for alcohol and other substances or that other clinical procedures are neglected. In fact, several trauma centers do have protocols in place for screening and testing for alcohol and other substances as part of a comprehensive approach to patient care. The detection of and intervention for substance abuse is a critical aspect of treating the entire patient, as it can directly impact the success of their recovery and also helps address any underlying issues that may have contributed to the injury. Additionally, various research studies have emphasized the importance of recognizing the potential role of alcohol and other substances in the occurrence and outcomes of traumatic injuries. This evidence indicates that despite the priority given to stabilization, there is an increasing awareness in trauma centers of the importance of addressing alcohol and substance abuse during the course of patient care. In conclusion, while the immediate priority of a trauma center is indeed to stabilize the patient, it cannot be categorically stated that they are not concerned with testing for alcohol and other substances or that other clinical procedures are neglected. Although the given premise suggests an assessment or focus on practice related to substance testing and clinical practice in trauma centers, it is not sufficient to conclude that the hypothesis is true. To make a valid conclusion, a more rigorous analysis of the existing research and protocols within U.S. trauma centers would be necessary."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Q: Passage: In a rematch of Super Bowl 50, the defending champion Broncos played host to the Carolina Panthers, in the opening kickoff game. This was the Panthers' their first visit to Denver since 2004. Following a fumble on the Broncos' initial possession, the Panthers grabbed the early lead, with a 14-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Cam Newton to wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin. The Broncos responded early in the second quarter, with a 28-yard touchdown by fullback Andy Janovich on his first rushing attempt. The Panthers then re-claimed the lead, with Newton rushing for a 2-yard touchdown, in an 18-play, 89-yard drive that took nine minutes off the clock. After the Broncos' offense went three-and-out, the Panthers added to their lead just before halftime, with a 44-yard field goal by placekicker Graham Gano. Following a scoreless third quarter, the Broncos pulled to within a 17-14 deficit on the first play of the fourth quarter, with quarterback Trevor Siemian connecting on a 25-yard touchdown pass to running back C. J. Anderson. On the second play of the Panthers' next drive, Newton was intercepted by cornerback Chris Harris Jr. at the Panthers' 38-yard line, giving the Broncos excellent field position. Ten plays later, the Broncos grabbed their first lead of the game, with Anderson rushing up the middle for a 1-yard touchdown at the 9:30 mark of the fourth quarter. The Panthers methodically marched down the field, hoping to re-claim the lead, but had to settle for a 36-yard field goal by Gano to pull to within a 21-20 deficit with 4:25 remaining. After the Broncos' went three-and-out, the Panthers had one last offensive possession. On the first play after the two-minute warning, the Panthers were facing a 4th-and-21 at their own 29-yard line, and a pass from Newton intended for Benjamin was incomplete, however, Harris was flagged for an illegal hands to the face penalty, giving a Panthers an automatic first down. With 47 seconds remaining, Newton was penalized for intentional grounding with the Panthers' at their own 47-yard line, however, Broncos' cornerback Darian Stewart was penalized for roughing the passer, with a helmet hit on Newton, resulting in both penalties offsetting. With only 14 seconds remaining, Newton completed a crucial pass to wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. at the Broncos' 32-yard line, setting up Gano for a potential game-winning field goal. After the Broncos called a timeout in order to ice the kicker, Gano's 50-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left, sealing the win for the Broncos. Andy Janovich became only the third player in Broncos' franchise history to score on his first rushing attempt; the other two are fullback Kyle Johnson and quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt, both of which occurred in 2005.

The Lone Prospector gets lost in the same blizzard while also prospecting for gold. He stumbles into the cabin of Black Larsen, a wanted criminal. Larsen tries to throw him out when Jim also stumbles inside. Larsen tries to scare both out using his shotgun but is overpowered by Jim and the three agree to an uneasy truce where they all can stay in the cabin. When the storm is taking so long that food is running out, the three draw lots for who will have to go out into the blizzard to obtain some food. Larsen loses and leaves the cabin. While outside looking for food, he encounters Jim's gold deposit and decides to ambush him there when Jim returns. Meanwhile, the two remaining in the cabin get so desperate that they cook and eat one of the Prospector's shoes. Later, Jim gets delirious, imagines the Prospector as a giant chicken and attacks him. At that moment, a bear enters the cabin and is killed, supplying them with food. After the storm subsides, both leave the cabin, the Prospector continuing on to the next gold boom town while Jim returns to his gold deposit. There, he is knocked out by Larsen with a shovel. While fleeing with some of the mined gold, Larsen is swept to his death in an avalanche. Jim recovers consciousness and wanders into the snow, but he has lost his memory from the blow. When he returns to the town, his memory has been partly restored and he remembers that he had found a large gold deposit, that the deposit was close to a certain cabin and that he had stayed in the cabin with the Prospector.

Paragraph: New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success. Question: \\"What did Howard Hughes purchase during his Vegas buying spree?\\" Answer: \\"300 million in properties\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Answer: No, this answer is not entirely correct. A more accurate and detailed answer would be: During Howard Hughes' three-year buying spree in Las Vegas, he spent 300 million and acquired six casinos, an airport, an airline, and numerous plots of land from the Strip to the mountains."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"This review undoubtedly depicts the product in an unflattering light. The various factors contributing to this negative portrayal can be analyzed in a more comprehensive manner to provide a better understanding of the reviewer's perspective. First and foremost, the reviewer emphasizes the book's dated nature. By stating that it is a \\"relic of old school thinking,\\" the reviewer implies that the information presented in the book is no longer relevant or useful, thus making the book unappealing to potential readers. In today's fast-paced world, with knowledge and trends constantly evolving, people typically prefer up-to-date and cutting-edge information. In this context, the reviewer's portrayal of the book as outdated directly challenges its value and appeal. Additionally, the reviewer points out that the book's content has been sourced from older materials, suggesting a lack of originality or innovation. The term \\"re-hashes\\" carries a negative connotation, implying that the book merely recycles pre-existing content instead of offering fresh insights. This further paints the book in a poor light, as readers generally prefer to consume new, engaging, and distinctive content. Furthermore, the reviewer highlights the significant changes that have occurred in the last four years, which are not adequately accounted for in the book. This criticism implies that the book may not only be out-of-date, but also incompetent in addressing recent developments or advancements, further undermining its credibility and usefulness to potential readers. Lastly, the reviewer expresses a faint hope that a new, updated edition might be published and prove valuable. While this suggestion slightly alleviates the overall negativity of the review, it still reinforces the notion that the current edition is not worth purchasing. This leaves the reader with the impression that the book cannot meet their needs or expectations, resulting in an unflattering depiction of the product. In conclusion, this review presents the product in an unflattering light, highlighting its dated content, lack of originality, and inability to address recent changes. The review ultimately discourages potential readers from considering the book as a valuable and worthwhile purchase."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100 BC 15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - The Dangerous Book for Boys, by Conn and Hal Iggulden, is a guidebook published by HarperCollins, aimed at boys \\"from eight to eighty.\\" It covers around eighty topics, including how to build a treehouse, grow a crystal, or tell direction with a watch. Also included are famous quotes, stories, battles, and phrases that \\"every boy should know.\\" It was published in the UK on 5 June 2006, and reached number one in the UK non-fiction charts several times, selling over half a million copies. - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - Historical fiction is a literary genre in which the plot takes place in a setting located in the past. Historical fiction can be an ambiguous term: frequently it is used as a synonym for describing the historical novel; however, the term can be applied to works in other narrative formats, such as those in the performing and visual arts like theatre, opera, cinema, television, comics, and graphic novels. - The Gods of War is the fourth novel in the Emperor series , written by British author Conn Iggulden .

The capital of Benin is Porto-Novo, but the seat of government is in Cotonou, the country's largest city and economic capital. Benin covers an area of 114,763 square kilometers and its population in 2015 was estimated to be approximately 10.88 million. Benin is a tropical, sub-Saharan nation, highly dependent on agriculture, with substantial employment and income arising from subsistence farming. - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. - The Cape of Good Hope (, ) is a rocky headland on the Atlantic coast of the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. - Dutch trading posts and plantations in the Americas precede the much wider known colonization activities of the Dutch in Asia. While the first Dutch fort in Asia was built in 1600 (in present-day Indonesia), the first forts and settlements on the Essequibo River in Guyana date from the 1590s. Actual colonization, with Dutch settling in the new lands, was not as common as with other European nations. Many of the Dutch settlements were lost or abandoned by the end of the 17th century, but the Netherlands managed to retain possession of Suriname until it gained independence in 1975, as well as the Netherlands Antilles, of which the islands remain within the Kingdom of the Netherlands today. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - The Fon people, also called Fon nu, Agadja or Dahomey, are a major West African ethnic and linguistic group. They are the largest ethnic group in Benin found particularly in its south region; they are also found in southwest Nigeria and Togo. Their total population is estimated to be about 3,500,000 people, and they speak the Fon language, a member of the Niger-Congo language group. - Jacob Elet was a Dutch Chief factor for the Dutch West India Company on the Slave Coast of West Africa during the 18th century who is especially known for having visited in 1733 Agaja , the king of Dahomey , and for having kept a diary chronicling the trip . - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - The Americas, also collectively called America, encompass the totality of the continents of North America and South America. Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the \\"New World\\". - Pepper Coast was the name given by European traders to a coastal area of western Africa, between Cape Mesurado and Cape Palmas. It encloses the present republic of Liberia. It got its name from the melegueta pepper. The pepper is also known as the \\"grain of paradise\\", which gave rise to an alternative name, the Grain Coast. The importance of the spice is shown by the designation of the area from the Saint John River (at present-day Buchanan) to Harper in Liberia as the \\"Grain Coast\\" in honor of the availability of grains of paradise. In some cases (as shown on the map) this term covers a wider area incorporating Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast. - The Oyo Empire was a Yoruba empire of what is today Western and North central Nigeria, and Eastern Benin. Established in the 15th century, the Oyo Empire grew to become one of the largest West African states. It rose through the outstanding organizational skills of the Yoruba, wealth gained from trade and its powerful cavalry. The Oyo Empire was the most politically important state in the region from the mid-17th to the late 18th century, holding sway not only over most of the other kingdoms in Yorubaland, but also over nearby African states, notably the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey in the modern Republic of Benin to the west. - The Slave Coast is a historical name formerly used for parts of coastal West Africa along the Bight of Benin. The name is derived from the fact that it was a major source of African slaves during the Atlantic slave trade from the early 16th century to the 19th century. Other nearby coastal regions historically known by their prime colonial export are the Gold Coast, the Ivory Coast, and the Pepper Coast (or Grain Coast). - Dutch West India Company (or ) was a chartered company (known as the \\"WIC\\") of Dutch merchants. Among its founding fathers was Willem Usselincx (15671647). On June 3, 1621, it was granted a for a trade monopoly in the West Indies (meaning the Caribbean) by the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands and given jurisdiction over the Atlantic slave trade, Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America. The area where the company could operate consisted of West Africa (between the Tropic of Cancer and the Cape of Good Hope) and the Americas, which included the Pacific Ocean and the eastern part of New Guinea. The intended purpose of the charter was to eliminate competition, particularly Spanish or Portuguese, between the various trading posts established by the merchants. The company became instrumental in the Dutch colonization of the Americas. - Dahomey was an African kingdom (located in the area of the present-day country of Benin) that existed from about 1600 until 1894, when the last king, Behanzin, was defeated by the French, and the country was annexed into the French colonial empire. Dahomey developed on the Abomey Plateau amongst the Fon people in the early 17th century and became a regional power in the 18th century by conquering key cities on the Atlantic coast. - The Tropic of Cancer, also referred to as the Northern Tropic is north of the Equator. It is the most northerly circle of latitude on the Earth at which the Sun can be directly overhead. This occurs on the June solstice, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum extent. - Willem Usselincx (15671647) was a Flemish slave owner, slave trader, merchant, investor and diplomat who was instrumental in drawing both Dutch and Swedish attention to the importance of the New World. Usselincx was one of the founding fathers of the Dutch West India Company (Dutch: \\"Geoctroyeerde Westindische Compagnie\\"). - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - The French colonial empire constituted the overseas colonies, protectorates and mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the \\"first colonial empire\\", that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost, and the \\"second colonial empire\\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. The second empire came to an end after the loss of bitter wars in Vietnam (1955) and Algeria (1962), and peaceful decolonization elsewhere after 1960. - Agaja (also spelled Agadja and also known as Trudo Agaja or Trudo Audati) was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, who ruled from 1718 until 1740. He came to the throne after his brother King Akaba. During his reign, Dahomey expanded significantly and took control of key trade routes for the Atlantic slave trade by conquering Allada (1724) and Whydah (1727). Wars with the powerful Oyo Empire to the east of Dahomey resulted in Agaja accepting tributary status to that empire and providing yearly gifts. After this, Agaja attempted to control the new territory of the kingdom of Dahomey through militarily suppressing revolts and creating administrative and ceremonial systems. Agaja died in 1740 after another war with the Oyo Empire and his son Tegbessou became the new king. Agaja is credited with creating many of the key government structures of Dahomey, including the \\"Yovogan\\" and the \\"Mehu\\". - Allada is a town, arrondissement, and commune, located in the Atlantique Department of Benin.

Ilse , Johanne and Zara plus Rudy Shruki and band like Kurt Widman and his Orchestra and Fud Cantics ex cetera never appeared in the radio show cause the singers and the bands were of the pop jazz and swing categories. The Club Foot had that regulated that for touring occupied areas for the soldiers to short wave radios for the soldiers also night clubs and hotels,in Berlin and Hamburg, and record sales only. This is why Ilse wasn't allowed to sing in this picture. This would be made up by medium budget musical ,Were making music, 1942, in which she would demonstrate her whistling.But this is an excellent example propaganda.Inge and her aunt Eichhorn,played by Ida Wust, goes to the 1936 Olympics. The aunt forgets her tickets so Inge has to wait till her aunt comes back with the tickets. She meets Carle Radditz, who plays Herbert, who has an extra ticket. She goes with him and it's love at first sight. they plan to marry but the Spanish war get in the way so he has to go on an assignment against the right side.Carl Raddatz as so many people complained about him was really handsome and not plain. When he did Opfergang and they put a mustache on him plus his own suntan that made him plain looking.You see the Nazi soldiers acting normal,like a scene in which a ex butcher and his troops are in France and they steal pigs from a farm and they are about to make lunch until their leader suggest to save the pigs. This reflect Adolphs animal rights extremism. The character was a butcher now soldier . This was a subtle put down against meat eating.Late on in world war 11, Herbert is flying in a German airplane. We shoot one of the pilots so Herbert takes over. We shoot his plane. They crash. Unfortunately for us they survive.Another seen the Nazis soldiers go in a bomb Catholic church ,now it's putting the catholics down, and Hubert's best friend Helmet,played by Joachim Brennecke starts to play the organ, Beethtoven, .More bombs come in from us. The church is bomb more the soldier continues to stay and play the organ he's being told to leave. We end up injuring him. Propaganda message? The catholic church organ cause him to become addicted to it.It injured him. See? By this time Inge is with her either mother or grandma, played Hedwig Bleibteu, the same German Grandame actress who played Maria Holst's Aunt in Weiner Blut.Well ,later it comes to the short view of the radio show. This was not intended to be a musical revue, such as Kora Terry released that same year were as well As Rosen in Tirol, The music as well as their side of the war was so supposed to be only the back drop. It was mainly a war romantic movie.It's easy to take a pot shot at those soldier in the movie but in real life many of those soldiers were being forced to fight the Nazi cause, cause of the job and the monthly pay that they would receive. After the war many of them who survive would regret it. This is a good swastika classic. The only problem is that today you have Neo Nazi and Nazi skin heads, who watched the same movies to reflect their Hitler worship and their. They have disturbing websites who exploit these film classics to raise money for their insanity . Be careful most of the time it's the direct hate only classics.

Her father, John Davis, spends most of his time at work, and has little time to spend with his daughter. She dreams of a traditional family, and tells her friends that she has such a family. Because of this fib, she cannot invite any friends to her home, as they will see the truth. Kathleen and her nanny, Mrs. Farrell, have a contentious relationship. Mr. Davis dismisses the nanny, and hires a psychologist named Dr. Angela Kent to look after the young girl for the summer. He has begun seeing a woman named Lorraine Bennett, whom he considers marrying. But Lorraine and Kathleen dislike each other intensely. Instead, Kathleen envisions Dr. Kent as the perfect mother for her, and wife for her father. When this seems unlikely, Kathleen runs away from home.

Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of actors - is totally unable to convey the great charisma that Biko had. Attenborough's big crowd scenes are laughable. The Soweto massacre wasn't like this, three neat lines of children ( some doing cartwheels!) marching happily into the guns of the soldiers. With Biko dead the film rapidly descends into farce. If the struggle against Apartheid was anything it was a black people's struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important while he wasn't. Penelope Wilton's accent is pure Hampshire and she seems completely unaware that she is in South Africa at all. at all. The Wood's family dog gets more lines than the black maid. As the family make their escape one the women I saw the film with - incidentally one of only about a dozen black people in a large, full cinema - whispered \\"This is like the sound of music.\\" She had a point.

That’s the claim of a new paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research that has become the latest talking point in the heated conversation about campus rape. The study’s finding may not be the most surprising in the history of social science. But as the authors, a trio of economists, write in their introduction, “evidence on the causal link between partying or drinking (at college or otherwise) and the incidence of sexual assault has eluded researchers to date.” By using Division I football games as a proxy for increased partying, they’ve added credence to a longtime belief. Their assertion: “[F]ootball game days increase reports of rape victimization among 17–24 year old women by 28 percent.” There are reasons to take this paper with a grain of salt. It hasn’t yet been peer reviewed, and, as Christopher Krebs, a researcher at RTI International, points out, it relies on official data from campus and local law-enforcement, where rape and sexual assault are notoriously underreported. Plus, there’s the age-old problem of separating out correlation and causation. But the paper still offers some potentially helpful insights about what happens when on-campus alcohol consumption rises. For example, home games had a greater effect on sexual assault reports (41 percent increase) than away games (15 percent increase). And Division I-FBS schools saw a bigger correlation than Division I-FCS, where rape reports went up 31 percent during home games, but not at all for away games. (Division II and III games had no impact.) Overall, the researchers estimate that game days produce an additional 253 to 770 rapes of college-age women at Division I-FBS schools per year, and between 6 and 115 at Division I-FCS schools. Advertisement “Our results provide support for thinking more about how policies targeting partying and drinking can be used to decrease incidence of sexual assault,” says Jason Lindo, one of the researchers and an associate professor of economics at Texas A&M University. He points to the fact that reports where the perpetrator was under the influence went up more than reports where the perpetrator was sober, and that “we see larger effects for rivalry games and games against ranked teams, and that we see that upset wins have especially large effects on reports of rape and also on arrests for alcohol-related crimes.” As the debate swirls around whether colleges or the criminal justice system should be adjudicating sexual assault cases, more attention is being paid to preventing rape in the first place. A consensus is starting to take shape around the benefits of bystander intervention programs, which train both men and women on college campuses to identify and break up worrisome sexual encounters. But questions remain about how far schools should go in targeting female students in particular. Programs that focus on warning young women not to drink are rightly accused of victim-blaming, and some feminists argue that even the most thoughtful interventions aimed at women risk diverting attention from where it needs to be: on rapists. Others counter with the fact that programs attempting to change the behavior of college-age men have universally failed. Lindo is careful not to overstate his work’s potential to affect this contested territory. “This evidence provides support for the notion that policies that effectively avoid spikes to partying and/or reduce the intensity of partying have the potential to reduce the incidence of rape,” he wrote in an email. “But this does not imply that other efforts to encourage a safer partying environment (through bystander intervention for example) are either likely or unlikely to be effective.” Charlene Senn, a sexual assault expert at the University of Windsor, says the most interesting thing about the study is the way it gestures at the extreme complexity of the relationships between alcohol, partying, and assault. Senn devised a training program for female students—to help them “assess risk from acquaintances, overcome emotional barriers in acknowledging danger, and engage in effective verbal and physical self-defense”—that succeeded in slightly lowering the instance of rape, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, and is now central to the debate about intervention programs for women. To Senn, the NBER paper gets at the fact that the campus party culture that leads to rape isn’t defined by perpetrators, victims, or bystanders, but by the way the entire community partakes and interacts. “Alcohol is a risk factor whether consumed by men, by women, or by others in the environment,” Senn says. “When we’re drinking, we’re anticipating a fun context, where bad things are not presumed to happen. It also diminishes the perpetrators’ view of their own responsibility, diminishes women’s ability to resist and the likelihood that others will believe them, and diminishes the chances that others will intervene.” ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The study, which examined the relationship between campus party culture and sexual assault, found “robust evidence” linking Division 1 football games to a 28% rise in reports of rape occurring the same day. Home games drove the biggest bump, the authors found. In particular, reports of sexual assault by strangers grew 61% after home games. But upset losses and games against major rivals also drove a notable increase in rape reports coming from 17- to 24-year-olds. Isaac Swensen of Montana State University, Jason Lindo of Texas A&M University, and Peter Siminski of Australia’s University of Wollongong co-authored the report, a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research. The authors say their findings support policies that rein in alcohol consumption at college parties. “By providing convincing evidence that spikes in the degree of partying at a university escalate the incidence of rape, our results suggest that efforts to avoid such spikes could serve to reduce the incidence of rape,” they wrote. But the findings, are also likely to fuel an ongoing debate over whether “jock culture” is feeding a campus rape epidemic. In recent years, a parade of high-profile college football players and other athletes have been accused and convicted of sexual assault. “Back-of-the-envelope” calculations led the authors to believe that Division 1 game days drive anywhere from 243 to 770 additional reports of rape at 128 schools. They caution, though, that they were limited to studying reports – not incidents – of rape, making their proportional findings much more valuable. The vast majority of victims do not report the crime to law enforcement, with some studies placing the reporting rate as low as 12%. |||||","completion":"A new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that Division I football game days lead to an increase in on-campus sexual assault, particularly when home games are played.

It was the first composed for a feast day, Pentecost Sunday (Whit Sunday), Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles, on the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1–13), and from the Gospel of John, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his Farewell discourse (John 14:23–31). As in many Bach cantatas, the libretto is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet.Franck's text shows elements of early Pietism: the expression of extreme feelings, for example \\"O seligste Zeiten!\\" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a \\"mystical demeanour\\", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to \\"Gott will sich die Seelen zu Tempeln bereiten\\" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His temple, more literally: \\"God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples\\"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, \\"Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten\\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\", which is based on the Latin hymn \\"Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium\\"...., can you guess it ?

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the title of Nielsen's third cantata?, using the article: Nielsen's two operas are very different in style. The four-act Saul og David (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by Einar Christiansen, tells the Biblical story of Saul's jealousy of the young David while Maskarade (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish libretto by Vilhelm Andersen, based on the comedy by Ludvig Holberg. Saul and David received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 Masquerade was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many strophic songs, its dances and its underlying \\"old Copenhagen\\" atmosphere.Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed Hymnus amoris (Hymn of Love), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style. Writing in the newspaper Dannebrog, Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as \\"a decisive victory\\" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of Nationaltidende welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the Berlingske Tidende reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish. Søvnen (The Sleep), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905.

What is the first name of the person who Cobain hired to produce in Utero? Answer the above question based on the context below: Both Surfer Rosa and Steve Albini's production of the album have been influential on alternative rock, and on grunge in particular. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa as the basis for Nevermind's songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1992 that he \\"heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw out because I was too afraid to play them for anybody.\\" Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as \\"the one that made me go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame.\\" Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa \\"blew my mind,\\" and that she \\"immediately went to track down Steve Albini.\\" Cobain listed Surfer Rosa as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.People connected with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: \\"I remember when I first heard Surfer Rosa thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.' That was my immediate reaction, in other words, incredibly raw.\\" Gary Smith, who at the time was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he \\"was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record.\\" Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde, said he thought that Steve Albini's production \\"sounded way better than the other ones.\\"In 1991, as Pixies were recording Trompe le Monde, Albini described his impressions of Pixies during the recording of Surfer Rosa to the fan magazine Forced Exposure: \\"A patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock.

Here is a news article: Shortly after taking office, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and new police Superintendent Garry McCarthy faced one of the city's worst police shootings in recent memory: a cop captured on video fatally shooting an unarmed African-American man in the back as he lay on the ground. The city paid 4.1 million to the victim's family and McCarthy said the officer, who had recently shot two other people, should not have been on the street given his history. In the four years following that vivid introduction to police misconduct, Emanuel and McCarthy have failed to enact systemic change in a department with a long history of excessive force and misconduct. On Tuesday, that cost McCarthy his job, dismissed by a mayor seeking to ease public outrage over the police video recording of a black teen shot 16 times by a white officer now charged with murder. \\"Superintendent McCarthy knows that a police officer is only as effective as when he has the trust of those he serves,\\" Emanuel said at a morning news conference, saying he discussed with McCarthy \\"the undeniable fact that the public trust in the leadership of the department has been shaken and eroded.\\" But the furor that erupted in the seven days since the city released the video of Laquan McDonald's death and prosecutors charged Officer Jason Van Dyke has focused as much on Emanuel as on his now-former police chief. While he hired McCarthy on his promise to reform and refocus the police force, Emanuel left in place leaders who had climbed the ladder as the department earned a national reputation for corruption, abuse and resistance to oversight. The mayor sought to erase the 2012 verdict of a federal jury that found a police \\"code of silence\\" protected bad cops. He declined to take a public stand even as McCarthy defended an off-duty detective who killed an unarmed woman when he fired into a crowd, another case that drew protests and national attention. Response to Garry McCarthy's resignation Activist Veronica Morris Moore speaks during a news conference outside Chicago police headquarters on Dec. 1, 2015. Earlier, Mayor Rahm Emanuel asked for and accepted the resignation of police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who had been under pressure after the release of a police video of the shooting death of Laquan McDonald, 17, by police Officer Jason Van Dyke in 2014.

Earlier, Mayor Rahm Emanuel asked for and accepted the resignation of police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who had been under pressure after the release of a police video of the shooting death of Laquan McDonald, 17, by police Officer Jason Van Dyke in 2014. See more videos And while Emanuel publicly called on Cook County prosecutor Anita Alvarez to wrap up her investigation of the McDonald shooting, the police watchdog agency that answers to him has still not issued its own ruling in the case. Even as he dismissed McCarthy and appointed a task force to recommend new ideas for police accountability, critics said it was too late for City Hall to fix the problems alone. Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan asked U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to launch a Justice Department civil rights investigation into the Police Department's use of deadly force and the adequacy of its review of such cases. \\"I write to you with urgency,\\" Madigan said in her letter to Lynch. \\"Trust in the Chicago Police Department is broken, especially in communities of color in the City of Chicago.\\" Locke Bowman, a Northwestern University law professor who has for years challenged Chicago police misconduct, said he was hard-pressed to recall any improvements the mayor had made to the system of police accountability during his time in office. Bowman, the head of the MacArthur Justice Center, pointed to the failure of the Independent Police Review Authority, the agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct, to sustain allegations against cops, including Van Dyke, in the vast majority of cases. \\"Van Dyke has over a dozen complaints against him, including some very serious ones,\\" Bowman said. \\"IPRA's never disciplined him. \\"If you had an agency that tracked repeat offender cops and looked at the most recent allegations in light of the history, this is a guy who should have been taken off the street before this ever happened,\\" Bowman said. \\"An effective disciplinary apparatus could have prevented Laquan McDonald's killing.\\" The images of Van Dyke pumping round after round into the body of the 17-year-old McDonald, many of them as he lay in the street, quickly became international news, with Chicago becoming the latest example of a young African-American dying unjustifiably at the hands of a white police officer in America. Such deaths, many of them also caught on video, have driven the Black Lives Matter movement over the last year and the subsequent protests and national discussion on urban policing. But for many Chicagoans, the story of McDonald's death represented an all-too-familiar set of circumstances at home: City Hall casts the incident as police self-defense only for the facts to bear out a much different story later on. For much of the last year, Emanuel and his lawyers fought in court to keep a police dashboard camera video of the shooting under wraps, arguing that releasing it publicly could interfere with a state's attorney and federal investigations into the shooting. But when a Cook County judge's ruling forced the mayor to release the video to the public last week, the fallout for McCarthy and Emanuel was sharp and immediate. Protesters took to the streets chanting \\"16 shots!\\" and on Friday blocked entry to Magnificent Mile stores on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Black aldermen called for McCarthy to be fired. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle urged Emanuel to do the same. Some Latino aldermen followed suit, as did newspaper editorial writers, television commentators, columnists and activists from around the country. Since 2011, Emanuel and McCarthy have stood together through rocky patches, including a major spike in homicides and a number of high-profile murders and shootings of young children caught in the gang gunfire of Chicago's most violent neighborhoods. But amid the protests and public backlash, Emanuel called McCarthy into his City Hall office Tuesday morning and asked him to resign. Chicago mayor asks for top cop to step down Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel asks for police Superintendent Garry McCarthy to step down. Dec. 1, 2015. (WGN-TV) Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel asks for police Superintendent Garry McCarthy to step down. Dec. 1, 2015. (WGN-TV) See more videos The mayor said McCarthy had a record to be proud of, citing his work to reduce crime rates and remove guns from the street. But Emanuel also sought to turn the page, announcing First Deputy Superintendent John Escalante would serve as acting superintendent during a \\"thorough\\" search by the Emanuel-appointed Police Board, which will recommend candidates for the mayor to interview. \\"Now is the time for fresh eyes and new leadership to confront the challenges the department and our community and our city are facing as we go forward,\\" Emanuel said. \\"This is not the end of the problem, but it is the beginning to the solution to the problem. There are systematic challenges that will require sustained reforms.\\" Emanuel's comments about the department were much more broad than what he said as recently as last week, when both the mayor and McCarthy portrayed the shooting as the case of a rogue officer and not reflective of a departmentwide problem. ||||| Now that Rahm Emanuel has gone against his political instincts by firing his larger-than-life police superintendent, the mayor faces an even bigger political dilemma that could define his legacy. He must find a worthy replacement for Garry McCarthy without making worse racial tensions brought to a boil by the Laquan McDonald shooting video. The video played around the world of a white Chicago Police officer pumping 16 rounds into the body of the black teenager not only sealed McCarthy’s fate. It also made the job of filling McCarthy’s shoes that much more difficult. Hispanic elected officials will almost certainly demand that the permanent job be awarded to First Deputy Police Superintendent John Escalante, who will serve as acting superintendent until a permanent replacement is chosen. But Escalante is already a political flashpoint. McCarthy’s decision to appoint him to replace retiring First Deputy Al Wysinger, who is African-American, infuriated the City Council’s Black Caucus and triggered demands for McCarthy’s ouster even before the Laquan McDonald video was made public. Hispanics may also lobby behind the scenes for Hiram Grau, the former Chicago deputy superintendent and former state police director who was chosen by Emanuel to recommend police reforms as part of a five-member Task Force on Police Accountability. Having succeeded in forcing Emanuel’s hand, black elected officials are equally certain to demand that McCarthy’s replacement be an African-American to restore public confidence between citizens and police in the black community so shaken by the department’s handling of the McDonald shooting. Several aldermen are openly lobbying for Wysinger’s return, even though he is best remembered for being the statue who stood motionless behind McCarthy at news conferences. “I believe in my heart that Al Wysinger will be a great choice to lead the department. Al has the respect of the community as well as the entire police department,” said Ald. Anthony Beale (9th), former chairman of the City Council’s Police Committee. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, who lobbied hard for McCarthy’s ouster, said the new superintendent need not necessarily be black. But it must be someone willing to make the “structural changes” necessary “so there’s not an effort to cover up, deny, misplace evidence and perjure when bad things happen.” “The mayor complains about the code of silence in the black and Hispanic communities that prevent people from coming forward and sharing information. What about the code of silence in the police department that protects bad cops?” Preckwinkle said. Another strong black candidate is Charles Ramsey, the former deputy police superintendent who went on to lead the police departments in Washington D.C. and Philadelphia. Ramsey was Emanuel’s first choice in 2011 before pricing himself out of the market by demanding a salary in excess of 400,000. The case for a black superintendent is strengthened by the fact that the surge in shootings and gang violence under McCarthy’s watch disproportionately impacted the African-American community and left many of those neighborhoods under siege. They need only point to the execution murder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee as proof. The boy was lured into an ally by a gang member seeking revenge after his brother was killed in a gang-related shooting. That initial nationwide search for a new superintendent will be conducted by the Police Board, whose president, Lori Lightfoot, is another member of Emanuel’s Task Force on Police Accountability. They will narrow the list to 10 candidates then winnow the names to three finalists from which the mayor can choose. Escalante will almost certainly be one of them unless he blows his audition. On Tuesday, Emanuel was asked whether a new superintendent needs to be an outsider or black. “I’m not looking for a type. I’m looking for a professional that can lead the department and make sure that they have a robust record of bringing results in public safety,” the mayor said. “I want to have somebody that will meet the needs of public safety, help obviously in this issue of both changing the culture, putting in place the building blocks to restore the confidence and trust that we want to see in Chicago and have a record in the police department of invigorating . . . not only commitment to professionalism but the type of commitment I want to see to make the changes necessary.” Lightfoot added, “It needs to be somebody with a track record of positive engagement with the community . . . There’s also a need for terrorism experience and ideas to combat violence and street crime.” If Emanuel dares to chose a white superintendent, former Englewood District Commander-turned State Police Director Leo Schmitz would be a strong candidate. Schmitz was a star of the CNN documentary series, “Chicagoland.” Former Mayor Richard M. Daley was a me-first politician who never hesitated to throw people under the bus, including two police superintendents: Phil Cline and Matt Rodriguez. Emanuel is far more loyal to his people. It goes against his grain to create political scapegoats. But the steady drumbeat for McCarthy’s ouster got too loud to ignore, particularly for a mayor who had promised during his second term to listen more to African-American voters, who were alienated by his record 50 school closings. The Chicago Sun-Times may well have put the final nail in McCarthy’s coffin with a front-page editorial demanding his ouster. “I have a lot of loyalty to what he’s done and him. But . . . no one person trumps my commitment and my responsibility to the city of Chicago and its future,” the mayor said. Pressed to explain what his only police superintendent had done wrong, he said: “I have a lot of confidence in the work and results that he’s done. But our goal . . . is to build the trust and confidence of the public. And at this point and this juncture for the city, given what we’re working on, he has become an issue, rather than dealing with the issue, and a distraction.” Emanuel has been under fire for keeping the McDonald video under wraps until after the April 7 mayoral runoff and waiting until one week after the election to settle the case for 5 million even before the McDonald family had filed a lawsuit. The video was released only after a judge’s order. On Tuesday, the mayor was asked what responsibility he bears for the crisis of confidence that has, once again, undermined the trust between citizens and police in the black community so essential to solving crime. “I take responsibility and none of us are above it . . . I have taken certain steps prior to this day. I’m taking steps today. As I told you, this is a work in progress in finding a solution [to police accountability]. It’s not the end of the problem. It’s the beginning of a solution towards the problem,” the mayor said. Emanuel was asked about demands for his own resignation. He kept his cool and simply said a sarcastic, “Thank you.” On Black Friday, the same day protesters infuriated by the McDonald video shut down Michigan Avenue, McCarthy insisted that the mayor “has my back.” Instead, he got a political knife in the back delivered Tuesday morning after a series of conversations with his boss over the last few days. The Emanuel-McCarthy dialogue started with the superintendent defending himself and making the case to finish the job he came to Chicago to do and ended with a realization that his tenure as superintendent, second only to Terry Hillard’s, had come to an end. “After repeated meetings with community and faith leaders and conversations with elected officials, the mayor realized community support for the superintendent had gotten so low, he could no longer be effective in his job. It was an evolution of conversations that got him to that point,” said a mayoral confidante, who asked to remain anonymous. ||||| CHICAGO (AP) — Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired the city's police chief Tuesday, a week after the release of a dash-cam video that showed a white Chicago officer fatally shooting a black teenager 16 times.

(Associated Press) Emanuel called a news conference to announce the dismissal of Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who only days ago insisted to reporters that the mayor had his \\"back.\\" Protesters have been calling for McCarthy's dismissal in response to the handling of the death of Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old who was killed in October 2014. The city released police video of the shooting only after a judge ordered it to be made public. The release set off several days of largely peaceful protests. Officer Jason Van Dyke has been charged with first-degree murder. McCarthy has been chief since May 2011. The audio-free video shows McDonald walking down the middle of a four-lane street. He appears to veer away from two officers as they emerge from a vehicle, drawing their guns. Van Dyke opens fire from close range and continues firing after McDonald crumples to the ground. Police have said McDonald was carrying a knife, and an autopsy revealed that he had PCP, a hallucinogenic drug, in his system. Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez has said the 3-inch blade recovered from the scene had been folded into the handle. Defense attorney Dan Herbert says his client feared for his life, acted lawfully and that the video does not tell the whole story. Van Dyke was released from jail Monday after paying the 150,000 required of his 1.5 million bail. Prior to his arrival in Chicago, McCarthy was police director in Newark, New Jersey, after rising through the ranks of New York City's police department. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago has fired police superintendent Garry McCarthy in light of the dash-cam video released by a judge, which shows a white Chicago police officer fatally shooting a black teenager 16 times.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - The Falkland Islands wolf (\\"Dusicyon australis\\"), also known as the warrah and occasionally as the Falkland Islands dog, Falkland Islands fox, or Antarctic wolf, was the only native land mammal of the Falkland Islands. This endemic canid became extinct in 1876, the first known canid to have become extinct in historical times. It was the only modern species in the genus \\"Dusicyon\\". - The American mink (\\"Neovison vison\\") is a semiaquatic species of mustelid native to North America, though human intervention has expanded its range to many parts of Europe and South America. Because of range expansion, the American mink is classed as a least-concern species by the IUCN. Since the extinction of the sea mink, the American mink is the only extant member of the genus \\"Neovison\\". The American mink is a carnivore which feeds on rodents, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and birds. In its introduced range in Europe it has been classified as an invasive species linked to declines in European mink, Pyrenean desman, and water vole populations. It is the most frequently farmed animal for its fur, exceeding the silver fox, sable, marten, and skunk in economic importance. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health. - The martens constitute the genus Martes within the subfamily Mustelinae, in the family Mustelidae. Martens are slender, agile animals, adapted to living in taigas, and are found in coniferous and northern deciduous forests across the Northern Hemisphere. They have bushy tails, and large paws with partially retractible claws. The fur varies from yellowish to dark brown, depending on the species, and, in many cases, is valued by fur trappers. - Skunks are mammals known for their ability to spray a liquid with a strong odor. Different species of skunk vary in appearance from black-and-white to brown or cream colored, but all have warning coloration. - The sea mink (\\"Neovison macrodon\\") is an extinct North American member of the family Mustelidae. It is the only mustelid, and one of only two terrestrial mammal species in the order Carnivora known to have become extinct in historic times (the other being the Falkland Islands wolf). The body of the sea mink was significantly longer than that of the closely related American mink (\\"N. vison\\"), and also bulkier, leading to a pelt that was almost twice the size of the other species. The longest specimen recorded was said to be . The sea mink produced a distinctive odor, and had fur that was said to be coarser and redder than the American mink's. - The Mustelidae (from Latin \\"mustela\\", weasel) are a family of carnivorous mammals, including the weasel, badger, otter, marten, ferret, mink, stoat, and wolverine. Mustelids are diverse and the largest family in the order Carnivora. The internal classification is still disputed, with rival proposals containing between two and eight subfamilies. One study, published in 2008, questions the long-accepted Mustelinae subfamily, and suggests that the Mustelidae consist of four major clades and three much smaller lineages. - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - The sable (\\"Martes zibellina\\") is a marten species, a small carnivorous mammal inhabiting forest environments, primarily in Russia from the Ural Mountains throughout Siberia, eastern Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, China, North and South Korea and Hokkaid in Japan. Its range in the wild originally extended through European Russia to Poland and Scandinavia. It has historically been hunted for its highly valued dark brown or black fur, which remains a luxury good to this day. While hunting of wild animals is still common in Russia, most fur in the market is now commercially farmed. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - The Pyrenean desman (\\"Galemys pyrenaicus\\") is a small semiaquatic nocturnal mammal related to moles and shrews, and is one of only two surviving species of the tribe Desmanini. The range of the species centers on northwestern Spain and northern Portugal, but it is under threat due to changes to its habitat. In Portugal it's called \\"\\"toupeira-d'água\\"\\" which means \\"water mole\\". - A vole is a small rodent; a relative of the mouse, with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats. - Neovison is a genus of mustelids , including the extinct sea mink and the extant American mink . - Carnivora (from Latin \\"car\\" (stem \\"carn-\\") \\"flesh\\" and \\"vorre\\" \\"to devour\\") is a diverse order that includes over 280 species of placental mammals. Its members are formally referred to as carnivorans, whereas the word \\"carnivore\\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order, ranging from the least weasel (\\"Mustela nivalis\\"), at as little as and , to the polar bear (\\"Ursus maritimus\\"), which can weigh up to , to the southern elephant seal (\\"Mirounga leonina\\"), whose adult males weigh up to and measure up to in length. 'neovison' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'parent taxon'? Choices: - animal - arvicolinae - carnivora - dusicyon - galemys - hagfish - human - marten - mustelidae - mustelinae - neovison - olfactores - ostrich - plant - rodentia - skunk - weasel Answer:","completion":"'Neovison' is related to the object entity 'Mustelidae' through the relation of 'parent taxon'. Mustelidae is a family of carnivorous mammals that includes various species such as weasel, badger, otter, marten, ferret, mink, stoat, and wolverine.

Earthquake Information The earthquake struck at 12:53 p.m. Alaska Daylight Time (4:53 p.m. Eastern time) near Little Sitkin Island in the far western part of the Aleutian Island chain, just west of the International Date Line. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the main jolt was followed by a series of aftershocks. Two significant aftershocks, measuring magnitude 6.0 and 5.8, occurring 18 and 37 minutes after the mainshock, respectively. About four hours after the 7.9 temblor, a magnitude-6.9 aftershock rocked the same area. A total of 21 aftershocks were recorded by the USGS in the four hours following the mainshock. The National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, issued a tsunami warning for a portion of the Aleutians stretching from Nikolski to Attu. \\"Widespread dangerous coastal flooding accompanied by powerful currents are possible and may continue for hours after tsunami arrival,\\" the NTWC bulletin said. Residents of Adak, Alaska, evacuated the town site and gathered on a nearby hill. \\"We're seeing water leave our bay, so we do have everybody up on the Bering Hill area, where our primary evacuation center is at,\\" City Manager Layton Lockett told The Associated Press by telephone as he gathered some last paperwork before heading out himself to join about 300 residents at the center. The agency downgraded the bulletin to a less-serious tsunami advisory at 2:44 p.m. local time, just under two hours after the quake. At 4:35 p.m. local time, all tsunami advisories were cancelled. The first tsunami measurement came from Amchitka, Alaska, about 25 miles from the quake's epicenter. A tsunami of 0.6 foot (about 7 inches) was recorded at 1:36 p.m. local time. The NTWC said that the depth of the earthquake, some 71 miles below the earth's surface, would mitigate the extent of the tsunami. Later, at 3:22 p.m. local time, Amchitka recorded an 0.7-foot tsunami wave. Other nearby communities reported tsunami heights of 0.2 to 0.6 foot. Successful evacuations have occurred in St. Paul, St. George, Adak and Atka. No #tsunami reported in Shemya yet. — NWS Alaska Region (@NWSAlaska) Jun 23 2014 Jeremy Zidek, a spokesman for the Alaska Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, told the Associated Press there were no immediate reports of damage from either the earthquake or the small tsunami. Natasha Ruppert, a seismologist with the Alaska Earthquake Center, said that because the communities that would have suffered damage are under a tsunami warning, people may not have been able to get out and check for damage yet. The Aleutian Island chain stretches some 1,200 miles across the northern Pacific Ocean between the Alaska mainland and eastern Russia. The epicenter of Monday's earthquake was closer to Russia than it was to Anchorage, Alaska's largest city. At a distance of just over 2,000 miles from Tokyo, it was also closer to the Japanese capital than to Seattle. Tsunami Concerns Ease for West Coast, Hawaii, and Japan The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the Alaska quake was too deep to pose a tsunami danger to Hawaii, and ruled that state out of the tsunami risk. California, Oregon, and Washington were later excluded from the tsunami risk as well. Large earthquakes in Alaska have caused significant tsunamis in the past. An Aleutian Islands quake in 1946 caused a tsunami that killed 96 people in Hilo, Hawaii, and prompted the establishment of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. The much stronger magnitude-9.2 Good Friday earthquake of 1964, which took place farther east near Anchorage, caused over 100 tsunami deaths in Alaska, five in Oregon, and 13 in California. After evaluating the data, the Japan Meteorological Agency ruled out any tsunami risk to Japan from the Aleutians earthquake. Japan has suffered damaging tsunamis from overseas quakes in the past, including the 1964 Good Friday quake. Major earthquakes in Chile also caused damaging tsunamis in Japan in 1960 and 2010. This report includes information from the Associated Press.

Natasha Ruppert, a seismologist with the Alaska Earthquake Center, said the communities that would have suffered damage are also under tsunami warnings, so people may not have been able to get out and check for damage yet. The earthquake recorded at 12:53 p.m. local time was initially reported with a magnitude of 7.1, but Ruppert says that was upgraded to 8.0. The quake was centered about 13 miles southeast of Little Sitkin Island. It was recorded at a depth of 60 miles, which is relatively shallow for an earthquake in the Aleutian Islands. The shallower the quake, the more likely it will be felt. The National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, issued a tsunami warning for coastal areas between Nikolski to Attu, on the Aleutian Islands. A warning means significant inundation is possible or occurring. Residents are being warned to move inland toward higher ground. A tsunami advisory was also issued for coastal areas stretching from Nikolski to Unimak Pass. An advisory means strong currents or dangerous waves are expected, but widespread inundation isn't likely. ||||| Story highlights Preliminary measures put the quake's strength at 8.0, later downgraded to 7.9 An initial tsunami warning was canceled The 150 residents of Adak moved to a shelter on higher ground Adak is on an island off the Alaskan mainland An initial tsunami advisory has been canceled for coastal Alaska. One had been issued after a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck Monday about 15 miles from Little Sitkin Island, Alaska. The quake had a depth of 71 miles, according to seismologists. The town of Adak evacuated its 150 residents to a shelter about 600 feet above sea level after the initial tsunami warning, City Manager Layton Lockett told CNN. There were no initial reports of quake damage in Adak or on Shemya Island, said Ian Dickson, website manager for the Alaska Earthquake Information Center. Dickson said there were 17 measurable aftershocks in the two hours after the quake. First estimates put the quake at magnitude 8.0. The strength was subsequently set by the U.S. Geological Survey at 7.9 magnitude. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A big earthquake happened near some islands in Alaska, and people were worried that it might cause big waves called tsunamis. They told people living near the coast to go to higher ground to stay safe. After a while, they found out that the earthquake was deep in the ground, so it didn't cause any dangerous tsunamis. People were relieved and no one was hurt. They experienced smaller shaking called aftershocks after the big earthquake."},{"prompt":"Lee decided to make a cake for the holiday coming up.

The hedgehogs missed their old Pick from: +cages .. +pen ..","completion":"I moved the hedgehogs from their cages into the new holding pen. The hedgehogs missed their old cages, probably due to the familiar layout and scents, but the transition to the pen was necessary. The pen was a significant upgrade in terms of space and living conditions, designed to mimic their natural habitat and encourage them to socialize and interact with one another. I wanted to give them the best possible environment and a chance at a more fulfilling life. Constructed in a carefully chosen spot within the sanctuary, the pen included some soft ground coverings, bushes, and a well-camouflaged den for them to nest in. There was also a small pond with clean water for them to drink and bathe in, and plenty of hiding spots that encouraged exploratory behavior. As I carefully introduced each hedgehog to its new home, I made sure they felt as comfortable as possible. I tried my best to minimize the stress and anxiety they might be feeling due to the change. I had already prepared a mixture of their preferred food, including mealworms, crickets, and fruits, to support a smooth transition. Over the next several days, I closely monitored their behavior, ensuring that they were adapting well to their new environment. I was pleased to see them gradually exploring their surroundings, learning how to search for food, and beginning to engage with one another. I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment as I watched them thrive and become more active. It wasn't long before I observed signs that they were adjusting to their new environment. The hedgehogs started forming bonds with one another, as they began to recognize each other's unique scents and vocalizations. They also displayed a strong fascination for their new home, showing curiosity in the objects around them, and occasionally stumbling upon hidden treats that I had placed to pique their interest. Despite my careful preparations, a few of the hedgehogs seemed to be having a harder time adjusting than the others. They appeared more hesitant to explore their surroundings and interact with the others. But I knew that patience and persistence were the keys to helping them feel more at ease. Over time, even the most timid hedgehogs began to show signs of improvement. They seemed to find comfort in the solidarity of the group, and I was increasingly convinced that moving them from their cramped cages into the open pen was the right decision. One day, as I took a break from my observations, I noticed a group of visitors watching the hedgehogs play together in their new home. They were fascinated and delighted by the hedgehogs' antics and how much their living conditions had improved. The visitors were not only captivated by the hedgehogs, but they also seemed to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for these spiky little creatures. Witnessing this connection unfolding between humans and animals was a profound and touching experience. As weeks turned into months, the hedgehogs continued to thrive in their new home. They displayed a remarkable ability to adapt and grow, and it was heartwarming to see them flourish in a space specifically tailored to their needs. Reflecting on the journey, it became apparent that the decision to move the hedgehogs from their cages to the spacious pen had a profound impact not only on the hedgehogs themselves but also on the people who visited them. The joyful interaction, increased understanding, and newly-formed bonds made the transition, and all the hard work it entailed, worthwhile in the end."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The minority leader, in consultation with other party colleagues, has a range of strategic options that he or she can employ to advance minority party objectives. The options selected depend on a wide range of circumstances, such as the visibility or significance of the issue and the degree of cohesion within the majority party. For instance, a majority party riven by internal dissension, as occurred during the early 1900s when Progressive and \\"regular\\" Republicans were at loggerheads, may provide the minority leader with greater opportunities to achieve his or her priorities than if the majority party exhibited high degrees of party cohesion. Among the variable strategies available to the minority party, which can vary from bill to bill and be used in combination or at different stages of the lawmaking process, are the following: Now answer this question: Does minority leader always employ same strategy for party objectives?","completion":"No, a minority leader does not always employ the same strategy for party objectives. The strategy used by a minority leader varies depending on a number of factors and can change from bill to bill or at different stages of the lawmaking process. Some of these factors include the visibility or significance of the issue, the degree of cohesion within the majority party, and the internal dynamics within the minority party itself. There are several variable strategies that can be employed by the minority leader, some of which are discussed below. 1. Forming coalitions with like-minded majority party members: If there are divisions within the majority party, the minority leader may find opportunities to form coalitions with members who share similar concerns or policy goals. This can help the minority leader to advance specific proposals, promote amendments, or even block or stall legislation. 2. Highlighting shortcomings of the majority party: The minority leader can use public debate, media, and other forms of communication to highlight the shortcomings of the majority party's policy proposals, leadership, or overall record on important issues. This can create pressure on the majority party, possibly leading to changes in policy or weakening the majority party's public support. 3. Filibustering or delaying tactics: In certain situations, the minority party might use filibustering or other delaying tactics to slow down the progress of a bill or force the majority party to compromise. While such tactics may not always lead to concrete policy victories, they can at least stall legislation or generate public attention. 4. Building public support: Minority leaders can also work to build public support for their policy priorities by engaging in grassroots organizing, social media campaigns, and other outreach efforts. This can help to create pressure on members of both parties to support the minority party's initiatives or adopt their proposed amendments. 5. Bargaining for concessions: The minority leader can use their influence to negotiate for concessions from the majority party, particularly when the majority party needs minority party votes for a particular bill to pass. In such cases, the minority leader might be able to secure funding, policy changes, or other concessions in exchange for supporting, or not opposing, the bill. 6. Constructive collaboration: When the minority party shares common objectives with the majority party, minority leaders may choose to cooperate and collaborate with the majority party in a more constructive manner. This can lead to bipartisan agreements that advance important policy objectives. The minority leader's choice of strategy is influenced by the specific context of each legislative situation, including the relationships among party members, the leadership dynamics within both the majority and minority parties, and public opinion on key issues. Therefore, the strategies employed by a minority leader will vary and adapt to the unique circumstances they face in pursuing their party's objectives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Henry Ford grew up on an un-electrified farm, and as a young man he followed Edison's career as the inventor became a national role model.Ford took a job at the Edison Illuminating Company working his way up to chief engineer. In 1896 Ford was thirty-three and, though still working for Edison Co.,he had created his first experimental automobile the Ford Quadricycle2 during his off-time. At an Edison company party in New York, Ford had his first chance to meet his hero Edison and was able to explain his new automobile to the great inventor. _ Young man, that's the thing! You have it! Your car is self-contained and carries its own power plant.\\" Edison himself had been working on the idea, but had only been considering electricity as the power source, so the idea of a gas engine was a somewhat new one. The words comforted Ford greatly, who immediately set out building a second car which was to become the Model-T.6.The two men became f'ast friends and would go on camping trips together.When Edison later became limited to a wheelchair, Ford brought an extra one to his house so they could race.At the 50th anniversary of the invention of light-bulb, Ford honored Edison.When Edison spoke, he ended his speech directed at Ford:\\" As to Henry Ford, words fail to express my feelings.I can only say that he is my friend.\\" Therefore it is no surprise that Ford wanted something to remember Edison by after he passed away in 1931. Once, Ford asked Thomas Edison's son Charles to sit by the dying inventor's bedside and hold a test tube next to his father's mouth to catch his final breath. Ford was a man with many strange behaviors( as was Edison)including some interest in reanimation and spiritualism and some say that he was attempting to catch Edison's soul as it escaped his body in hopes of later bringing the inventor back to life. The test tube itself didn't turn up until 1950 when it was listed in the Ford possessions after Clara Ford's passing away, and then lost again until 1978 when it was discovered in an exhibit Entitled \\"Henry Ford-A Personal History\\" in the Henry Ford Museum.It would then be discovered that the tube was labeled \\"Edison's Last Breath\\". There is a further mystery of this \\"last breath\\" test tube. It would seem as if Edison had quite a last breath indeed, as the Edison Estate holds a collection of 42 test tubes all supposedly containing Edison's last breath. Regardless of the excitement over the last breath, the test tube is quite touching in its meaning.Although both men were known for all sorts of poor behavior towards .their loved ones and mistreatment of employees, between them at least, there was clearly a deep respect and admiration.

It has origins in ancient India, and was transformed by various ruling elites in medieval, early-modern, and modern India, especially the Mughal Empire and the British Raj. It is today the basis of educational and job reservations in India. It consists of two different concepts, varna and jati, which may be regarded as different levels of analysis of this system. Multi-choice problem: Is it true that did the british create the caste system in india? Choose your answer from: (a). no. (b). yes. The answer is:","completion":"(a). No. The caste system in India is a centuries-old social stratification system that has its roots in ancient Indian society. While it is true that the British Raj emphasized and solidified the caste distinctions in India during their rule, it would be inaccurate to say they created the caste system. The caste system in India originated with the Hindu tradition of classifying society into four main categories called varnas, which eventually evolved into thousands of sub-categories called jatis. The four main varnas are: 1. Brahmins (priests and scholars) 2. Kshatriyas (warriors and rulers) 3. Vaishyas (merchants and farmers) 4. Shudras (laborers and service providers) The development of the caste system can be traced back to the Vedic period (1500-500 BCE), where sacred Hindu texts emphasized the division of society based on duties, responsibilities, and occupations. These divisions were largely maintained to ensure an orderly and functional society. However, over time, these divisions became more rigid and hereditary as people were born into their caste, which determined their social and professional opportunities. During the British rule in India (1858-1947), the colonial administration placed further emphasis on the caste system as a means of maintaining control and authority. They utilized the existing social hierarchy to govern a diverse and large population effectively, often exploiting the divisions and promoting the idea that some castes were superior to others in order to gain control. Moreover, the British introduced policies like the census and created legal categories for castes, thus cementing the divisions and making the system more rigid and discriminatory. It is important to note, however, that the caste system's existence predates British rule in India, despite its transformation and reinforcement during that period. Consequently, it would be incorrect to attribute the creation of the caste system in India solely to the British."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

Frank immortalizes these two events in a pair of crayon drawings that he hangs on his wall for inspiration. Sarah, a recovering addict, leaves Frank for Jacques, a charismatic strip club owner who gets her hooked on drugs. Frank sinks into depression, where he has a vision in which he is touched by the finger of God and meets the Holy Avenger, a superhero from a public-access television show, who tells Frank that God has chosen him for a very special purpose.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Several techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the cueing, equalization and audio mixing of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques. Club DJ turntable techniques include beatmatching, phrasing and slip-cueing to preserve energy on a dance floor. Turntablism embodies the art of cutting, beat juggling, scratching, needle drops, phase shifting, back spinning and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of samples in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a musical instrument rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use harmonic mixing to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys. Recent advances in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include phrasing and beatmatching, which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic synchronization of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled \\"sync\\". Most DJ mixers now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in beats per minute (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources. In the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques. Answer this question \\"What other techniques are there?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Apart from cueing, equalization, and audio mixing, other techniques used by DJs include beatmatching, phrasing, slip-cueing, turntablism (which involves cutting, beat juggling, scratching, needle drops, phase shifting, back spinning, etc.), harmonic mixing, and assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques through the use of advanced DJ hardware and software.

If you are purchasing a first pair of recreational skates for your child, you're probably better off starting with figure skates. This is because they provide a wider base of support and make it easier for beginners to learn basic skating skills without becoming discouraged. Stability and ease of use should be top priorities when selecting an introductory pair for any child, since your primary goal is to help them enjoy their experience on the ice and build confidence in their abilities. Once your child gains more experience and develops a preference for a specific type of ice sport, you can then consider investing in specialized skates designed for hockey or figure skating.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: But then I realize how superficial that attitude is. Sentence 2: The behaviour was so ridiculous, they all were a bit dismayed. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The two sentences express different ideas and are not directly related in meaning. Let's examine each sentence in more detail to understand their meanings and why they are not connected. Sentence 1: \\"But then I realize how superficial that attitude is.\\" This sentence suggests the speaker has acknowledged that a certain attitude they were referring to earlier is superficial. The term \\"superficial\\" implies that the attitude lacks depth or is based on surface-level observations or judgments rather than deeper understanding or empathy. The speaker is reflecting on that realization and possibly reconsidering their approach or opinion. The use of \\"but then\\" implies a change in their perspective, indicating they have come to this realization after some prior thoughts or experiences. Sentence 2: \\"The behaviour was so ridiculous, they all were a bit dismayed.\\" This sentence describes a scenario where a specific behavior exhibited by someone (or a group of people) is deemed ridiculous, causing dismay among those affected or observing it. The term \\"ridiculous\\" indicates that the behavior is absurd, unreasonable, or bizarre to the extent that it led to a negative emotional response among others. The word \\"dismayed\\" further highlights the negative emotions experienced by those in response to the ridiculous behavior. The two sentences express distinct ideas, with the first sentence referring to the speaker's self-awareness in recognizing the superficiality of an attitude, and the second sentence describing others' reactions to a particular behavior. There is no clear connection between the content of the two sentences, and they could refer to unrelated situations and contexts. In summary, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as they discuss separate issues and do not share a direct link in meaning or context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior. I am facing a new situation today: Two friends met after 20 years and had a beer together. Vlad was a geologist and studied earthquakes. Mort was a pedologist and studied soils. They had some interesting conversations that night. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend studied less about seismic waves going different speeds through different materials? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, Mort, the pedologist who studied soils, would have studied less about seismic waves going through different speeds and materials compared to Vlad, the geologist who specifically studied earthquakes.

Passage:Like his father, Mellon consistently supported the Republican Party, and he frequently donated to state and local party leaders. Through state party boss Matthew Quay, Mellon influenced legislators to place high tariffs on aluminum products in the McKinley Tariff of 1890. During the early 20th century, Mellon was dismayed by the rise of progressivism and the antitrust actions pursued by the presidential administrations of Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. He especially opposed the Taft administration's investigations into Alcoa, which in 1912 signed a consent decree rather than going to trial. In the aftermath of World War I, he provided financial support to Henry Cabot Lodge and other Republicans in their successful campaign to prevent ratification of the Treaty of Versailles. Mellon attended the 1920 Republican National Convention as a nominal supporter of Pennsylvania Governor William Cameron Sproul (Mellon hoped Senator Philander Knox would win the nomination), but the convention chose Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio as the party's presidential nominee. Mellon strongly approved of the party's conservative platform, and he served as a key fundraiser for Harding during the presidential campaign.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","completion":"The data provided refers to Alexandria, Indiana, and indicates that the elevation of this location is 265.0 (presumably in feet). To offer a comprehensive understanding of this information, let's break it down into its various components: 1. Alexandria, Indiana: Alexandria is a city located in the state of Indiana, United States. It is situated within Madison County and is a part of the Anderson, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area. With a rich history and a variety of local attractions, Alexandria offers an authentic midwestern experience for both residents and visitors. 2. Elevation: Elevation is a geographic term referring to the height of a location above a fixed reference point, which is usually the mean sea level. Elevation data is crucial for several reasons, such as understanding the topography, planning infrastructure projects, or studying climate patterns that are affected by altitude changes. 3. 265.0 feet: In this particular instance, the elevation of Alexandria, Indiana, is given as 265.0 feet. This implies that the city is situated at a height of 265 feet above the mean sea level. The elevation data helps provide insight into the city's geographical features and how they might influence aspects like weather patterns, drainage systems, and vegetation. To put Alexandria's elevation of 265.0 feet into perspective, let's examine how it compares with other elevations within Indiana and the United States as a whole: - Indiana, in general, has relatively flat terrain, and its elevation varies between about 98 feet (at the state's lowest point in Posey County) and 1,257 feet (at Hoosier Hill in Wayne County). Thus, Alexandria's elevation of 265 feet is marginally above the state's overall average elevation, which stands around 230-250 feet. - The United States, on the other hand, has varied topography with elevations ranging from 282 feet below sea level (Badwater Basin in Death Valley, California) to 20,310 feet (Denali, Alaska) above sea level. Compared to the national elevation range, Alexandria's elevation of 265 feet would be considered relatively low-lying. In conclusion, the data provided describes the elevation of the city of Alexandria in Indiana, which stands at 265.0 feet above sea level. This value is helpful for identifying the city's topography and comparing it with other geographical regions. Alexandria's elevation is typical for the state of Indiana given its predominantly flat landscape, while it is considered a relatively low-lying area when looking at the United States' more extensive elevation range."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thethicknessoftheholdingfixtureforweightplatesshouldalsobeconsidered. Please segment the words.","completion":"The thickness of the holding fixture for weight plates should also be considered. When designing a holding fixture for weight plates, it is crucial to consider the thickness of the fixture to ensure that it can support the weight plates safely and effectively. This means taking into account various factors, such as the types and sizes of weight plates to be stored, as well as the material and construction of the fixture itself. The thickness of the holding fixture is dependent on several factors: 1. Material: The choice of material for the holding fixture plays a significant role in determining the thickness required for adequate support. Common materials used for holding fixtures include steel, aluminum, wood, or plastic. Steel and aluminum are strong and durable metals that often require less thickness compared to wood or plastic. 2. Load capacity: The amount of weight the fixture needs to support is another important consideration. The heavier the weight plates being stored, the thicker the holding fixture needs to be to provide sufficient structural integrity. It is essential to calculate the maximum load capacity required and choose a thickness that can accommodate this weight. 3. Weight plate sizes: Different weight plates come in various sizes, and the holding fixture must be designed to accommodate them all. The thickness of the fixture should be sufficient to provide enough space between each plate, without the risk of the plates falling off or damaging the fixture. 4. Durability: Ensuring that the holding fixture is strong enough to withstand long-term use and potential wear and tear is crucial. A thicker fixture is often more durable, provided that it is constructed from high-quality materials. 5. Safety: In a setting where users will be frequently handling heavy weight plates, safety is a top priority. A holding fixture with adequate thickness can prevent accidents caused by plates falling off the rack or the fixture itself collapsing under the weight. 6. Ease of use: A suitable holding fixture for weight plates should allow users to easily access and store their plates without difficulty. The thickness of the fixture should be sufficient to enable users to slide the plates onto the holding pegs without obstruction comfortably. In conclusion, the thickness of the holding fixture for weight plates is an important aspect to consider during the design process. By taking the factors outlined above into account, you can ensure the fixture is strong, durable, safe, and user-friendly, allowing for efficient storage and access to weight plates in any fitness setting."},{"prompt":"Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The oxygen travels into the lungs - The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells) - The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart - All cells receive the oxygen.

Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel sets the fastest time in practice ahead of the Abu Dhabi GP. Article:","completion":"Title: Alain Prost Discusses Reviving the French Grand Prix as FIA Considers Increasing Entry Fees in 2013 Former Formula 1 World Champion Alain Prost has revealed that talks are underway to potentially reinstate the French Grand Prix. The legendary race, held at Circuit Paul Ricard, had last taken place in 2007 but has experienced a hiatus since then. As discussions to bring back the esteemed event unfold, it is worth noting that the FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile) is reportedly looking into raising entry fees for the teams participating in the 2013 season. Meanwhile, Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel seems undaunted by these developments, securing the fastest lap time in the practice session leading up to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Alain Prost, recognized for his exceptional driving skills and illustrious career, remains an influential figure within the Formula 1 community. His announcement revealing the ongoing negotiations to breathe new life back into the French Grand Prix is a testament to his deep-rooted commitment to the sport. Fans and professionals alike eagerly anticipate the possible return of an iconic race that has contributed significantly to the history of Formula 1. The Circuit Paul Ricard, located in the South of France near Le Castellet, debuted as the host of the French Grand Prix in 1970. A superb racing facility with exceptional infrastructure, the track often attracted massive crowds. As the French Grand Prix remained a beloved staple on the Formula 1 calendar, the last race in 2007 marked a turning point. The French event took a backseat due to the sport's international expansion, with newer circuits and venues beckoning. Reviving the French Grand Prix not only pays homage to F1's roots but also rekindles the passion for the sport in a nation where it all began. In the meantime, recent reports suggest a potential increase in entry fees for teams from the 2013 season onwards. The FIA, the governing body of motorsport, is said to be considering this move in an effort to generate additional revenue. This could potentially place teams in a challenging position, especially smaller outfits that already struggle to maintain a competitive edge. The ramifications of these policy changes could impact the sport's financial balance and it would be pivotal to monitor the teams' response on this matter. Unswayed by the surrounding news, four-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel maintains his competitive edge. Vettel clocked the fastest time during the practice session leading up to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The German driver, representing the Red Bull Racing Team, has demonstrated an unrelenting drive to win throughout his Formula 1 journey, and this recent achievement further solidifies his standing in the racing world. As talks begin to potentially reinstate the French Grand Prix and the FIA mulls over increasing entry fees, the Formula 1 landscape continues its inevitable evolution. Despite these potential changes, it's essential to remember that the sport's heart and soul remains the talent and tenacity of the drivers themselves. With sports icons like Alain Prost keeping a watchful eye on the circuit's progress, the future of Formula 1 is bound to remain electrifying."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

During the attack, Mr Kim called for reunification of the two Koreas. Police said they were also investigating Mr Kim's links with North Korea, after it was revealed he had made multiple visits. \\"We are investigating whether there is any connection between the suspect's visits to North Korea and the crime committed against the US ambassador,\\" Yoon Myeong-seong, head of Seoul's central Jongno district said according to Reuters. Mr Kim also had a history of nationalist militant activity, media reports said. A small group of people in South Korea see the US as the main obstacle to the reunification of a divided Korean peninsula. Mr Yoon said authorities wanted to charge Mr Kim, 55, with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction, Yonhap news agency reported. Police have requested a formal detention warrant. Mr Kim, who was apprehended after the incident, told police that he did not intend to kill Mr Lippert. Mr Yoon also said they were considering charging him with violating South Korea's National Security Law, which bans South Koreans from publicly sympathising with the government of North Korea. Mr Kim also shouted opposition to annual US-South Korean military drills, which began Monday, during the attack. North Korea traditionally opposes the drills, which it describes as a rehearsal for invasion. Late on Thursday, it described the attack as \\"just punishment for US warmongers\\", in a statement on state media. Mr Lippert, 42, was given 80 stitches to the deep cut on his face and underwent surgery to repair nerve damage to his hand. Doctors said he would be discharged early next week. The attack raised questions about security for diplomatic personnel. Mr Lippert had a bodyguard with him when the attack took place. Police were also there, but not at the request of the US embassy or the organisers of the event. The responsibility for the safety of diplomats lies with the host nation. After the incident, the South Korean government ramped up security for diplomatic missions, including the US embassy. Police said they were providing protection for Mr Lippert.

Here are the steps I took to understand why: 1. Analyze the properties of rocks: Rocks are solid, sturdy, and provide a stable structure. They can be found in various shapes and sizes, with some having crevices, gaps, or even small caves. They are typically found in many environments, such as forests, grasslands, deserts, and mountainous regions. 2. Identify the needs of small animals: Small animals require protection from predators, a place for rest, and a stable environment to raise their young. They often seek shelter that provides coverage where predators cannot easily see or reach them. 3. Consider the role of rocks as protection: Rocks can provide small animals with a barrier against predators, which may have difficulty accessing tight spaces in or around the rock formations. 4. Examine the role of rocks for temperature regulation: The temperature inside rock crevices or under large boulders can be quite different than the surrounding environment. This helps animals maintain a consistent body temperature, protecting them from extreme heat or cold. 5. Assess the role of rocks in camouflage: Small animals can blend in with their surroundings when using rocks as shelter. This camouflage makes them less visible to predators and increases their chances of survival. 6. Evaluate the role of rocks for nesting and breeding: Rocks can offer small animals a safe place to build their nests or dens, where they can raise their young without frequent disruptions or threats from predators. Final Conclusion: Small animals may use rocks as shelter because rocks provide a stable and protective structure with varying temperatures, offering camouflage, protection from predators, a place for rest, and a suitable environment for nesting and breeding activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer acknowledges that the VH1 special has something more special behind it, suggesting that the film is not just another run-of-the-mill documentary. By highlighting the fact that the music in the film didn't sell many records, the reviewer acknowledges the music's underground status, but then emphasizes its considerable influence saying it \\"helped change a nation.\\" The phrasing implies that despite not being commercially successful, the music and the story it tells have a lasting and profound impact on society. This juxtaposition between commercial success and cultural influence adds a level of depth and intrigue to the movie. The use of the word \\"special\\" also tends to imply a positive nuance, connoting that the film stands out from others in its category. Although the statement doesn't explicitly mention any particular positive aspects, the emphasis on the unique and significant influence of the music suggests that the movie has a powerful narrative.

The management at the office had invested in modern, high-performance machines to maximize productivity and efficiency, whereas the school's tight budget had not allowed for such frequent upgrades. Step 1: Analyze the given text and understand the situation. Reasoning: The text mentions that the computers in the office are faster than the ones in the school, so the goal is to identify which ones are newer based on this fact. Step 2: Choose the option that explains the difference in performance. Reasoning: Since faster computers typically indicate better, newer technology, it's logical to select the option that says the office computers are newer. Step 3: Elaborate on possible reasons the office and school computers differ in their performance. Reasoning: It is important to provide context for why the office had newer computers while the school did not to make the explanation more meaningful and comprehensive. Office environments often prioritize efficiency and productivity, while schools may be restricted by limited budgets. In conclusion, the faster computers in the office can be attributed to their newer technology, which was invested in to improve overall productivity and workflow.

Given information: 1. The circular path has a radius of 12 meters. 2. The walkway surrounding the path is 2 meters wide. 3. The cost of leveling the walkway is 50 paise per square meter. Now, let's solve the task step-by-step: Step 1: Calculate the area of the entire circular area, including the path and the walkway. The radius of this entire area is the sum of the path's radius and the walkway's width: 12 + 2 = 14 meters Area (A) = π × Radius² => A = π × 14² = 3.14 × 196 = 615.44 m² Step 2: Calculate the area of the circular path. Area (B) = π × Radius² => B = π × 12² = 3.14 × 144 = 452.16 m² Step 3: Calculate the area of just the walkway by subtracting the path area from the total area. Walkway Area (C) = A - B => C = 615.44 - 452.16 = 163.28 m² Step 4: Calculate the cost of leveling the walkway. Cost = Walkway Area × Cost per square meter Cost = 163.28 m² × 0.50 Rs = 81.64 Rs Comparing the result to the given options: a) 49 b) 40 c) 81.72 d) 42 e) 43 The answer is closest to option 'c' (Rs. 81.72), which suggests some rounding differences but it's the closest to the correct calculated cost (Rs. 81.64)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jimmy Eat World is an American rock band from Mesa, Arizona that formed in 1993. The band is composed of vocalist and lead guitarist Jim Adkins, rhythm guitarist and vocalist Tom Linton, bassist Rick Burch and drummer Zach Lind. As of October 2016, Jimmy Eat World have released nine studio albums, the last eight featuring the current lineup. The four-piece's commercial breakthrough came with the successful release of several singles from the album Bleed American (2001). In fall (autumn)/winter of 2011, Adkins announced that the band would be writing and recording for their next album. Lind stated in a Twitter post that the band will begin recording its next album during the latter part of August 2012 and, on September 5, 2012, another Twitter post stated that recording had begun for the eighth studio album with engineer/producer Alain Johannes. On October 5, 2012, Jimmy Eat World posted on Twitter that the band had completed recording its eighth album and that the recording was being mixed at that time; the mastering process then commenced after a November 30, 2012 Twitter update indicated that the mixing process had been completed. On January 29, 2013, Jimmy Eat World stated on both its Twitter and Facebook profiles that the eighth studio album was \\"officially mastered and sequenced\\". In a Twitter post on Lind's individual profile, the drummer revealed that, as of January 29, 2013, the band was still seeking out a record label for the release of the eighth album. Lind briefly responded to a fan's query with: \\"@CallumSty no announcement coming soon. still looking for a label.\\" The official details of the eighth album, entitled Damage, emerged in early April 2013 and on April 10, 2013, a lead single titled \\"I Will Steal You Back\\" was revealed via the band's website. The title track Damage appears on the 7-inch Damage EP along with a cover version of the Radiohead song \\"Stop Whispering\\". The EP was released on April 20, 2013, for Record Store Day, an internationally recognized celebration in support of music and independent retail outlets. Jimmy Eat World also released the album's track-listing, consisting of ten songs, and June 11, 2013, as the official release date. Adkins explained in a Rolling Stone magazine interview that Damage is a \\"pretty energetic\\" work that explores the issue of relationship break-ups from the perspective of an adult: \\"I'm 37 and the world around me is a lot different than when I was writing break-up songs in my 20s. I tried to reflect that in what the lyrics are.\\" The release of Damage also signifies the cessation of Jimmy Eat World's independent era, as the band signed a recording contract with the Toronto, Canada-based record label Dine Alone Records. RCA Records released the eighth album in the U.S. on April 4, 2013 and internationally April 11, 2013. The album was recorded in Johannes' Los Angeles, U.S. home and was mixed by James Brown, who had previously worked with Sound City, Nine Inch Nails, and The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart. The band posted a music video for the song \\"I Will Steal You Back\\" on their VEVO YouTube page on May 31, 2013. In October 2013, the band announced a series of December 2013 US tour dates that followed a UK/European tour.

The reason there is so much trash around is because not enough people recognize that it's a problem. Start with yourself, and make sure you're not generating litter, intentionally or otherwise.","completion":"How to pick up litter Stop litter where it starts. The reason there is so much trash around is because not enough people recognize that it's a problem. Start with yourself, and make sure you're not generating litter, intentionally or otherwise. Educate your friends and family. Once you have adopted the habit of not generating litter, encourage your friends, family, and colleagues to do the same. Share with them the negative impact that litter has on the environment and how it affects local wildlife. Educate them on how every piece of trash that is thrown on the ground instead of a trash can contributes to the growing problem. Organize community cleanup initiatives. Taking personal responsibility for your own actions is crucial in combating litter; however, it's important to extend these efforts to your neighborhood and community. Work with your local government or join an existing environmental organization to plan cleanup events. By participating in or organizing community cleanup initiatives, you help raise awareness and inspire others to contribute to a cleaner, litter-free environment. Set up more garbage and recycling bins. One of the reasons why people tend to litter is the lack of trash and recycling cans in public spaces. Talk to your local officials about installing additional garbage and recycling bins in strategic places like parks, bus stops, and shopping areas. By providing these facilities, people will have a better chance of disposing of their waste properly. Encourage local businesses to reduce waste. Businesses can play a massive role in reducing litter by implementing sustainable practices and using eco-friendly packaging. Encourage local businesses to adopt these practices by showing support for those that do. When you shop at places that prioritize sustainable packaging and waste reduction, not only are you helping to keep the environment clean, but you're also providing an incentive for other businesses to adopt similar practices. Promote proper waste disposal and recycling. Many people are unfamiliar with proper waste disposal practices, leading to littering and even waste contamination in recycling bins. Educate yourself and others in your community about proper waste disposal and recycling practices. It's essential to understand what materials can be recycled and how they should be sorted to prevent contamination and optimize recycling efforts. Monitor and report littering. Some people still litter despite knowing its negative effects. If you notice a consistent litter problem in a specific area or see someone littering, consider reporting it to local authorities. They can then take action to tackle the issue, such as increasing law enforcement presence, installing surveillance cameras, or posting anti-littering signage. However, always prioritize your safety when monitoring and reporting litter issues. Set a positive example. Finally, always show a positive example by practicing proper waste disposal and engaging in environmentally-friendly habits. By doing so, you can inspire others, especially children and teenagers, to be more environmentally conscious and make the right choices when it comes to waste management. Remember that every small action you take can make a difference in creating a cleaner, healthier environment for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.). Question: \\"Was the man whose thoughts made up the text, \\"The Way and Its Power\\", have legends about his past, that claimed he taught the young Confucius.\\" Answer: \\"Chairman Mao\\" Is this answer correct?

Jermain Defoe's hat-trick gave Tottenham fans even more to sing about after the Metropolitan Police reassured them they will NOT face prosecution for using the word 'Yid' in matchday chants. London's police force agreed with the club and their supporters that the 'Yid Army' songs are not anti-Semitic. Spurs fans often sing songs featuring the expression, and did so during their Europa League clash against Slovenian side Maribor at White Hart Lane, where a stunning treble from Defoe gave them a 3-1 win. Scroll down for video. Backing: Tottenham fans cheer on their side against Maribor on Thursday. 'The club does not tolerate any form of racist or abusive chanting. 'Our guiding principle in respect of. the \\"Y-word\\" is based on the point of law itself - the distinguishing. factor is the intent with which it is used ie if it is used with the. deliberate intention to cause offence. 'This has been the basis of. prosecutions of fans of other teams to date. Our fans adopted the chant. as a defence mechanism in order to own the term and thereby deflect. anti-Semitic abuse. They do not use the term to others to cause any. offence, they use it a chant amongst themselves. 'The club believes that real. anti-semitic abuse such as hissing to simulate the noise of gas chambers. is the real evil and the real offence. We believe this is the area that. requires a determined and concerted effort from all parties and where. we seek greater support to eradicate.' Before kick-off, a smattering of. supporters in the South Stand sang 'Yid Army' and, after a third-minute. corner for Spurs, the chant grew louder with the whole end joining in. Then, in clear protest at the. criticism levelled at them, Spurs fans from all corners bellowed:. 'We're Tottenham Hotspur, we'll sing what we want.' Another round of 'Yid Army' then followed. The club released a statement. defending their fans' right to use the expression. It read: 'Our guiding. principle in respect of the \\"Y-word\\" is based on the point of law - ie. if it is used with the deliberate intention to cause offence. 'Our fans. adopted the chant as a defence mechanism in order to deflect. anti-Semitic abuse. They do not use the term to cause any offence, they. use it as a chant among themselves.' The Met have advised Spurs that. chants such as 'Yid Army' will not lead to prosecution on the basis that. it is used with no 'deliberate intention to cause offence'. The Society of Black Lawyers. threatened to report Spurs to the police if they were not seen to be. doing more to ensure the term is no longer used. Hat-trick hero: Jermain Defoe. As a youngster growing up supporting Spurs, it took me some time to realise the word 'yid' was an offensive racial slur. I'd never heard it used in a derogatory sense at White Hart Lane, only ever as a collective term - yid army - and as a positive identifier. If a player was good, he was a yiddo. But its significance soon became apparent. Though far from the abhorrent gas chamber hissing of some away fans, it's still sensitive. Context is important, though, and its reclamation as a positive term at the ground should not be ignored. The Society of Black lawyers says use of the word yid, including the tone adopted by Spurs fans, amounts to casual racism. Perhaps they have a point. Perhaps simply substituting the word would be the answer. But Spurs fans are unlikely to take kindly at being told what to do by an external body, especially as it is largely considered a positive, rather than offensive, chant. David Baddiel tried to stamp out its use by Tottenham supporters but, despite his own Jewish faith, the views of a Chelsea fan were never likely to be accepted by the Spurs majority. If the word yid really is to be kicked out of White Hart Lane, it would need concerns to be raised from within the Spurs-supporting community, rather than outside pressures.

Answer based on context: Superferry 14 was a large ferry destroyed by a bomb on 27 February 2004, killing 116 people in the Philippines' worst terrorist attack and the world's deadliest terrorist attack at sea. On that day, the 10,192 ton ferry sailed out of Manila with about 900 passengers and crew on board. A television set filled with 8 lb. of TNT had been placed on board. 90 minutes out of port, the bomb exploded. 63 people were killed instantly and 53 were missing and presumed dead. Despite claims from terrorist groups, the blast was initially thought to have been an accident caused by a gas explosion. However, after divers righted the ferry five months after it had sunk, they found evidence of a bomb blast. A man called Redendo Cain Dellosa admitted to planting the bomb for Abu Sayyaf. Six suspects were arrested in connection with the bombing while the masterminds, Khadaffy Janjalani and Abu Sulaiman, were killed. How many passengers and crew aboard Superferry 14 were not killed in the terrorist attack?","completion":"To find out how many passengers and crew aboard Superferry 14 were not killed in the terrorist attack, we'll first need to determine the total number of people on board the ferry and the number of casualties. As mentioned in the context, there were approximately 900 passengers and crew on board Superferry 14 at the time of the attack. The bomb blast resulted in the deaths of 116 people, which included 63 people killed instantly and 53 missing and presumed dead. To calculate the number of people who were not killed in the terrorist attack, we can subtract the number of casualties from the total number of passengers and crew: 900 (total passengers and crew) - 116 (casualties) = 784 Therefore, approximately 784 passengers and crew aboard Superferry 14 were not killed in the terrorist attack."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which shipping area is north of Forties?","completion":"The shipping area north of Forties is the Viking shipping area. The shipping forecast areas were established by the United Kingdom Meteorological Office to provide weather forecasts for mariners navigating the waters around the British Isles. The areas are named after nearby geographical features or locations, and Viking is one of them. The Viking shipping area is situated in the North Sea, to the north of Forties, and it covers the region between latitudes 58°N and 62°N and longitudes 0° and 4°E. The area is mainly bounded by the Faroe Islands to the northwest, the Norðrá Hanstholm VHF coastal radio station in Denmark to the east, and the Forties shipping forecast area to the south. The Forties shipping area lies between latitudes 56°N and 58°N and longitudes 0° and 5°E. To its south, the shipping forecast area of Dogger can be found, while Fisher lies to the southeast. The name Viking originates from historical connections with the Viking people who were known seafarers and sailed through these waters when voyaging between Scandinavia and the United Kingdom. Given the northerly location of the Viking shipping area, the waters tend to be cooler, and the weather can be more severe and unpredictable compared to the Forties shipping area.

Emotional Connection: She might be cherishing a deep emotional bond with him that has developed over time, getting to know each other and sharing experiences. The desire to touch him could be an extension of this emotional connection, as physical touch acts as a powerful medium to communicate feelings and reinforce connections. 2. Attraction: The woman could be experiencing a strong attraction towards the man, either due to his physical appearance, personality traits, or a combination of both. Her desire to touch him could stem from a genuine appreciation of these qualities and the magnetic pull that attraction tends to have. 3. Comfort and Reassurance: Physical touch can be incredibly comforting and reassuring, especially when dealing with anxiety, self-doubt, or negative emotions. She may want to touch him because his presence might give her a sense of security and solace, something she craves in that moment. 4. Expressing Love and Affection: The desire to touch could also be an urge to convey love and affection towards the man, beyond words. Touches are often loaded with meaning, and simple tactile interactions can communicate emotions powerfully, transcending languages and spoken expressions. 5. Curiosity and Exploration: It is also possible that she is driven by curiosity and an innate desire to explore the dynamics of their relationship or friendship. Touching him might be a way to better understand the nature of their connection and evaluate how he reacts to it, paving the way for deeper intimacy or clarifying boundaries. 6. Test boundaries: Her desire to touch him could be an unconscious yearning to test the boundaries of their relationship or friendship. She might wonder how close they can get without crossing a line or jeopardizing their existing dynamics. This touch could be a move to gauge his reactions, to see if he feels similarly. 7. Longing and Familiarity: If they have been apart for some time or if they had a more intimate relationship in the past, her desire to touch him might be based on nostalgia and a craving to reconnect in a familiar and tangible manner, reminding herself of the warmth and closeness they once shared. However, fear of rejection is holding her back, as she is unsure about his feelings and how he would react to her advances.

A:","completion":"In general, the solubility of a substance is affected by temperature. For most solid or liquid solutes, solubility increases as temperature increases. This is because higher temperatures provide more kinetic energy to the solute and solvent molecules, allowing them to more easily break their intermolecular bonds and mix. In Keith's experiments, test A had a liquid solute in a solvent at room temperature, while test B increased the temperature of the same solute-solvent system. Since the solute is in the liquid state, we can assume that it follows the typical trend where increasing temperature leads to increased solubility.

I would recommend the book based upon her writing style alone. The plot is a tad mournful...an young girl is abandoned to live with her Aunts by her drug-addicted mother. The girl grows up and never really develops her own personality as she is obsessed with the hope that her mother will reenter her life and wastes most of her youth daydreaming about life with her messed-up mother and reuniting with an equally messed-up father who she has never known. Sadly, the young girl misses most out of her own youth focusing on what can never be and misses out on a wonderful life she would have know had she recognized the love and guidance her Aunts were providing. But through the poetry of Youngblood, you will see and feel this young girl's pain. Haunting!

Answer:","completion":"This product review conveys a mixed sentiment. On one hand, it praises Shay Youngblood's debut for its creative writing, poetry, and beautiful imagery, and recommends the book based on her writing style alone. On the other hand, it highlights the mournful plot and mentions that the protagonist misses out on her own youth and opportunities, making it haunting and potentially less appealing to some readers.

Answer the following question: Information: - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - The International Pentecostal Holiness Church ( IPHC ) or simply Pentecostal Holiness Church ( PHC ) is a Pentecostal Christian denomination founded in 1911 with the merger of two older denominations . Historically centered in the Southeastern United States , particularly the Carolinas and Georgia , the Pentecostal Holiness Church now has an international presence . In 2000 , the church reported a worldwide membership of over one million -- over three million including affiliates . Heavily influenced by two major American revival movements -- the holiness movement of the late 19th century and the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century -- the church 's theological roots derive from John Wesley 's teachings on sanctification . Several ministers who were raised in the Pentecostal Holiness Church have come to have greater name recognition than the church itself , such as Oral Roberts , an internationally known charismatic evangelist ; Charles Stanley , a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention ; and C.M. Ward , a former Assemblies of God radio preacher . - Apostolic succession is the method whereby the ministry of the Christian Church is held to be derived from the apostles by a continuous succession, which has usually been associated with a claim that the succession is through a series of bishops. This series was seen originally as that of the bishops of a particular see founded by one or more of the apostles. According to historian Justo L. González, apostolic succession is generally understood today as meaning a series of bishops, regardless of see, each consecrated by other bishops, themselves consecrated similarly in a succession going back to the apostles. But, according to documentation produced by the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, the sees (\\"cathedrae\\") play \\"an important role in inserting the bishop into the heart of ecclesial apostolicity\\". - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\". - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.

Allen also is creating a fund to help medical professionals who get sick cover their bills. (Fellow Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates donated 50 million via his foundation.)","completion":"Title: Microsoft Co-founder Paul Allen Pledges 100 Million to Fight Ebola and Provides Additional Support The ongoing battle against the deadly Ebola virus has recently received a major boost as Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen pledges a staggering 100 million to support the cause, as reported by the Seattle Times. This generous contribution comes in addition to the 50 million previously donated by fellow Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates via his foundation. With Ebola cases continuing to emerge globally, such financial support is critical in curbing the spread of this devastating disease. Paul Allen, aware of the enormity of the task in containing and ultimately eradicating the Ebola virus, has expressed his concerns in a conversation with the New York Times. He says, “We’re up against an extremely tough opponent here,” adding, “The exponential nature of the growth of this disease is really a challenge—we’ve already seen in the US where one case quickly became two.” His determination to make a difference in this fight against Ebola has led to the inception of a website named TackleEbola. The purpose of this website is to allow people worldwide to donate to specific projects aimed at controlling and eventually eliminating the virus. Some of the ongoing and proposed projects that TackleEbola seeks funds for include hand-washing stations in West Africa, a region significantly impacted by the virus, as well as the creation of an 80-bed center for patients in the same area. Ensuring adequate sanitation facilities and providing better access to treatment can significantly contribute to reducing the transmission of Ebola and improving survival rates. A portion of the funds donated by Paul Allen will be allocated to the University of Massachusetts Medical School. This well-respected institution is currently underwriting the cost of training and medical equipment in Liberia, one of the hardest-hit countries in the recent Ebola outbreak. Establishing a skilled local workforce equipped with the necessary resources is a critical step in managing the impact of Ebola and preventing any further spread. In addition to his 100 million donation and the TackleEbola initiative, Paul Allen is also dedicated to supporting the medical professionals who are on the front lines battling the virus. He is in the process of creating a fund specifically designed to help medical professionals who become infected cover their expenses. This crucial financial safety net provides a measure of reassurance to those who risk their own health and well-being in the fight against the disease. The recent surge of financial support from influential figures and philanthropists such as Paul Allen and Bill Gates exemplifies the need for a collective, global effort to confront the Ebola crisis head-on. As cases continue to arise and the global community becomes increasingly aware of the repercussions of the disease, the combined efforts of individuals, organizations, and governments must work in unison to tackle this formidable opponent. Paul Allen's formidable 100 million pledge, along with his multifaceted approach in addressing the issue, serves as a testament to the power of philanthropy and the positive impact it can have on this ongoing battle against Ebola."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: This artist's rendering shows NASA's New Horizons spacecraft during its flyby of Pluto and its moons on July 14, 2015. The spacecraft awoke from its final hibernation period on Dec. 6, 2014 in preparation for the epic Pluto encounter at the edge of the solar system. LAUREL, Md. — Pluto, get ready for your close-up: A NASA spacecraft has roused itself from the final slumber of its nine-year trek to the edge of the solar system, setting the stage for the first close encounter with Pluto next year. The New Horizons spacecraft, currently located 2.9 billion miles (4.6 billion kilometers) from Earth, had been in hibernation since August — with most of its systems turned off to reduce wear. But late Saturday (Dec. 6), mission scientists received a confirmation signal from New Horizons at the probe's Mission Operations Center here at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. The probe is now wide awake for its 2015 flyby of Pluto. At the time of its wakeup call, New Horizons was just over 162 million miles (261 million km) from Pluto. About 20 people gathered in a conference room here at APL to await the signal from New Horizons. [Photos from NASA's New Horizons Pluto Probe] NASA's New Horizon Pluto flyby mission operations manager Alice Bowman and operations team Karl Whittenburg watch screens for signals confirming that the New Horizons probe awoke from hibernation on Dec. 6, 2014. The New Horizons mission is managed from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Credit: NASA First word from the probe arrived at about 9:30 p.m. EST on Saturday (Dec. 6) — generating a burst of happy applause from the attendees, including Alan Stern, New Horizon's principle investigator, and Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary sciences. At 9:52 p.m. EST (0252 GMT), mission managers confirmed that New Horizons was awake, with all systems functioning normally. The wakeup sets the stage for the probe's flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015. \\"This is the turning of a page. This is changing from a mission in cruise to a mission at its destination,\\" said Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Stern popped a champagne bottle and offered a toast to the mission following the signal confirmation. New Horizons even got a wakeup song to mark the occasion: the tune \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\" by English tenor Russell Watson. The song, which included a special greeting from Watson for New Horizons, was played in the mission operations center after the confirmation signal was received. You can hear Watson's New Horizons wakeup song here. This photo of Pluto (center) and its largest moon Charon was captured by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft in July 2014 and released on Aug. 7.

Credit: NASA New Horizons will begin its Pluto science campaign in January, and will make its closest approach to Pluto in July. It will explore the outer-most and most-populated region of the solar system, the Kuiper belt, which is full of rocky, icy objects that have remained largely unchanged since the formation of the solar system. \\"This is the place that this spacecraft was built to operate, and these are the operations that this team has waited a decade to actually go and execute,\\" Stern said. \\"So it's game time.\\" NASA launched the New Horizons mission in 2006 on a 700 million mission to be the first spacecraft ever to see Pluto and its five moons up close. The piano-size spacecraft is powered by a nuclear power source and has traveled nearly 3 billion miles (4.8 billion km) to reach Pluto in a mere nine years, making it the fastest space probe ever launched). It has spent two-thirds of its journey in a hibernation state that has both prolonged the life of the instruments and reduced staff costs on the ground. While New Horizons has gone through 18 hibernation periods, sleeping for about 1,873 days in all, this is the last one before it begins taking data on the Pluto system. For 20 weeks of its flyby of Pluto, New Horizons will provide better photos of Pluto and its moons than those taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, Stern said. In analogy, if the spacecraft were flying over a city it would be able to count the individual buildings on the ground. New Horizons may also identify as-yet-unknown moons or rings around Pluto. At the wake-up event, Stern handed out small, 2-inch-long pencils — whittled down from extensive use. \\"This is the metaphor for persistence,\\" Stern said, holding up the pencil stub. \\"Since this mission went through so many ups and downs — the way the exploration of Pluto did — I thought this was an appropriate thing to give away.

Translate to English","completion":"PRISTINA, Kosovo -- According to news reports in the local media on Sunday, January 30, which are based on official sources, there are approximately 300,000 pending cases in the courts of Kosovo. The news, dated January 30, 2022, refers to the current situation in the courts of Kosovo. As the reports suggest, the backlog of cases awaiting trial or resolution in the country's judicial system is estimated to be around 300,000. This notable amount of pending cases highlights the difficulties and challenges that Kosovo faces in addressing its legal needs. The backlog of cases in any judicial system can lead to significant delays in delivering justice, both for the individuals involved and for society as a whole. This situation can erode public trust in the judicial system and may negatively impact social stability, and in some instances, economic development. The reasons behind such a considerable backlog in the Kosovo courts can be attributed to multiple factors, some of which may include: 1. Limited resources: Courts in Kosovo may face budgetary constraints, lack of proper infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified personnel, including judges, lawyers, and administrative staff. 2. Legal complexity and efficiency: The judicial process in any country can be complex and time-consuming. The need for proper legal representation, thorough investigations, and adherence to due process are all factors that can slow court proceedings. 3. Social factors: Cultural and socio-economic variables can also contribute to delays in the judicial process. Instances of high crime rates, corruption, or a general lack of awareness about legal rights and processes can exacerbate the issue. 4. Political climate: The political landscape of the country may be a contributing factor in the efficiency of the judicial system. Governments transitioning or dealing with political turmoil can result in policy changes that may hinder or impair the court's ability to dispense swift justice. To address the issue of judicial backlog and improve the overall efficiency of the legal system, Kosovo could consider exploring and implementing various strategies. These solutions may include increasing funding for the judicial sector, investing in infrastructure improvements, allocating resources for the training and development of personnel, and implementing measures to simplify legal processes. Moreover, fostering a culture of transparency and accountability within the judiciary and government agencies would help build public trust in the system. Additionally, increased public education and awareness campaigns about legal rights and processes could contribute to a more informed and empowered population, which would, in turn, lead to a reduction in the number of unresolved cases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Knox is the world number 20 at the moment. Only five players in Darren Clarke's team are ranked higher than the Inverness man - Henrik Stenson (four), Rory McIlroy (five), Justin Rose (10), Danny Willett (11) and Sergio Garcia (12). The other seven in Clarke's team are ranked below - and in some cases miles below - Knox in the world order. Rafa Cabrera Bello is ranked 27th, Chris Wood is 28th, Thomas Pieters is 41st, Andy Sullivan is 42nd, Lee Westwood 46th, Matt Fitzpatrick 48th and Martin Kaymer 50th. Clarke was always going to go for at least two experienced players among his three captain's picks and nobody can quibble with the inclusion of Ryder Cup warriors Westwood and Kaymer. Three wildcards - but, in real life, there was only ever one spot up for grabs as soon as it became obvious that the Englishman and the German would require a pick. Media playback is not supported on this device When Knox sank that terrific putt across the 18th green to win the Travelers Championship in early August he looked like a shoo-in for the team. It was Knox's second victory on the PGA Tour since November - the other being his breakthrough win in an all-star field at the WGC in Shanghai. He was not a member of the European Tour then, so the ranking points did not count towards his Ryder Cup bid. Had he joined the Tour a week before instead of a week after, he would have made the team automatically. That night of the Travelers the lost points in Shanghai did not seem to matter because the Scot's form was looking formidable. Apart from his two wins, he would also finished second to Graeme McDowell at the OHL Classic, second again to Branden Grace at the Heritage and second once more to Rory McIlroy at the Irish Open. The gist was that Clarke probably wanted three experienced players as his wildcards to counterbalance the five rookies already in his team, but that Knox was forcing his hand with his excellence. In early August, Knox looked a certainty. Things changed, dramatically. The fast emergence of Pieters was something that Knox, and others, did not see coming. Fourth at the Olympics, second at the Czech Masters and first last week at the Made in Denmark event was a hell of a run by the talented Belgian. Suddenly, Knox had a challenger for that one wildcard spot. Knox has not helped himself either. You could not say for sure that he blew his own chances but he did himself no favours by his approach post-Travelers. He had two ranking events left after that and he played in neither of them. He thought he had done enough. He sat back and waited for Clarke's call while Pieters burned it up elsewhere. Knox should have played in the Wyndham on the PGA Tour to show his intent to qualify by right, but he did not. He should have gone to Denmark last week, thereby showing his captain that he had a huge desire to make the team, but instead he opted for the cash mountain that was The Barclays. There were Ryder Cup points on offer in Denmark but not in the USA. In choosing the USA, the Scot gave out a bad signal. At the beginning of last week, an interview with Knox was published in Golf Digest magazine. That, too, probably damaged his case for a pick. Knox displayed an alarming sense of entitlement. It would have been understandable had Clarke harboured grave doubts about Knox's ability to fit into a team once he read that interview. \\"As I said to someone recently, my big problem was not getting the points for winning in China,\\" said Knox of his victory in Shanghai. \\"I'd be in if they counted. So there is a moral obligation to pick me, I guess. I don't want Darren to pick me because of that, though. His goal is to pick the three best players who did not make the team. And I have a hard time not thinking I am one of those right now.\\" Moral obligation? This was a player dictating to a captain - and no good ever comes of that. It was a bizarre approach from Knox; it was utterly self-defeating when Pieters was already laying down a huge case for inclusion. Knox went on: \\"If all he [Clarke] does is list those he thinks are playing the best right now, I don't know how I can't be in the top 12. I know people are assuming I am the third of the three picks if he goes for Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer. But I should really be the first.\\" The first? It smacked of arrogance. Knox has only recently become a member of the European Tour, but ticking a box is not enough. He has not shown the commitment to playing in this part of the world that his captain would want. Pieters is a dedicated member of the Tour. Knox is not. Because he played in Denmark last week, Pieters got to partner his captain - and shot the lights out in his company - while Knox was in New York playing The Barclays. Out of sight, out of mind. The Belgian is a terrific player, a massive hitter, a birdie-machine and a future star of the Tour. He deserves his spot. Knox played his way into contention and then let the moment slip. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The text discusses the selection of the European Ryder Cup team and the omission of Russell Knox, currently ranked 20th in the world.

Article: Kent police look for gunman who allegedly walked onto victim’s driveway and shot him in the arm; Sikh community sees rise in abuse. Kent police are looking for a gunman who allegedly walked onto a man’s driveway and shot him, saying “Go back to your own country.” The victim, a 39-year-old Sikh man, was working on his vehicle in his driveway in Kent’s East Hill neighborhood about 8 p.m. Friday when he was approached by an unknown man, Kent police said, after talking with the victim. An altercation followed, with the victim saying the suspect made statements to the effect of “Go back to your own country.” The victim was shot in the arm. The victim described the shooter as a 6-foot-tall white man with a stocky build. He was wearing a mask covering the lower half of his face, the victim said. Kent police say they’ve reached out to the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies. “We’re early on in our investigation,” Kent Police Chief Ken Thomas said Saturday morning. “We are treating this as a very serious incident.” Jasmit Singh, a leader of the Sikh community in Renton, said he had been told the victim was released from the hospital. “He is just very shaken up, both him and his family,” Singh said. “We’re all kind of at a loss in terms of what’s going on right now, this is just bringing it home. The climate of hate that has been created doesn’t distinguish between anyone.” In a statement Saturday, the Sikh Coalition, a New York-based civil rights group, asked local and federal authorities to investigate the shooting as a hate crime. Singh said Puget Sound-area Sikh men in particular have reported a rise in verbal abuse and uncomfortable encounters recently, “a kind of prejudice, a kind of xenophobia that is nothing that we’ve seen in the recent past.” To Singh, the number of incidents targeting members of the religion, which has its roots in the Punjab region of South Asia, recalls the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. “But at that time, it felt like the [presidential] administration was actively working to allay those fears,” he said. “Now, it’s a very different dimension.” Sikh Coalition Interim Program Manager Rajdeep Singh, in calling for the hate crime investigation, said in a statement: “While we appreciate the efforts of state and local officials to respond to attacks like this, we need our national leaders to make hate crime prevention a top priority. Tone matters in our political discourse, because this a matter of life or death for millions of Americans who are worried about losing loved ones to hate.” ||||| KENT – Police are investigating a possible hate crime after a man was shot in the arm Friday evening in Kent.

He was wearing a mask covering the lower half of his face. \\"It is our belief and opinion, based upon the experience of my investigators, that our victim is absolutely credible and that this incident did occur as he has described,\\" said Kent Police Chief Ken Thomas.

Some people think it's better to pull the lever and save the five toy soldiers, even if it means that one toy soldier gets hit by the train.

Umar was born in Mecca to the Banu Adi clan, which was responsible for arbitration among the tribes. His father was Khattab ibn Nufayl and his mother was Hantama bint Hisham, from the tribe of Banu Makhzum. In his youth he used to tend to his father's camels in the plains near Mecca. His merchant father was famed for his intelligence among his tribe. Umar attended the event of Ghadir Khumm, which took place a few months before Muhammad passed away. According to both Shia and Sunni sources, he was among the many who pledged allegiance to Ali at the event. In Medina, after the Farewell Pilgrimage and the event of Ghadir Khumm, Muhammad ordered an army under the command of Usama bin Zayd. He commanded all the companions, except for his family, to go with Usama to Syria to avenge the Muslims' defeat at the Battle of Mu'tah. Muhammad gave Usama the banner of Islam on the 18th day of the Islamic month of Safar in the year 11 A.H. Abu Bakr and Umar were among those that Muhammad commanded to join Usama's army. However, Abu Bakr and Umar resisted going under the command of Usama because they thought that he, who was 18 or 20 at the time, was too young to lead an army, despite Muhammad's teachings that age and standing in society did not necessarily correspond to being a good general. In response to these worries, the Prophet said: \\"O Arabs! You are miserable because I have appointed Usama as your general, and you are raising questions if he is qualified to lead you in war. I know you are the same people who had raised the same question about his father. By God, Usama is qualified to be your general just as his father was qualified to be a general. Now obey his orders and go.\\" Whenever Muhammad felt any relief from his fatal sickness, he would inquire as to whether Usama's army had left for Syria yet, and would continue urging his companions to leave for Syria. Muhammad even said, \\"Usama's army must leave at once. May Allah curse those men who do not go with him.\\" However, while a few companions were ready to join Usama's army, many other companions, including Abu Bakr and Umar, disobeyed Muhammad's orders. It is also noted that this was the only battle expedition where Muhammad urged his companions to go the battle no matter what; for other battles, if someone was unable to go to the fight, Muhammad would let them stay at home.

Question: You are given a new situation: Big continent used more air polluting substances, while Small continent was very protective towards the environment. Big continent got a hole in its ozone layer as a consequence of their actions. and a hint : Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Please answer this question : Which continent used fewer bromine gasses? Answer:","completion":"Small continent used fewer bromine gases in comparison to Big continent. This is evident from the given situation, where it is stated that Small continent was very protective towards the environment while Big continent used more air polluting substances. Among the air pollutants, chlorine and bromine gases are known to be the chief contributors towards the destruction of the ozone layer. Big continent's excessive use of air polluting substances, including bromine gases, led to the formation of a hole in its ozone layer. Such an impact highlights the difference in the environmental approach taken by both continents. On the other hand, Small continent's efforts to preserve the environment resulted in a lower consumption of harmful substances like bromine gases, as no significant damage to their ozone layer was mentioned. As the ozone layer is crucial for protecting Earth and its inhabitants from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the consequences of high bromine gas usage by Big continent can be seen in an increased risk of skin cancers, eye cataracts, disturbance of the nitrogen cycle, and the negative impacts on marine life. Small continent's responsible use of resources, which resulted in fewer bromine gas emissions, allowed them to maintain a healthier environment for their ecosystems and human population. In conclusion, Small continent used fewer bromine gases compared to Big continent, therefore taking a more environmentally responsible approach and preserving their ozone layer from depletion. This is a significant factor in sustaining the health of ecosystems and human populations within their region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: I picked up this Sporf in Amsterdam Schipol airport. A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

Q:China Daily Oct. 11----The ministry of Health has called for more awareness from the public on the mental health of the young, as part of efforts to make World Mental Health Day which fell on Friday. More than 15 percent of Chinese youths have been found with mental problems, and about 30 million young people under 17 are suffering from depression, the Shang-based Wenhui Daily reported. The World Health Organization estimates that before 2020, the rate of children with mental problems will increase to 50 percent, and mental problems will become a major factor behind deaths and illness in the young worldwide. Deng Xiaohong, the spokesperson for the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, said rapid changes are one of the reasons behind the rising number of youngsters with psychological problems. If these mental diseases are not addressed on time, occurrence of crimes, drug-taking and other dangerous behavior are expected to rise. Experts said mental diseases could be caused by many factors, such as the inability to handle interpersonal relations well, unstable emotions and pressures from an overload of studies. A number of experts have also said the one-child policy is another reason leading to poor mental health in the young. Children are said to be too \\" spoiled\\" and \\"selfish\\" in a one-child family. It's reported schools in many cities are rolling out measures to help students maintain their mental well-being.

Given the two facts above, what causes ice to form? (A). liquid. (B). Metling snow. (C). freezing. (D). water. (E). Condensation. (F). burning. (G). melting. (H). heat. Answer:","completion":"Answer: (C). Freezing. Ice is formed through the process of freezing, which is the transition of a substance from a liquid to a solid state as its temperature decreases. Fact 1 states that freezing causes a solid to form, and Fact 2 states that ice is a solid. Therefore, considering these facts, we can infer that the cause of ice formation is freezing. It is essential to note that freezing occurs when a substance's molecules slow down enough due to a temperature drop that they can form a regular and stable structure. In the case of water, the freezing process happens at 0°C (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure. Let's briefly analyze the other options provided and explain why they are not the correct answer: (A). Liquid: A liquid is a state of matter, and while a liquid substance is a precursor to a solid when freezing occurs, it is not the cause of ice formation. (B). Melting snow: Melting snow is a result of a transition from a solid to a liquid state (melting), which is the opposite of freezing, thus cannot cause ice formation. (D). Water: Water is the substance that freezes to form ice. While it is essential for ice formation, it is not the cause. The cause is the freezing of water. (E). Condensation: Condensation is the process of transforming a gas into a liquid when it comes into contact with a cooler surface. Although this process can transform water vapor into liquid water, it does not cause ice to form directly. (F). Burning: Burning is a chemical reaction that generates heat and is not related to the formation of ice. (G). Melting: Melting is the process of turning a solid substance into a liquid state due to temperature increase and is the opposite of freezing, thus cannot cause ice formation. (H). Heat: Heat is the transfer of thermal energy and is not responsible for causing ice to form. In fact, heat causes the opposite effect (melting) in the case of ice. Freezing is the process caused by the removal or reduction of thermal energy. In conclusion, given Fact 1 and Fact 2, the correct answer is (C). Freezing is the process responsible for causing ice to form as it transforms water from its liquid state to solid state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The number of women in positions of power in the UK has plummeted causing a damaging effects on our country's social, cultural and political life, an influential new report has claimed today. Researchers found female representation at senior levels of the judiciary, education, the arts, finance, the civil service and Government has gone into reverse. The evidence is presented in a report by Counting Women. In, a coalition of five organisations including the Fawcett Society and. the Hansard Society. Home Secretary Theresa May is one of a dwindling number of women in top jobs, according to a new report. In politics, the report finds that Britain has rapidly fallen down the international league tables for female democratic representation since Gordon Brown left power. The former Labour Prime Minister had eight female cabinet ministers and there were 31 women in government. Women now make up only 22.5 per cent of MPs; 12.3 per cent of council leaders (in England); and 17.4 per cent of the cabinet, the report says. The study found Britain fell 37 places through the noughties, from 33rd place in 2001, to joint 60th in 2010. In western governments, only Ireland and Italy had fewer female representatives in 2010. The Sex and Power 2013: Who Runs Britain? report, to be published tomorrow, found a similar trend at senior levels in the judiciary, education, the arts, finance, the civil service, the City and media. The group was created after the 2010 general election to create annual reports modelled on the audits of public life that were published by the now defunct Equal Opportunities Commission. Women are increasingly under-represented in the judiciary, according to Counting Women In. Nan Sloane, director of the Centre. for Women and Democracy said: 'This report shows a shocking absence of. women from powerful roles in Britain. 'We are often told that it's just a. matter of time before we have equality, but we have already waited for. generations; asking us to wait still more will change nothing, and the. quality of decision-making in our democracy and public life will suffer. as a result. 'There needs to be meaningful action now if next year's report is to show real progress.' Only a third of public appointments are female, as are 15.6 per cent of high court judges and five per cent of editors of national daily newspapers. In many areas, progress has shifted into reverse, such as in the devolved regional political bodies, where fewer women have been returned at recent elections. Katie Ghose, chief executive of the. Electoral Reform Society said: 'These missing women offer the most vivid. illustration of parliament's failure to keep up with the times. While women are well represented in the teaching profession, the report says they are not at the upper echelons of the education sector. 'Politicians will struggle to connect. with voters as long as the combined talents and perspectives of half. the population are shut out. Party leaders admit there's a problem, but. all have failed to find a lasting solution. 'It's not a good look for the Mother. of all Parliaments to be left lagging behind on the fundamental issue of. women's representation.' In Wales, the percentage of women elected has dropped from 50 per cent in 2004 to 40 per cent last year; in Scotland, the figure has dropped from 39.5 per cent to 34.9 per cent in the same time. In a handful of other areas, progress has been made in the past decade, but with a long way still to go. Women now lead three in ten trade unions and membership is 50-50. Ceri Goddard, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: 'It's simply scandalous fact that in 2013 men still outnumber women four to one in parliament. If political parties don't take urgent action, Britain will continue to fall down the global league table when it comes to women's access to power and representation in politics. 'The number of women in the Cabinet is at a ten year low. Failure to increase the number of women around the top table of politics sends a message to other walks of life and to the next generation for whom we hope for something different, that excluding women from positions of power is acceptable. 'Women's votes will determine the next election – remaining male dominated won't help the parties on polling day' Ruth Fox, chief executive of the Hansard Society said: 'Parliament needs to show leadership in reflecting the people it governs and serves. 'Decisions made in Parliament affect women and men equally and the dearth of women in positions of political power not only reflects badly on the quality of our democracy, it also wastes the skill, expertise and life experience of half the population and sets a terrible example for other professions and industries. 'It's time for Parliament and political parties to take concrete steps to increase the number of women in politics.' Alex Runswick, deputy director of Unlock Democracy, said: 'The lack of female involvement in UK politics is a canary in the mining shaft; it is a particularly visible example of how the system fails to represent people more widely. 'Our democracy and public life is weaker because it misses the skills experience and talents of over half the population. It is not enough to recognise the problem and simply hope that things will improve; we need Parliament and politicians to take urgent action.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"- The number of women in positions of power in the UK has decreased, impacting the country's social, cultural, and political life. - Female representation at senior levels in various sectors, including judiciary, education, arts, finance, civil service, and government, has diminished, according to a report by Counting Women In. - In politics, the UK has fallen down the international league tables for female democratic representation; women make up only 22.5% of MPs, 12.3% of council leaders, and 17.4% of the cabinet. - Some progress has been made in other areas, such as trade unions where women now lead three out of ten. - Advocates call for concrete steps from Parliament and political parties to increase the number of women in politics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question 1: What are the differences between Jquery and JavaScript and SQL? Question 2: What is a difference between jQuery and JavaScript? OPTIONS: +no +yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"To answer both questions, let's first break down the differences between the mentioned technologies. Step 1: Define the technologies: - JavaScript: A programming language that is used for web development, commonly used for client-side applications to interact with users and manipulate website elements. - jQuery: A popular JavaScript library that simplifies the process of using JavaScript, making it more user-friendly for programmers to perform tasks such as DOM manipulation and event handling. - SQL: Structured Query Language, a standard language used for managing and operating databases, mainly for storing and retrieving data. Step 2: Compare the technologies: - JavaScript vs jQuery: jQuery is a subset of JavaScript, as it is a library built using JavaScript. The use of jQuery simplifies tasks that would require more complex JavaScript code. - JavaScript vs SQL: These are two different technologies. JavaScript is a programming language used for web development, while SQL is a language used for database management. - jQuery vs SQL: Similarly, jQuery is a JavaScript library used for web development, whereas SQL focuses on database management. Now, to answer the last part: Step 3: Analyze the questions: - Question 1: The question is asking for the differences between jQuery, JavaScript, and SQL. It requires understanding of all three technologies and comparisons between them. - Question 2: The question is specifically focused on the difference between jQuery and JavaScript. It requires understanding of just these two technologies and their comparison.

She arrives there late in the evening and meets Ben Wainwright, the lamplighter at Addisford. He asks her about herself and if she has any relatives in Addisford.

Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers. Question: \\"Was there a normal amount of passengers on United 99-33 on 9/11?\\" Answer: \\"all of the passengers booked first-class seats\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: OPT: -no -yes","completion":"-no The given answer is incorrect because it does not address the question about the number of passengers on United 93 on 9/11.

Do one enjoyable activity a day. Socialize with friends and family at least once a week.","completion":"Title: Enhancing Life Quality through Daily Mindfulness and Engagement Life is undeniably hectic, especially in today's fast-paced world where each day unfolds with its own share of challenges and stressful circumstances. The daily grind, if not handled properly, can leave you feeling overwhelmed and significantly contribute to health issues. However, the key to achieving a balanced life and optimal health might lie in the lesser-explored depths of our daily routine. It starts with simple steps like beginning your day with meditation, engaging in deep breathing exercises, indulging in an enjoyable activity daily, and socializing with loved ones at least once a week. Starting Your Day with Meditation Kickstarting your day with meditation is an astounding method to ground yourself, establish a link with your inner self, and set positive intentions for the day ahead. Known as the art of mindfulness, this ancient practice instills a sense of tranquility, fosters self-awareness, and equips you with the emotional resilience to face the day's hurdles with an unfazed mind. Apart from these psychological benefits, meditation has also been linked to various physical health benefits. It lowers blood pressure, improves cardiovascular health, enhances immune function, and slows the aging process at a cellular level. Moreover, it can stimulate the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which are essential for maintaining mental wellbeing. Deep Breathing Exercises Deep breathing exercises are not only simple and easy to practice but also, they form a cornerstone in the management of stress and anxiety. This is because, during deep, controlled breathing, the message sent to the brain is to calm down and relax. The brain, subsequently, passes this information to the body, instigating a considerable reduction in stress levels, heart rate, and blood pressure. The beauty of deep breathing lies in its accessibility – it can be done anywhere, anytime without any need for special equipment or skills. Simply dedicating a few minutes daily to focus on your breath can greatly contribute to mental clarity, emotional balance, and overall wellness. Indulging in One Enjoyable Activity Daily The key to a healthy mind and body isn't just about diet, exercise, and adequate sleep. Indulging in activities that bring joy and happiness is equally important. The very act of immersing yourself in something you love can be profoundly therapeutic and relaxing. It could be a simple morning walk, painting, reading a good book, cooking a favorite dish, gardening, or even listening to a captivating podcast. Incorporating an enjoyable activity into your daily routine not only breaks the monotony but also acts as a powerful antidote to stress, enriches your life with satisfaction, and boosts your overall sense of wellbeing. It has been consistently found that people who make time for hobbies and leisure activities generally exhibit a lower risk of depression and burnout. Socializing with Friends and Family Human beings are inherently social creatures. We thrive on connections and relationships. In fact, several research studies have found a strong link between social interaction and mental health. This implies that maintaining relationships and spending quality time with friends and family can significantly improve your mental wellbeing. To derive the maximum benefits from social interaction, aim to spend quality time with your loved ones at least once a week. This is not about quantity but quality. It could mean having a heart-to-heart conversation with your best friend, a fun outing with family, or a virtual catch-up call with an old comrade. In conclusion, pivoting towards a balanced and healthier lifestyle needs a holistic approach, including personal self-care routines and healthy social interaction. Starting your day with meditation, practicing deep breathing exercises, engaging in enjoyable activities daily, and maintaining social connections, can act as a strong foundation in building your mental resilience and overall health. It's these seemingly simple activities that can transform your life, paving the path towards a more content, peaceful, and healthier you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: (2013*,D)When asked about happiness,we usually think of something extraordinary,an absolute delight,which seems to get rarer the older we get. For kids,happiness has a magical quality.Their delight at winning a race or getting a new bike is unreserved . In the teenage years the concept of happiness changes.Suddenly it's conditional on such things as excitement,love and popularity.I can still recall the excitement of being invited to dance with the most attractive boy at the school party. In adulthood the things that bring deep joy-love,marriage,birth-also bring responsibility and the risk of loss.For adults,happiness is complicated . My definition of happiness is \\"the capacity for enjoyment\\".The more we can enjoy what we have,the happier we are.It's easy to overlook the pleasure we get from the company of friends,the freedom to live where we please,and even good health. I experienced my little moments of pleasure yesterday.First I was overjoyed when I shut the last lunchbox and had the house to myself.Then I spent an uninterrupted morning writing,which I love.When the kids and my husband came home,I enjoyed their noise after the quiet of the day. Psychologists tell us that to be happy we need a mix of enjoyable leisure time and satisfying work.I don't think that my grandmother,who raised 14 children,had much of either.She did have a network of close friends and family,and maybe this is what satisfied her. We,however,with so many choices and such pressure to succeed in every area,have turned happiness into one more thing we've got to have.We're so selfconscious about our \\"right\\" to it that it's making us miserable.So we chase it and equal it with wealth and success,without noticing that the people who have those things aren't necessarily happier. Happiness isn't about what happens to us-it's about how we see what happens to us.It's the skillful way of finding a positive for every negative.It's not wishing for what we don't have,but enjoying what we do possess.

Write highlights for this article: (CNN)California has reported more measles cases. The number of cases has increased to 73, with 50 of those cases linked to an outbreak at Disneyland, the California Department of Public Health reported Monday. Last week, public health officials reported 59 cases since December; 42 with a Disney connection. In addition, 13 cases linked to the outbreak have been reported in six other U.S. states: five in Arizona, three in Utah, two in Washington, and one each in Nebraska, Oregon and Colorado. Also, one case linked to it has been reported in Mexico. The disease outbreak apparently surfaced when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park from December 15 to December 20. At least five Disney employees have been diagnosed with measles, Disney said. Measles is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat, the CDC said. Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director of the state's Center for Infectious Diseases, recommended that children under 12 months and people who've never had a measles vaccination stay away from the park while the disease event continues. He made the same recommendation for other places where large numbers of people congregate, such as airports and shopping malls. However, Chavez said Disneyland would be \\"perfectly safe\\" if you've been immunized. Opinion: Heed the lesson from Disneyland measles outbreak. When asked for a comment, Suzi Brown of Disney media relations said, \\"We agree with Dr. Chavez's comments that it is safe to visit Disneyland if you have been vaccinated.\\" For the most part, measles spreads among those who have not been vaccinated against the virus. The California Department of Public Health said Orange County had the most measles cases, with 23, followed by San Diego County, with 13. 5 things to know about measles.

He is also known for \\"Teitlebaum's Window\\" (1970), a comic novel about a Jewish boy growing up in Brooklyn in the 1930s and 1940s. Markfield was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1965 after the publication of \\"To an Early Grave\\". - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Herbert Sargent ( July 15 , 1923 -- May 6 , 2005 ) was an American television writer , a producer for such comedy shows as The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live , and a screenwriter ( Bye Bye Braverman ) . During his tenure at Saturday Night Live , he and Chevy Chase created Weekend Update , the longest - running sketch in the show 's history , and one of the longest running sketches on television . - A television set, more commonly called a television, TV, TV set, television receiver, or telly, is a device that combines a tuner, display, and loudspeakers for the purpose of viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax, VHS and later DVD. It was also the display device for the first generation of home computers (e.g., Timex Sinclair 1000) and video game consoles (e.g., Atari) in the 1980s. In the 2010s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays, especially LED-backlit LCDs, largely replaced cathode ray tubes and other displays. - NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. Originally known as \\"SunDew\\", its primary authors were James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal. The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple \\"contexts\\" to support windows. Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI. - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912 January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century. - Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called \\"sketches\\", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy. - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based. - Laughter is a physical reaction in humans and some other species of primate, consisting typically of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation. - Live television is a television production broadcast in real-time, as events happen, in the present. Shows broadcast live include newscasts, morning shows, awards shows, sports programs, and, occasionally, episodes of television series. Live television was more common until the late 1950s, when videotape technology was invented. Because of the prohibitive cost, adoption was slow, and some television show remained live until the 1970s, such as soap operas. To prevent unforeseen issues, live television programs may be delayed, which allows censors to edit the program. Some programs may be broadcast live in certain time zones and delayed in others. - Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising. - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show). - A variety show, also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, is entertainment made up of a variety of acts (hence the name), especially musical performances and sketch comedy, and is normally introduced by a compère (master of ceremonies) or host. Other types of acts include magic, animal and circus acts, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism. The variety format made its way from Victorian era stage to radio to television. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from its early days (late 1940s) into the 1980s. - Lorne Michaels (born Lorne Lipowitz; November 17, 1944) is a Canadian-American television producer, writer, comedian, and actor, best known for creating and producing \\"Saturday Night Live\\", and producing the \\"Late Night\\" series (since 1993), and \\"The Tonight Show\\" (since 2014). - The Colbert Report is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes.

Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News' \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\". \\"The Colbert Report\\" is a spin-off of Comedy Central's \\"The Daily Show\\", where he acted as a correspondent for the program for several years while developing the character. - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over . - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - The Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show currently broadcast from the Rockefeller Center in New York City (and previously from various studios in the Los Angeles region) and airing on NBC since 1954. It is the world's longest-running talk show, and the longest running, regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows \\"Today\\" and \\"Meet the Press\\". - A late-night talk show is a genre of talk show popular in the US, structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances. The late-night talk show format was popularized, though not invented, by Johnny Carson with \\"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\\" on NBC. Typically the show's host conducts interviews from behind a desk, while the guest is seated on a couch. Many late night talk shows feature a house band which generally performs cover songs for the studio audience during commercial breaks and occasionally will back up a guest artist. - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden. - A cold open (also called a teaser) in a television program or movie is the technique of jumping directly into a story at the beginning or opening of the show before the title sequence or opening credits are shown. On television, this is often done on the theory that involving the audience in the plot as soon as possible will reduce the likelihood of their switching away from a show during the opening commercial. A cold open may summarize events in previous episodes or storylines that will be revisited during the current episode. - The Daily Show is an American news satire and late-night talk show television program hosted by Trevor Noah. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. Describing itself as a fake news program, \\"The Daily Show\\" draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humor as well. - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\". - In theatre (especially in the illusionistic Western tradition), breaking character occurs when an actor ceases to maintain the illusion that they are identical with the character they are portraying. If the breaking of character is particularly serious, it is considered corpsing, which in film or television would normally result in an abandonment of that take. - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay. - In theatre, a monologue (from , from \\"mónos\\", \\"alone, solitary\\" and \\"lógos\\", \\"speech\\") is a speech presented by a single character, most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the audience. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices. - Duncan \\"Dick\\" Ebersol (born July 28, 1947) is an American television executive and a senior adviser for NBC Universal Sports & Olympics. He had previously been the chairman of NBC Sports, producing large scale television events such as the Olympic Games and National Football League broadcasts. - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered in the Comcast Building (formerly known as the GE Building) at Rockefeller Center in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and soon in Philadelphia at Comcast Innovation and Technology Center. The network is part of the Big Three television networks. NBC is sometimes referred to as the \\"Peacock Network\\", in reference to its stylized peacock logo, which was originally created in 1956 for its then-new color broadcasts and became the network's official emblem in 1979. - Weekend Update is a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch that comments on and parodies . It is the show's longest-running recurring sketch, having been on since the show's first broadcast, and is typically presented in the middle of the show immediately after the first musical performance. One or two of the players are cast in the role of news anchor, presenting gag news items based on and acting as hosts for occasional editorials, commentaries, or other performances by other cast members or guests. Chevy Chase has credited Weekend Update, which he started as anchor in 1975, for paving the way for comedic news shows like \\"The Daily Show\\" and \\"The Colbert Report\\". - Cornelius Crane \\"Chevy\\" Chase (born October 8, 1943) is an American actor, comedian, writer and producer. Born into a prominent New York family, he worked a plethora of strange jobs before moving into comedy and began acting with \\"National Lampoon\\". He immediately became a key cast member in the debut season of \\"Saturday Night Live\\", where his recurring \\"Weekend Update\\" segment soon became a staple of the show. - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts such as songwriter but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. - Meet the Press is a weekly American television news/interview program that is broadcast on NBC. It is the longest-running program in U.S. television history, though its current format bears little resemblance to the one it debuted with on November 6, 1947. Like similar shows that have followed it, \\"Meet the Press\\" specializes in interviews with national leaders on issues of politics, economics, foreign policy and other public affairs, along with panel discussions that provide opinions and analysis. It originates from NBC's Washington, D.C. studios. - Monochrome describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or values of one color. A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues. Images using only shades of grey (with or without black or white) are called grayscale or black-and-white.

He was nominated for the Academy Award as Best Director for \\"12 Angry Men\\" (1957), \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" (1975), \\"Network\\" (1976) and \\"The Verdict\\" (1982). He did not win an individual Academy Award, but he did receive an Academy Honorary Award and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as \\"Network\\", which was nominated for ten, winning four. - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - Rockefeller Center is a large complex consisting of 19 highrise commercial buildings covering between 48th and 51st Streets in New York City. Commissioned by the Rockefeller family, it is located in the center of Midtown Manhattan, spanning the area between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection. - Bye Bye Braverman is a 1968 American comedy film directed by Sidney Lumet. The screenplay by Herbert Sargent was adapted from the 1964 novel \\"To an Early Grave\\" by Wallace Markfield. - A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh. This might be through jokes or amusing situations, or acting a fool, as in slapstick, or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comic. - Saturday Night Live (abbreviated as SNL) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\", properly beginning the show. - Screenwriting, also called scriptwriting, is the art and craft of writing scripts for mass media such as feature films, television productions or video games. It is frequently a freelance profession. - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.

While tensions within the band had been growing for some time, the official announcement of their breakup came on April 10, 1970, when Paul McCartney issued a press release stating his departure from the group. This marked the end of The Beatles as a cohesive musical unit. The band's disintegration should be understood within the context of both personal and professional conflicts that had started to intensify in the late 1960s. Some key factors that contributed to their eventual split include: 1. Growing Creative Differences: As the four members of The Beatles developed as musicians and songwriters, their stylistic preferences began to diverge. This led to disagreements over creative directions as well as disparities in the quality and quantity of songwriting contributions from each member. 2. Financial Disputes: The Beatles experienced financial disputes throughout their career, mainly due to the mismanagement of their finances by their business manager, Allen Klein. Paul McCartney was particularly disdainful of Klein's practices, leading to further rifts within the group. 3. Personal Relationships: John Lennon's relationship with Yoko Ono and her constant presence during recordings created tension in the studio, as the other members felt that she was intruding into the creative dynamics of the band. Lennon's growing disinterest in The Beatles and increasing dependency on Yoko Ono contributed to the group's dissolution. Additionally, each of the Beatles had begun to form their own romantic relationships, families, and individual lives that pulled them apart from the tight-knit group they had been. 4. The Beatles' Manager, Brian Epstein's Death: Brian Epstein, who many called the \\"fifth Beatle,\\" had been instrumental in managing the band's careers since their early days. His death in 1967 left the band without a unifying figure who could mediate disputes and manage their professional affairs. 5. Pursuit of Solo Careers: As The Beatles' individual members explored their respective musical interests and began to establish their own careers outside of the group - George Harrison with the “Concert for Bangladesh,” John Lennon's collaborations with Yoko Ono and his solo albums, Paul McCartney’s efforts with Linda McCartney and the formation of Wings, and Ringo Starr's foray into acting and solo recording projects - the group's dynamic changed irreparably, hastening their demise. The Beatles' official split in 1970 marked the end of an era, but their influence on music and popular culture remains undeniable to this day. Their iconic body of work continues to inspire musicians and shape the landscape of the music industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: who doesn't believe Catherine? Movie plot title: Proof Movie plot: The movie opens with Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) talking to her father Robert (Anthony Hopkins) after he startles her watching TV in the middle of the night. He gives her a bottle of champagne for her birthday, which she starts drinking from the bottle, commenting on how bad it is. They chat for a while about the nature of insanity and how he is crazy, but then she challenges his admission that he is crazy, pointing out that he had just admitted that the nature of insanity is that you can't acknowledge your own insanity. He reminds her that he's not just crazy he died last week and his funeral is tomorrow.Awoken from this dream, Catherine realizes that there is someone still upstairs -- Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), a former student of Robert's. Robert was a professor in the University of Chicago's math department and Hal is a fledgling mathematician, struggling to advance in the field with any sort of developments of his own. In his younger years, Robert had made many advances in mathematics, revolutionizing the field twice before 22, and is quite famous and well regarded for it, but struggled with mental illness for the last 20+ years of his life.Catherine asks him why he is still there and he confesses that he thinks that somewhere in Robert's books of notes there has to be additional products of his mathematical genius. Catherine asks him what there has been in the notes he's made it through. Hal confirms that it was gibberish, but tells her that it would make a career for someone to find even a fraction of the advances Robert made in his early to mid twenties. She asks if he is trying to steal her father's work, and he says that, no, he would credit the discovery to her father.

Write the next sentence. The teacher cannot hear the bell ring because of the noise from the class. The Choose from: [1]. bell is loud.. [2]. noise is loud.. Answer:","completion":"The noise is loud, drowning out even the usually distinct, reverberating chime of the bell which signified the end of one lesson and the transition to another. In this cacophony of chatter, laughter, and the occasional screeching of a chair, the teacher struggles to maintain order and take back control of the classroom while her voice competes with the amplified chaos. Like a conductor attempting to direct an unruly orchestra, she uses her body gestures, facial expressions, and eventually, a stern glance to assert her authority over the students and gradually bring the noise levels down to a manageable hum. As quiet returns, the teacher returns to her task of ensuring the smooth flow of education within the walls of her classroom. With a mixture of patience, firmness, and tact, she expertly navigates the complexities of the learning environment, steering her students' minds and hearts toward knowledge, understanding, and mutual respect. The bell, now a distant memory in the teacher's mind, had served its purpose - not as a reminder that her daycare is over, but as a marker of the ebb and flow of time within the sacred space of learning. She takes a moment to reflect on the challenges that come with her profession, the myriad emotions, the constant influx of students bringing new ideas, attitudes, and backgrounds. She admits that it's not an easy journey, but she wouldn't have it any other way. The noise, whether loud or subtle, is but a representation of the minds that are brewing within the classroom, and their collective sound is the embodiment of the vivacity and potential her students possess. The teacher sees these challenges as nothing but a testament to her purpose: to nurture and guide these young minds and help them traverse the path of learning, growth, and self-discovery. One might say that the noise in the classroom is both an obstacle and a reminder that learning is a continuous process, filled with distractions and disruptions. However, both the beginnings and endings of each lesson marked by the bell are part of a rhythmic dance between teacher and students that she contributes to the shared symphony of education. In the end, though the noise is loud, the teacher stands firm, embracing her role as a beacon of stability and hope for her students. And as each day unfolds with its unique blend of lessons, laughter, and challenges, she knows that her calling goes beyond merely hearing the bell—it lies in orchestrating the beautiful crescendos and decrescendos that define the journey of teaching and learning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The prank unfolded, and the character found himself caught in the middle, with his emotions heightening due to the sense of confusion, fear, or even annoyance. As a result, his heart rate escalated, and his breathing became more labored, evident by his panting. 5. Rin, a fellow member of the group and potentially involved in the prank, was also present at the scene. Yet, because Rin may have not fully comprehended the gravity or potential consequences of the prank, he/she struggled to figure out how to stop or mitigate the situation. 6. Sensing Rin's uncertainty and being overwhelmed by the intensity of the prank, the character could no longer contain his emotions. He yelled out, exclaiming that this was not funny and demanded that their actions must be stopped immediately. Rin, now feeling a mix of guilt and anxiety due to the adverse reaction they caused, stuttered in their response, realizing that the prank had gone too far. The events leading up to the character's yelling depict a practical joke that spiraled out of control, leaving the victims in distress and the pranksters scrambling to remedy the situation. The consequences of this ill-conceived prank could potentially strain relationships among the group, teaching them all a valuable lesson about the limits of humor and the importance of considering the feelings of others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write the answer: Which US state is known as the ‘Beaver State?","completion":"The U.S. state known as the 'Beaver State' is Oregon. Located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, Oregon has adopted this nickname due to the beaver's historical significance and contribution to the state's growth, development, and economy. The beaver population in Oregon was once exceedingly abundant, and they played a vital role in shaping the region's landscape. Possessing natural instincts for creating dams, beavers helped create ecosystems that sustained various plant and animal species. They also helped prevent flooding, control erosion, and improve water quality in rivers and streams. Despite their ecological importance, however, beavers were mainly valued for their pelts. In the early 19th century, Euro-American trappers and traders started to explore Oregon and other western regions in search of furs. Beaver pelts were highly sought-after because they could be used to make high-quality, waterproof hats, a popular fashion item during that time. The rich beaver population in Oregon, combined with the great demand for beaver pelts in the international market, fueled the local fur trade and brought numerous pioneering trappers, traders, and settlers to the region. Oregon's beaver-fueled fur trade played a critical role in its eventual settlement and development. Companies like the Pacific Fur Company and the North West Company established trading posts in Oregon, which subsequently became important centers for economic and social interactions between traders, trappers, and Indigenous peoples. Additionally, routes established by trappers later served as primary trails for thousands of pioneers during the famous Oregon Trail migration in the mid-1800s. Due to its significance, the beaver became the official state animal of Oregon in 1969. Today, the beaver appears on the state flag as a symbol of Oregon's rich history and the animal's contributions to the region's development. Moreover, efforts to protect, conserve, and reintroduce beavers are underway to ensure that this keystone species continues to fulfill its essential ecological functions within Oregon's diverse landscapes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: England opener Alex Hales will join his side on their tour of the West Indies after recovering from a hand fracture.","completion":"Title: Alex Hales Returns to England Squad for West Indies Tour After Recovering from Hand Fracture Introduction: England cricket fans received a boost as news broke out that opener Alex Hales has recovered from a hand fracture and will be joining the team for their tour of the West Indies. The talented opening batsman, known for his aggressive stroke play, will be a welcome addition to the team as they navigate the challenges of the Caribbean tour. The Injury and Recovery: Alex Hales sustained the hand fracture during the One-Day International (ODI) series in India, where he took a difficult outfield catch. The injury forced him to miss the remaining games of that series and the subsequent T20I series in India as well. Despite being ruled out of those games, Hales remained upbeat and focused on his recovery, hoping to make a comeback in the West Indies tour. The right-handed batsman went through an intensive rehabilitation program over the past few months, working closely with doctors, physiotherapists, and trainers to regain full fitness. His dedication to his recovery was evident as he was seen posting updates on his progress through his social media channels, sharing pictures of him performing hand exercises and training at the gym. The Significance of Hales' Return: The return of Alex Hales to the England squad cannot be undermined, as the aggressive opener has proven time and again to be a match-winner. His explosive batting style often provides the team with an initial surge of momentum that lays a strong foundation for the rest of the innings. Both in ODIs and T20Is, Hales has consistently delivered whenever called upon. His partnership with fellow opener Jason Roy has been particularly fruitful, with the duo sharing several record-breaking partnerships across different formats. Their understanding at the crease and ability to complement each other's batting style has often proven to be a winning formula for England. The West Indies tour, consisting of three ODIs and three T20Is, will be crucial for the England team as they aim to build momentum ahead of the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup. Hales' inclusion in the side will undoubtedly bolster the team's chances, as they look to dominate the shorter formats of the game. Challenges Ahead: While Hales' recovery and return to the team are certainly positive news, it is important to note that the West Indies tour will pose several challenges for him and the entire squad. The Caribbean conditions can be a testing ground for visiting teams – unfamiliar pitches, different weather, and unique styles of play make acclimatization a key factor in determining success. England's recent performances suggest that the team is well equipped to tackle these challenges, with several players in good form. The addition of Hales into the mix will strengthen their batting line-up, but the team will need to gel quickly and adapt to the conditions in order to get the best results. Furthermore, the West Indies team, although not in their best form, still possesses a plethora of talented players that can threaten any opposition on their day. The England squad will need to be wary of the threat posed by the home side, and approach each game with the right mindset to maintain their winning momentum. Conclusion: Alex Hales' return to the England team for their tour of the West Indies is a much-needed boost for the side and their fans. The dynamic opening batsman will play a vital role in the team's success during the tour, as they face the West Indies in both ODI and T20I series. If Hales can quickly adapt to the Caribbean conditions, his presence at the top of the order will add a powerful punch to England's batting arsenal, increasing their chances of dominating the shorter formats of the game and paving their way to success in the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: how latin america has changed us culture I found the following answer on Google: Original elements also play a strong role, such as the invention of Jeffersonian democracy .

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the Kinks member that released solo work in the 1980's? from the following article ? Following the termination of their contract with RCA, the Kinks signed with Arista Records in 1976. With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \\"Father Christmas\\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist Ian Gibbons was recruited for the subsequent tour, and became a permanent member of the group. Despite the personnel changes, the popularity of the band's records and live shows continued to grow. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands such as the Jam (\\"David Watts\\"), the Pretenders (\\"Stop Your Sobbing\\", \\"I Go to Sleep\\") and the Knack (\\"The Hard Way\\") recorded covers of Kinks songs, which helped bring attention to the group's new releases. In 1978, Van Halen covered \\"You Really Got Me\\" for their debut single, a Top 40 US hit, helping boost the band's commercial resurgence (Van Halen...

The era began in the wake of the Permian–Triassic extinction event, the largest well-documented mass extinction in Earth's history, and ended with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, another mass extinction which is known for having killed off non-avian dinosaurs, as well as other plant and animal species. The Mesozoic was a time of significant tectonic, climate and evolutionary activity. The era witnessed the gradual rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea into separate landmasses that would eventually move into their current positions. The climate of the Mesozoic was varied, alternating between warming and cooling periods. Overall, however, the Earth was hotter than it is today. Non-avian dinosaurs appeared in the Late Triassic and became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates early in the Jurassic, occupying this position for about 135 million years until their demise at the end of the Cretaceous. Birds first appeared in the Jurassic, having evolved from a branch of theropod dinosaurs. The first mammals also appeared during the Mesozoic, but would remain small—less than 15 kg (33 lb)—until the Cenozoic.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Robert Montgomery Knight (born October 25, 1940) is a retired American basketball coach. Nicknamed \\"The General\\", Knight won 902 NCAA Division I men's college basketball games, the most all-time at the time of his retirement and currently third all-time, behind his former player and assistant coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke University, and Jim Boeheim of Syracuse University. Knight is best known as the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers from 1971 to 2000. On March 14, 2000 (just before Indiana was to begin play in the NCAA tournament), the CNN Sports Illustrated network ran a piece on Knight in which former player Neil Reed claimed he had been choked by Knight during a 1997 practice. Knight denied the claims in the story. However, less than a month later, the network aired a tape of an Indiana practice from 1997 that appeared to show Knight placing his hand on the neck of Reed. In response, Indiana University president Myles Brand announced that he had adopted a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy with regard to Knight's behavior. Later in the year, in September 2000, Indiana freshman Kent Harvey reportedly said, \\"Hey, Knight, what's up?\\" to Knight. According to Harvey, Knight then grabbed him by the arm and lectured him for not showing him respect, insisting that Harvey address him as either \\"Mr. Knight\\" or \\"Coach Knight\\" instead of simply \\"Knight.\\" Brand stated that this incident was only one of numerous complaints that occurred after the zero-tolerance policy had been put into place. Brand asked Knight to resign on September 10, and when Knight refused, Brand relieved him of his coaching duties effective immediately. Knight's dismissal was met with outrage from students. That night, thousands of Indiana students marched from Indiana University's Assembly Hall to Brand's home, burning Brand in effigy. Harvey was supported by some and vilified by many who claim he had intentionally set up Knight. Kent Harvey's stepfather, Mark Shaw, was a former Bloomington-area radio talk show host and Knight critic. On September 13, Knight said goodbye to a crowd of some 6,000 supporters in Dunn Meadow at Indiana University. He asked that they not hold a grudge against Harvey and that they continue to support the basketball team. Knight's firing made national headlines, including the cover of Sports Illustrated and around the clock coverage on ESPN.

He coached a college team called the Indiana Hoosiers for many years and won a lot of games. One day, a video was shown of him putting his hand on a player's neck, which made people upset. The people in charge said he had to be very well behaved from then on, but later, there was another problem with a student, and they asked him to leave his job as a coach. Many students were not happy about this and showed their support for him. Knight said goodbye to his fans and asked them to keep supporting the basketball team and not to be mad at the student who reported the incident.
