Here are the options: Select from the following. * yes. * it is not possible to tell. * no. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the given premise and hypothesis, it is possible to provide an analysis and evaluate the likelihood of the hypothesis being true if the premise is true. Let's break down each component before providing a detailed answer. Premise: The same kind of thing The premise states that there is a situation, object, or event that is of the same type or category as another. It implies similarities or shared characteristics between the two entities being compared. This premise alone, however, does not provide enough information to determine specific details or nuances that might be relevant to assessing the veracity of the hypothesis. Hypothesis: It is the same kind of thing, so you should be used to it. The hypothesis suggests that because the situation, object, or event is the same kind of thing, one should be accustomed or familiar with it. This implies that past experiences with similar entities should have prepared someone for dealing with the current one. Options: 1. Yes 2. It is not possible to tell 3. No To determine whether the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, let's consider each option: 1. Yes If the premise \\"the same kind of thing\\" is true, it would make sense that the hypothesis suggesting that one should be used to it might also be true. This is because past experiences and encounters with similar entities might have allowed someone to develop a familiarity or comfort level in dealing with them. However, there are still factors that could possibly affect this conclusion, such as the individual's personal experiences, memory retention, or the specific context of the situation. 2. It is not possible to tell Considering that the premise alone offers limited information about the specific attributes or context of the entity being referred to, it might be challenging to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true. While there might be a possibility that one should be used to it based on past experiences, other factors could impact this, such as variations within the same category, differences in context, or the possibility of anomalies. 3. No Although the hypothesis suggests that one should be used to the situation, object, or event since it is \\"the same kind of thing,\\" the premise alone does not guarantee this result. For instance, individuals may have different learning trajectories or personal experiences that affect their familiarity with the entity in question. Moreover, there could be specific aspects or nuances of the current entity that diverge from previous encounters. Conclusion: Taking into account the available information, it is not possible to tell with certainty that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. While it might be likely that one could be used to a situation, object, or event if it falls under the same category as prior experiences, external factors and individual variances could impact this outcome. It is essential to gather more context and details on the specific entity in question to make a more definitive evaluation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Can we infer the following? Gladys Leslie had many roles. Select from: (a). Yes (b). It's impossible to say (c). No The answer is:","completion":"(a). Yes Gladys Leslie, born on March 5, 1899, was an American actress who became active in the silent film era during the 1910s and 1920s. While she may not have been as well-known as some of her contemporaries like Mary Pickford, her acting career boasted a number of starring roles between 1917 and the early 1920s. As one of the young female stars of her day, it is clear that Gladys Leslie had many roles during her time in the film industry. Leslie's career began when she was just 18 years old, with her first film appearance in \\"The Candy Girl\\" (1917). This marked the beginning of her transition from stage to screen, and over the following years, Leslie starred in numerous silent films. Some of her most notable performances include roles in \\"A Morning Adventure\\" (1917), \\"The Girl and the Crisis\\" (1918), \\"The Chorus Girl’s Romance\\" (1920), and \\"Captain Swift\\" (1920). Gladys Leslie worked with several influential directors of the silent film era, such as Charles Brabin and George Irving. She was also highly praised by film critics for her natural acting ability and captivating screen presence. Despite her successes, Leslie's career started to wane with the introduction of sound in films. Struggling to make the transition to \\"talkies,\\" she made her final on-screen appearance in the 1925 film \\"The Girl of Gold.\\" After her retirement from acting, she led a private life and passed away on October 2, 1976.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please briefly summarize this news article: A Pre-Thanksgiving Ritual: Cocktails, Catch-Ups and Maybe a Kiss There was a short line outside the Stumble Inn on 76th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan on Wednesday night. Women decked out in what seemed to be matching puffy coats huddled together under the bar’s overhang. Men wore Uniqlo flannel. There was an excited energy in the air, but it was not holiday spirit. It was the hope, perhaps, that before the clock would strike 4 a.m. and the Prince Charmings and Cinderellas would have to retreat home in cabs for turkey and pumpkin pie, they might ring in the holiday season with a night of debauchery and unapologetic fun. And by the way, if you thought that the first snowstorm of the year would keep young 20-somethings away from the bars on what is infamously referred to as the most insane party night of the year, you thought wrong. So wrong. Inside, Justin Timberlake’s “Sexy Back” played loudly, and Shamar, the doorman, inspected IDs (but gave only his first name for privacy reasons). He has been working this job for three years, so he believes he is pretty good at judging the scene. The night before Thanksgiving usually turns out a similar size crowd as a regular Friday or Saturday, he said, but the energy is better. “Everyone just wants to be merry tonight,” he said of the crowd. Merry they were. Packets of friends monopolized dark brown leather booths, a group of eight guys threw back shots of tequila by the beer pong table, two girlfriends shrieked and embraced upon seeing each other for the first time in months. Tabs were opened and kept open. ’Twas the night before Thanksgiving. Once again, it was a big bar night around the country for the post-collegiate and barely legal set — traveling to their hometowns for the holiday. For some, it was about finding an hourslong romance in a crowded bar of strangers. For others, the lure was striding into that one place that used to deny them entry when they were underage and seeing everyone they grew up with and having, finally, a compelling answer to the questions of “What are you up to these days?” For all, it was about the possibility of a tipsy, consequence-free kiss. By Thursday, these same revelers would be kicking back with relatives, avoiding conversations about politics and religion, wondering if crazy Aunt Judy would again ask when they were going to finally settle down. (She’s not going to be around forever, you know, and she would like to see at least one of her nieces or nephews get married.) There would be food, family and football. But first would come flirting. Sitting at a corner of the mahogany bar were Wendy Dallis and Richie O’Mahoney. If you had only a minute to study them, you would think they were in a long-term relationship. Mr. O’Mahoney’s hand rested on Ms. Dallis’s leg. Now and again, she leaned in close to make a joke, then tilted her head back in wild laughter. They seemed blissfully unaware of any others. Turns out, they had only met two nights earlier. Ms. Dallis, a singer in the band Ferrari Truck, told the story of girl-meets-boy. Or in this case, bartender: Mr. O’Mahoney, 33, works at the Gael Pub, which is about 10 blocks from the Stumble Inn. She had wandered there last Monday night after having had a few drinks while singing downtown at the Mercury Lounge. “I told him I was hungry, and he gave me olives, and I told him he had to make sure I got home that night,” she said. “He texted me the next morning asking if I wanted to hang out.” Ms. Dallis told Mr. O’Mahoney she would meet him at the Stumble Inn on Wednesday night. From that perch, they discussed meeting up on Thanksgiving, too. As they focused on their new connection, a dozen or so fraternity brothers waxed about their old days at the University of Pennsylvania. Meeting up for Thanksgiving Eve drinks is their annual tradition, said Lionel Anderson, 32, of Philadelphia. He and a group of his Alpha Phi Alpha friends have dinner at Dallas BBQ on 73rd Street and Third Avenue, and walk a few blocks up to the Stumble Inn. Mr. Anderson, now the assistant director of academic research at Haverford College, said he is the only one of the brothers who doesn’t live in New York City. But this pre-Thanksgiving event is a priority for him: “I haven’t missed a Thanksgiving Eve night out since 2001.” He reminisced about the years when they were younger and a little more carefree, he said, adding that those nights were crazier. Now, he said, “it’s about catching up with old friends over a drink or two, and getting nostalgic for our college days.” By now, R. Kelly’s “Ignition (Remix)” had begun to play. The song is an anthem of sorts for anyone who was in high school or college in the early aughts (which, on Wednesday night was most everyone). One young woman stood on her chair and started dancing and singing along, every lyric memorized. The crowd whooped in delight. A bit farther south on Second Avenue, a different crowd congregated at Turtle Bay, a renowned party bar not far from the Queensboro Bridge, it’s a favorite spot for those traveling from Long Island and New Jersey in search of a night of big-city fun. The scene at Turtle Bay was younger and a little rowdier. A steady rain and snow mix fell as a line zigged outside the door. Sean Paul’s 2005 hit “Get Busy” could be heard thumping from inside. The cover charge was 5 for women and 10 for men. The doorman granted entry at his leisure. A soggy pile of umbrellas accumulated on the ground inside. Hanging out by the bar, trying to catch the attention of the blond bartender were two buddies — Charles Gehnrich, a senior at SUNY Geneseo, and Steven Davies, a senior at Towson University in Maryland. The two 21-year-olds, childhood friends originally from Syosset, N.Y., were home for the holiday and ventured into the city for their first official “legal night out” on Thanksgiving Eve. They had chosen Turtle Bay because a friend of theirs had won a free happy hour for a small group. “I’m a broke college student!” Mr. Davies said, never diverting his eyes from one of the seven TV screens showing the Knicks game. “I’m just trying to get drunk, that’s it.” Then he looked away from the game, for just a moment. “But there should be more girls here,” he said. Indeed, Turtle Bay was heavy on the cheap drinks, including neon-colored tubes of alcohol being sold for 5 by an aggressive saleswoman who ported them about, cigarette-girl style. But the guy-to-gal ratio did not favor gentlemen looking to hook up with women. And the women who were there, weren’t digging the vibe. “This is so not my scene,” Trisha Barry, 24, yelled over the music. Her friend Kelsey Demsky, who would turn 24 at midnight, nodded her head in annoyed agreement. The women said they had been invited to the bar by a colleague at T. J. Maxx, who had told them he wanted to ring in Ms. Demsky’s birthday “the right way,” Ms. Demsky said, “whatever that means.” What they really wanted to do was head home to Brooklyn to prep for their Thanksgiving, which they would be spending Thursday afternoon together in their apartment in Bensonhurst. They did not want to drink too much. “We have to cook tomorrow,” Ms. Barry said. Back uptown at the Stumble Inn, Mr. O’Mahoney and Ms. Dallis grabbed their coats and prepared to leave together into the rainy night. It was a successful second date, they both said, and then Ms. Dallis hinted it might not yet be over. “We already kissed,” she said, grabbing his hand. “And I’m still here.” A version of this article appears in print on November 30, 2014, on page ST1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Night for Hookups.

Această situație poate crea provocări pentru întreprinderile care doresc să intre pe aceste piețe, cât și pentru autoritățile responsabile cu reglementarea piețelor de achiziții publice. Există mai multe motive pentru care accesul la piețele de achiziții publice ale țărilor terțe remain restricționate.

UE urmărește să faciliteze accesul pe piețele de achiziții publice ale țărilor terțe prin negocieri comerciale bilaterale și multilaterale. Aceste negocieri pot duce la încheierea unor acorduri comerciale care liberalizează piețele de achiziții publice și permit întreprinderilor din UE să participe într-un mod mai ușor și mai transparent la licitațiile publice din țările respective. Un exemplu în acest sens este Acordul privind Achizițiile Publice (GPA), care face parte din Organizația Mondială a Comerțului (WTO).

Pentru a aborda aceste provocări și pentru a sprijini întreprinderile în procesul de licitație, autoritățile din UE pot oferi asistență și resurse care să ajute la depășirea barierelor existente.

Living things need non-living matter as well as energy. What do you think matter is used for? One thing is to build bodies. They also need it to carry out the processes of life. Any non-living matter that living things need is called a nutrient. Carbon and nitrogen are examples of nutrients. Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. You can see how in Figure 3.11. Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms. The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots. The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants. The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers. When living things die, the cycle repeats.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Outside Spending Shows How Few of the House Races Are Competitive How small is the field of competitive House races? So narrow that just 25 contests account for 80 percent of all reported outside spending in the general election. The Cook Political Report rates 38 seats either as tossups or leaning toward one party or the other, but among groups operating outside the district like super PACs, the concentration is even tighter: Half of all independent spending reported to the Federal Election Commission for general election races has gone to just a dozen seats, with two apiece in Arizona and Illinois. Arizona’s First District, where the Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick faces the Republican Andy Tobin, has drawn more than 10 million in outside spending, almost all of it for negative messages against the two candidates. (It is not the most outside money ever reported in a House race — that distinction goes to Michigan’s Seventh District in 2010, when 12.4 million was spent.) Close behind is California’s Seventh District, where a freshman Democrat, Ami Bera, faces a former Republican congressman, Doug Ose. That race, which attracted more than 8 million in independent expenditures in 2012, has topped 9.6 million this year. Arizona’s Second District, where Ron Barber, a Democratic incumbent, is facing Martha McSally, a Republican and retired Air Force colonel, has attracted 9.5 million. Those three races alone represent 15 percent of all reported outside spending in House general elections. The focus is even tighter for the two national party committees devoted to House races and for super PACs with close ties to House leaders. A full 88 percent of the 137 million in independent spending in the general election has gone to 25 races from those groups — the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC on the left, and the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund on the right. The bulk of House contests have seen virtually no outside spending this year, with 193 having less than 10,000 spent. You could form a slim majority with the 220 races that have had less than 25,000 in independent spending for the general election. As with Senate races, most of the outside money spent in House contests goes to television advertising, with smaller amounts on direct mail, online ads and polling. About 82 percent of the outside spending in House races is on negative messages, in line with previous election cycles. Summary:","completion":"In the current House races, competitiveness appears to be quite limited as only 25 contests account for 80% of all reported outside spending in the general election.

The six-party talks, which involve China, the United States, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and North Korea, have been a crucial platform for dialogue and negotiation aimed at resolving security concerns and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Although these talks have faced numerous challenges and setbacks over the years, they have accomplished some positive results such as cooling down periods of heightened tension between North Korea and its neighbors. In this particular instance, Wu Dawei's statement reflects the urgency felt by China and its commitment to regional stability. By proposing emergency consultations, China recognizes the importance of maintaining open communication channels among the involved nations to address the critical issues and to gather a consensus on how to diffuse the current situation. The mention of the talks taking place in early December shows that China realizes the need for swift action, aiming to prevent any further escalation of hostilities on the Korean peninsula.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person that named the river that had cleanup efforts begin in the 1930s get a American Heritage River? By the early 20th century, major river-control projects had begun to take place. Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40 percent of the basin. Most of them do not have fish ladders.With development in and near the river came increased pollution. By the late 1930s, efforts to stem the pollution led to formation of a state sanitary board to oversee modest cleanup efforts. In the 1960s, Oregon Governor Tom McCall led a push for stronger pollution controls on the Willamette. In this, he was encouraged by Robert (Bob) Straub—the state treasurer and future Oregon governor (1975)—who first proposed a Willamette Greenway program during his 1966 gubernatorial campaign against McCall. The Oregon State Legislature established the program in 1967. Through it, state and local governments cooperated in creating or improving a system of parks, trails, and wildlife refuges along the river. In 1998, the Willamette became one of 14 rivers designated an American Heritage River by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. By 2007 the Greenway had grown to include more than 170 separate land parcels, including 10 state parks. Public uses of the river and land along its shores include camping, swimming, fishing, boating, hiking, bicycling, and wildlife viewing.In 2008, government agencies and the non-profit Willamette Riverkeeper organization designated the full length of the river as the Willamette River Water Trail. Four years later, the National Park Service added the Willamette water trail—expanded to 217 miles (349 km) to include some of the major tributaries—to its list of national water trails. The water-trail system is meant to protect and restore waterways in the United States and to enhance recreation on and near them.A 1991 agreement between the City of...

Jane Jacobs (born Jane Butzner; May 4, 1916 - April 25, 2006) was an American-Canadian journalist, author, and activist who influenced urban studies, sociology, and economics. Her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961) argued that urban renewal did not respect the needs of city-dwellers. It also introduced the sociological concepts \\"eyes on the street\\" and \\"social capital\\". Jacobs organized grassroots efforts to protect neighborhoods from \\"slum clearance\\", in particular Robert Moses' plans to overhaul her own Greenwich Village neighborhood. In 1935, during the Great Depression, she moved to New York City with her sister Betty. Jane Butzner took an immediate liking to Manhattan's Greenwich Village, which did not conform to the city's grid structure. The sisters soon moved there from Brooklyn. During her early years in the city, Jacobs held a variety of jobs working as a stenographer and freelance writer, writing about working districts in the city. These experiences, she later said, \\"... gave me more of a notion of what was going on in the city and what business was like, what work was like.\\" Her first job was for a trade magazine as a secretary, then an editor. She sold articles to the Sunday Herald Tribune, Cue magazine, and Vogue. She studied at Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years, taking courses in geology, zoology, law, political science, and economics. About the freedom to pursue study across her wide-ranging interests, she said: For the first time I liked school and for the first time I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the property of Barnard College at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn.

Yamaha's Bradley Smith finished second amid changing weather that saw most riders forced to make two pit-stops. Honda's Scott Redding claimed his first podium finish in third, despite sliding into the gravel early on. All three capitalised after Valentino Rossi blew his chances with tactical errors and Jorge Lorenzo crashed out. The last time two Britons shared a podium in a premier-class grand prix was in Venezuela 36 years ago when Barry Sheene won the race and Irishman Tom Herron came third. Early rain proved crucial on Sunday, with Honda rider Marquez switching to slick tyres just as the Misano circuit started to dry. Championship leader Rossi and his army of home fans were left frustrated after he led with seven laps to go but left the switch from wet tyres to slicks until too late, which handed the race to Marquez. Rossi eventually finished fifth but thanks to Lorenzo's crash the 36-year-old still extended his championship lead to 23 points over his Yamaha team-mate. Marquez, who sits in third spot 63 points behind Rossi with five races to go, explained that problems caused by the weather were made more difficult by the recently re-laid track surface. The Spaniard added: \\"The asphalt is new here and very dark, so it was hard to tell if it was dry or wet. It was really difficult out there but we made the right decision with the tyres.\\" Smith was delighted to claim the second podium finish of his career after sticking with slick tyres at the right time. The 24-year-old said: \\"I kept telling myself that luck favours the brave, went with my instincts and it turned out to be a good day.\\" Redding rode a remarkable race after sliding into the dirt, only to get back up and push his bike back on the track. The 22-year-old said: \\"When I went into the gravel, the marshalls tried to hold me back but I was fighting to get on the track. \\"It was an incredible race and the adrenaline was through the roof.

The designs show a complex of modern buildings, with a library, museum and event center, plus a community garden, a children's play area and possibly an athletic field. \\"What we want this to be is the world-premiere institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world,\\" he told the crowd that included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, his one-time chief of staff.

The museum, the tallest of the three buildings, will hold exhibition space, public spaces, offices and education and meeting rooms, according to the Obama Foundation. The forum and library buildings are intended to be used for study and foundation programming. Obama said his foundation, which is overseeing the project, is also looking into the possibility of locating a Chicago Public Library branch on the site. Obama said he envisioned recording studios where musicians could help young people work on music, and space for movie directors who could take on community storytelling. The center will also have exhibits with campaign memorabilia and personal artifacts. \\"Let's face it, we want to see Michelle's dresses,\\" the former president joked.

Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. Please answer this question : Which tetrapod would have more offsprings in their lifetime, tetA or tetB?","completion":"Based on Aristotle's theory, since tetA has a longer gestation period and is heavier than tetB, it is likely that tetA has a longer lifespan as well.

Born as Milo, he was named after Dr. Milo, a friend of his chimpanzee parents, Cornelius and Zira. Due to a series of events involving Armando, the circus owner, Caesar was raised in secret, and would eventually become instrumental in the story arcs of the subsequent films. Caesar's backstory adds significant depth to the entire Planet of the Apes universe. His unique upbringing as the offspring of talking chimpanzees that had traveled back in time creates a complex and intriguing character. Growing up among humans, he develops a perspective different from typical apes, and this makes his role even more pivotal in later films. In Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, Caesar, now an adult, is captured and sold as a pet, leading him to witness the cruel treatment of apes by humans first hand. This exposure to the harsh realities faced by his kind fuels his desire to lead the ape rebellion against human domination. In this film, Caesar emerges as a symbol of resistance and hope for the oppressed ape population. Moreover, in Battle for the Planet of the Apes, which takes place after the events of Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, Caesar tries to create a peaceful society involving both apes and humans. However, his efforts are met with resistance from certain factions, including the mutated humans and a rebellious gorilla general, which leads to a war that ultimately shapes the future of both species. In summary, we can conclude that Caesar is an integral character in the original Planet of the Apes movie series, with his unique origin story, growth, and eventual role in the ape revolution profoundly affecting the plot and the future of the Apes universe."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. Answer:","completion":"Bob didn't make a fire that burned for a longer time. This is because he used small sticks, kindlings, and sawdust which have a larger surface area as compared to the large logs used by Danny. The increased surface area causes the smaller materials to burn much more quickly, resulting in a faster and brighter fire, but not one that lasts as long. In contrast, Danny's fire created with large logs will burn relatively slowly, thus lasting for a longer period of time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Paragraph: Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.

Body armour Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Gotham's Reckoning\\" Plot: In the dark, crime-ridden Gotham City, Batman (Bruce Wayne) encounters a new and ferocious adversary: Vincent Dent, the twin brother of the deceased and notorious Harvey Dent. Vincent seeks vengeance against Batman, blaming him for not only his brother's death but also the loss of his once-prominent family name. Using his power, influence, and knowledge of Gotham's underground network, Vincent Dent aims to launch a carefully coordinated operation to bring Gotham to its knees and overthrow Batman once and for all. The film opens as Batman struggles to handle the surge of crimes perpetrated by the people loyal to Vincent, who has donned the name 'Vindictive Dent'. In his desperation, Batman turns to his long-time butler, friend, and confidante, Alfred, for advice. Together, they delve deeper into the Dent family history and learn of a closely guarded secret: Harvey and Vincent were conjoined twins, separated at birth to protect the family's public image. This leads to a dark revelation; it wasn't Batman who caused Harvey's downfall but Vincent himself, who manipulated the tragic events that turned Harvey into the monstrous Two-Face. As Batman puzzles out the truth, Commissioner Gordon also starts investigating the mysterious circumstances surrounding Harvey's death. He uncovers damning evidence that Vincent was orchestrating both his brother's demise and the criminal wave sweeping the city. He confronts Vincent at his mansion, hoping to reason with him and halt his sinister plans. But Vincent is consumed by his anger for Batman and has no intention of stopping. Batman, now relying on his exceptional detective skills, designates a team of trusted allies to counter Vincent's moves and disrupt his network. Simultaneously, he works on developing a new suit of advanced body armor to help him withstand Vincent's relentless attacks. He knows that when they meet, it's going to be a fierce battle of survival. As the plot unfolds, the citizens of Gotham are caught in the crossfire between Batman's struggle against Vindictive Dent's followers, resulting in a high-stakes hostage situation in City Hall. Batman, now wearing his newly developed body armor, enters the fray, desperate to put an end to the violence that has plagued his city. The suit features cutting-edge technology, enabling Batman to absorb the impact of bullets, knives, and various forms of blunt force trauma. The climax of the movie sees Batman and Vincent facing off atop the burning ruins of City Hall, a casualty of the chaos and mayhem caused by Vincent's carefully executed plan. The rain beats down on them, adding further tension and drama to the final confrontation. With his life and the lives of Gotham's citizens on the line, Batman swiftly tackles Vincent, using his advanced body armor to absorb a potentially deadly blow from Vincent's powerful melee weapon. Simultaneously, Commissioner Gordon leads the police force in a valiant effort to free the hostages held captive in City Hall. As Batman and Vincent battle it out, the line between justice and vengeance becomes blurred, highlighting the destructive nature of vengeance and the heartaches both Batman and Vincent have undergone as a result of Harvey Dent's death. Ultimately, Batman emerges victorious, incapacitating Vincent and bringing him to justice. With his brother's actions exposed, Vincent is sent to Arkham Asylum, where he will face the consequences of his actions. Batman, having protected his city once more, reaffirms his commitment to saving Gotham from their enemies, both old and new. The film ends with a renewed sense of hope and determination as Gotham's citizens work to rebuild their broken city and heal their wounds. In \\"Gotham's Reckoning,\\" Batman's penchant for bravery and determination, coupled with Vincent's dark obsession with revenge, culminate in an action-packed, emotionally charged cinematic thriller that showcases the devastating consequences of seeking vengeance at the expense of justice."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The first major contacts between the two countries occurred after Thailand was made an apostolic vicariate by Pope Alexander VII on 22 August 1662. The mission was assigned to the newly formed Paris Foreign Missions Society to evangelize Asia, and Siam became the first country to receive these efforts, to be followed by new missions 40 years later in Cochinchina, Tonkin and parts of China, because Siam was highly tolerant of other religions and was indeed the only country in Southeast Asia where the Catholic Fathers could establish themselves safely. Monseigneur Pierre Lambert de la Motte, Bishop of Beirut, Vicar-Apostolic of Cochinchina, and member of the Missions Etrangères de Paris, accompanied by Fathers De Bourges and Deydier, left Marseille on 26 November 1660, and reached Mergui 18 months later.

It was started in the month of May 1982 in old re-appropriated barracks of 1 PARA (SF) by the Army Welfare Education Society. The school's first principal was Mrs S Samadhar. The present principal is Mr R A Prabhakar, who has occupied the post since 2011 and is the ninth principal of the school. Context_3 : The political relationship between the United States and Myanmar worsened after the 1988 military coup and violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations. Subsequent repression, including the crackdown on peaceful protestors in September 2007, further strained the relationship. However, following signs of liberalization, the US government began the process of improving its links with Myanmar in 2011. With improving ties in 2012, the White House planned Ambassador nomination, the first since 1990. On June 29, 2012, the U.S. Senate confirmed Derek Mitchell as the United States Ambassador to Myanmar. Context_4 : Bloody Sunday – sometimes called the Bogside Massacre – was an incident on 30 January 1972 in the Bogside area of Derry, Northern Ireland, when British soldiers shot 28 unarmed civilians during a peaceful protest march against internment. Fourteen people died: thirteen were killed outright, while the death of another man four months later was attributed to his injuries. Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from the soldiers and some were shot while trying to help the wounded. Other protesters were injured by rubber bullets or batons, and two were run down by army vehicles. The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA). The soldiers involved were members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, also known as \\"1 Para\\". Context_5 : In 2014, a series of protests, political demonstrations, and civil insurrection began in Venezuela due to the country's high levels of urban violence, inflation, and chronic shortages of basic goods attributed to economic policies such as strict price controls. While protests occurred in January 2014, after the murder of actress and former Miss Venezuela Mónica Spear, mass protesting began in earnest that February following the attempted rape of a student on a university campus in San Cristóbal. Subsequent arrests and killings of student protestors spurred their expansion to neighboring cities and the involvement of opposition leaders. The year's early months were characterized by large demonstrations and violent clashes between protestors and government forces that resulted in nearly 4,000 arrests and 43 deaths, including both supporters and opponents of the government. Toward the end of 2014, and into 2015, continued shortages and low oil prices caused renewed protesting. By 2016, protests occurred following the controversy surrounding the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary elections as well as the incidents surrounding the 2016 recall referendum. On 1 September 2016, the largest demonstration of the protests occurred, with over 1 million Venezuelans, or over 3% of the entire nation's population, gathered to demand a recall election against President Maduro, with the event being described as the \\"largest demonstration in the history of Venezuela\\". Following the suspension of the recall referendum by the government-leaning National Electoral Council (CNE) on 21 October 2016, the opposition organized another protest which was held on 26 October 2016, with over 1.2 million Venezuelans participating. After some of the largest protests occurred in a late-2016, Vatican-mediate dialogue between the opposition and government was attempted and ultimately failed in January 2017. Concentration on protests subsided in the first months of 2017 until the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis occurred when the pro-government Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela attempted to assume the opposition-led National Assembly and removed their immunity, though the move was reversed days later, demonstrations grew \\"into the most combative since a wave of unrest in 2014\\". The protests are considered to be the Mother of all Protests. Context_6 : During the early stages of the Libyan Civil War of 2011, the Gaddafi regime was still in power: but there was widespread withdrawal of support from that regime by influential persons and organisations within the country. Among those who no longer supported the regime, the main concern they expressed was what they regarded as its use of excessive force against peaceful protestors. There were many resignations by ministers of the governing council and other senior officials, diplomats posted abroad, and senior military officers. Islamic clerics, tribal leaders, and members of the former royal family expressed their opposition, while the two leading Libyan oil companies also withdrew support for the regime. Context_7 : Tom Reilly (born 1960) is an Irish author and former regional newspaper columnist (\\"Life of Reilly\\", \\"Drogheda Independent\\"), who has written books on Oliver Cromwell and religion, (\\"Hollow Be Thy Name\\") as well as a book based on his own newspaper columns among others.

Ruby responds to Justine by declining the offer to use Justine's speaker, since the buzzing sound could be a problem. She assures Justine that she will find an alternative solution to the problem. Justine then agrees with Ruby's decision and waits for further updates. At this point, Lawrence intervenes and informs the group that he has found his Bluetooth speaker. He offers to bring it with him to the event or gathering, resolving the issue they were trying to figure out. Justine expresses her gratitude to Lawrence for his offer and confirms that his speaker would be a great solution to the problem.

Answer:","completion":"Henry III was born on September 19, 1551, at the Château de Fontainebleau in France. He was the son of King Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici, a member of the House of Valois. As a young man, Henry held various titles, including Duke of Anjou, Duke of Orléans, and Duke of Angoulême. He had a diverse and distinguished education as a prince, groomed for his future role as a king. In 1570, he was portrayed by the famous artist François Clouet, revealing his status as a prominent figure of the time. On May 16, 1574, Henry III ascended the throne as the King of France and Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. His coronations took place in Reims on February 22, 1574, and Wawel on February 13, 1575. His reign was marked by various challenges, including religious tensions and political disputes. In 1575, Henry III married Louise of Lorraine, a member of the House of Lorraine. Despite their marriage, the couple did not have any children, leading to the succession crisis that would follow Henry's death. Throughout his reign, Henry III saw escalating conflicts between Catholics and Protestants in France, culminating in the French Wars of Religion. As a Roman Catholic himself, Henry attempted to navigate the complexities of the religious tensions within his kingdom. On August 2, 1589, Henry III was assassinated at the Château de Saint-Cloud in France, solidifying the end of the Valois dynasty. He was succeeded by Anna and Stephen Bathory in Poland, and by Henry IV in France. Henry III's legacy continues to be a subject of historical discussion and examination, particularly surrounding his reign and religious policies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent 13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent. Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was 2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. Part of the problem was the cost of restoration of the new property and the deteriorating equipment. In addition, while the tourists in Vermont had enjoyed the sights of cornfields, farms, covered bridges, a waterfall and a gorge on a Steamtown excursion, the Scranton trip to Moscow, Pennsylvania, cut through one of the nation's largest junkyards, an eyesore described by Ralph Nader as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\".In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the spending of 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of 66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study.

An Arizona mother of seven will be back in court on Wednesday as a judge weighs whether she will go free or remain behind bars in Mexico, her family said. It's a situation Yanira Maldonado's family said she never imagined when she boarded a bus to head back to the United States last week after attending a family funeral. Now she's facing drug-smuggling charges after Mexican authorities said they found 12 pounds of marijuana under her bus seat. Her family vehemently denies the charges and accuses authorities of arresting her to get bribe money. A Mexican state official also told CNN it appears that Yanira Maldonado was framed. Anna Soto, Maldonado's daughter, said it was devastating to see her mom in jail over the weekend. \\"She's an honest woman. She's innocent. It's not a place for someone of her kind,\\" Soto told CNN's \\"Piers Morgan Live\\" on Tuesday night. \\"It hurts just to know that she's there, to have seen her there. It's not fair.\\" Soto said she knows her mother has nothing to do with drugs. \\"Never. No. She is not that kind of person. I don't think she's ever even tried a cigarette in her life or even drank a beer,\\" Soto said. \\"You know, she's one of those people that tries to stay away from those kinds of people or those kinds of things.\\" From a bus seat to a jail cell. Mexican authorities arrested Maldonado last Wednesday as she and her husband, Gary, were on their way back to Arizona. During a search of their bus at a military checkpoint in the northwestern Mexican state of Sonora, authorities asked everyone to get off. At first, authorities told Gary Maldonado that marijuana had been found under his seat and arrested him, his father, Larry Maldonado, told CNN. After the father contacted the U.S. Consulate in Hermosillo, Mexico, authorities said they were mistaken and released Gary. Then, they charged his wife. Gary Maldonado said he believes Mexican soldiers at the checkpoint wanted a bribe. \\"It's about getting money here,\\" he told CNN's \\"Starting Point\\" on Tuesday. A lengthy court hearing. Maldonado's court hearing had stretched for more than three hours on Tuesday afternoon, said Brandon Klippel, her brother-in-law. Military officers from the checkpoint were scheduled to testify on Wednesday, Klippel said after speaking with family members and a translator who were inside the Mexican courtroom on Tuesday. \\"Although we are disappointed to hear that she will not be released today,\\" he said, \\"we are very encouraged by the strong evidence and witnesses proving her innocence.\\" Gary Maldonado told CNN affiliate KTVK that he was feeling optimistic after Tuesday's hearing. \\"We're hoping for the best outcome. ... We don't think they have a case,\\" he said. The Mexican Embassy in Washington said in a statement that a preliminary decision from the judge was expected soon. Questions about arrest. A Sonora state official with extensive knowledge of the case told CNN there are questions about the arrest. \\"Can you imagine?\\" asked the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media and did not want to be named. \\"A passenger by himself or herself would have been unable to carry almost six kilos of marijuana onto a bus without being noticed. She must've been framed.\\" A regional office of Mexico's Defense Ministry said troops conducting a routine investigation stopped the bus Maldonado was riding in and and found 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) of a substance that appeared to be marijuana under her seat. Troops turned the case over to the Mexican attorney general's office, the defense ministry said. Maldonado is being housed in a women's prison in Nogales, Mexico, while authorities decide her fate. The Sonora state division of the attorney general's office said the investigation is ongoing and declined to provide additional information about the case against Maldonado. Her husband was told by authorities that regardless of his wife's guilt or innocence, he would have to pay 5,000 to secure her freedom, the family said. He was able to cobble together the money but then was told it was too late. His wife had been transferred to another jail. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake is monitoring the case, his office said. \\"Senator Flake is personally monitoring the situation, and he has had multiple conversations with the deputy Mexican ambassador this weekend,\\" Flake's office said Monday. 'Blind mules' unknowingly ferry drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border. Fear grips family. But growing political and media attention toward the case has not lessened the fears of Yanira Maldonado's family. Family members visiting her over the weekend were told they would have hours to talk, but when they arrived they were given only 10 minutes, Klippel said. \\"She was at a wire window with her fingertips up through the holes, touching her son's hand with one hand and touching her husband's hand with the other,\\" Klippel said. \\"She was just saying, 'I don't know how this happened to me. I've never done anything illegal in my life. Why has this happened?'\\" After Tuesday's hearing, sister-in-law Veronica Anaya said the family remained very scared and upset. \\"The family is very sad,\\" Anaya told Canal 7, a local TV station in Nogales. \\"They know she's innocent. She's the mother of seven children and a decent person. She's a Christian. This is an injustice.\\" Mormons reach out. While they anxiously await word from Mexico, family members say they've been turning to their church for strength. The Maldonados are members of a local Mormon ward in Goodyear, Arizona, Klippel said, adding that church leaders at the state and local level have offered spiritual and material support to the family. \\"I feel very blessed, and I feel how powerful this network is,\\" Klippel said. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormon church is officially known, has long been active in Mexico and other parts of the world, and is famous for its tight and socially active circles. A Facebook page Klippel and his wife founded to support Yanira Maldonado had garnered more than 12,500 members as of Tuesday afternoon, many of whom are fellow Mormons. A number have offered to connect the Maldonados with Mormon leaders in Mexico or media in the United States. Some in the Facebook group said that they are refraining from eating and drinking for a day on the family's behalf. \\"To find out that hundreds if not thousands of people are fasting on behalf of my sister and praying to God that this is over soon is very humbling,\\" Klippel said.

The plain-clothes officer was seen on the video running up to and slugging one of three teens being cuffed for an assault on a 20-year-old man on Madison Street around 4 p.m., Monday. The victim had been struck with a cane before cops responded and made the arrest. A witness can be heard shouting in the video “I’m a lawyer,” and adding that she couldn’t believe the officer “did that to a 12-year-old.” The suspects were ages 16 and 17 and had an ongoing dispute with the victims, sources said. “An individual ended up hospitalized as a result of a beating that he may have received at the hands of three or four young men and during the effort to arrest one of the men thought to be involved in the incident an individual that we have identified as one of our plain clothed officers runs up and appears to strike the (teen) with a closed fist twice in the side of the body,” Bratton said.

(Associated Press) STOCKHOLM (AP) — Much like the flags on the Stockholm skyline — some still flying half-staff, others at their peak — people here were divided over their country's friendly immigration policies two days after an asylum-seeker from Uzbekistan allegedly killed four people in the city's deadliest extremist attack in years. The Swedish capital was slowly, but resolutely, regaining its normal rhythm Sunday as details about the 39-year-old suspect emerged. Police said he had been ordered to leave Sweden in December after his request for a residence permit was rejected six months earlier. Instead, he allegedly went underground, eluding authorities' attempts to track down and deport him until a hijacked beer truck raced down a pedestrian street and rammed into an upscale department store on Friday. \\"It makes me frustrated,\\" Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven told Swedish news agency TT on Sunday. The suspect, who has been detained on suspicion of terrorist offenses, was known known for having \\"been sympathetic to extremist organizations,\\" Jonas Hysing of Sweden's national police said. A second person was arrested on the same potential charge Sunday, and four others were being held by police. None of them have been identified. Security officials in neighboring Norway, where a 17-year-old asylum-seeker from Russia was detained early Sunday in connection with an explosive device found near a busy subway station, spoke of the alarming potential for a copycat effect. Norwegian's security agency said it wasn't clear if the teen planned to carry out an attack with the primitive homemade device police defused without any injuries. Agency head Benedicte Bjornland said it was likely the youth had been inspired by recent attacks in Stockholm, France, Germany, Britain and Russia. \\"The attacks demonstrate how easy such attacks can be carried out, and prove to others that it is possible to make something similar,\\" Bjornland said. Sweden has long been known for its open-door policy toward migrants and refugees. But after the Scandinavian country of 10 million took in a record 163,000 refugees in 2015 — the highest per-capita rate in Europe — the government has tried to be more selective about which newcomers it allows to stay. Swedish police said Sunday they had received roughly 12,500 referrals from the Swedish Migration Board of people who, like the suspect in the truck attack, had overstayed their welcome. The suspect eluded authorities by giving police a wrong address after his residency request was rejected in June 2016, said Hysing, the operative head of the attack investigation. \\"The efforts to locate (these people) is both time-consuming and resource-intensive,\\" he said. National Coordinator Against Violent Extremism Anna Carlstedt, who used to lead the Red Cross in Sweden, said Friday's attack and the background of the suspect posed \\"difficult questions.\\" \\"Do we somehow need a more repressive policy?\\" Carlstedt said. \\"I think it is very important now not to rush into something, to see how we can safeguard this open society and still be able to protect ourselves.\\" The range of mixed emotions — fear and fraternity, anger and openness, — also surfaced at memorial services and rallies held in Stockholm on Sunday to honor the attack victims. Lars Holm, a 73-year-old Stockholm resident was visibly upset, after attending a service at Stockholm Cathedral. \\"If people who are here seeking asylum and treat us like this, it is not good,\\" Holm said. \\"So now we have to have more security in our society, but still we don't like to live in bunkers.\\" Addressing tens of thousands of people rallying in bright sunshine on the downtown Sergelstorg square, organizer Rickard Sjoberg noted that many in the crowd probably were from out of town. \\"But today, were all Stockholmers,\\" he said to huge applause. The four victims killed included a British man, a Belgian woman and two Swedes, authorities in those countries said. Their identities were not released by Swedish officials. The British government named the Briton as Chris Bevington, an executive at Swedish music-streaming service Spotify. In Brussels, the Belga news agency said the Belgian woman had been reported missing before she was identified by her identity papers and later by DNA testing. As of Sunday, 10 of the 15 people wounded remained hospitalized, including one child. Stockholm county spokesman Patrik Soderberg said four of the 10 were considered \\"seriously\\" injured and the remaining six, including the child, were slightly injured. One of the wounded, an 83-year-old Romanian woman who was begging on the city's pedestrian Drottninggatan shopping street when the attack took place, said she was \\"surprised\\" that passers-by helped her. \\"I thought everyone would run past me and save themselves,\\" Papusa Ciuraru, whose foot was crushed by a boulder displaced by the speeding truck, told the Expressen daily. The lion-shaped boulders on Drottninggatan are meant as roadblocks and have been put up in several European capitals after a truck attack last year killed 12 people at a Christmas market in Berlin. Police and Sweden's intelligence have questioned some 500 people as part of the investigation, a senior police officer said. Sweden's SAPO security police said it was working to find \\"any abettor or network involved in the attack.\\" The department store that was rammed by the truck apologized Sunday for an announcement that it would reopen two days after the deadly attack to sell damaged goods at a \\"reduced price.\\" The Ahlens store described it as \\"a bad decision\\" on its Facebook page, saying its motivation \\"was born out of the idea of standing up for transparency and not allowing evil forces take control of our lives.\\" The store said it would reopen Monday \\"without any damaged goods.\\" ___ Olsen reported from Copenhagen.

(Associated Press) COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A 17-year-old asylum-seeker from Russia was arrested Sunday in connection with an explosive device found near a busy subway station in Norway's capital that police defused before it detonated, authorities said. The youth was detained on suspicion of handling explosives, but investigators do not know if he planned to carry out an attack with the homemade device, Signe Aaling, chief prosecutor for Norway's PST security service, said. Aaling described the explosive as \\"a primitive improvised explosive device with limited damage potential.\\" \\"PST is now working on finding his intentions and find out whether others are involved,\\" she said. The youth was not identified, but security service head Benedicte Bjornland said Norwegian intelligence was aware of him. He is an asylum-seeker from Russia who arrived in Norway with his family in 2010, Bjornland said. Bjornland also alleged that the youth was part of \\"extreme Islamism\\" circles in Norway. He was arrested based on a tip from the public, Bjornland said without elaborating. \\"It is likely that that attacks in France, German, Great Britain, Russia and Sweden can create a copycat effect in Norway with people with Islamic sympathies,\\" Bjornland said, listing the locations of extremist attacks that have devastated Europe in the last year. \\"The attacks demonstrate how easy such attacks can be carried out, and prove to others that it is possible to make something similar,\\" she added. The teenage suspect's lawyer, Aase Karine Sigmond, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that her client denies wrongdoing and had distanced himself from the Islamic State group. \\"We are talking about boyish stupidities,\\" Sigmond told NRK. The teen, who lives in Oslo, is scheduled for a pre-trial custody hearing on Monday. The discovery of the explosive Saturday night — found on the street just outside the Groenland subway station — prompted police to evacuate late bars and restaurants in the Norwegian capital. The Oslo explosive was found less than a mile from the government buildings that were damaged in a deadly bomb attack carried out by right-wing extremist Anders Breivik in 2011. That bomb and a subsequent gun massacre at a Norwegian island killed a total of 77 people. Norway was put on high alert after neighboring Sweden suffered a truck attack in Stockholm on Friday that killed four people and injured 15. The risk of a significant attack striking the country was raised on Sunday to \\"likely\\" for what intelligence officials said would be a two-month period. |||||","completion":"People in Stockholm are divided over their country's friendly immigration policies after an asylum-seeker from Uzbekistan allegedly killed four people in a truck attack.

All its life it had been asleep, but now it hardly got a chance for a nod, so swiftly did big events and crashing surprises come along in one another's wake: Friday morning, first glimpse of Real Nobility, also grand reception at Aunt Patsy Cooper's, also great robber raid; Friday evening, dramatic kicking of the heir of the chief citizen in presence of four hundred people; Saturday morning, emergence as practicing lawyer of the long-submerged Pudd'nhead Wilson; Saturday night, duel between chief citizen and titled stranger. The people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put together, perhaps. It was a glory to their town to have such a thing happen there.

Proper wound care: Keeping the wound clean, moist, and free from infection. This may include using appropriate dressings, ointments, or creams, as recommended by a healthcare professional. 4. Nutritional support: Ensuring adequate protein and calorie intake can promote tissue repair and healing. 5.

Movie title: The Mask of Zorro Movie plot: In 1821, the Mexican Army is on the verge of liberating its country from Spanish colonial rule. In the area of Las Californias the ruthless Spanish Governor, Don Rafael Montero, is about to be overthrown. In a last ditch effort to trap his nemesis, the masked swordsman Zorro (Anthony Hopkins), Montero prepares to execute three innocent townspeople. With assistance from two orphan brothers, Joaquin and Alejandro Murrieta, Zorro releases the prisoners. Zorro rewards the Murrieta brothers with a special medallion he wears, and escapes on his horse, Toronado, after cutting a \\"Z\\" into Montero's neck as a parting gift and warning. The same night, however, Montero confronts Zorro at his home, having deduced that Zorro is really Don Diego de la Vega, a Spanish nobleman married to Esperanza, the woman Montero had always loved. Attempting to arrest Diego, a fight ensues, during which Esperanza is killed while trying to protect Diego. Diego's house is burned and his infant daughter, Elena, is taken to Spain by Montero to be raised as his own while Diego is taken to prison. Twenty years later, Montero secretly returns to California, looking for Diego in the old prison. Although de La Vega is there, Montero does not recognize him, while several prisoners claim to be Zorro (taken from the famous scene of Spartacus). Diego later escapes, intent on killing Montero the following day at a public ceremony for Montero's return. However, Diego restrains himself when he sees Eléna (Catherine Zeta-Jones), now a beautiful young lady. Elena is presented with a bouquet of flowers - Romagnas, native to California - the scent of which she recognizes, although she incorrectly believes she has never been to California before. Diego soon meets an adult Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas), whom he recognizes by the medal he awarded Joaquin. Now a drunken, clumsy bandit, Alejandro is bitter over the recent capture of his mentor, bandit Three-Fingered Jack (L. Q. Jones), and the murder of Joaquin by the sadistic Texian Army Captain Harrison... Answer:","completion":"De La Vega tells Elena the truth about her true parentage and that he is her real father.

Todd Sheets is still the director, but no longer the screenwriter, which isn't a negative or a positive, considering he's just as untalented as the guy who wrote this one.

The acting is about on par with the last two Bloodbath movies, so naturally, it's some of the worst I've ever seen. The special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look godawful. The plot has become too complicated for it's own good, and was about some government experiment gone wrong and zombies being produced. Also featured is cryogenically frozen mutant zombie and school kids that know how to time travel, leading to one of the most idiotic endings I've ever seen.

The song is believed to be about ignorance and its effects on people , its lyrics apparently being a sarcastic imitation of hero - worship . Musically , the song begins with a unique , dreamy , slightly flanged arpeggio that is unusual for Tom Morello . After a repeat , the main riff of the song crashes in accompanied by drums and bass . Tom 's solo once again invokes the toggle switch technique , with one handed tapping in the left hand that creates a hectic array of notes which seem to bounce off each other before entering the closing bridge of the solo , where the whammy pedal is put into full force . It appears on the soundtrack for the video game Madden NFL 07 . In addition , \`\` Revelations '' along with \`\` I Am the Highway '' were featured in the documentary Warren Miller 's Off the Grid .

Every time we have ordered food to go its wrong. The last time we went, several items were missing from our order. When I went back I was told by the manager that everyone is asked to sign their receipt confirming everything is correct.

When I asked her to show me the receipt we had signed, she could not produce it. It's very frustrating to order food, have it be wrong and then have someone tell you its your fault.

Information: - Hans Asperger (18 February 1906 21 October 1980) was an Austrian pediatrician, medical theorist, and medical professor. He is best known for his early studies on mental disorders, especially in children. His work was largely unnoticed during his lifetime except for a few accolades in Vienna, and his studies on psychological disorders only acquired world renown posthumously. He wrote over 300 publications, mostly concerning a condition he termed \\"autistic psychopathy\\" (AP). There was a resurgence of interest in his work beginning in the 1980s, and due to his earlier work on autism spectrum disorders, Asperger syndrome (AS), was named after him. Both Asperger's original paediatric diagnosis of AP and the eponymous diagnosis of AS that was named after him several decades later have been controversial. - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The DSM is now in its fifth edition, DSM-5, published on May 18, 2013. It evaluated the patient on five axes or dimensions rather than just one broad aspect of 'mental disorder'. These dimensions relate to biological, psychological, social and other aspects. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders. - ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. - Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life. The exact cause of Asperger's is unknown. While it is probably partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\" (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the \\"International Classification of Diseases\\" (ICD-10) as of 2015. There is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured. In 2013, Asperger's was estimated to affect 31 million people globally. The syndrome is named... - International Organization is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the entire field of international affairs.

A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. - A social skill is any skill facilitating interaction and communication with others. Social rules and relations are created, communicated, and changed in verbal and nonverbal ways. The process of learning these skills is called socialization. For socialization, Interpersonal skills are essential to relate one another. Interpersonal skills are the interpersonal acts a person uses to interact with others which are related to dominance vs. submission, love vs. hate, affiliation vs. aggression, control vs. autonomy categories (Leary, 1957). Positive interpersonal skills include persuasion, active listening, delegation, and stewardship among others. Social psychology is the academic discipline that does research related to social skills, the discipline studies how skills are learned by an individual through changes in attitude, thinking, and behavior. - High-functioning autism (HFA) is a term applied to people with autism who are deemed to be cognitively \\"higher functioning\\" (with an IQ of 70 or greater) than other people with autism. Individuals with HFA or Asperger syndrome may exhibit deficits in areas of communication, emotion recognition and expression, and social interaction. HFA is not a recognized diagnosis in the DSM-5 or the ICD-10. - Developmental disorders is a group of psychiatric conditions originating in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. There are several ways of using this term. The most narrow concept is used in the category \\"Specific Disorders of Psychological Development\\" in the ICD-10. These disorders comprise language disorders, learning disorders, motor disorders and autism spectrum disorders. In broader definitions ADHD is included, and the term used is neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet others include antisocial behavior and schizophrenia that begins in childhood and continues through life. However, these two latter conditions are not as stable as the other developmental disorders, and there is not the same evidence of a shared genetic liability. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three. Autism is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypotheses, which have since been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met. Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder. Globally, autism is estimated to affect 21.7 million people as of 2013. As of 2010, the number of people affected is estimated at about 12 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children... - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\", Fifth Edition (DSM-5\\") is the 2013 update to the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) classification and diagnostic tool. In the United States the DSM serves as a universal authority for psychiatric diagnoses. Treatment recommendations, as well as payment by health care providers, are often determined by DSM classifications, so the appearance of a new version has significant practical importance. - Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, , or OPEP in several other languages) is an intergovernmental organization of 13 nations, founded in 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela), and headquartered since 1965 in Vienna. As of 2015, the 13 countries accounted for an estimated 42 percent of global oil production and 73 percent of the world's \\"proven\\" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by American-dominated multinational oil companies. - Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr. - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. - The Czech Republic, also known by the short name Czechia, is a nation state in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast. The Czech Republic covers an area of with mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate. It is a unitary parliamentary republic, has 10.5 million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague, with over 1.2 million residents. The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.

Question: what is a petition for a writ of certiorari?? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Define the term \\"petition\\" in the context of legal matters A petition is a formal, written request submitted to a court or any authoritative body, asking for a particular action or decision to be made. Step 2: Define the term \\"writ of certiorari\\" A writ of certiorari is an order issued by a higher court, such as the Supreme Court, to review the decision and proceedings of a lower court to determine any legal errors that may have occurred during the trial or appeal process. Step 3: Explain when and why a party files a petition for a writ of certiorari A party files a petition for a writ of certiorari when they believe that the lower court made an important legal error, resulting in a potentially incorrect decision or judgment. The petition asks the higher court to review the case and provide guidance on the correct legal principles to apply, ensuring a fair and just outcome. Step 4: Describe the process of filing a petition for a writ of certiorari To file a petition for a writ of certiorari, a party (the petitioner) must submit a written document to the higher court, arguing the importance of the case, identifying the legal issues in question, and explaining the reasons why the higher court's input and review are necessary. The other party (the respondent) may file a response to the petition, arguing against its grant. The higher court then decides whether to take the case based on the presented arguments and the legal importance of the case. Step 5: Explain the implications of a successful petition for a writ of certiorari If the higher court grants the petition for a writ of certiorari, it will review the lower court's decision, focusing on the legal questions raised by the petitioner, which could potentially lead to the overturning of the original verdict or legal guidance for lower courts on similar issues in the future. Based on the step by step analysis, the answer is: A petition for a writ of certiorari is a formal request submitted to a higher court, such as the Supreme Court, seeking a review of the decision and proceedings of a lower court to determine any legal errors that may have occurred. Parties file this petition when they believe that an important legal mistake was made in their case, and they hope by the higher court's guidance and review, the case can achieve a fair and just outcome."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Federal insurance program won’t add self-plus-one option until 2016 A self-plus-one coverage option won’t be available in the health insurance program for federal employees and retirees until 2016, according to the Office of Personnel Management. Currently, enrollees in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program may choose between self-only coverage and self and family coverage. Family coverage rates are substantially more expensive and don’t vary by how many additional persons are insured. A budget law passed in December approved making a self-plus-one option available to enrollees as soon as 2015. However, a spokesperson said that OPM “expects to implement the self plus one option for the 2016 plan year.” More than 250 insurance plans participate in the FEHBP, the large majority operating only in local areas. Rates and coverage terms are negotiated annually between the carriers and OPM, a process that starts in the spring and ends with an open season each fall for enrollment decisions for the following year. The OPM spokesperson said in an e-mail that adding the option will require the insurance carriers, federal payroll systems and the federal retirement system to revamp their processes. “Making this significant change across many systems would need to be completed well before the beginning of the 2015 open season to ensure user testing and quality assurance,” the spokesperson said. “FEHB carriers will need to submit rate and benefit proposals on the self plus one category. Adding self plus one will require precise actuarial evaluation for the new rates, and agencies will need sufficient time to make changes to their systems to accommodate payroll deductions,” the spokesperson added. The White House last spring proposed adding that option to the FEHBP program and Congress later approved it in part because the Congressional Budget Office determined it would be a money-saver for the government. The government pays about 70 percent of the total FEHBP premium cost for enrollees, whether they are in self-only or self and family plans. The CBO projected that premiums for a self-plus-one option would fall between the rates of the two other options and that retirees, especially, would be drawn to it. However, the CBO also predicted that once a self-plus-one option is added, the family coverage option “would become more costly than under current law because the average number of people covered by policies of that type would rise.” The idea of adding a self-plus-one option to the FEHBP had been in circulation for many years, advocated mainly by enrollees with only one eligible family member who contend that it is unfair for them to have to pay the same rates as those with multiple eligible family members. Self-plus-one coverage is available under the separate Federal Dental and Vision Insurance Program. In that program, the second person must be someone who would be eligible under family coverage rules. Domestic partners, for example, are excluded.","completion":"The Office of Personnel Management has announced that a self-plus-one coverage option for health insurance for federal employees and retirees will not be available until 2016.

The government has announced a series of policies to prevent the prices from rising further. Rising housing prices is still a big concern for the people, but since farm products are needed every day, the increase in their prices has made life very difficult for them. Many people may think the increase will help farmers. But have higher prices of farm products really benefited the farmers? Take the increase in vegetable prices in the first half of this year for example. Though natural disasters such as droughts and spring frost did not cause the prices of farm products to increase greatly--in fact, prices of some products did not increase at all--vegetables have become dearer by as much as 20 percent compared to that of last year. This means only a small part (or even none) of the extra money that city people have paid to buy farm products has gone to the farmers. The extra cost actually has gone to middlemen. As the fact shows, just increasing prices of farm products will have negative influence on the entire economy. On one hand, the price increase has created some abnormal phenomena, which hurts farmers' interests. On the other hand, resources will enter the agriculture because of the high price of farm products, which would finally create negative effect on the whole economy. In such a case, it would be better to leave the market to decide the prices instead of raising farm products' prices to protect the interests of farmers. Actually, such a way will be better for farmers in the long run. What is probably the author's attitude to raising the farm products' prices? A) Negative. B) Indifferent. C) Enthusiastic. D) Positive.","completion":"The author's attitude towards raising the farm products' prices appears to be negative (A) based on their detailed observations and explanations. The author raises several concerns on the negative impacts of increased prices of agricultural products on both the consumers and the farmers themselves. Firstly, they highlight that despite the rising prices, only a small part or even none of the extra money is going to the farmers, with middlemen benefiting instead. This shows that the author is concerned about the well-being of the farmers and does not think that higher prices necessarily benefit them. Furthermore, they argue that increasing the prices of farm products may lead to abnormal phenomena that could ultimately harm the farmers' interests. They also point out that resources funneling into agriculture due to high prices may negatively affect the overall economy, suggesting that price intervention might not be the most sustainable solution. The author then proposes an alternative, market-driven approach to price determination, stating that leaving the market to decide the prices is better than artificially raising them. By presenting this alternative and their belief in its long-term benefits, the author shows their negative attitude towards raising farm product prices as a means of protecting farmers' interests. Instead, they emphasize the importance of considering the broader implications on both the farming community and the economy as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- For many families, the school year just started, but for Karen Suffern, it's not too early to start planning for Christmas. The financially struggling single mother of fraternal twins recently asked her 8-year-olds to write down a list of things they would like from Santa. Suffern, who works part time as an administrative assistant for a home health care company, wanted to start budgeting for the holidays. She knew her twins, who just began third grade, were at the age where they would start asking for electronics and other expensive gifts. Her son, Ryan's, letter to Santa started off normally: \\"Every day when she goes to school, she says, '","completion":"Mommy, can I have this?' But I have to tell her that I don't have the money for it. She knows we don't have a lot of money, but she still believes in Santa Claus. So today, I asked my children to write letters to Santa earlier than usual, so I'd have enough time to budget properly and try to get them the presents they really want,\\" said Suffern. Her son, Ryan's, letter to Santa started off normally: \\"Dear Santa, I hope you are having a good year. Here is my list of things I would like for Christmas,\\" he wrote. On the list were items like a new scooter, a Lego set, and a remote-control car. But as Ryan continued writing, his letter revealed a more selfless intention: \\"I also want to ask if you can do something special for my sister, Amber. She's been through a lot and she could use some extra love and happiness this holiday season. Could you please make sure she gets a new toy that she's been wanting or that art set that she's been talking about? And it would be amazing if she could have that Barbie Dreamhouse she's always telling me about when she plays with her friends. I think it would make her really happy, Santa. And if there's a way I could give up my presents so she can have everything she wants, I would be okay with that. Thank you, Santa.\\" Touched by her son's heartfelt letter, Karen Suffern shared it on social media where it quickly went viral, gaining national attention. In response to the outpouring of support, a crowdfunding campaign was started to help make Ryan and Amber's holiday wishes come true. As the campaign gained traction, it not only raised enough money for Karen to purchase toys for her children, but it also sparked a community effort where neighbors, friends, and strangers came together to provide support to this family. With the local community collecting donations, the Suffern family was able to receive additional assistance beyond just Christmas gifts, such as grocery store gift cards, clothes and school supplies for the children, and even financial assistance to cover the twins' after-school activities. The generosity shown by the community and beyond managed to turn a potentially simple and predictable Christmas for a small family into a life-changing event, and made the holiday season much brighter for the Suffern family. Karen Suffern expressed her deep gratitude for the overwhelming support from everyone who had pitched in to make her children's Christmas wishes come true. \\"I can't thank everyone enough for the kindness they've shown my family. We're so grateful and truly feel like it's been a Christmas miracle.\\" As for Ryan and Amber, they not only received the items on their Christmas lists, but they also learned valuable lessons in compassion, empathy, and the power of community support. The story of Ryan's selfless letter to Santa will remain a touching tale that serves as a reminder during the holiday season of the true spirit of giving."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On 6 August 1945, the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in the first nuclear attack in history. In a press release issued after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Truman warned Japan to surrender or \\"...expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.\\" Three days later, on 9 August, the U.S. dropped another atomic bomb on Nagasaki, the last nuclear attack in history. More than 140,000–240,000 people died as a direct result of these two bombings. The necessity of the atomic bombings has long been debated, with detractors claiming that a naval blockade and aerial bombing campaign had already made invasion, hence the atomic bomb, unnecessary. However, other scholars have argued that the bombings shocked the Japanese government into surrender, with Emperor finally indicating his wish to stop the war. Another argument in favor of the atomic bombs is that they helped avoid Operation Downfall, or a prolonged blockade and bombing campaign, any of which would have exacted much higher casualties among Japanese civilians. Historian Richard B. Frank wrote that a Soviet invasion of Japan was never likely because they had insufficient naval capability to mount an amphibious invasion of Hokkaidō.

The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music.

Write an article with the title: \\"Penn State Penalties Include 60 Million Fine and Bowl Ban\\"","completion":"Title: Penn State Penalties Include 60 Million Fine and Bowl Ban Introduction: In the world of college sports, NCAA sanctions can shake the very core of a university's athletic program and create far-reaching consequences for the institution, sponsored athletes, coaches, and the students themselves. In July 2012, the NCAA imposed a series of heavy penalties on Pennsylvania State University, one of the most successful and fiercely competitive schools in the United States. The sanctions came in response to the shocking revelation of a child sexual abuse scandal involving Jerry Sandusky, the former assistant football coach at Penn State. They included a huge 60 million fine, a four-year bowl ban, a significant reduction in the number of football scholarships, and the forfeiture of all the Nittany Lions' wins from 1998 to 2011. Penn State's exemplary football program suddenly became the epicenter of a devastating scandal, tainting its reputation and leaving it with a painful road for recovery. The Sandusky Scandal The Penn State penalties stemmed from a major child sexual abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach, Jerry Sandusky. In November 2011, Sandusky was arrested and charged with 52 counts of child sexual abuse. He was ultimately convicted on 45 charges in June 2012. The revelations of Sandusky's abuse led to the firing of head coach Joe Paterno, and university president Graham Spanier resigned. The Freeh report, conducted by former FBI director Louis Freeh, scrutinized the response of the university's administration and coaching staff to the allegations against Sandusky. The report harshly criticized the failures of the university leadership in addressing the allegations and ensuring the safety of children on campus. The NCAA Penalties Following the release of the Freeh report, the NCAA levied several punitive measures against Penn State. The penalties included: 1. A 60 million fine, effectively equal to one year's revenue from the football program. The money was to be used to establish an endowment aimed at preventing child sexual abuse and helping its victims. 2. A four-year ban from participating in postseason bowl games. This prohibited the football team from competing in prestigious games that often serve as a measure of success and a determinant of national ranking. 3. A reduction in the number of scholarships the football program could offer from 85 to 65 over a four-year period. This reduction significantly impacted the team's ability to recruit top-tier athletes and remain competitive at the highest level. 4. The vacation of 112 wins by the Nittany Lions, spanning from 1998 to 2011. This decision dealt a significant blow to the program’s historical record and legacy. Consequences and Repercussions The sanctions had wide-ranging effects on the Penn State community. The students were left grappling with the embarrassing revelations and disappointed by the limitations imposed on their beloved football team. The university faced enormous financial strain from the fine and lost revenue from the bowl ban, affecting a broad range of initiatives and programs. The athletic program faced significant challenges in recruiting and retaining highly talented players and coaches after the scandal. The loss of revenue and opportunities to participate in postseason games forced the university to reevaluate its priorities and investment in its athletic programs. Moving Forward Penn State was able to recover more quickly from the consequences of the Sandusky scandal than initially expected. The university made significant efforts to demonstrate transparency, accountability, and a renewed commitment to the core values of the institution. The Nittany Lions broke their bowl ban in 2014, and as of 2016, Penn State restored 112 vacated wins. Commendably, the football program has shown resilience and the ability to rebuild while maintaining competitive excellence on the field. The Penn State scandal illustrated the tragic risks of failing to diligently investigate and address allegations of child sexual abuse. The penalties imposed by the NCAA served as a stark reminder of the obligations and responsibilities that universities have in ensuring the safety of all members of their community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They couldn't have been more different – Hunter, the top of his class, and Craig, the guy who was seemingly always on the edge of failing. Yet, fate had a funny way of bringing people together. Step 1: Introduce the characters and their contrasting personalities. As the semester began, Hunter dove straight into his studies, meticulously organizing his schedule and balancing his extracurricular activities. Craig, on the other hand, had an uncanny ability to procrastinate, cramming the night before exams and turning in assignments just before the deadline. Step 2: Elaborate on their different study habits and lifestyles. Despite their differences, they began to develop an unlikely friendship. As they spent more time together, Hunter started to discover Craig's hidden talents: he was a great musician, had a sharp wit, and was just as passionate about social issues as Hunter was about academics. Step 3: Develop their friendship through shared interests and qualities. Hunter realized that Craig's supposedly laissez-faire attitude towards his studies could actually be useful; it helped to alleviate the immense pressure he felt to always be at the top of his game. In turn, Craig admired Hunter's discipline and drive and began to take his academics more seriously, picking up study and organizational skills from his high-achieving roommate. Step 4: Show the characters learning from each other and growing as individuals. As the year progressed, they both recognized the value in maintaining a balanced lifestyle. Hunter encouraged Craig to join him in volunteering at a local food bank and tutoring underprivileged kids, while Craig managed to get Hunter to loosen up, taking him to concerts and teaching him how to play the guitar. Step 5: Highlight the positive impact of their friendship on each other's lives. By the end of the academic year, they had both changed for the better. Hunter had learned to appreciate life's non-academic pursuits, and his overall mental well-being had significantly improved. Craig's new-found focus and study habits started paying off, and he finished the year with the best grades he had ever managed. Step 6: Demonstrate the growth and progress the characters have achieved. What began as an unlikely pairing eventually turned into a life-changing friendship. Against all odds, Hunter and Craig became inseparable, proving that their differences were what made them the perfect pair. With their new bond and newfound balance, they were ready to face whatever challenges their next year of college would bring. Step 7: Conclude the story by reinforcing the importance of the friendship and their growth as individuals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Dry the garment carefully.\\"","completion":"Title: Treating Stubborn Stains and Drying Your Garment Properly: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction Every once in a while, even the most cautious individuals can experience the misfortune of staining their clothes. Whether it's due to an accidental spill of coffee or a splash of mud, a stubborn stain can quickly put a damper on your day. This article aims to provide you with a step-by-step guide to treating stains further if needed and drying your garment carefully to prevent damage. With these essential techniques, your clothing will be stain-free and ready to wear in no time. Step 1: Identifying the Stain Identifying the stain is crucial, as it helps you understand the best approach for treatment. Different stains require different treatments, ranging from simple at-home remedies to professional cleaning. Take your time to figure out the source of the stain and its characteristics. Step 2: Pre-Treatment Before proceeding with further treatment, always ensure you have pre-treated the stain. This process typically involves blotting the area with an absorbent cloth to remove excess moisture, gently scraping off dried residue, and applying a stain removal solution as per the manufacturer's instructions. Pre-treatment helps to break down the stain and prepare it for more effective treatment. Step 3: Assessing the Garment's Fabric Different fabrics require different levels of care. Check the garment's care label for guidelines on its fabric type and washing instructions. Always follow these instructions to preserve the quality and durability of the fabric and ensure you do not inadvertently cause further damage during treatment. Step 4: Treating the Stain If the initial pre-treatment fails to remove the stain completely, further treatment may be necessary. It is essential to tailor the treatment to the specific type of stain and fabric. For example, enzyme-based cleaners work best for protein-based stains, while vinegar and water solutions are more effective against mildew stains. Apply the chosen treatment and let it work its magic. It may take some time, but avoid rushing the process as it might cause damage to the garment. Step 5: Laundering the Garment Wash the garment based on its care label instructions, being careful to use the right detergent and water temperature. For particularly stubborn stains, you may consider using a pre-soak or adding a laundry booster to the wash cycle to increase the chances of stain removal. Step 6: Inspecting the Garment Before drying, always inspect the garment to ensure the stain is completely removed. If traces of the stain remain, repeat the treatment and washing process to try again. It is crucial not to dry the garment until the stain is entirely gone, as the heat can set the stain permanently. Step 7: Drying the Garment Carefully Drying your garment carefully is essential to avoid any potential damage, shrinkage, or color fading. If possible, air dry the garment by laying it flat or hanging it vertically to maintain its shape. Avoid direct sunlight or heat sources as it may cause fading or unnecessary stress on the fabric. If you must use a dryer, select the lowest heat setting and consult the garment's care label for specific drying instructions. Conclusion Treating stubborn stains and drying garments properly are essential skills for any individual looking to maintain their clothing's quality and prolong its life span. Remember that patience and attention to detail are key in successfully removing stains, preserving the fabric, and keeping your garments looking their best. With practice and knowledge, you'll soon become an expert in tackling even the most challenging stains and drying your clothing just right."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

She watched his graceful fingers ending in thick black claws tap out calculations on the panel. His pointed ears swiveled back and forth, catching every sound from the bridge, while his long tail swished to the rhythm of his thoughts. Only those of the Arrallin Insurrection inner team knew he was no common 'beta furry'. His silken fur, which would be tawny golden and striped with jet black bands, was dyed perfectly to a pure black, and his mane trimmed and thinned as to be indistinguishable from the rest of his coat. His eyes had been treated and darkened to a rich purple to disguise the brilliant golden yellow color that would mark him as an Alpha Arrallin, and leader of his hive.

When her grandmother needs to go to a nursing home, Carrie has to move in with her father Hank, a rancher in Wyoming, whom she hasn't seen since she was a baby. Initially reluctant to adapt to country living, Carrie soon meets Flicka, a beautiful black Mustang that previously had belonged to Carrie's cousin Katy, who asked Hank to look after Flicka when her father sold their own ranch. Flicka is wild and dangerous and, according to the ranchers, longs for Katy. However, when Carrie is attacked by a rattlesnake, Flicka saves her and the two form a bond. Carrie also meets Jake, an attractive ranch hand hoping to become a country singer, and Amy Walker, the proud and arrogant daughter of a neighbour. Although Jake and Carrie take an immediate liking to each other, there is instant animosity between Carrie and Amy, mainly because Amy also likes Jake.

Vivekananda Degree College was established in 2006. We want to find out if it has been more than 10,000 days ago or not. First, let's count how many days are in a year. There are 365 days in a year (but remember, sometimes there are 366 days because of leap years!). Now we need to figure out how many years have passed since 2006. Let's say it's 2021, so that makes it 2021 - 2006 = 15 years. Now we just have to count how many days are in 15 years. We start with 15 years * 365 days/year = 5,475 days. But, we also need to add the extra days from leap years. Since 2006, there have been 4 leap years (2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020). So we need to add 4 extra days. That gives us 5,475 + 4 = 5,479 days.

Donald Trump supporters spits on Latino protester at rally This is the latest face of civility at a Donald Trump rally: A man caught on camera cursing out an immigration activist and spitting on him. A video of that encounter is just one show of the tensions that erupted as the blabbering billionaire businessman brought his GOP presidential campaign to Richmond, Va., Wednesday night. Shortly after Trump started his speech to 5,000 people at the Richmond International Raceway, about a dozen Latino student protesters heckled him, shouting “We’re here to stay” and “Dump Trump,” according to reports from the scene. Trump supporters nearby stole the protesters’ signs, shoved them and yelled, “Go back where you came from!” Then came one troublemaking Trump lover, who spat in the face of one protester and yelled “F--- you!” eight times in 11 seconds until fellow fans pulled him away, as seen in video from a reporter. The hothead hasn’t been identified. Henrico County Police took one incident report at the rally, which did not involve spitting, and made no arrests, spokesman Lt. Chris Eley told the Daily News. This is at least the second time a xenophobic nut let loose at a rally for Trump, who has roused his supporters against undocumented immigrants. Less than a month ago, Trump remained silent as a man at a New Hampshire rally told him Muslims are “a problem in this country” and insisted, incorrectly, that President Obama is one. After public uproar about Trump’s non-response — which had no effect on his continuing dominance of GOP polls — the candidate said he was not “morally obligated” to correct the man. Unsurprisingly, Trump himself was in fighting mode as well Wednesday night, saving most of the venom in his hour-long speech for Democratic contender Bernie Sanders, whom he called a “maniac.” Trump said the proudly socialist Vermont senator is a “socialist-slash-communist,” and accused Hillary Clinton of trying to copy Sanders' views during Tuesday’s first Democratic debate. “She’s got to give everything away ‘cause this maniac that was standing to her right is giving everything away, so she’s following,” Trump said. “We have to be careful.” His remarks came the same day Trump’s campaign dropped an anti-Sanders ad online, saying the senator isn’t tough enough to handle a “dangerous” world with Islamic extremists in it. It’s unclear if Trump knew about the ruckus at his Richmond rally. After it ended, he posted a crowd photo on Instagram and wrote: “Incredible crowd in Richmond, Virginia tonight! So much spirit and energy!” What was this article about?","completion":"This article describes an incident that took place during a Donald Trump rally in Richmond, Virginia.

The article also discusses Trump's rhetoric during his speech, focusing primarily on Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, whom he criticized for their positions on various issues. Additionally, it mentions an anti-Sanders ad released by Trump's campaign, which questioned the senator's ability to handle a dangerous world with Islamic extremists.

He eyed the dishes before him, contemplating which to dive into first. Step 1: Describe the surroundings In order to immerse the reader, I will add details about the setting, creating a vivid atmosphere around James as he enjoys his meal. The dining room was warmly lit, with golden rays coming through the windows, painting the walls and table with their honeyed hue. The sound of laughter and clinking cutlery echoed throughout the room, as the whole family gathered around the large wooden table filled with various mouth-watering dishes. Step 2: Introduce the main dish Since the story already mentions steaming food, I'll introduce a specific, inviting meal as a focus for the story. The main course was a succulent roasted turkey, its skin evenly browned, and the aroma of herbs and spices enticing those seated around the table. James knew all too well that his mouth would water before even taking a single bite. Step 3: Describe the side dishes For a well-rounded dinner, side dishes are important to mention, giving the reader a sense of the variety and flavors of the meal. Alongside the turkey, there was an array of colorful side dishes; creamy mashed potatoes, crisp roasted vegetables, and soft, buttery dinner rolls.

James scooped up some mashed potatoes onto his plate and turned to his younger sister, Emily. \\"Would you like me to pass the potatoes?\\" he asked.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? making networks with new websites","completion":"To describe the sentiment of the tweet \\"making networks with new websites\\", we need to evaluate the tweet for any positive or negative connotations, emotional tone, and intent. In this case, we can consider the tweet to be neutral to slightly positive. 1. Neutral Sentiment: The tweet can be seen as neutral as it conveys a plain statement about an activity, which is creating networks with new websites. No overt positive or negative emotions are expressed in the text. It purely narrates an action, leaving the reader to place their own interpretation on the perception and feelings associated with the action. 2. Slightly Positive Sentiment: However, if we dig a bit deeper into the context of networking and establishing connections with new websites, we can interpret the tweet as having a slightly positive sentiment. It suggests that the person tweeting is actively engaged in expanding their online presence, fostering relationships, or collaborating with others. This could imply the person is open to new opportunities and embraces growth, which can be seen as an optimistic perspective. To elaborate further, in the digital era, networking is a crucial aspect of professional and personal development. Creating connections with new websites might indicate that the individual is keen on exploring new territories, discovering new resources, or tapping into innovative digital landscapes. They may be enthusiastic about leveraging these connections for mutual benefit or for broadening their knowledge base. However, it is important to note that the absence of adjectives, emoticons, or any other grammatical context to emphasize feelings or emotions allows for multiple interpretations. Depending on the background of the reader or their familiarity with the tweet's author, this tweet could be perceived with more emphasis on the neutral or positive sentiment as described earlier. Without more context or knowledge of the individual's usual tone and communication style, it is difficult to pin down the exact sentiment. In conclusion, the sentiment of the tweet \\"making networks with new websites\\" can be considered neutral to slightly positive. It states an action without explicit positive or negative emotions, but the context of networking may evoke a sense of growth and opportunity, leading to an optimistic interpretation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: 100 Girls Context: After leaving a party at a women's dormitory (aka the \\"virgin vault\\"), Matthew (Jonathan Tucker) is trapped in an elevator with an unknown, and unseen, woman when the power goes out. Matthew and this unknown woman have sex in the dark. When Matthew wakes up in the morning still in the elevator he finds himself alone with a pair of her panties.On a mission to find his mystery maiden by finding a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance boy of the virgin vault. He releases mice and goes room to room setting traps. He convinces the panicked women to leave the room and then starts to look for a match. This does not prove successful, and he continues to break things (such as the air conditioning) in an effort to find his woman. He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as \\"Jane-ites,\\" as they have a great interest in movies adapted from books by Jane Austen. He doesn't get much help from his roommate Rod (James DeBello), who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women. Rod tells him that he doesn't need a girlfriend and that it's futile to try to find the \\"matching bra the panties,\\" and Matthew accuses him of being too machismo. Rod introduces Matthew to his adopted idea of \\"penile power\\" that he uses to try to increase the size of his penis. We later find out that he does this, as well as the dissing of women entirely, as a ploy to try to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood.Early on, he watches as a woman named Patty (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and her boyfriend Crick fight. Crick is the epitome of the macho man stereotype, with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness. He wears a pony-tail, a manicured goatee, \\"male make-up,\\" and chews nicotine gum, much to Matthew's dismay. Matthew tries to save Patty, but is hurt by Crick. Crick leaves and Patty tries to help Matthew, but Matthew can't help but think of how Patty's reputation has been.While searching one room, Matthew finds...

First question: Computer Architecture: Why is context switching expensive on intel x86 chips? Second question: Why did the x86 architecture become more popular than the MIPS architecture? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: Computer Architecture: Why is context switching expensive on intel x86 chips? Step 1: Identify the components of context switching Context switching involves saving the current context (state and registers) of a task and loading the context of another task to resume its execution. Step 2: Explain the context switching mechanism in x86 chips In x86 chips, context switching can be more expensive due to a few factors, such as: - The complex variable-length instruction set, which can lead to more unpredictable pipeline behavior and increase the time it takes to save and restore task context. - A relatively small number of general-purpose registers, which makes it more likely that memory accesses will be needed during context switches, leading to additional overhead. - The hardware support for segmentation and paging, which requires updating segment and page tables during context switches, adds additional steps and complexity. Step 3: Provide the answer Context switching is expensive on Intel x86 chips due to its complex instruction set, small number of general-purpose registers, and hardware support for segmentation and paging, all of which contribute to increased overhead when saving and restoring task context. Second question: Why did the x86 architecture become more popular than the MIPS architecture? Step 1: Outline key differences between x86 and MIPS architectures The x86 architecture is a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture, whereas the MIPS architecture is a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture. The key differences between them are in the complexity of the instruction set and the overall design philosophy. Step 2: Explain the factors that contributed to the popularity of x86 The x86 architecture became more popular than the MIPS architecture for several reasons: - Backward compatibility: x86 provided strong backward compatibility, making it possible to run older software on newer hardware with little to no modifications. - Market dominance: Early success with IBM's choice of x86 processors for its personal computers helped establish x86 as the standard architecture for PCs, creating a larger market for x86-based systems and software. - Investment in technology and manufacturing: Intel, the primary company behind x86, invested heavily in manufacturing facilities and research, enabling it to produce and improve the high-performance, cost-effective chips that fueled the growth of the personal computer market. - Ecosystem and support: As x86 gained popularity, the software and hardware ecosystem that formed around it created a positive feedback loop, further cementing its market leadership. Step 3: Provide the answer The x86 architecture became more popular than the MIPS architecture due to its backward compatibility, early market dominance driven by IBM's adoption, Intel's investment in technology and manufacturing, and the robust ecosystem and support that developed around it. Are these two questions asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is about the expense of context switching on Intel x86 chips, and the second question is about the reasons behind the popularity of the x86 architecture compared to the MIPS architecture."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set.

Randy put toilet paper back on the roll, while Kevin did not, so","completion":"their household had a major disagreement over this seemingly small issue. Randy believed in the importance of maintaining a clean and presentable home, which to him, included things like hanging the toilet paper properly. He had grown up in a household where orderliness was highly valued, and this mindset was deeply ingrained in him. He had observed that in both his parents' and grandparents' homes, such simple acts of tidiness went a long way in contributing to a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. On the other hand, Kevin was more of a free spirit. He had grown up in a more laidback household, where keeping things tidy was not a top priority. For him, replacing the toilet paper on the roll was nothing more than a trivial act that had little bearing on the overall aura of the home. He believed that love and laughter were what made a house a home, not necessarily the adherence to a strict regimen of cleanliness. The difference in their backgrounds and habits led to a clash between the two roommates. Randy could not fathom how something so simple could be overlooked and would find himself getting frustrated, while Kevin was baffled by the focus on such a minor detail. As they spent more time living together, their disagreements over the toilet paper were merely the tip of the iceberg; they discovered that they had vastly different approaches to managing shared spaces, such as the kitchen and living room. This friction affected their ability to enjoy each other's company and eventually led to serious conversations about the future of their living arrangement. In order to avoid further conflicts and maintain their friendship, Randy and Kevin decided to sit down and discuss the matter openly. They acknowledged that their respective upbringings had a major influence on their views and behaviors, and they agreed that it was important for both of them to compromise in order to create a harmonious living environment. They decided to establish certain ground rules, highlighting areas where they could both make concessions. Randy agreed to loosen up a bit on his expectations and not become too upset over small infractions, recognizing that Kevin's relaxed nature was part of his personality and actually brought some balance to their lives. Meanwhile, Kevin promised to be more attentive to keeping shared areas tidy and following the basic household etiquette that Randy held dear, such as replacing the toilet paper on the roll. With these new agreements in place, the tension in their home began to dissolve. They grew to appreciate the differences they brought to the table, and their friendship blossomed as they learned to navigate their contrasting perspectives. The toilet paper issue became a reminder of the importance of open communication, compromise, and accepting one another's unique backgrounds and beliefs. As months went by, Randy and Kevin's household transformed into a blend of their individual styles. They no longer saw their differences as a source of conflict, but rather as an opportunity to learn from one another and create a home that reflected both of their personalities. And so, the seemingly inconsequential matter of toilet paper placement turned out to be a valuable lesson in understanding, growth, and friendship for Randy and Kevin. Who knew that such a small detail could lead to such profound insights and change their lives in ways they could not have imagined?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It also shows that they feel good about life, that they just want to be themselves and enjoy life, and that they are not afraid of problems. Hip-hop dancing has a history of more than 30 years. It first began in the 1980s in the US. In early times, it was seen in New York and Los Angeles. At that time, many young black people often danced to music in the streets. They used their legs, arms, heads and even shoulders to dance. Many young people still use most of these moves today. Hip-pop dancing became popular all over the world because of the 1983 movie Flash Dance. Some people performed Hip-hop dancing in the movie. People enjoyed their performances. They began to dance like them. Then it became popular. There are two kinds of Hip-pop dancing: the new school and the old school. More and more young people are learning Hip-pop dancing.

Given the question: Given the following context: Although the publicity generated by Five Leaves Left was minor, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened.

This album was a groundbreaking fusion of classical and rock music, as the band collaborated with The London Festival Orchestra conducted by Peter Knight. \\"Nights in White Satin\\" has since become one of The Moody Blues' most famous and enduring hits, with its haunting melodies and poetic lyrics resonating with fans across generations. The song continues to be covered by various artists through the years, though none have eclipsed the original's timeless quality. Justin Hayward has been quoted as saying that he wrote the song when he was only 19 years old, inspired by an emotion of love and passion. Interestingly, the song didn't become a major hit until 1972 when it was reissued to much greater success, reaching number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. This popularity encouraged The Moody Blues to incorporate it into their live performances, and it remains a staple of their concerts to this day. The song's title refers to the feeling of longing and desire that the lyrics explore, with \\"white satin\\" symbolizing the emotions that surround love and the elusiveness of happiness. The song has been interpreted by many to be about unrequited love or the complexity of romantic relationships, making it a poignant and touching ballad that still connects with audiences today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

John von Neumann Von Neumann was the first to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, known as the Dirac–von Neumann axioms, with his 1932 work Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics. After having completed the axiomatization of set theory, he began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics. He realized, in 1926, that a state of a quantum system could be represented by a point in a (complex) Hilbert space that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. In this formalism of quantum mechanics, observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as linear operators acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system.

Q:Given the below context: At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in...

He didn't want to risk ending up with an uneven or unsatisfactory haircut, especially since he had an important job interview scheduled for the following week. Samuel knew that first impressions were crucial, and he wanted to ensure that his physical appearance would be on point for this significant event in his life. Knowing that Samuel was rather particular about his hair, Kevin suggested that they visit a professional hair stylist. Kevin had a friend who was a hairdresser, and he knew that she was experienced in working with all sorts of hair types. He believed that she would be able to provide Samuel with the haircut that he desired and help him make a great first impression at his job interview. Reluctantly, Samuel agreed, and together they went to the hair salon where Kevin's friend worked. Upon arrival, they were greeted warmly by the stylist, who quickly assessed Samuel's hair and discussed several haircut options that would suit his face shape and personal style. After some consultation, Samuel decided on a classic taper haircut with a slightly modern twist, as he believed it would be the perfect blend of professional and stylish. While waiting for his haircut, Samuel browsed through the various hair care products displayed in the salon, looking for shampoo and conditioner specifically designed for his hair type. He knew that maintaining the health and appearance of his hair were essential to creating a polished and put-together look. As the stylist began working on Samuel's haircut, Kevin watched intently, taking note of the techniques she was using and asking questions to understand the process better. He hoped to improve his own hair cutting skills to offer better assistance to Samuel and other friends in the future. Throughout the haircut, the stylist offered helpful tips for Samuel to maintain the style after leaving the salon. She also discussed the importance of regular trims to keep the ends of his hair healthy and encouraged him to invest in quality hair care products to prolong the life of his cut. Once the hairstylist finished, Samuel looked in the mirror and was amazed at the transformation. His hair was expertly crafted into the perfect style that conveyed confidence and professionalism. He thanked the hairstylist for her excellent work and left the salon feeling like a new man, ready to tackle his upcoming job interview with confidence. In the end, although initially apprehensive about relying on someone with more experience for his haircut, Samuel felt grateful for Kevin's advice and the skilled work of the hairstylist. Sometimes, it is necessary to recognize when to trust in the expertise of others to achieve the best results possible.

This really began to get me down but life carried on and thus so did I. Life in the pub trade with just me and my parents working also became more difficult because of a severe illness that nearly overtook my mum . With just me and my dad working busy weekends it really did get frantic at times . Why might it be hard for me to get another job outside of the pub ?","completion":"There may be several factors that can make it challenging for you to find another job outside of the pub trade. Here is a detailed analysis of some primary reasons: 1. Limited work experience: Having worked mostly within your family's pub trade, employers in other sectors may see your work experience as limited to a specific field. This could make it harder for them to understand and appreciate the transferable skills you may have developed during your time in the pub industry. 2. Long-term employment in a single industry: Working in the pub trade for an extended period might lead potential employers to perceive you as someone who is less adaptable to new work environments and roles. This perception might make them hesitant to consider you for positions in sectors that are significantly different from your experience. 3. Overspecialization: Throughout your years working in the pub trade, you might have acquired a highly specialized skill set tailored to the industry. While these skills are valuable in the pub sector, they may not necessarily translate well to other industries, limiting the range of roles you can apply for and potentially making your job search more challenging. 4. Education and qualifications: Your years spent studying after school without obtaining specific qualifications or degrees might make it harder for you to compete with other candidates who have more focused academic qualifications or certifications in their fields. 5. Personal and family circumstances: Your parents' illness and the challenges involved in keeping the pub business running might have affected your availability to fully engage in a comprehensive job search. Finding a job in a new industry typically requires dedicated time and energy, which can be difficult when managing personal and family commitments. 6. Network limitations: The majority of job seekers find new opportunities through personal and professional networks. If your social and professional circles revolve around the pub trade, you may need to actively work on expanding your network and connecting with people in other industries to increase your chances of finding job offers. 7. Lack of confidence: The combination of uncertain career goals, personal struggles, and work-related challenges might have led to low self-confidence, which can impact your pursuit of job opportunities outside of the pub trade. Confidence in oneself and one's skills is essential for a successful job search. To overcome these obstacles, it is critical to focus on identifying and developing transferable skills, acquiring relevant qualifications, expanding your professional network, and bolstering self-confidence. With persistence and determination, you can eventually find a job that aligns with your interests and skillset outside of the pub trade."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was a lovely Saturday afternoon, and they had decided to invite a few friends over for dinner. Knowing their strengths and weaknesses, the two friends agreed that Carrie would be in charge of preparing the meal, while Rebecca would take care of setting the table and playing hostess. Step 1: Discuss the menu The first thing Carrie did was discuss the menu with Rebecca. To cater to everyone's taste, they decided on a simple, classic menu: a salad for appetizer, a pasta dish for the main course, and a fruit salad for dessert. Step 2: Make a shopping list After deciding on the menu, Carrie quickly made a shopping list. She outlined all the ingredients needed for each dish, making sure to consider any dietary restrictions their guests might have. Step 3: Shop for ingredients Carrie and Rebecca headed to the nearby supermarket and picked up all the ingredients on the shopping list. Carrie carefully checked the freshness and quality of the produce, while Rebecca made sure to find the best deals on the items they needed. Step 4: Begin food preparation Once they returned to the apartment, it was time for Carrie to start preparing the meal. She began by washing and chopping the vegetables for the salad, then prepared a simple dressing from olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Next, she moved on to the pasta dish. Carrie opted for a classic marinara sauce, simmering crushed tomatoes, garlic, onion, and fresh basil to create a rich, savory aroma that filled the apartment. Step 5: Enlist Rebecca's help with easy tasks Although Rebecca wasn't skilled in the kitchen, Carrie knew she could still help with some tasks. She had Rebecca toast some bread for the salad and grate parmesan cheese for the pasta. This made the cooking process faster, and it allowed them to bond while working together. Step 6: Cook the pasta As the sauce finished simmering, Carrie boiled water and cooked the pasta al dente. She carefully read the package instructions to avoid overcooking it and to ensure the pasta was perfectly cooked and tender. Step 7: Prepare the fruit salad While the pasta was cooking, Carrie prepared the fruit salad. She washed, peeled, and cut various fruits, including strawberries, grapes, kiwi, and pineapple. Then she gently mixed them together in a large bowl. Step 8: Set the table While Carrie was busy in the kitchen, Rebecca set the table, folding cloth napkins into intricate shapes and adding a beautiful centerpiece of fresh flowers. She also set out glasses for drinks, utensils, and plates for each course. Step 9: Serve and enjoy With everything ready, Carrie and Rebecca called their guests to the dining area. They started with the salad, followed by the pasta dish and then the refreshing fruit salad for dessert.

Lilly Squires is in charge of the human police investigating these cases. She states that she comes from a workhouse in this same slum, and we establish that she is one of the few cops who care what happens to these people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap. Lilly finds a small boy who witnesses one attack, and tells her that a Brother was responsible. As the police don't want to panic the city, the string of murders is explained away as being the result of an outbreak of the rampant influenza virus. Silus is detailed by the church cardinals to work with the human police, because the Brothers know that these attacks have been carried out by a Brother; Silus's brother Edgar.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph: Staying balanced when riding a scooter requires control over the body’s muscles. The nervous system controls the muscles and maintains balance. Q: What helps control the muscles and maintain balance? A: Answer:","completion":"The nervous system plays a critical role in helping control the muscles and maintain balance when riding a scooter. This complex network in our body is composed of various structures, pathways, and mechanisms that work together to ensure that we can move, perform tasks, and remain stable while doing so. When riding a scooter, the process begins with sensory inputs from the body's proprioceptive system, which is responsible for detecting changes in muscle length, tension, and joint position. This information is then constantly relayed to the central nervous system (CNS), comprising the brain and spinal cord. The CNS processes this data and evaluates the body's position, alignment, and balance in relation to the scooter. In addition to proprioceptive information, the CNS also integrates information from other sensory systems such as the vestibular system, which is located in the inner ear and responsible for detecting head movement, and the visual system, which processes visual cues from the surroundings. These inputs allow the brain to assess the body's position and whether or not it is in balance, enabling it to respond quickly and adjust accordingly to maintain stability. Once the CNS has evaluated this information, it sends signals through the peripheral nervous system (PNS) to the muscles that are responsible for maintaining balance while riding. These signals, known as motor commands or action potentials, are transmitted through nerve fibers called motor neurons. These motor neurons connect with muscle fibers in a specialized junction called the neuromuscular junction, where the release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine triggers muscle contraction. By controlling the level of muscle contraction, the nervous system helps maintain the ideal position and coordination required for balance during scooter riding. For instance, core muscles, which are crucial for stability, need to be engaged properly. Also, the muscles responsible for moving the scooter forward or turning it – mainly located in the legs and feet – need to work in harmony with the rest of the body. Additionally, rapid reflexes and adjustments are essential for maintaining balance, especially when encountering irregular terrain or sudden obstacles. These involuntary responses are facilitated by the body's reflex arcs, which help bypass the relatively slower CNS processing by instantly reacting to sensory signals and producing automatic motor responses. Examples of reflexes at play while riding a scooter include the stretch reflex, which helps maintain muscle tone, and the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which keeps the eyes stable and focused on the visual environment despite head movement. In summary, the nervous system helps control the muscles and maintain balance when riding a scooter by constantly gathering sensory information, processing it within the central nervous system, and issuing motor commands via the peripheral nervous system. This intricate collaboration between various sensory systems and muscle groups enables the rider to make essential adjustments to stay upright, maintain equilibrium, and demonstrate a skillful ride."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If I tell you that Rivers turn rocks into soil, and ask you the question \\"what do rivers do to rocks?\\", is the correct answer \\"storing water\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"what do rivers do to rocks?\\" is not \\"storing water.\\" Instead, rivers contribute to the process of weathering and erosion of rocks, gradually breaking them down into smaller particles and eventually helping to form soil. Rivers accomplish this through a combination of physical and chemical processes. As the river water flows, it generates friction and force, which can dislodge and carry away rock fragments. Over time, this process can wear the rocks down, rounding and smoothing their surfaces, and reducing them to smaller particles known as sediment. Additionally, dissolved substances in the river water can cause chemical reactions with the rocks, further breaking them down. As a result, rivers play an important role in shaping the landscape and contributing to the formation of soil. While rivers do store and transport water, this is not directly related to their action on rocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, the context and specific circumstances in each case will affect the accessibility and public availability of these toilets. - Bathroom: This is the most obvious place where you would find a toilet. However, there is a significant distinction between private and public bathrooms. A bathroom in a person's house is not accessible to everyone. However, a public bathroom in a shopping mall, airport, train station, or other public places are meant for anyone to use. - Apartment: An apartment is a private space, so although it's likely that there is a toilet in it, it's not accessible to anyone unless the residents permit them to do so. Hence, an apartment is not typically where anyone can freely use a toilet. - Stall: The term 'stall' might refer to a toilet stall, which is again found inside a bathroom. These are generally public and meant for anyone to use. If 'stall' refers to a vendor's stall or a stable, it does not usually have a toilet. - Hospital: Hospitals have both public and private toilets. Public toilets in the lobbies and waiting areas are generally accessible to anyone. But the toilets in patient rooms or certain wards may be reserved for patients or specific users. - Rest Area: Rest areas, often found on highways and interstates, commonly provide public toilet facilities. These are available for all travelers or commuters to use during their journey, making them a great place to find toilets that anyone can use.

How does the sentence end? Accra, March 6 1957. Tens of thousands of rejoicing people flood the streets of the city center. Shouts of \\"freedom, freedom\\" fill the air as men, women and children sing and dance, celebrating the birth of a new state and the beginning of a new era: an independent Ghana. At midnight on that historic day, Britain's Union Jack was taken down above Parliament House in the capital, replaced by Ghana's new flag -- a black star at the heart of a red, gold and green tricolor. At that moment, to the cheering of an ecstatic crowd, Ghana became the first African country south of the Sahara to break the chains of colonialism. The event triggered a liberation movement that was destined to sweep the entire continent and eventually lead to the demise of colonial rule in Africa. The country is often described as \\" OPTIONS: - Accra for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Africa for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - African for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Britain for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Ghana for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Gold Coast for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Great Britain for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Nation for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Parliament House for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Sahara for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. - Union Jack for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife.","completion":"\\"Africa for beginners,\\" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. The correct answer is \\"Africa for beginners,\\" because it describes Ghana as an accessible and inviting introduction to the diverse experiences that the African continent has to offer.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A tender woman, or an independent one, which one would you prefer? Arecent research shows that most people would choose the latter. This type of woman is called a nuhanzi (\\"tough woman\\"). Experts believe these characteristics have social and psychological roots among young femalesin China. Su Hao's friends all call her a tough woman, because she can finish tough tasks usually carried out by men. For example, she carries 10-litre water to her dormitory on the 5th floor. \\"I depend on no one but myself,\\" she says. According to a recent survey by China Youth Daily, tough women have become rather common in society. Of the 21,265 respondents, 78.5 percent said they are familiar with a tough woman. About 50 percent said they like women with tough characteristics, while less than 29 percent expressed the opposite view. Why are tough women gaining popularity? Shen Meng, a psychological consultant, believes the fierce competition in society is contributing to this trend. \\"Women are often in a disadvantaged position compared to men,\\" Shen says. \\"In order to survive, they have to be independent, strong and tough.\\" Liu Xiao lin, professor of psychology at Wuhan Mental Health Center, believes tough women are brought up this way. They are often on close relationship with their fathers, who teach their daughters to be brave and decisive,\\" he says. As a result, these women are more likely to be psychologically healthy and more tolerant to stress, according to Liu. Though Liu believes that this is a good trend, Hu Shenzhi, a psychologist at the Guangdong Sunflower Counseling Center, says the popularity of tough woman indicates an unclear line between gender identities, which can lead to relationship problems. \\"Some women with characteristics that differ from the traditional female image may have a difficult time finding Mr Right,\\" he says.\\"Even if they get married, their manly characteristics might cause family conflicts. Question: Which of the followings does NOT belong to the characteristics of a tough woman? Options: A: She is soft and tender to others. B: She is independent of others in daily life.

Article: You should continue to wash your tattoo 2-3 times a day with antibacterial soap and lukewarm water until it's fully healed. This can take anywhere from 2 to 6 weeks, depending on the size and location of the tattoo. While moisturizing is important, be careful not to smother the tattoo in lotion or ointment—a thin layer is all you need. Continue using an unscented mild soap when washing. As it heals, your tattoo will start to scab over, which is normal. Let the scabs dry out and fall off by themselves, and don't speed up the process by picking or scratching at the scabs. This can cause the scabs to fall off too soon, which can leave holes or light spots on the tattoo. Dry, scabbing or peeling skin can become very itchy, but scratching at your tattoo may also cause scabs to fall off. Keep using moisturizing ointment to combat itchiness if it is a problem. The harsh rays of the sun may cause your skin to blister and bleach some of the colors from your tattoo. For this reason, it is best to keep your tattoo covered and away from the sun for at least 3 to 4 weeks until the initial healing is complete. Once your tattoo is healed, you'll want to wear sunscreen to prevent the tattoo from fading. Until your tattoo is fully healed, don't swim in a pool or the ocean. Avoid soaking in the bathtub as well. Exposing your tattoo to lots of water can pull the ink out of your skin and do damage to the tattoo's appearance. The water may also be carrying dirt, bacteria, or other chemicals that can infect your tattoo. It will be safe to resume these activities once your tattoo is healed, but for now you should stick to rinsing your tattoo in the sink or shower. Try not to wear tight or restrictive clothing on the area with your new tattoo, especially at first. As your tattoo heals, it will seep plasma and excess ink, which may cause the clothing to stick to the tattoo. The clothing will then be painful to remove and may rip off any freshly formed scabs. If your clothing does stick to your tattoo, do not pull! First wet the area with water, which should loosen the clothing to where it can be removed without damaging your tattoo. Tight clothing will prevent enough oxygen from getting to your tattoo, and oxygen is essential for the healing process. If the tattoo covers a large surface area or is near your joints (such as elbows and knees), it may take longer to heal if the skin is forced to move around too much during physical activity. The movement will cause the skin to crack and become irritated, prolonging the healing process. If you work in a job that involves physical activity, such as construction or dance, you may want to consider having your new tattoo done right before you have a day or 2 off so it has time to heal before you return to work. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of a longer text. So, for this article, the summary would be: To take care of a new tattoo, wash it 2-3 times a day with special soap and water, and put a little bit of special lotion on it. Don't scratch it, and keep it away from too much sun and water for about a month. Also, don't wear tight clothes on the tattoo and be careful with moving a lot if the tattoo is near places like elbows or knees. Doing these things will help the tattoo heal and look nice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Tässä kattavassa raportissa käsitellään Latinalaisen Amerikan alueen nykytilannetta ja tulevaisuudennäkymiä, ja siinä tarkastellaan erityisesti Euroopan unionin ja Etelä-Amerikan maiden välisiä suhteita. Raportissa tunnustetaan, että yhteistyö ja vuoropuhelu näiden kahden alueen välillä ovat välttämättömiä kestävän kehityksen saavuttamiseksi ja maailmanlaajuisten haasteiden kuten ilmastonmuutoksen, köyhyyden ja eriarvoisuuden torjumiseksi.

No; These two sentences do not mean the same thing, and here's why: In sentence (1), we have: \\"Then Tyrone tells him who Tommy is.\\" This sentence implies that Tyrone, a person in the conversation, is explaining to someone else the identity or details about a third person named Tommy. Tyrone is the one providing the information, and Tommy is the subject being discussed. In sentence (2), we have: \\"Tommy then tells him who Tyrone is.\\" Here, the roles are reversed. Tommy is now the one providing information, and he is explaining the identity or details about Tyrone to someone else. In this case, Tommy is the one sharing information, and Tyrone is the subject being discussed.

Multi-choice question: What is the sentiment of the following tweet? Tweet: I just setup My Twi page Pick from: A). negative B). positive","completion":"Based on the given tweet, it would be accurate to select B). Positive as the sentiment of the tweet. To understand why, let's start by breaking down the tweet and providing a more detailed explanation. The tweet reads: \\"I just setup My Twi page.\\" First, it's important to identify that the term \\"Twi\\" is most likely an abbreviation for \\"Twitter.\\" Thus, the user is talking about setting up their Twitter page. Now let's analyze the possible emotions or feelings conveyed through this tweet. The tweet does not contain any explicitly negative words or phrases, such as complaints, dissatisfaction, anger, or sadness. Instead, it is merely stating that the individual has completed the action of setting up their Twitter page. In this context, they might be feeling a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction from finishing the process. Furthermore, people usually share their achievements or positive experiences on social media to elicit reactions from others, such as likes, comments, or shares. Intuitively, people are less inclined to post about negative experiences or events that evoke unpleasant emotions. Considering the content and context of the tweet, we can reasonably infer that it carries a positive sentiment. While the tweet's phrasing may not be overtly enthusiastic, it conveys a subtle sense of excitement or eagerness to share their new Twitter page with others. People often announce their presence on a new platform, expecting others to connect with them, follow their updates, and participate in their online community, which typically stem from a positive stance. Therefore, option B). Positive would be the most suitable choice for describing the sentiment expressed in the given tweet. To recap, based on the analysis of the tweet content and the context it is shared in, we can confidently determine that the sentiment of the tweet is positive, making option B) the correct choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: What are some Filipino traditions? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answer to Question 1: Filipino traditions and beliefs largely stem from a mix of indigenous, Spanish, and American influences, as well as their Malay roots. The island nation of Cyprus, on the other hand, boasts of traditions and beliefs influenced by a blend of Greek, Turkish, and Middle Eastern cultures. Comparing and contrasting the two cultures reveals certain similarities and differences. Examples of Filipino traditions and beliefs include: 1. Bayanihan: This is the spirit of community and helping one another, especially in times of need. Whenever someone needs to move their house, for instance, their neighbors would readily help. 2. \\"Mano po\\" gesture: Younger individuals show respect to their elders by taking the elder's hand and pressing the back of it to their forehead. This gesture signifies honor and gratitude. 3. Pagmamano: This tradition is observed during times of celebration, such as on New Year's Day and Christmas, where children receive blessings from their elders in the form of small gifts or money. 4. Simbang Gabi: A nine-day series of religious masses leading up to Christmas that start in the early morning, symbolizing the preparation for the birth of Jesus Christ. 5. Superstitions: Filipinos are generally superstitious, with beliefs surrounding various aspects of life, from weddings and funerals to acquiring good luck or warding off evil spirits. Examples of Cypriot traditions and beliefs include: 1. Kourabiedes and Melomakarona: Traditional sweets prepared and served during the Christmas season. 2. Easter Celebrations: Greek Orthodox Easter is the most important religious event in Cyprus, featuring various religious processions and customs, such as the Good Saturday Rocket War and the tradition of coloring eggs. 3. Weddings: Traditional Cypriot weddings involve a series of events and rituals, like the bride's \\"stolisma\\" where the bride is dressed in her wedding gown, or the \\"koumparo\\" and \\"koumbara\\" roles, which are given to the couple's best man and maid of honor. 4. Name Days: Celebrated in place of birthdays, name days are observed on the feast day of the saint one was named after. 5. Evil Eye: Cypriots share a belief in the \\"evil eye,\\" where envy or malicious intent can bring bad luck or misfortune to the person receiving it. To ward off the evil eye, people hang protective charms and amulets in their homes and cars. While there are differences between Filipino and Cypriot traditions and beliefs, some similarities can be drawn, such as the strong emphasis on family, respect for elders, and the importance of religious celebrations. Answer to Question 2: Some Filipino traditions include: 1. Bayanihan: The act of coming together as a community and helping one another in times of need. 2. \\"Mano po\\" gesture: A sign of respect and gratitude performed by younger individuals towards their elders by taking the elder's hand and pressing it to their forehead. 3. Pagmamano: The tradition of children receiving blessings and small gifts from their elders during festive occasions like Christmas and New Year's Day. 4. Simbang Gabi: A nine-day series of religious masses held before dawn, leading up to Christmas, symbolizing the preparation for Jesus Christ's birth. 5. Fiestas: Vibrant and colorful celebrations held in honor of patron saints, marked by parades, processions, and feasting on various Filipino dishes. 6. Harana: A serenade tradition where a man expresses his love and affection by singing romantic songs to the woman he is courting, usually outside her window. 7. Debut: A coming-of-age celebration for young women turning 18, signifying their transition into womanhood. 8. Panlilimos: A practice of soliciting donations during special occasions, such as birthdays and funerals, to help offset the financial burden of the event.

Jeremy is frequently exposed to sounds with high decibel levels due to being around these machines so often. Jeremy's brother, Alexander, on the other hand works in a library. Unlike Jeremy, Alexander is frequently exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels during his work. Hint: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing.

Movie title: Crank Movie plot: Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is a Los Angeles-based British hitman, working for a crime syndicate headed by Carlito (Carlos Sanz). Chelios is contracted by Carlito to kill mafia boss Don Kim (Keone Young) as members of the Triads have been encroaching on Carlito's business. Chelios goes to Don Kim and apparently murders him. However, Ricky Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo), an ambitious small-time criminal uses the opportunity to conspire with Carlito against Chelios; Verona will kill Chelios so the Triads do not retaliate, and then take Chelios's place as Carlito's new hired gun. The morning after Don Kim's death, while Chelios sleeps in his apartment, Verona, his brother Alex (Jay Xcala), and several henchmen break in and inject Chelios with a Chinese synthetic drug which inhibits the flow of adrenaline, slowing the heart and eventually killing the victim. Chelios wakes to find a recording left by Verona showing what he has done. In anger, Chelios smashes his TV and heads out. Chelios phones Mafia surgeon Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam), who informs Chelios that in order to survive he must keep his adrenaline pumping through constant excitement and danger, and he is unsure if the antidote exists. Chelios keeps his adrenaline up through reckless and dangerous acts like picking fights with other gangsters, taking illegal drugs and synthetic epinephrine, fighting with police, stealing a police officer's motorcycle, having public sex with his girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart), and driving his car through a shopping mall. Chelios visits Carlito at his penthouse and asks him to help find an antidote, as well as to find and kill Verona and his crew. Carlito says there is no antidote and only confirms that Carlito and Verona are working together. Carlito tells Chelios how he will use his death as a scapegoat against the Chinese. An angered Chelios leaves Carlito's penthouse to find Verona. Through Chelios' street contact, a transvestite named Kaylo (Efren Ramirez), he finds Alex at a restaurant and unsuccessfully interrogates him... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Crank,\\" Carlito leads a wealthy Mexican-American crime syndicate in Los Angeles. As the head of this powerful criminal organization, Carlito is responsible for various illegal activities and operations in the area. He contracts Chev Chelios, a British hitman, to take down Mafia boss Don Kim, as the Triads have started to threaten the syndicate's business interests. Carlito's crime syndicate is deeply involved in organized criminal activities, including but not limited to, drug trafficking, contract killings, extortion, and racketeering. While he is focused on maintaining control over his criminal empire, he becomes vulnerable to the ambitions of a small-time criminal named Ricky Verona, who conspires with Carlito to eliminate Chelios and take his place as the syndicate's primary hired gun. Throughout the movie, Chelios fights to stay alive and seeks revenge against those who have betrayed him. As the story unfolds, it becomes evident that Carlito is not to be trusted, and Chelios' relentless pursuit of adrenaline-fueled activities brings him closer and closer to his ultimate goal: exacting revenge upon his enemies and uncovering the truth. Ultimately, from an investment perspective, the film's proposal presents a high-octane, action-packed narrative with a strong cast including Jason Statham, Amy Smart, and Carlos Sanz. Whether or not to invest depends on several factors, such as the expected production budget, the potential audience, and comparables from similar film genres. If the movie aligns with your investment goals and preferences, it can turn out to be an exciting opportunity. In conclusion, Carlito leads a wealthy Mexican-American crime syndicate in Los Angeles, and the constant twists and turns of \\"Crank\\" offer a thrilling experience for viewers. Investing in the film proposal could prove to be a rewarding endeavor, provided the other factors mentioned above are taken into account."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Solve this instance: Background Paragraph: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). Story: Robert and his brother Dale are both dairy farmers that primarily produce milk products. Both Robert and Dale have farms that approximately the same size. Dale prefers to produce milk conventionally, as he likes the way that conventional milk tastes. Robert, on the other hand, decided to switch to organic milk production after reading an article online about it. Question: Whose farm, Robert's or Dale's, will produce lower emissions of methane?

Q:Bill is setting his cup on a table. He puts a napkin under it to avoid leaving what? - noise - knocking over - put down - doesn - water mark The best answer is A:","completion":"The best answer is \\"water mark.\\" When Bill puts a napkin under his cup on the table, he is trying to prevent the formation of a water mark on the table's surface. Water marks, also known as \\"coaster marks,\\" \\"condensation rings,\\" or \\"water rings,\\" are the marks left on surfaces, typically wooden ones, by the condensation from cold beverages or hot items such as cups or mugs. These marks are created when moisture from the cup or mug interacts with the table's finish, causing it to become cloudy, discolored, or even slightly raised. By using a napkin as a barrier between the cup and the table, Bill is protecting the table from any potential damage caused by the moisture and keeping the surface looking clean and unblemished. The other options provided do not accurately describe the purpose of placing a napkin under a cup on a table: - Noise: While placing a napkin under a cup might marginally reduce the noise made when setting the cup down, this is not the primary reason for doing so. - Knocking over: A napkin does not provide any significant stabilization to a cup, and will not prevent it from being knocked over if accidentally bumped or pushed. - Put down: This phrase does not make sense in the context of placing a napkin under a cup. \\"Put down\\" could refer to setting something down in general, but it does not specifically indicate the reason for placing a napkin underneath the cup. - Doesn: This option seems to be an incomplete or incorrect word, and does not provide any meaningful answer to the question.

Article: Speaking two languages can actually help offset some effects of aging on the brain, a new study has found. Researchers tested how long it took participants to switch from one cognitive task to another, something that's known to take longer for older adults, said lead researcher, Brian Gold, a neuroscientist at the University of Kentucky. Gold's team compared task-switching speeds for younger and older adults, knowing they would find slower speeds in the older population because of previous studies. However, they found that older adults who spoke two languages were able to switch mental activities faster than those didn't . The study only looked at life-long bilinguals, defined in study as people who had spoken a second language daily since they were at least 10 years old. Gold and his team asked 30 people, either bilingual or monolingual , to have a series of tests. They found that bilingual people were not only able to switch tasks faster, they had different brain activity than their monolingual peers. Kristina called bilingualism \\"a beautiful natural experiment\\", because people grow up speaking two languages,and studies have shown that they get certain cognitive benefits from switching between languages and determining which to respond with based on what's going on around them. Gold said he grew up in Montreal, where he spoke French at school and English at home, prompting relatives to question whether his French language immersion would somehow hinder his ability to learn English. \\"Until very recently, learning a second language in childhood was thought of as dangerous,\\" he said. \\"Actually, it's beneficial. \\" Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

When an ally of the Ü-Tsang ruler threatened destruction of the Gelugpas again, the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso pleaded for help from the Mongol prince Güshi Khan (1582–1655), leader of the Khoshut (Qoshot) tribe of the Oirat Mongols, who was then on a pilgrimage to Lhasa. Güshi Khan accepted his role as protector, and from 1637–1640 he not only defeated the Gelugpas' enemies in the Amdo and Kham regions, but also resettled his entire tribe into Amdo. Sonam Chöpel urged Güshi Khan to assault the Ü-Tsang king's homebase of Shigatse, which Güshi Khan agreed upon, enlisting the aid of Gelug monks and supporters. In 1642, after a year's siege of Shigatse, the Ü-Tsang forces surrendered. Güshi Khan then captured and summarily executed Karma Tenkyong, the ruler of Ü-Tsang, King of Tibet.Soon after the victory in Ü-Tsang, Güshi Khan organized a welcoming ceremony for Lozang Gyatso once he arrived a day's ride from Shigatse, presenting his conquest of Tibet as a gift to the Dalai Lama. In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel. Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \\"supreme authority\\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign. However, Rawski states that he eventually \\"expanded his own authority by presenting himself as Avalokiteśvara through the performance of rituals,\\" by building the Potala Palace and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies.

On bended knee: Sam Sheppard, 34, right, launched her proposal expert company after her boyfriend Ryan, left, offered her such a disappointing one. Catering for clients with any budget - from £10 to £10,000 - Sam has already helped couples all over the UK get engaged, and boasts a 100 per cent success rate. She said: 'The idea came from my own disappointing experience - my boyfriend, Ryan Galeozzi, proposed to me during an argument in the same way you might ask someone if they'd like to go for a pizza. 'When he proposed I didn't even realise what he was asking. He said he spent too long looking and planning and in the end he just blurted it out. 'At the time I thought it was because. he didn't care enough to put any effort into it, but once he explained I. realised I was being silly. He said he wants to have another go, so now I'm just waiting.' You have got to be kidding: Sam doesn't want other women to be as let down as she was when their boyfriend's finally pop the question. She said: 'I want to help other people not to feel how I felt. Initially, I felt like he couldn't really care about me to have asked that way, though of course I know that's not true at all.' Sam spends up to three weeks planning the perfect way for the prospective groom - or bride - to propose. The client can choose from a number. of packages, ranging from an bespoke ideas consultation costing under. £100, to a full proposal planning service, where Sam organises every. aspect of the proposal, including negotiating a discount with venues and. vendors and handling payments. Sam added: 'I ask key questions to put together the pieces of the puzzle - what makes their partner laugh, how they spend their Saturday mornings - those little things build up a picture. 'Once we've got the idea, the proposer can then have as much or as little input as they like.' Be mine? Ryan and Sam have been together for four years, but Ryan says he is planning to propose all over again because Sam was so disappointed by his first attempt. Clients can even choose to have their proposal recorded or photographed with a paparazzi-style lens. Sam said: 'A lot of guys use Google for ideas and end up with something generic. They can become overwhelmed and a little bit paralysed with it. 'A good proposal can be lasting talking point, but a bad one can end up on YouTube for the whole world to see. 'I haven't heard any really wacky ideas yet - unless your partner is really wacky too those are best avoided.' Say cheese! Sam caters for clients with any budget, from £10 to £10,000, and says she builds up a picture of the couple and their relationship before putting together their 'proposal package' Sam's research has shown that most women prefer to be asked while their partner is on bended knee, and that a treasure hunt proposal is the most fail-safe option - just so long as it has been personalised to the couple. Sam, whose background is in marketing and teaching English, believes her creative flair and organisation have helped her to become The Proposal Expert. She said: 'A lot of my friends are male which has helped me to know how they think and what makes them tick. 'I know that they need help with this sort of thing and I'm here to give it to them. I can give them a female's perspective and they don't have to worry about being judged by their friends - or their girlfriend finding out. I offer absolute discretion. Meet the expert: 'This is a huge industry in America and the guys there are proud to have used a proposal planner. Their fiances usually love that they've used one too' Sam admits that most men she has helped choose not to tell the bride-to-be that they've used her services, but she believes that will change. 'This is a huge industry in America and the guys there are proud to have used a proposal planner,' she said. 'Their fiances usually love that they've used one too. 'Everything the man says is what helps me to put the idea together - so whatever package they choose they still play a big part.' To hire Sam's services, visit www.theproposalexpert.co.uk. Sam said of Ryan: 'He said he wants to have another go, so now I'm just waiting'","completion":"Sam Sheppard, a 34-year-old from Gilwen, Monmouthshire, was disappointed with her boyfriend Ryan's proposal, describing it as being asked out for pizza.

Build a movie plot around this: How old was Alan Parrish? 14 Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"The Jumanji Paradox\\" The movie opens with a 14-year-old boy, Alan Parrish, a vivacious and curious character always hungry for an adventure. Life in his peaceful town in New Hampshire is routine and monotonous until one day Alan stumbles upon a mysterious board game, Jumanji, while exploring an abandoned factory near his home. A key element here is Alan's inquisitive nature which leads him to discover the game, setting the movie plot in motion. For the next step, while playing the game at home with his best friend, Sarah, Alan gets sucked into the game, disappearing from the real world. His sudden disappearance shocks and confuses everyone in the town, setting in a feeling of mystery and unease. This step heightens the plot tension and introduces the central conflict of the story. To further build the plot, we transition to a 26-year later jump when siblings, Judy and Peter, move into the old Parrish home. They discover the game and start playing it, unleashing Alan who has aged in the game but is still mentally a 14-year-old. This time jump brings a twist in the plot, deepening the intrigue and mystery. Alan's return creates a flurry of mixed reactions from the town people: shock, fear, curiosity, and relief. Despite his physical appearance, his mental maturity is still that of a 14-year-old which leads to him having a hard time adjusting to the changes. This part of the plot exposes Alan's internal conflict and his struggle for acceptance, adding emotional depth to the story. The plot thickens as Alan realizes that the only way to restore peace, revert to his actual age and free others trapped in the game is to complete Jumanji. Alan, Judy, Peter, and a now-adult Sarah embark on a mission to finish the game despite the harrowing experiences Jumanji has to offer. This is the main turning point of the plot, showcasing our characters' bravery and determination. The climax features the group successfully finishing the game after overcoming numerous challenges, forcing everything caused by the game to revert, turning Alan and Sarah back into their 14-year-old selves. Finally, the plot concludes with Alan and Sarah, having the memory of what happened. They toss the game into a river, ensuring it doesn't wreak any more havoc. As they grow, they hold onto their shared secret, bringing their friendship closer. This brings a satisfactory resolution and close to the movie, ending on a note of friendship, bravery, and maturity. Each step taken in the plot is laid out strategically to maintain the suspense, build-up towards the climax, and finally, give a fitting end to the story. It explores themes of adventure, friendship, and growth while revolving around the central question of Alan Parrish's age and the Jumanji game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the Siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led naval officers to be sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the Garde Mobile.

Believing that Ray's soul still inhabits the doll, Tiffany crudely stitches it back together and reenacts the voodoo ritual which instilled Ray inside the doll ten years ago. The incantations seemingly fail to produce results, but Chucky suddenly springs to life and kills Tiffany's Goth admirer Damien while Tiffany looks on with excitement. Later, Tiffany and Chucky have an argument because Tiffany believed that Chucky wanted to marry her. Upon learning he had no intention of doing so, Tiffany locks Chucky in a playpen, and gives him another doll in a wedding dress to make fun of him. Chucky escapes the play pen and kills Tiffany by electrocuting her. He then uses the same voodoo ritual to transfer her soul into the bride doll so she could feel what he went through as a living doll. Still intent on becoming human again, Chucky plans to retrieve the magical amulet that was buried with Ray's body, and use the bodies of Tiffany's neighbor Jesse and his girlfriend Jade as hosts for their souls. Tiffany sends Jesse a message asking him to transport the two dolls to New Jersey in exchange for money. Jesse convinces Jade to go with him.

A jungle safari is a unique and exciting adventure that offers the opportunity to witness wildlife in their natural habitat. Observing monkeys in the wild is a rare experience that not many people get to have, so this would likely be fascinating and enriching for Bailey. In addition to the excitement of seeing wild animals like monkeys up close, going on a jungle safari often includes other activities such as trekking through dense forests, learning about the native flora and fauna, and visiting remote villages and local communities. These activities further contribute to the sense of gaining new experiences, as Bailey would be exposed to different aspects of the culture, environment, and wildlife that might be unfamiliar to her. It is less likely that Bailey would feel bored and worthless or bored and stupid, as a jungle safari presents an opportunity for adventure, learning, and personal growth. These experiences would generally generate feelings of satisfaction, wonder, and fulfillment, rather than boredom or worthlessness. Additionally, engaging with new and exciting experiences often leaves people feeling more knowledgeable and well-rounded, rather than feeling stupid.

Movie title: Balls of Fury Context: this first appeared on www.realmoviereview.com Ben Garant joined with fellow Reno 911!er, Thomas Lennon to write this comedy, before getting behind the lens for his first feature film, while Lennon took the supporting role of German champion Karl Wolfschtagg. However, the star here is Dan Fogler, in a Jack Black kind of role as a Ping Pong protégé turned has-been, Randy Daytona. The acting is fine, and its always great to see Christopher Walken back on screen. The story is pretty much a by-the-numbers spoof of Bruce Lees Enter the Dragon, with some James Bond, Scarface and every clichéd martial arts film ever made. The script, the bread and butter of every comedy, is only passable, with more smiles and chuckles than laughs.Randy Daytona loses the 1988 Olympic Gold medal for ping-pong, and his father on the same day, and becomes a has-been haunted by his line, Im going to Disneyland. Daytona gets another chance when he is approached by FBI agent, Ernie Rodriguez (played by George Lopez), to go undercover at an underground ping-pong tournament run by the evil criminal emperor, Feng (Walken). After a gruelling training regiment under Master Wong, played well by veteran actor, James Hong, and his daughter, Maggie (Maggie Q) who looks great and has some very cool moves.This review has come out pretty positive, but, although there are some good characters and ideas here, there is a lack of really funny jokes and, really, in a martial arts spoof about ping-pong that is packed with more talent than Tiger Woods, it shouldnt have been that hard to get a few really good laughs.

But does it feel like your parents are stressing you out with their love? Do you often fight with them? Hu Muqing, 16, of Shenyang, complains that his parents only care about his grades and not his other needs. He and his parents fight the most about the time he spends watching TV and on the Internet. \\"They think because I'm in high school I should concentrate on my work,\\" the Shenyang teenager said. \\"However, I need to be able to relax. Most of my friends can watch TV and surf the Web a lot. There are times when it's hard to talk to them.\\" After some talks, Hu has been allowed to watch TV for 15 to 20 minutes every night, but has been told to keep away from the computer. Since she feels she's grown up now, Shen Ying, 17, wants more respect from her parents. \\"My father shouts at me when he's in a bad mood . He doesn't listen to me, but instead acts like, 'I'm the boss'!\\" said the teenager from Mianyang, Sichuan province. \\"I'd like my parents to treat me like a friend and understand that respect is a two-way street.\\" \\"It's the age when teenagers are becoming more independent . But their parents are very concerned about their kids' futures,\\" said Sun Yunxiao, a senior researcher at the China Youth and Children Research Center. Sun suggests that teenagers should learn to communicate with their parents effectively . \\"Find the right time for a talk. On Mother's Day or Father's Day, say 'Thank you' to your parents or give them a small gift with a letter so they can get inside your head a little,\\" he advised.

Critics say that is not nearly enough compared with other prescribers, such as M.D. psychiatrists or nurse practitioners who have at least six years' medical education and clinical experience. Neither Davison nor most other RxP opponents doubt the efficacy of medications. Their greatest objection is to the notion of turning psychology into a prescribing profession. In a field that has struggled long and hard to prove that mind, mood and behavior can be studied empirically, the past decade, Davison says, has seen \\"exciting developments\\" that demonstrate the validity of various psychotherapeutic interventions and the psychosocial-behavioral models on which they are based. \\"The timing is peculiar to abandon psychological science or to convert it to a medical science,\\" explains Elaine M. Heiby of the University of Hawaii, who chairs a committee of the 1,000-member American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology that is concerned about the medicalization of psychology. \\"Making sure that practicing psychologists are giving patients interventions based on the best available psychological science should be the APA's priority,\\" argues Emory University's Scott Lilienfeld, president of the Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology (SSCP). More than any philosophical betrayal of psychology, RxP opponents fear that the movement will undermine the science they love. They believe that if prescriptive authority becomes the norm, biomedical requirements will inevitably seep into the psychology curriculum, at the expense of traditional psychological science and methodology. Lilienfeld feels that many clinical psychologists already receive inadequate training in fundamentals such as research design and evaluation. RxP opponents charge the APA with pushing its prescription-privileges agenda without adequately assessing support for it in the field. The 300-member SSCP is the only group within the APA to have taken a formal stance against prescription privileges. The APA has scheduled 30 minutes at its meeting in August for an RxP debate, but its leadership believes it already has an accurate sense of support for its RxP policy. \\"Except for this small vocal minority, we have just not gotten a lot of groundswell against this from members,\\" says APA president Philip G. Zimbardo of Stanford University. With prescription privileges now a reality in one state, some RxP opponents concede that it may be too late. This year four states besides New Mexico -- Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois and Tennessee -- have pending legislation for psychologist prescription privileges. Over the past decade, 14 state legislatures have considered such laws. Between 1991 and 1997, a U.S. Department of Defense psychopharmacology demonstration project involving two to four years' training produced 10 military psychologists who can write prescriptions.

Look at the face of the person you're talking to. Notice how light affects the shadows and the shape of their features. Pay special attention to how light looks on certain textures like clothing and skin. Noticing these things will help you gain a better understanding of how real objects look with different types of light hitting them. As a fun exercise, try to describe objects without using their names to help you visualize and capture shapes. For example, if you’re looking at a tree, you might describe the trunk as a sloping cylinder and the leaves as tiny lemon shapes. When you're looking at something, notice any color variations and how that causes your eyes to want to linger or move to another area. Note the subtle hues within a certain color (like all the different shades of red on an apple). For instance, if you're looking at a brightly colored tulip, note how the hot pink petals contrast with the soft green hue of the stem and how your eyes are drawn to the lighter tips of the petals. Take time to squint your eyes at a particular thing, landscape, or scene. Squinting minimizes your eyes ability to see color and detail and blurs the distinctions between things. This is especially helpful if you want to paint a mass of individual things that are far away like a landscape or a forest full of trees. Squinting will also help you distinguish between shadows and light. When you're looking at a particular object or scene, notice the background space (like a wall, table, or backdrop). Allowing negative space in your paintings will give it a sense of balance or tension depending on the scene and overall esthetic. For example, take note of the colors, shadows, and textures of objects behind the central objects you'd like to paint. For instance, a burnt orange wall with a diagonal shadow can make the candles and flowers in the foreground stand out more. Notice how certain objects are put together to create shapes or lines. The geometry of a particular scene or collection of objects draws the spectator’s in a particular pattern. For example, imagine a still scene of a bookstore. The aisle on the left creates a line that moves the eye vertically, a string twinkle lights between shelves might move the eye across the top, and another shelf encourages the eye to move up or down. The vertical eye movements on each side of the painting might act as a sort of frame for the still-life piece. What is a summary?","completion":"In summary, the article discusses the importance of observing the color, shape, texture, and size of objects in our everyday surroundings to gain a better understanding of how light affects their appearance. It provides tips and exercises, such as describing objects without naming them and squinting to better distinguish shadows and light.

The team’s research, soon to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, indicated that the atmosphere of 55 Cancri e comprised largely of hydrogen and helium, but the absence of water vapour suggested that finding life on this far-flung world was highly unlikely. “This is a very exciting result because it’s the first time that we have been able to find the spectral fingerprints that show the gases present in the atmosphere of a super-Earth” said Angelos Tsiaras, a PhD student who helped develop the techniques used to analyse the atmosphere of 55 Cancri e. “The observations of 55 Cancri e’s atmosphere suggest that the planet has managed to cling on to a significant amount of hydrogen and helium from the nebula from which it originally formed.” While 55 Cancri e is described as a ‘super-Earth’ due to its close approximation in size, that is where the comparisons end. A year on 55 Cancri e is just 18 hours long. (ESA/Hubble, M. Kommesser) Artists impressions of the distant planet, which orbits a different sun-like star to Earth, reveal an incredibly dangerous and hellish landscape, where a year is just eighteen hours long and where temperatures soar to over 2000 degress celcius – hot enough to melt titanium. Apart from hydrogen and helium, the data also revealed hints of hydrogen cyanide in the atmosphere, an extremely toxic and explosive compound that can kill humans within minutes. The scientists were able to make the observations by sweeping the Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) quickly across the parent star to reveal the spectrum of its starlight. The data was then analysed by software to reveal the spectrum of 55 Cancri e, illuminated by the light of the star it orbits. Little was previously known about 55 Cancri e before these close observations, only that it had a mass approximately eight times that of Earth, and that it was roughly 40 light years from Earth. The planet has made headlines in previous years after research determined that its interior is carbon-rich, leading to the nickname “the diamond planet”.","completion":"An international team of scientists, including researchers from University College London, have used the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to study the atmosphere of Earth-sized exoplanet 55 Cancri e for the first time. The planet, situated some 40 light years from Earth, has a dense atmosphere largely made up of hydrogen and helium, and no water vapour, meaning that finding life there is highly unlikely. Furthermore, temperatures on the inhospitable planet are over 2000°C, and hydrogen cyanide is present in the atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Gordon Banks (born 30 December 1937) is a former England international football goalkeeper. He made 628 appearances during a 15-year career in the Football League, and won 73 caps for his country. Regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, the IFFHS named Banks the second-best goalkeeper of the 20th century - after Lev Yashin (1st) and ahead of Dino Zoff (3rd). He was named FWA Footballer of the Year in 1972, and was named FIFA Goalkeeper of the Year on six occasions. Banks was born in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and brought up in the working-class area of Tinsley. The family later moved to the village of Catcliffe after his father set up a (then-illegal) betting shop. This brought greater prosperity but also misery; one day Banks's disabled brother was mugged for the shop's daily takings, and died of his injuries some weeks later. Banks left school in December 1952 and took up employment as a bagger with a local coal merchant, which helped to build up his upper body strength. He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh F.C. after their regular goalkeeper failed to turn up for a match; the club's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as he was aware that Banks had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys. His performances there earned him a game in the Yorkshire League for Rawmarsh Welfare, however a 12-2 defeat to Stocksbridge Works on his debut was followed by a 3-1 home defeat, and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh. Still aged 15, he then switched jobs to become a hod carrier. He was scouted by Chesterfield whilst playing for Millspaugh, and offered a six-game trial in the youth team in March 1953. He impressed enough in these games to be offered a part-time PS3-a-week contract by manager Teddy Davison in July 1953. The reserve team were placed in the Central League on account of a powerful club director rather than on merit, and Banks conceded 122 goals in the 1954-55 season as the \\"Spireites\\" finished in last place with only three victories. Banks was posted to Germany with the Royal Signals on national service, and won the Rhine Cup with his regimental team. He recovered from a fractured elbow to help the Chesterfield youth team to the 1956 final of the FA Youth Cup. There they were beaten 4-3 on aggregate by Manchester United's famous \\"Busby Babes\\" - a team that included both Wilf McGuinness and Bobby Charlton. Banks was given his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, at the expense of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2-2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the following match; by the end of the 1958-59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for PS7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to PS15 a week.","completion":"This text is about Gordon Banks, a former England international football goalkeeper."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Washing your hair every day can strip your scalp of its natural oils, so try to use shampoo and conditioner every other day instead. Use a leave-in conditioner once a week for thick and full hair. Avoid conditioners that contain wax, which can weigh your hair down. Styling curly hair, for example, requires paying attention to what makes the most of the curls; don't try to flatten your curly hair with pomade or curl your straight locks on a daily basis. Doing so will wear out your hair and ruin its texture over time. Choose a hairstyle based on its natural characteristics so your hair stays undamaged. Using the right materials can make a world of difference when caring for your hair. A wide-toothed comb or brush with natural bristles work well with long hair. If you use rubber bands, look for cloth-covered bands to avoid tangling your hair with the bands. Excessive blow drying can dry out your hair and scalp, and it can damage your hair if you don't apply a heat protectant beforehand. Only blow dry your hair on special occasion. On an everyday basis, air- or towel-dry your hair.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of properly caring for your hair to maintain its natural health and texture. Washing your hair daily can strip it of essential oils, so the recommendation is to shampoo and condition every other day. For those with thick and full hair, applying a leave-in conditioner once a week is advised, but it's important to avoid products containing wax as they can weigh your hair down. When it comes to styling your hair, be mindful of your hair type. For curly hair, focus on enhancing the curls rather than flattening them with products like pomade. Similarly, avoid curling straight hair on a daily basis as it can damage the hair texture over time. It's crucial to choose a hairstyle that complements your hair's natural characteristics to prevent damage. Using appropriate tools and materials is another aspect of proper hair care. Long hair benefits from a wide-toothed comb or a brush with natural bristles. If using rubber bands, opt for cloth-covered ones to minimize tangling. Additionally, the article warns against the excessive use of blow-drying, as it can cause dryness in both hair and scalp, and potentially damage your hair if a heat protectant isn't applied beforehand.

An analysis of the language and choice of words used in the sentence can offer insight into understanding why the sentiment appears to be positive. First, let us focus on the word \\"heartwarmingly.\\" This adverb is derived from the adjective \\"heartwarming,\\" which is typically used to describe situations or events that evoke feelings of warmth, happiness, or emotional comfort. When someone defines something as heartwarming, they are usually referring to a positive and uplifting experience. Second, there's the verb \\"motivate.\\" To motivate someone means to inspire or encourage them to take action, accomplish tasks, or improve themselves. This verb has a positive connotation, as it is usually linked to positive outcomes such as achieving goals, personal growth, or increased self-esteem. Lastly, the adverb \\"so\\" is used here as an intensifier to emphasize the degree or extent to which someone or something is heartwarmingly motivating. It suggests that not only is the motivation present, but it is also exceptionally powerful and emotionally resonant. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"They so heartwarmingly motivate\\" is positive. The use of \\"heartwarmingly\\" and \\"motivate\\" suggests a scenario where someone or something is inspiring others in a way that brings about emotions such as happiness, warmth, and emotional comfort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who does Sir Edith take to London? from the following article ? Elliot Hopper is a workaholic widower who is about to land the deal of a lifetime at work, which he hopes will win him a promotion and a company car. After he forgets his daughter Diane's birthday, he attempts to make it up to her by promising her she can have his car when he secures the deal at work on the coming Thursday. After being persuaded to give the car to his daughter early, Elliot must hail a taxi from work, which is driven by Satanist Curtis Burch, who drives erratically and is of control. Attempting to get the taxi stopped, Elliot announces that he is Satan and commands him to stop the taxi, and also attempts to give him his wallet. Shocked to see his \\"Evil Master\\", Burch drives off a bridge and into the river. Elliot emerges from the accident scene, only to learn that he is a ghost when a police officer fails to notice him and a speeding bus goes straight through him. When he gets home he discovers that his three children can see him, but only in a totally dark room, and they can't hear him at times. He struggles to tell them what happened when he is whisked away to London by paranormal researcher Sir Edith, who tells him he is a ghost who has yet to enter the afterlife because \\"they screwed up\\"; his soul will not cross over until Thursday. The pressures of work and family life lead to many comedic events, as Elliot attempts to renew his life insurance policy and complete his company's merger, so his family will be provided for once he crosses over. One day, he must choose between staying in an important work meeting and helping his son with a magic trick at school. He eventually decides that his family's happiness is more important and walks out on his furious boss, Mr. Collins, who later smugly fires him. Dejected, Elliot reveals himself as a ghost to his love interest, Joan, whose initial shock soon turns to sympathy. Answer:","completion":"Sir Edith takes Elliot Hopper to London in the story.

Sentenced: Devon Jenkins, 16, has been sentenced to probation and community service after acting as a lookout while his friend's grandmother was killed last year. A 16-year-old boy who acted as a lookout while his friend's grandmother was ambushed, strangled and stabbed in her Minnesota home was today sentenced to probation and community service. Devon James Jenkins must complete a. youth correctional program, perform 100 hours of community service and. serve probation until age 21 over the murder of 79-year-old Lila Warwick. 'I go to bed every night thinking about the awful things I did,' Jenkins told Kandiyohi County Court about the July 2013 incident. Jenkins, who had smoked marijuana on the night of the murder, told the court he's been in chemical dependency treatment since October and wants to get his high school diploma, work with his dad in the drywall business and go to Ridgewater College to get his general classes, according to The Global Dispatch. As Jenkins apologized in court for his actions, Warwick's daughter Cheri Ekbom said she did not hate her mother's attackers. She did not comment on the sentence. 'Maybe it seemed like such an innocent thing to get in that car that night,' she said, according to Star Tribune. 'As a result of that choice, the life of a human being - my mother - was violently taken from us. It will also cost you five years of your life. 'To hate you would bring dishonor to my mom and only allow the darkness...to continue.' Jenkins was the youngest of three defendants charged over Warwick's tragic death. Prosecutors said the church volunteer's own grandson, 18-year-old Robert Warwick, masterminded the deadly plan that led 19-year-old Brok Junkermeier to choke and stab the woman. Junkermeier was charged with intentional second-degree murder, without premeditation, and his trial is in March. Warwick's trial has not been scheduled. Victim: Lila Warwick, 79, was found strangled and stabbed to death in her Minnesota home last year. Crime scene: Lila Warwick was found dead in the basement of her Willmar, Minnesota, home last year. According to the charging documents, Warwick believed that his grandmother had more than 40,000 in a safe. The trio had reportedly been planning to kill Warwick and steal her money for some time. Warwick's body was found after she. failed to show up at a meeting at Redeemer Lutheran Church, where she. was a volunteer. ‘Upon. entering into the garage and home, deputies found evidence of homicidal. violence and found the body of Ms. Warwick who was deceased,’ one of the. juvenile petitions said. Preliminary autopsy results showed she died from complex homicidal violence involving multiple stab wounds and strangulation. After the murder, witnesses told authorities they heard Junkermeier talk previously about killing Warwick and stealing her money, but both thought he was joking. One of the witnesses said that the day after the killing, Junkermeier came to him and talked about the burglary and attack. Charged: Prosecutors say Warwick's own grandson Robert Warwick, 18 (right) masterminded the attack while Brok Junkermeier, 19 (left) choked and stabbed the woman. According to the charges, Junkermeier told his friend that he and another teen drove to Warwick's house in the 3000 block of U.S. Highway 12 East at around 4am on July 29 and lay in ambush. The 19-year-old had previously obtained a key to get into Warwick's garage, and went inside wearing a mask and gloves while Jenkins stayed in the car as a lookout. Junkermeier waited two hours for Warwick to enter the garage, then ambushed her and slashed her hand with a 20-inch knife. The suspect told his friend that while the elderly woman was bleeding heavily, he forced her to access her bank account online and write him a check for 1,500. Prosecutors say Junkermeier later deposited that money into his account. Callous: Charges state that after the murder, Junkermeier and Jenkins (pictured) went to a McDonald's for a snack before heading home. Junkermeier told his confidant he then began to strangle Warwick, and when he saw she was not dead, he stabbed her multiple times before dumping her in the basement, the charges said. The charges state that soon after Warwick’s gristly murder, Junkermeier and Jenkins went to a nearby McDonald’s for a snack and then headed home, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. At around 2pm that day, Junkermeier and Robert Warwick returned to Lila Warwick's house and took a safe. The duo stopped by the house again at around 5pm and saw police officers on the scene. The charges said Junkermeier confessed to the killing when he was arrested and told police where to find the bloody knife. Pillar of community: Lila Warwick, right, pictured with her daughter, Cheri Ekbom, was a grandmother to eight children, great-grandmother to two others and volunteered at Redeemer Lutheran Church in Willmar. Bloody gym shoes, a safe and 30 1,000 savings bonds in Warwick's name were found at Junkermeier's house, the complaint said. At the time of the incident, Cheri Ekbom said her nephew was a drug addict who hated his grandmother and wanted her dead. Junkermeier, a 2012 graduate of Willmar High School, has had some previous run-ins with the law involving theft-related charges and was on probation at the time of Warwick's death. Former classmates described Junkermeier to Echo Press as a big sports enthusiast who did not have many friends in school and was often picked on. Graham Dahl, 19, called Junkermeier a stone-faced 'weird kid' who had little respect for his teachers and would sometimes get ejected from class for acting out. Warwick had eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. She and her husband, who died in 1976, had lived in Willmar since 1969.","completion":"The 16-year-old boy, Devon James Jenkins, who acted as a lookout whilst his friend's grandmother was stolen from her home and subsequently killed, has been given a sentence of probation and is expected to complete over 100 hours of community service. In addition to this, the defendant will be required to participate in a youth correctional program. Jenkins was one of the youngest of the defendants who were charged concerning the murder of 79-year-old Lila Warwick. He allegedly acted as a lookout while the crime was committed by two other individuals - 18-year-old Robert Warwick, grandson to the victim, and 19-year-old Brok Junkermeier. Robert, accused of masterminding the crime, believed that his grandmother was in possession of more than 40,000 in a safe, and the trio had been allegedly planning to kill Warwick and steal her money for some time. Junkermeier, the main executor of the crime, is charged with intentional second-degree murder, without premeditation. His trial is scheduled for March and Robert Warwick's trial is not yet scheduled. The physical violence inflicted on Warwick involved multiple stab wounds and strangulation, as revealed by preliminary autopsy results. Post the murder, witnesses have reported hearing Junkermeier admitting to the crime, divulging about the burglary, the attack, and also how he coerced the bleeding Warwick to give him access to her online bank account and made her write a check for 1,500, which he later deposited into his account. Revealing the gruesome details of the crime, Jenkins reported how Junkermeier, despite two hours of waiting and initial slashing, needed to strangle and stab Warwick repeatedly until she died. Following her murder, their alleged nonchalance was demonstrated by their trip to McDonald's before heading home. Later the same day, Junkermeier and Robert returned to Warwick's house to retrieve the safe. They paid another visit around 5 PM only to find police officers on the scene. Junkermeier was arrested shortly after, where he confessed to the crime and also disclosed the location of the murder weapon. Evidence found in Junkermeier's house include bloody gym shoes, a safe, and 30 1,000 savings bonds in Warwick's name. Former classmates and teachers from Willmar High School remember Junkermeier as a disrespectful 'weird kid' with a stone face. The deceased, Lila Warwick, was a church volunteer at the Redeemer Lutheran Church, a pillar of her community, and a grandmother to eight and a great-grandmother to two. Despite the brutal loss of her mother, Warwick's daughter Cheri Ekbom, stated that she did not harbor hatred towards the attackers, asserting that hatred would bring dishonor to her mother.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation 151 * j = 709 * j - 3 * j - 12765 for j, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the j terms on one side of the equation. First, we need to simplify the equation by combining the terms with j on the right side. The equation is: 151j = 709j - 3j - 12765 Step 2: Simplify the right side of the equation. Combine the j terms on the right side: 151j = (709 - 3)j - 12765 151j = 706j - 12765 Step 3: Subtract 706j from both sides of the equation to isolate the j terms on one side: 151j - 706j = 706j - 706j - 12765 This can be simplified to: -555j = -12765 Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by -555 to solve for j: (-555j) / (-555) = (-12765) / (-555) This simplifies to: j = 23 So, the solution for j is 23."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He was a member of Parliament for more than 30 years and an active anti-communist. - The South Eastern and Chatham Railway Companies Joint Management Committee (SE&CRCJMC), known as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&CR), was a working union of two neighbouring rival railways, the South Eastern Railway (SER) and London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&DR), which operated between London and south-east England. Between 1899 and 1923, the SE&CR had a monopoly of railway services in Kent and to the main Channel ports for ferries to France and Belgium. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Grand Trunk Railway was a railway system that operated in the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and in the American states of Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The railway was operated from headquarters in Montreal, Quebec, with corporate headquarters in London, England (4 Warwick House Street). The Grand Trunk, its subsidiaries, and the Canadian Government Railways were precursors of today's Canadian National Railways. - Sir Alfred Waldron Smithers ( 4 October 1850 -- 22 August 1924 ) was a British financier and parliamentarian . Smithers father William Henry Smithers was a prominent employee of the Bank of England . Alfred entered the world of finance early when he joined the London Stock Exchange at the age of 23 .

Article:Margaret Gleeson, 70, died two days after a routine hernia operation at Wigan's Royal Albert Edward Infirmary. Valerie Taylor told Bolton Coroner's Court she had \\"no excuse\\" for the failure in October 2015. It led to an artificially low rating of Mrs Gleeson's health risk, the inquest heard. Valerie Taylor was one of several medics questioned about omissions from patient notes during the second day of the inquest. She turned to Mrs Gleeson's family while giving evidence and apologised, saying: \\"I didn't score a urine output and I've no excuse for that. I can only apologise wholeheartedly.\\" Staff nurse Sian Parkinson, who was in charge of the nursing staff on the ward, told the inquest she had not been overly concerned about Mrs Gleeson's condition. Asked about missing details from the records, she said: \\"Sometimes you're that busy you don't have time to record.\\" Mrs Gleeson's daughter, Julie Barnes, had earlier told the inquest that when the family visited the hospital the afternoon after the operation her mother was pale, waxy, vomiting repeatedly and in pain. The inquest has heard internal tissue was torn during the procedure but there was a delay running blood tests and medics did not realise she was seriously ill until the early hours of the Sunday morning. A leading surgeon at the hospital, Dr Marius Paraoan, told the inquest she may have survived if she had been treated sooner. Dr Paraoan, one of the authors of an internal hospital report into Mrs Gleeson's death, said mistakes were made and that \\"the sooner the operation is done, the lower the mortality rate.\\" But he disagreed with claims that delays spotting the \\"very rare\\" complications and treating her were the result of weekend staffing levels. On the first day of the inquest, the surgeon who oversaw the operation said weekend staffing levels affect the care patients receive at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary.

Question: Bobby and Will were two friends attending a genetics course. Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals. Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person didn't observe any loss in genetic diversity? Hint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led... Answer:","completion":"Will did not observe any loss in genetic diversity. The explanation for this lies in the differences between the populations Bobby and Will studied, as well as the potential consequences of reduced population size on genetic diversity. Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals, whereas Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species. One of the significant issues faced by smaller and isolated populations is the decline in genetic diversity due to declines in population size. An observable consequence of decreasing genetic diversity is the Allee effect, which refers to the reduced fitness of a species resulting from a decline in population size and reduced gene pool. This decrease in fitness is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Some examples of the risks associated with smaller populations include genetic drift, inbreeding depression, and fixation of deleterious alleles. A smaller gene pool has a higher chance of a stochastic event in which harmful alleles become fixed through genetic drift. Furthermore, natural selection is less likely to remove mildly deleterious alleles that act later in life in smaller populations than in larger ones. As a result, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost through random chance in smaller populations. On the other hand, larger populations exhibit more genetic diversity, diminishing the likelihood of genetic drift, inbreeding depression, and fixation of deleterious alleles. In Will's case, since he was studying a large, healthy population of the same species, he was more likely to observe greater genetic diversity and a relatively reduced effect of the aforementioned factors. This would have led to a more robust representation of the species' gene pool and potentially improved overall fitness. An example that highlights the importance of maintaining genetic diversity is the case of the Florida panther. This endangered species experienced a genetic bottleneck due to a reduced population size, leading to defects like lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, and other physical abnormalities. A genetic rescue plan involving the introduction of female pumas from Texas into the Florida population ultimately improved genetic diversity and the species' overall fitness. In summary, while Bobby likely observed a loss in genetic diversity in the small, isolated population he studied, Will did not observe any such loss due to the larger, healthier population he investigated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: If I tell you that Wind can lead to a deterioration of soil quality, and ask you the question \\"what can lead to a deteroriation in soil quality?\\", is the correct answer \\"rain\\"? Available choices: [a]. Yes; [b]. No; A:","completion":"[b]. No; Although your initial statement mentions that wind can lead to a deterioration of soil quality, when asked \\"what can lead to a deterioration in soil quality?\\", the correct answer should not be limited to \\"rain\\" because there are numerous factors that can negatively impact soil quality. The deterioration of soil quality can occur due to several reasons, including: 1. Wind erosion: As mentioned in the given statement, wind can transport soil particles and erode the topsoil, making it less fertile and nutrient-rich. This can further lead to the loss of organic matter and contribute to desertification in some areas. 2. Water erosion: Rain, or more specifically, water runoff, can lead to soil erosion and the removal of nutrient-rich topsoil. Heavy rainfall causes water to flow over the soil surface, taking away valuable nutrients and minerals, reducing fertility, and exposing the soil to further erosion. 3. Soil compaction: This occurs when the soil is compressed due to the heavy weight of machinery, livestock, or human activity. Compaction reduces pore space between soil particles, limiting the flow of water, air, and nutrients. This can result in poor root development, reduced plant growth, and an overall decline in soil quality. 4. Loss of soil organic matter: Soil organic matter (SOM) is crucial for maintaining soil fertility, water retention, and nutrient cycling. Agricultural practices, such as intensive tillage and monoculture, can lead to the depletion of SOM, negatively impacting soil quality. 5. Chemical contamination: Overuse of fertilizers, pesticides, and other agrochemicals can cause contamination, leading to an imbalance of nutrients, soil acidification, and the death of beneficial microorganisms in the soil. This can ultimately deteriorate the quality of the soil. 6. Salinization: In areas where there is poor water drainage or high evaporation rates, salts can accumulate in the soil, reducing its fertility and productivity. Salinization can be exacerbated by irrigation practices that involve using water with high salt content. In conclusion, while rain (or more specifically, water erosion) is one factor contributing to the deterioration of soil quality, it is not the only factor, and the correct answer should not be limited to rain alone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Choose from: a. debris is soft.. b. broom is soft..","completion":"The broom James bought from the store could not sweep the debris in the yard. The broom is soft. The broom's soft bristles may be the main contributing factor to its inability to sweep the debris in the yard effectively. Brooms are typically designed for various types of surfaces and messes, which means that finding the right broom for a specific task is essential. Soft-bristled brooms might be great for cleaning indoor surfaces and collecting fine particles such as dust and pet hair but may not be suitable for picking up the more substantial debris found outdoors. Outdoor sweeping tasks often require a sturdy broom with stiff bristles, as the debris encountered can range from substantial materials like leaves, sticks, dirt, and gravel to more minor particles like dirt and sand. Stiff-bristled brooms are specifically designed to handle this variety of debris, with bristles that can penetrate cracks and crevices more effectively and withstand rougher handling and contact with the ground. When James bought the soft-bristled broom, he may not have considered the specific type of cleaning for which he would be using the broom. A few factors could have contributed to this oversight. For instance, he could have been unfamiliar with the difference between types of brooms, or he may have been swayed by a cheaper price or an attractive appearance. Ultimately, this soft-bristled broom may not be suitable for the task at hand. James may have few other options than to purchase a new, stiff-bristled broom designed for outdoor cleaning. For future purchases, James could benefit from spending some time researching the type of broom required for his specific cleaning needs, including the kinds of bristles necessary and the intended use of the broom. In conclusion, the sentence ends with \\"broom is soft\\" because a soft-bristled broom is less effective in sweeping debris in the yard, making it an inadequate tool for the task at hand. James would benefit from investing in a stiff-bristled broom designed for outdoor use so that he can effectively clean his yard and sweep away the debris as needed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But never call a Canadian tourist \\"American\\" Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Navigating Cultural Sensitivities: Tourism Body Issues Guide for Hospitality Industry Introduction As the tourism industry experiences a steady growth globally, hotel accommodations have become increasingly diverse in terms of nationalities and cultures. Keeping this in mind, a renowned tourism body has recently issued a comprehensive list of do's and don'ts to help hoteliers and their staff better interact with foreign guests, while respecting their cultural differences and ensuring their satisfaction. Below are some interesting highlights and practices that have been suggested. The Russian Guests: Appreciating their Height Russians are generally known for being taller than the average person. To cater to this unique physical characteristic and ensure their comfort, the tourism body recommends providing Russian guests with rooms that have high ceilings. This small yet considerate effort can definitely leave a lasting positive impression and show respect for their needs. Japanese Guests: Anticipate their Requirements Japanese visitors typically possess a quiet, reserved nature and prefer not to impose their needs on others. To make their stay more pleasant and hassle-free, it's essential for hotel staff to maintain a proactive approach. Anticipating and fulfilling their requirements even before their request not only demonstrates keen attention to detail but also enhances their overall experience. This level of attentiveness reflects hospitality excellence and can go a long way in establishing strong bonds with guests from Japan. Canadian Guests: Respecting their Identity Understanding and respecting one's nationality is crucial in a multicultural environment like the hospitality industry. The tourism body stresses the importance of distinguishing between Canadian and American visitors. To some, this may seem like a minor detail, but for Canadians, it holds great significance. Using the correct terminology helps hotel staff establish an immediate connection with their Canadian guests and express genuine warmth and respect. Inadvertently calling a Canadian tourist \\"American\\" can be seen as a faux-pas and leave a less than favorable impression. General Considerations for Foreign Guests 1. Language barriers: Providing simple translated materials, such as menus or brochures, can make a significant difference in how foreign guests perceive their stay. Additionally, ensuring that staff members are familiar with basic phrases in commonly spoken languages, or have access to translation tools, goes a long way in making guests from diverse backgrounds feel welcomed. 2. Special dietary requirements: Being aware of and accommodating various dietary restrictions due to culture, religion, or personal preferences helps create a more inclusive environment. This may involve offering vegetarian, halal, or kosher meals, and also considering allergies when preparing dishes for specific guests. 3. Cultural etiquette: Understanding and adapting to essential etiquette norms, such as whether or not to maintain eye contact or customary greetings in different cultures, can create a more harmonious atmosphere. Training staff to be aware of potential differences promotes respectful interactions with guests from various backgrounds. Conclusion The increasingly multicultural nature of the global tourism industry calls for hoteliers and their staff to pay attention to cultural sensitivities, preferences, and needs. By following the tourism body's list of do's and don'ts, hotel establishments can create a truly hospitable environment that fosters respect, understanding, and satisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best social media monitoring tool and why?","completion":"While at first glance these questions might seem similar because they both involve social media management tools, they are actually asking about potentially different aspects of social media management and are not exactly the same. 1. \\"What is the best free social media and email management tool?\\" This question is specifically asking for a tool that manages both social media and email. It's possible that the person asking this question is looking for a way to coordinate their social media and email marketing strategies, streamline their workflow, or manage these tasks for multiple clients. Here, the person is also asking for a free tool, which is another important distinction because many tools may require a monthly or yearly subscription or may be free initially but require payment for more advanced features. In this case, characteristics like budget, integrated management of different communication channels, and cost-efficiency would be the criteria to answer this question. 2. \\"What is the best social media monitoring tool and why?\\" This question is more specific about the functionality of the tool. The person is asking about a social media monitoring tool, which tracks mentions of certain keywords or phrases on social media platforms. These tools essentially \\"listen\\" to what's being said about a brand, industry, or competitors on social media, and can be a crucial part of a brand's online reputation management strategy. Here, the person is also asking for a justification of whatever tool is recommended (\\"and why\\"), means the answer needs to take into account the specific factors and unique characteristics that make the recommended tool the \\"best\\". This could be the coverage of different social media platforms, real-time alert features, sentiment analysis, integration with other tools, or various other factors. Overall, while both questions delve into social media management tools, the first is broader and also incorporates email management and is specifically asking for a free tool. The second question is more about social media monitoring (a subset of management) and is asking for an explanation about why a particular tool is considered the best. Thus, these two questions have different implications and would likely yield different answers. It's important to consider the specifics of each question to ensure the most accurate and helpful answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: If Jim wants to raise the pH of his solution he should do what to the concentration of hydrogen ions inside of it decrease or increase? A:","completion":"If Jim wants to raise the pH of his solution, he should decrease the concentration of hydrogen ions inside of it. As mentioned in the paragraph, a higher concentration of hydrogen ions corresponds to a more acidic solution and a lower pH. Conversely, a lower concentration of hydrogen ions will result in a less acidic solution and a higher pH. To give some context, the pH scale ranges from 0-14, with values below 7 being considered acidic, 7 being neutral, and values above 7 being considered basic or alkaline. The pH scale measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) present in a solution. A high concentration of hydrogen ions results in a low pH value, indicating acidic conditions. Meanwhile, a low concentration of hydrogen ions results in a high pH value, indicating basic or alkaline conditions. By decreasing the concentration of hydrogen ions in his solution, Jim will be effectively raising its pH and making it less acidic. This can be done through several methods, such as adding a base or alkaline substance to the solution. Common examples of alkaline substances include sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and calcium hydroxide (lime). These substances can react with hydrogen ions in the solution, reducing their concentration and, as a result, increasing the pH."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: What is a nickname for the courtesans? Movie title: Flowers of Shanghai Movie plot: In four elegant brothels, called \\"Flower Houses\\", in fin-de-siÃ¨cle 19th-century Shanghai (Qing dynasty), several affairs are described. Events presumably take place in 1884, a year named in one of the scenes. The action involves four men who live for pleasure, and takes place mostly in the light of oil lamps, giving the film a claustrophobic feel. Preparation and consumption of opium and tea occur more than once, and dishes of food are served and hot towels prepared in several scenes. We are introduced to the main characters, mainly the courtesans known as Crimson, Pearl, Emerald, Jasmine and Jade. Crimson belongs to Huifang Enclave (èè³é) brothel; Pearl and Jade to Gongyang Enclave (å¬é½é) brothel; Emerald lives at Shangren Enclave (å°ä»é) brothel; and Jasmine works at East Hexing Enclave (æ±åèé) brothel. The relationship between the wealthy patrons and the courtesans are semi-monogamous, frequently lasting many years. The courtesans are purchased at an early age by the owners of the brothels, otherwise known as \\"Aunties\\". In spite of the trappings of luxury and the wealth surrounding them, the graceful, well-bred courtesans live lives of slavery. Although there are only a few references to the courtesans being beaten, we are led to understand that there are frequent beatings for the girls and women with harsher Aunties and that beatings for perceived misbehaviour are common. Because of the oppressing social conventions, the best that the courtesans, known as \\"flower girls\\", can hope for is to pay off their debts some day (possible through a wealthy patron) or marry into a better social status. The silent Master Wang leaves the courtesan Crimson in favor of Jasmine, with whom he fell madly in love in only 10 days, after (allegedly) 2Â½ years with Crimson. He offers to settle Crimson's debts. Wang sees himself with multiple ties and between hardening fronts. The dependencies turn out to be reciprocal. Crimson has only Master Wang as a customer, and must sustain herself from his money to...

Article: In Germany, English expressions are used in conversations and increasingly in written form. Advertisements are often expressed completely in English. When I go to the gym, there are \\"aerobic-classes \\". We \\"warm up\\". We go \\"jogging.\\" In business, we attend a \\"meeting\\" and we have \\"good connections.\\" Other nations, like France, have taken action to protect their language from the influence of \\"Americanization\\". In Germany, however, there is concern that those rules could be connected with Hitler's Third Reich , when the language had to be pure. If the government curbed the use of English words now, this could be considered by some as a return to that terrible past. Some German citizens are now trying to stop the use of English vocabulary in German. However, I think generally it is not a big deal to use some common English expressions as they often describe things more directly. But we should know that it is important to use English correctly. All too often, bad English is spoken or even written instead of good German. The proper use of the German language would be the better choice. However, there are some fields that require the use of English words, for example, in the high-tech communication and the Internet fields, there is no alternative to English. Also, I think sometimes I have to speak English when I introduce some scenic places to tourists. I think you have to find a balance and decide when it is better to use good German in place of bad English or when the use of correct English words is more suitable. Languages have always changed naturally, and I disagree with a restriction by law. Some nice expressions borrowed from other languages can make a conversation more vivid.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the modern name of the photograph by the commercial photographer that inspired an 1888 oil painting? Farsari and other 19th-century commercial photographers generally concentrated on two types of subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the \\"manners and customs\\" of its inhabitants. Such subjects, and the ways in which they were literally and figuratively framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; and the reason for this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, had much to do with economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō \\"per head\\", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting \\"manners and customs\\".In 1885, Charles J. S. Makin used some of Farsari's views to illustrate his travel account Land of the Rising Sun, Being a Short Account of Japan and the Japanese. As photomechanical printing was still in its infancy, it was common for artists and illustrators to create works derived from photographs. For example, Charles Wirgman's numerous engravings for the Illustrated London News were made from views by Wirgman's friend and sometime partner Felice Beato. Occasionally the link between a work of art and its photographic source material was less overt: Louis-Jules Dumoulin's 1888 oil painting Boys' Festival from the Bluff, Yokohama [sic] (now called Carp Banners in Kyoto) draws heavily from Farsari's photograph Gionmachi, Kioto (now often called View of Shijō-dōri, Kyoto); although the painted image strongly resembles the photographic source, the location of the subject has been changed in the title.

They pursue Steve and Sarah into the wilderness and eventually to the streets of Vancouver. The movie also featured a chase scene aboard the BC Ferries Queen of Vancouver. After a long chase, Stantin manages to shoot Steve in an underwater struggle. The killer's identity is not revealed until midway through the film. He attempts to evade detection by killing a member of a hiking expedition and taking his place. To keep the audience guessing as to the true identity of the villain, some of the hikers were played by actors known for playing bad guys: notably Clancy Brown (Highlander), Frederick Coffin (Mother's Day), Andrew Robinson (Dirty Harry) and Richard Masur (the vicious drug dealer in Who'll Stop the Rain). The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, Stantin does not forget about finding Steve. In fact, he becomes obsessed with finding him and chases him into the rugged forests of Washington, eventually leading to an underwater struggle where Stantin manages to shoot Steve."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: When Glynis Barnett shows friends her new yellow diamond nestling in its jewellery box, they never fail to be impressed. ‘People always say how sparkly it is and compliment me on the fabulous colour,’ says Glynis, 63, a retired PA from Kent. ‘They’re so surprised when I tell them the diamond used to be my husband John. ‘I paid £5,000 to have a laboratory turn his ashes into the gem as a way to keep him close to me after he died.’ Scroll down for video. Glynis Barnett, 63, a retired PA from Kent, shows off the yellow diamond made from the ashes of her late husband John. It may sound like something from a sci-fi film, but these so-called ‘cremorials’ — tributes made from cremated ashes — are becoming ever more common. For £3,000, you can have your ashes pressed into vinyl records, or mixed with paint and painted into a favourite scene. Ashes can also be shot into space, floated out to sea in a model ship or even encased in concrete and turned into part of a man-made reef off the Dorset coast — a scheme created by Dorset Council for families to encase their loved ones’ ashes in concrete ‘bereavement balls’ and added to the reef, providing a home for marine wildlife. When John died in 2011, aged 64, following a long battle with throat and liver cancer, Glynis spent months wondering what to do with his ashes. ‘Although we had been married for 42 years, we never discussed in detail what we wanted if either of us should die,’ she says. ‘His ashes sat by the side of my bed for 18 months, while I struggled with my grief. Glynis with husband John. Despite beiing married for 42 years she says they never discussed in detail what they would do if one of them died. ‘I eventually decided to scatter them under the willow tree in our garden, but then I remembered a friend of mine who’d told me she planned to have her husband’s ashes turned into a diamond if anything happened to him. ‘I liked the idea I could take a little piece of John with me wherever I went. After months of research, I contacted Phoenix Memorial Diamonds in Manchester and ordered a .75 carat canary yellow gem. All I needed to do was send off 100g of John’s ashes by recorded post, and pay a deposit of £2,500.’ Turning ashes into a diamond is fairly straightforward, as both are comprised of the same substance: the element carbon (the human body is 18 per cent carbon, and the rest is mostly water). Natural diamonds are formed underground when carbon is put exposed to huge amounts of heat and pressure. Laboratory-grown diamonds are made by creating the same forces artificially. Glynis says her friends always admire the £5,000 yellow diamond she had made out of John's ashes. First, the ashes are heated to 1,300c until they become molten, then they are compressed at 10,000 tons per square inch for several weeks until they form a diamond crystal, which is chemically indistinguishable from a natural stone. Because the chemical make-up of each person’s ashes is unique, so is the size, clarity and precise colour of the stone that emerges. However, the natural colour of diamonds made from human ash is broadly canary yellow due to the nitrogen content in the ashes. These yellow laboratory diamonds sell for about £6,500 per carat — around 40 per cent less than the equivalent natural diamond, which costs more because it takes thousands of years to form, is scarce and has to be mined. Once the diamond crystal has been formed, it is cut and polished in the same way as a natural diamond would be. Glynis waited 12 weeks for her diamond to be delivered. ‘My youngest son Robert, 29, who works in finance, was incredibly suspicious of the whole process and insisted on being there when the diamond was delivered,’ she says. ‘He drove the courier to our local jeweller to have the gem tested before he’d let me pay the balance.’ Glynis is now hoping to get her diamond set into a ring, and plans to leave it to her daughter Lucie, 31, in her will. ‘John would have laughed at my extravagance, as I am pretty frugal by nature, but I feel it’s an important, lasting and very personal tribute to my beloved husband.’ Cremation expert Richard Martin says that memorialising a loved one — whether that means having some of their ashes made into a paperweight or even decanted into cartridges and fired from a shotgun — can be incredibly cathartic. ‘All that matters is that you feel you have chosen a fitting resolution for that person, your family and friends,’ he says. Sue White in her garden with the £645 sculpture that contains her late husband Bruce's ashes. Not all ‘cremorials’ are as subtle as Glynis’s diamond. When visitors step into Sue White’s manicured garden, the first thing they comment on is the striking modern sculpture, in the shape of a closed flower bud, rising from her rockery. ‘Of course, they’re a little taken aback when I tell them: “That’s Bruce — my late husband”,’ says Sue, 60, a company director from Ascot, Berkshire. Bruce, who ran a successful record label, was 68 when he died peacefully at home in November 2011 from lung cancer with Sue, son Julian, now 44, and daughter Natalie, 40, by his side. Once his funeral was over, Sue was at a loss as to what to do with his remains. ‘It was just too difficult to talk about once he became ill,’ says Sue. ‘The ashes were handed over to us a few days afterwards in an ugly plastic jar. I found it so painful to look at, I hid it in the garage for more than a year.’ A year on, Sue and Natalie decided to scatter some of the ashes in the garden of the family’s holiday home in Spain. ‘We thought about scattering the rest around our garden in England, but I quickly realised that if I ever moved house, it would mean leaving Bruce behind for good,’ says Sue. ‘After searching online, we decided on a memorial ornament instead — something that would be a tangible reminder of Bruce but portable, too. We bought it online from a specialist company called Scattering Ashes for £645 and had a small plaque made for it with Bruce’s name on. ‘It has an internal sphere that Natalie and I carefully opened and decanted the ashes into at the kitchen table. ‘I thought I would find that hard to do, but it was actually very cathartic. Now, every time I pop out to snip a few herbs for my cooking, I see the sculpture and feel connected to Bruce. ‘I sometimes wonder if he would be happy with what I’ve done — but I love the sculpture, and I’m sure he would be glad about that.’ Heidi Lewis, 42, with mum Pat whose last wish was that her family would have a party celebrating her life and send her ashes up in fireworks. Increasingly, people are leaving instructions in their wills about how they would like their ashes used. Heidi Lewis’s mother, Patricia Mitchell, 73, a retired market researcher, was very clear about what she wanted before she passed away from long-standing health problems on April 25. ‘Mum told me in no uncertain terms that she did not want a religious funeral, nor should anyone attend the crematorium,’ says Heidi, a 42-year-old student nurse and mother to Henry, 19, Stanley, 12, and Arney, nine, from Woking in Surrey. Heidi says she couldn't think of a better send off for her late mother. ‘Instead, she left £6,000 from a funeral savings plan for us to throw a big party to celebrate her life. ‘She said she wanted to have her ashes sent up in a firework display over Eel Pie Island, in the middle of the Thames at Twickenham. It’s the site of a famous jazz club that she used to love going to in the Sixties. ‘My sisters Lyndsay, Madeleine and I desperately wanted to hold the wake on her birthday, May 9,’ says Heidi. ‘It was all a bit of a rush, but we managed to courier some of Mum’s ashes to Heavenly Stars fireworks in Colchester, Essex. ‘They transferred around an egg cup-full into a large firework — a complete display in one package — at a cost of £249. ‘We organised a big group of family and friends to meet in a local pub, and then walk, accompanied by a New Orleans-style jazz band, to the Twickenham rowing club. ‘There were eulogies and poetry readings then, as it started to get dark, my eldest son lit the fuse on the firework display. ‘There were two minutes of spectacular flashes, bangs and colours as the fireworks scattered Mum’s ashes over the island she loved. ‘As the fireworks came to an end everyone cheered, clapped, whistled and yes, shed a few tears. ‘What better send-off could anyone ask for?’","completion":"A lady named Glynis had a yellow diamond made from her husband's ashes after he passed away.

Read this and answer the question The Victorian era in particular became notorious for the conditions under which children were employed. Children as young as four were employed in production factories and mines working long hours in dangerous, often fatal, working conditions. In coal mines, children would crawl through tunnels too narrow and low for adults.

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from last week's loss to the Buccaneers, the Bengals prepared for a showdown with the Panthers. This game saw the return of 3rd down running back Chris Perry and safety Dexter Jackson. In the first quarter, Bengal defense allowed a 7-yard TD pass from quarterback Jake Delhomme to tight end Kris Mangum for the quarter's only score. In the second quarter, the Bengals when quarterback Carson Palmer completed a 16-yard TD pass to tight end Reggie Kelly. Delhomme countered with a 20-yard TD pass to running back Nick Goings. After halftime, Cincinnati's offense found its stride. Kicker Shayne Graham nailed a 23-yard field goal in the third quarter, and Carson Palmer completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh. The drive was kept alive by a 4th and 1 play action pass, where Palmer tossed a high arcing pass down the sideline to a sprinting Chad Johnson, who caught it for a 32-yard gain. The Panthers' last scoring opportunity ended when Delhomme threw his first career interception to Kevin Kaesviharn. The Bengals improved to 4-2, and tied the Ravens for the lead in the AFC North. After being relatively silent for most of the season, Chad Johnson spoke out boastfully before the Atlanta game predicting he would score multiple touchdowns and jeopardize the job security of rival defensive back, DeAngelo Hall, who entered the game with four interceptions.

Here's a more detailed and comprehensive answer to the question: The envoys in question were sent to the Ming court of China, which was ruled by the Hongwu Emperor during the early period of the Ming Dynasty. This exchange of envoys took place as a diplomatic interaction between the Hongwu Emperor and Sagya Gyaincain, an influential Tibetan leader during the time. The historical event can be traced back to a primary source, \\"Records of the Founding Emperor.\\" The Hongwu Emperor sought to establish a relationship with the Tibetan leader by bestowing upon him the title of \\"Initiation State Master,\\" a prestigious designation that reflected Sagya Gyaincain's status and influence. In response to the honor of receiving this title, Sagya Gyaincain dispatched envoys to the Ming court as a diplomatic gesture of gratitude and acknowledgement. These envoys were entrusted with the responsibility of delivering Sagya Gyaincain's jade seal of authority, which symbolized his acceptance of the Hongwu Emperor's recognition. In addition to the jade seal, the envoys also carried other precious items as tribute, reflecting the importance of this diplomatic exchange and demonstrating respect for the Ming court. These items included colorful silk and satin fabrics, statues of the Buddha, Buddhist scriptures, and sarira—precious relics believed to be the remains of enlightened Buddhist masters. In summary, while the original answer contains pertinent information, a more focused and specific reply to the question \\"Where were the envoys sent?\\" would be: The envoys were sent to the Ming court of China during the reign of the Hongwu Emperor, as a diplomatic gesture from Sagya Gyaincain, an influential Tibetan leader."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"If people decide not to reproduce, there will be a decreased human population over time. This would likely lead to less carbon dioxide and methane production in several ways. Firstly, a smaller population would require fewer resources, leading to reduced demand for energy generation, transportation, and industrial processes, all of which contribute to carbon dioxide production. With fewer people breathing, there would also be a slight decrease in carbon dioxide exhaled. Secondly, the decreased human population would produce less waste. With less waste decomposing, methane production would reduce. Additionally, large-scale agricultural practices such as livestock farming, which contribute to methane emissions, may become less necessary due to a reduced demand for food. Water evaporation would still occur, but there would likely be a decrease in water vapor produced by human activities, such as power generation, manufacturing industries, and residential water use. As a consequence, the decrease in human population would have a direct and indirect effect on the levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere. However, other factors such as remaining agricultural practices, natural processes, and other sources of greenhouse gas emissions would still contribute and may even dominate the emissions scenario, depending on the scale of the population decrease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Astonishment at realisation a flashlight app extracts location information. Angry Birds game named among the worst offenders on mobile phones. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Beware of Privacy Intrusions: Popular Apps Extract Your Location Information Introduction: In recent times, privacy concerns have become an essential factor in our growing reliance on technology. A shocking discovery reveals that even innocuous apps such as the flashlight app might be extracting and sharing your location information. To make matters worse, the ever-popular Angry Birds game is listed among the worst offenders compromising users' privacy on mobile phones. In this article, we aim to create awareness about the potential privacy risks that come with the use of such apps. Step 1: Expose the extent of the issue. Firstly, it is important to provide a clear overview of the privacy intrusion issue. An alarming number of mobile apps request access to user data, such as location information, even though the app functionality does not have a legitimate need for it. Users should be made aware of this potential threat to their privacy and be vigilant when granting permission to apps to access their data. Step 2: Spotlight on the flashlight app. The flashlight app, meant for providing light to the user in times of need, has been found to extract the user's location information covertly. This discovery is concerning since there is no justifiable reason for a flashlight app to require location details. Moreover, users may be unaware of this intrusion as they usually perceive the app as harmless. It's crucial to create awareness around such revelations to empower users to make informed decisions about the apps they install on their devices. Step 3: Expose Angry Birds as a primary offender. In addition to the flashlight app, the popular mobile game Angry Birds has been recognized as one of the top privacy offenders in the app world. The game has amassed millions of dedicated users worldwide, and with it being identified as a privacy violator, it poses a significant threat to user data. This issue should not go unnoticed, and the game's developers should be held accountable for addressing and rectifying these concerns. Step 4: Discuss the consequences of location data extraction. To emphasize the severity of the issue, it is necessary to discuss the consequences that users may face when their location data is extracted and shared. Location information can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as stalking, identity theft, and targeted advertising, to name a few. By becoming aware of these dangers, users will be more cautious when downloading apps and providing permissions. Step 5: Provide tips for maintaining privacy and data protection. To conclude the article and leave the readers with tangible guidance, it's crucial to offer tips and best practices that users can follow to maintain privacy and protect their data while using apps. Some examples include: 1. Be cautious when granting app permissions – Only grant access to data that is necessary for the app to function correctly. 2. Regularly review and update app permissions – Check the settings on your device to ensure your apps have appropriate permissions. 3. Avoid downloading apps from unknown sources – Stick to trusted app stores and research app developers before downloading their products. 4. Use privacy tools, such as VPNs or location masking applications, to safeguard your location information. Conclusion: Privacy concerns are increasingly becoming important in the digital age. Apps like the flashlight app and Angry Birds game continue to emphasize the need for vigilance when it comes to protecting one's privacy and location data. By staying informed and practicing good data hygiene, users can better protect their information and enjoy a safer experience in the world of mobile applications."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The pair, whose radio shows are the first and second most popular in the US, are being taken off air by Cumulus Media which is the second-biggest broadcaster in the nation. The decision means that Limbaugh and Hannity will lose a significant chunk of their listeners - and could make NPR’s Morning Edition the most listened to radio show. However, Limbaugh is already making moves to get back on the radio in cities where he would be blacked out. Scroll down for video. Rush Limbaugh had advertisers leave in droves after he referred to a female law student as a 'slut' and a 'prostitute' for advocating free birth control. Conservative talk show host Sean Hannity, whose radio show is the second-most popular in the country, is also on the verge of being booted from thousands of local radio stations. The New York Daily News reports that in New York, Limbaugh - likely with Hannity along with him - is probably going to move from Cumulus' WABC station to WOR - an AM radio stationed owned by rival Clear Channel. The move is being hailed as a ‘major shakeup for the radio industry’ and even though it is reportedly over money, there is speculation that Limbaugh may be the real reason. The. root of the row does seem to be Limbaugh’s comments about Fluke, who in. February last year gave evidence before the House Democratic Steering. and Policy Committee on the need for affordable birth control. On. his radio show Limbaugh said in response that she ‘essentially says. that she must be paid to have sex - what does that make her?' He. went on: ‘It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She. wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford. the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to. have sex.’ His comments. sparked and firestorm on social media and an advertising boycott from. the likes of AOL, Sears, Netflix, Autozone, Capital One, J.C. Penney and. the Cleveland Cavaliers. Controversy: Sandra Fluke became a national celebrity when Limbaugh called her named after she was denied an appearance before a House hearing about birth control. Cumulus. chief executive Lew Dickey is said to have blamed him for the 2.4m. first quarter slump in advertising revenue after he called Fluke, the. pro-choice Georgetown University law student, a ‘slut’ and a. ‘prostitute’ live on air last spring. According to Politico, Cumulus has now said it will not renew either Limbaugh or Hannity’s contract, which expire at the end of the year. Negotiations. are also said to have broken down between Cumulus and Premiere. Networks, the division of Clear Channel which distributes the shows for. both men, because they could not agree on payments for distribution. rights. Both sides are reportedly tough negotiators and have apparently chosen to walk away rather than agree an unsatisfactory deal. Cumulus. has already begun working on how it will fill the slots vacated by. Limbaugh and Hannity and are looking at moving hosts like former. Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee and conservative. commentator Mark Levin into one of their slots. Executives have also begun asking radio talent agencies and regional stations to put forward potential hosts. Jason Easley, a left-wing commentator with PoliticusUSA, said: ‘The boycotters did it. ‘They got Cumulus to dump not only Limbaugh, but also Hannity. NPR's Morning Edition could become the top radio show in the country if the two conservative talk shows are dropped from Cumulus Radio. ‘Without the public pressure, bad publicity, and shame that the boycott brought on to his advertisers, Rush Limbaugh and Cumulus would probably still have a happy marriage.’ Limbaugh and Hannity’s shows are the first and second most popular in the US with 14 million and 13.25 million listeners each week respectively. Being dropped by Cumulus does not mean they will be going off air completely as Clear Channel, the largest radio distributor in the US, will continue to carry them. But a surprising effect could be making publicly-funded National Public Radio's Morning Edition the no.1 show in the country. It is currently in third with 12.3 million listeners, followed by All Things Considered, also on NPR, with 11.8 million listeners. In a statement Cumulus said: ‘Cumulus is not in a position to comment about negotiations with talent under contract, no matter what the rumor of the day might be’. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity are popular radio show hosts in the US. Some people didn't like the things they said on their shows about a woman named Sandra Fluke. Because of this, a big company called Cumulus Media decided to remove their shows from 40 radio stations. This means that they will lose many listeners, and another radio show from NPR called Morning Edition might become the most popular instead.

Sadly, the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain-addled. The film begins with Ingrid Bergman coming to work for the Stoddard family. Everything is so very peachy and swell--the family adores Bergman and things couldn't be more perfect. Well, that is until the mother (Fay Wray) dies, the stock market crashes in 1907 (wiping out the family's fortune) and Bergman is forced to go back home to France. This portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet, but not bad. Later, after the family's fortunes have improved, Bergman returns. The four boys are now all grown and there isn't really a conceivable reason why they'd hire her once again as a governess. But, briefly, everything is swell once again. But, when WWI occurs, the four all go to war--gosh! In the midst of this, one of the sons (David) brings home his new wife (Susan Hayward). Miss Hayward's character is as black and white as the others, though while they are all good and swell, she's obviously a horny she-devil. To make things worse, she comes to live in the family home while David is at war. Now here is where the movie gets really, really dumb--brain-achingly dumb. Hayward begins an affair with one of David's brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers, Bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her, not Hayward with Jack! WHY?! Why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman? This was exactly the sort of excuse Bergman needed to get rid of the gutter-snipe once and for all! This is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad...and most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941. The rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for Hayward's evilness to be exposed. This just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess. As expected, however, the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again---happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut, Hayward. The film suffers because of poor writing. Hayward's affair made no sense--at least in how it was handled. And, having characters who are so gosh-darn good or evil (with nothing in between) sinks this movie to the level of a second-rate soap. The only thing that saves it at all is the acting---they tried as best they could with a turgid script.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What year did the composer in a creative struggle perform a concert? ? With the outbreak of World War I on 28 July 1914, The Oceanides languished. Wartime politics being what they were, Sibelius's music was seldom played outside the Nordic countries and the United States: in Germany, there was little demand for the music of an \\"enemy national\\", while in Russia, Finns were viewed as being \\"less than loyal subjects of the Tsar\\". In any case, many of Sibelius's works had been printed by German publishing houses, a detail that harmed Sibelius's reputation not only in Russia, but also Britain and the United States. According to Tawaststjerna, the war plunged Sibelius into a state of melancholy and creative struggle (the Fifth and Sixth symphonies were in the process of simultaneous gestation at this time). His response was to retreat into near solitude: he abstained from attending and giving concerts and neglected his circle of friends, and he imagined himself \\"forgotten and ignored, a lonely beacon of light in a deepening winter darkness\\".Sibelius was not easily stirred from his exile; friend and fellow composer Wilhelm Stenhammar, then Artistic Director and chief conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Sibelius repeatedly to persuade him to conduct a concert of his works in Gothenburg. Believing himself duty-bound to premiere a \\"major work\\" in Sweden, such as a symphony, Sibelius—to Stenhammar's chagrin—delayed each scheduled trip. He withdrew from planned concerts for March 1914, writing to Stenhammar, \\"My conscience forces me to this. But when I have some new works ready next year, as I hope, it would give me great joy to perform them in Gothenburg\\". New arrangements were made for February 1915, but these, too, Sibelius canceled in December 1914. In the end, the indefatigable Stenhammar prevailed and new concerts were set for March 1915 (\\"I see yet again your great sympathy for my music. I shall come\\".).Stenhammar's efforts were rewarded with the European premiere of The Oceanides. For Sibelius, it was an opportunity to once again be an \\"artist on tour\\", feeding...

The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. Who was angry as the bus rode on? - The man who offered his seat to the woman who had to move - not enough information - The woman who had to move - The wife of the man who offered his seat The answer is:","completion":"The woman who had to move was the one who was angry as the bus rode on. This situation highlights the complexities and tensions that can arise in public spaces, where individuals with different needs, backgrounds, and perspectives come into contact with one another. It is important to recognize the various factors that contributed to this particular incident, including questions of race, age, entitlement, and societal expectations. The elderly woman, who was at least 75 years old and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus, was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped individuals. She clearly felt that she had earned her right to claim that seat and was unwilling to vacate it, despite the bus driver's insistence that the seat needed to be folded up in order to accommodate the young couple's pram on the wheelchair apparatus. Her reluctance to move may have been influenced by a perception of being singled out or unfairly treated, particularly in the context of racial dynamics and the neighborhood's recent gentrification. Furthermore, her advanced age may have also contributed to her sense of entitlement to the seat. The young couple with the baby in the pram faced a difficult situation of trying to secure their pram in a crowded bus. This must have been a frustrating experience for them, but they managed to resolve the issue after the man and his wife offered their seats to the elderly woman. The man who offered his seat to the elderly woman was not explicitly mentioned to be angry in the given context. He merely provided a solution in a compassionate manner to diffuse the tense situation on the bus. The man's wife, who also offered her seat and stood for the rest of the trip, was not necessarily portrayed as angry either, but rather annoyed over having to move. However, it is essential to appreciate the empathy exhibited by the couple who offered their seats to resolve the situation. In this given scenario, it was the elderly woman who was angry as the bus rode on. She vented her frustration by asking the middle-aged white man what he would do in a situation like that, to which he responded by suggesting offering it up to God. This anecdote serves as an important reminder of the challenges that can arise in shared public spaces and the importance of empathy, understanding, and sometimes personal sacrifice in navigating these situations."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

However, these are two separate indicators and can't be directly added, as they are not representing the same exact groups within the population. The most direct statistic we have about the overall population portion below the poverty line is 13.1%. So to determine the percentage of the population not living below the poverty line, we would subtract the percentage living below the poverty line from 100%. 100% - 13.1% = 86.9% So, approximately 86.9% of the population was not living below the poverty line.

Question: Background: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline. Paragraph: Pat has 2 acres of land next to Tim's property. Tim's land is of similar size. The clay soil on Tim's property is very alkaline, so he had to amend it with aluminum salts to make it more acidic in order to grow crops. The soil on Pat's parcel has a good structure and high infiltration capacity. Pat gets twice as much food of his land every year. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which soil from these two parcels has a poor structure?

Second question: Does it make sense to to bring a gold biscuit from abroad to India and sell in India? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Available choices: i. no ii. yes","completion":"First answer: When you want to bring a 100gm gold coin from the USA to India, the tax you need to pay is called customs duty. The Indian government charges a customs duty of 10% on gold (for example, on a gold coin). So if you bring a 100gm gold coin, you would need to pay a 10% tax on its price. Imagine if the gold coin costs about 100 chocolates, you would need to give 10 chocolates as a tax to customs. Second answer: Bringing a gold biscuit from abroad to India and selling it in India can make sense if you can sell it for a higher price in India than you bought it for, even after paying the customs duty. If you can sell the gold biscuit at a good price in India that covers the cost of the biscuit, the customs tax, and leaves you with extra chocolates (money), then it makes sense.

Firstly, I have to mention that the app's user interface is rather basic and lacks a certain polish. Although it is simple and easy to navigate, it would benefit from some touch-ups and a modern design overhaul to compete with other eBook readers available on the market today. In terms of functionality, the app supports multiple file formats, which I greatly appreciate, allowing me to read a variety of eBooks on my device. However, I have experienced some slow loading times when opening larger files, which can be quite frustrating. I liked the ability to customize text size, color, and font style in the app, but the options seemed limited compared to other eBook reader apps I've used. Ideally, I'd like to see more customization options to enhance the reading experience. Moreover, I have faced occasional crashes while using the org.geometerplus.zlibrary.ui.android app, especially when accessing and scrolling through my library.

Context: Based on experience with German strategic bombing during World War I against the United Kingdom, the British government estimated after the war that 50 casualties— with about one third killed— would result for every tonne of bombs dropped on London. The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.

A great-grandfather has put up his Christmas tree for the 84th time this year after his father first bought it from a toy shop in 1929. Douglas Hewitt, 84, has celebrated every Christmas with the artificial tree since he was born and he and his wife Mavis, 82, have once again put it up this year. Mr Hewitt's father bought the tree from Redgates toy shop, in Sheffield, just months after Douglas was born. The 4ft tree has been kept in its original red stand throughout the years and remains the centrepoint of the Hewitt family household during every festive season. Mr Hewitt, of South Anston, South Yorkshire, said: 'It reminds us of my childhood, our children's childhood and our grandchildren and great-grandchildren's after that. 'They all come and look at it and smile, it's become part of the furniture. 'If we didn't put that Christmas tree up, it wouldn't feel like Christmas. It would be different.' The tree was passed down to Mr Hewitt when he married Mavis in 1951. Mrs Hewitt said: 'Douglas was born in 1929 and they went into Redgates and asked for a Christmas tree and they didn't have any. 'The only one that was left was in the widow so his father said, \\"right, we will have that\\". 'Year after year we have just carried on using that one. You have to be a bit more careful with it now as it's a little fragile.' Sadly, it may be the last year that the tree makes an appearance in the Hewitt household, as it stands on its last legs. Scroll down for video. Mr Hewitt and his wife Mavis (pictured in 1980) have once again put the artificial tree up, 84 years after it was first bought. Mr Hewitt has said the tree used to have more branches on it and had 'seen better days' but it is once again standing pride of place in the Hewitt family home. Their daughter June Murphy also has fond memories of the Christmas tree. Mrs Murphy, 60, said: 'It was in my grandparents' home and then it was given to us. 'The lights that are on there now have been there since we went to a three-pin plug. 'It's looking a little thin now as each time you get it out something else falls off.

'We'd all be sad to see it go as I think it would be hard to find such a loved replacement.' The tree was passed down to Mr Hewitt when he married Mavis in 1951 (left). The artificial tree has been kept in its original red stand throughout the years (right) Mr Hewitt said: 'There were a lot more branches on it, and it's lost it's feathers that were all along the edge. 'There were little candle holders on the ends and little legs on it, but unfortunately they're been lost over the years. 'It could be its last outing, as it's seen better days.'

The rationale to choose \\"queue\\" as the answer is that when a printer experiences a paper jam, it usually stops the printing process and subsequently disrupts the order of print jobs within the printer's queue. The printer queue is a list of documents or files that are awaiting their turn to be printed. After the paper jam is resolved and the printer starts functioning normally, the specific print job that caused the jam may need to be removed from the queue to prevent the printer from attempting to print the same problematic document again. Additionally, other print jobs may have continued to be added to the queue during the paper jam, causing a backlog of documents awaiting printing. Clearing the queue ensures that any issues with the print jobs are resolved, and the printer can continue to properly process and print new documents. The other choices are not relevant to the situation described: - Ink - while ink may be involved in the printing process, it does not directly relate to the paper jam issue described. - Noise - paper jams and unjamming the printer do not specifically require clearing any noise. - Use paper - this term is not relevant in the context of addressing the aftermath of a paper jam. - Hard copy - a hard copy is a physical printout of a document, which does not directly relate to what James would need to clear after resolving the paper jam."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Monaco is known as a playground for the rich and famous, due to its tax laws. In 2014, it was noted about 30% of the population was made up of millionaires, more than in Zürich or Geneva. Choose your answer: Is the following statement correct based on the text is monaco a country in its own right Select from: * no * yes","completion":"* yes Monaco is indeed a country in its own right, as stated in the text. Officially known as the Principality of Monaco, it is considered a sovereign city-state, country, and microstate located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. While it lies within the geographical boundaries of the continent and is bordered by France on three sides and the Mediterranean Sea on the fourth, it maintains its sovereignty. This means that Monaco maintains supreme power or authority over its affairs and is not governed by any other state or country. Its sovereignty is further reinforced by present international recognition and its active participation as a full member of international organizations. It is globally recognized as an independent nation with its own government, constitution, and royal family. Its government can hold diplomatic relationships with other countries, make its own laws, and impose taxes, among other things. Monaco is also noted for its unique characteristics that set it apart from most countries in the world. It is notably the second-smallest and most densely populated sovereign state globally, and it boasts a high concentration of wealth, as evidenced by the proportion of millionaires within its population. Lastly, Monaco's active land reclamation, which leads to its territorial expansion, is an assertion of its sovereignty and independence. By undertaking such a significant and ambitious engineering project, Monaco demonstrates its autonomy and thus further distinguishes itself as a country in its own right."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. I am facing a new situation today: Manny and Joe checked their cholesterol levels.

UPDATE 2-Beauty buys to brighten Unilever as markets lack shine * Q2 underlying sales up 2.9 pct; beat analysts' estimates * Sees consumer demand remaining weak across markets * Stands by full-year outlook even as beauty business grows (Adds details on beauty business, CEO comments) LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Unilever expects a recent series of beauty deals to give its performance extra lustre while consumer demand remains weak for staple products from soup to soap. The Anglo-Dutch maker of Knorr soup, Lipton tea and Ben & Jerry's ice cream has been on a quest for the last few years to move away from food toward personal care, where margins and growth prospects are better. The wisdom of the transition was evident on Thursday when Unilever reported better-than-expected second-quarter sales, fueled by gains of 3.3 percent and 5.9 percent for its personal care and home care businesses, respectively. That compares with flat sales for the foods business which has recently divested brands including Slim-Fast and Ragu pasta sauces. Some analysts believe Unilever may also sell its margarines, after creating a stand-alone unit for the struggling business this month. Unilever executives repeated their expectation that full-year sales growth would probably come in at the upper end of a previously stated goal of 2 to 4 percent. That reflects the current low-key nature of its main markets. \\"Emerging markets continue to be subdued whilst in Europe and North America growth is negligible,\\" Unilever said in a statement. Its shares were up 1.7 percent in London by 1430 GMT. This year's acquisitions of four beauty brands -- REN Skincare, Kate Somerville Skincare, Dermalogica and Murad, which together have some 400 million euros in turnover -- should add to sales, margins and profits immediately. Even though they are small, they will give Unilever what Chief Executive Paul Polman called \\"critical mass\\" in a market for prestige beauty products, worth about 70 billion and growing amid increased interest in personal grooming and anti-aging. He stressed that Unilever was not rushing into the business, which is highly competitive, concentrated in developed markets such as the United States and Japan, and somewhat subject to the whims of fashion. \\"We are learning our way into this in a very mindful way,\\" Polman said, adding that he would look at further acquisitions as they arise, but for now has \\"enough on our plate to integrate these brands and make them work for us\\". Unilever is not the only food maker looking to plump its performance with skin creams and wrinkle treatments. Nestle last year set up a Skin Health division, after taking over a joint venture it had with L'Oreal. In general, makers of packaged food and drinks have seen a sales slowdown, due largely to economic weakness, but also because of a growing health consciousness that doesn't hurt sales of other household goods. \\"There's a limit to how much food, alcohol and tobacco smoke you can push inside a human body without having quite dire consequences, but there's no limit to the number of home and personal care products somebody can have,\\" said Whitman Howard analyst Chris Wickham. And whereas food must always be catered to local tastes, soaps, deodorants and creams can often be sold across markets. On average, shares of personal and household products companies like Colgate-Palmolive and Beiersdorf are trading at around 22 times forward earnings, versus 20 times for food companies. Unilever was recently reclassified as a personal care company instead of a food company by various stock market groupings, reflecting the fact that personal care is now its biggest business, accounting for 37 percent of turnover. The new beauty business will be run in a separate \\"Prestige\\" division headed by Vasiliki Petrou, who joined Unilever in 2012 after more than 16 years at Procter & Gamble, where she most recently ran Max Factor cosmetics. Max Factor is part of the business P&G is selling to Coty , conceding failure in its own move upmarket, selling designer perfumes and salon hair products alongside prosaic goods like detergent and diapers. Whereas mass market products such as Unilever's Dove soap and Axe deodorant are sold at supermarkets and drugstores, prestige beauty brands are sold at salons, department stores, specialty shops like LVMH's Sephora and Ulta, duty free shops or online. Analysts said Unilever would do a better job keeping up luxury brands' needed mystique, given that it already manages the high-end Maille mustard brand and T2 tea shops. \\"I think it's great that they absolutely recognize that they need to deal with it slightly differently to the rest of their personal care business,\\" said Bernstein analyst Helena Strettle. \\"We're quite confident in them.\\" Unilever's previous personal care acquisitions include TIGI hair care in 2009, Sara Lee's personal care brands in 2010 and its biggest, Alberto Culver, in 2011. Since paying 3.7 billion for the haircare company, sales from its TRESemme brand have more than doubled to over 700 million euros.

Right now, they want to sell more things like skincare and beauty products because they can make more money from them. They bought four smaller companies that make beauty products, which will help them grow in this area. People are buying more beauty products, but they're not buying as much food and drinks as before, so Unilever wants to change what they focus on.

Everyone feels negative emotions such as anger and needs to deal with them. But there are healthy ways to express anger and ways to control it. Shouting bad words at someone will hurt the other person or make them angry too. If you feel angry, it is best to think before you speak. Some people in the UK use the expression \\"take a deep breath and count to 10\\", meaning take a pause, breathe deeply and let yourself calm down instead of getting angry. Another expression people use to say they are controlling their anger is \\"biting their lip\\". This means not letting the bad words come out of their mouth. If you cannot think of anything but bad words, it is probably best to \\"bite your lip.\\" But sometimes letting all your anger out can be cathartic , as long as you do it at the right place and time. If you have just had a bad day, you could go into a room by yourself and scream or yell very loudly. Or if you want to hit someone or smash something, you could hit a pillow instead. Then after you let your frustration out this way, you'll be able to deal with your problems more calmly. If you do lose your temper with someone and swear at them, though, you need to apologize. One way to do this is to say \\"pardon my French\\". This expression has been used for many years as an apology for bad language. Then you can calmly explain what made you upset.

Great Barrier Reef - While the Great Barrier Reef is a natural habitat where living sharks are commonly found, it is not the place where you would go to find a shark that is no longer alive. 2. Deep Ocean - Similar to the Great Barrier Reef, the deep ocean is the natural habitat for many living shark species. Dead sharks may sink to the ocean floor and decompose, but it is not a specific location where you would purposely find them for display or educational purposes. 3. Maritime Museum - This is the correct choice for finding a shark that is not alive. Museums often display preserved or replica specimens of marine life, including sharks, for educational purposes. You may find stuffed, mounted, or replica sharks as exhibits in a maritime museum, which offer the opportunity to study the species in detail and learn more about their biology, habitats, and behaviors. 4. Ocean - Like the Great Barrier Reef and the deep ocean, the ocean in general is a habitat for living sharks. It is not a place where you would intentionally find a shark that is not alive for any specific purpose. 5. Pool Hall - A pool hall is a place where people play pool or billiards, and it has nothing to do with marine life or sharks.

Does it follow that \\"The EPA considered the future compliance costs.\\"? Options: [I] yes [II] it is not possible to tell [III] no","completion":"[I] Yes The statement \\"The EPA considered the future compliance costs\\" is likely accurate based on the assertion \\"As discussed previously, EPA considered the future compliance costs in assessing the impact of the rule.\\" In this circumstance, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is clarifying that in its decision-making process, it contemplated future compliance costs while evaluating the rule's impact. The mention of future compliance costs denotes any expenses that regulated entities might incur in the future related to satisfying the requirements of the rule under discussion. These costs could encompass various things, such as expenses for new equipment, increased operational costs, or even potential fees or penalties for non-compliance. It's crucial to keep in mind that cost assessment, such as considering future compliance costs, plays a pivotal role in the decision-making process of implementing new rules or changing existing ones. Before implementing any new rules, EPA evaluates the anticipated environmental, economic, and social effects to ensure that the system balances both environmental protection and economic sustainability. The mention \\"as discussed previously\\" implies that this isn't the first time the matter is addressed. This aspect can suggest that the EPA has an established procedure for considering future compliance costs when assessing the impact of a rule. Overall, it's clear that the EPA is mindful of the potential economic effects of its rules and takes these into consideration in its decision-making processes. This particular statement indicates a comprehensive appraisal of potential outcomes; it implies a careful balancing of environmental protection needs against the potential financial burden that could be imposed on those required to comply with the rule. Thus, in this context, it definitely follows that \\"The EPA considered the future compliance costs\\" as a part of the impact assessment of the rule. The EPA has considered not only the environmental impacts of the rule but also the costs that businesses will have to bear in the future to comply with the rule.

Narendra Damodardas Modi (Gujarati: ['n@re:ndr@ da:mo:d@r'da:s 'mo:di:] ( listen); born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician serving as the 16th and current Prime Minister of India since 2014. He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. In September 2013 Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modi's candidature, including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were \\"concerned with their personal agendas\\". Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's election campaign. Several people who voted for the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party. The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign. The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi. During the campaign, Modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous INC government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat. Modi projected himself as a person who could bring about \\"development,\\" without focus on any specific policies. His message found support among young Indians and among middle-class citizens. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism. Prior to the election Modi's image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, but during the campaign the BJP was able to shift this to a focus on Modi's neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development. Although the BJP avoided issues of Hindu nationalism to an extent, Hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign. The BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media. Modi's campaign blitz cost approximately Rs50 billion (US770 million), and received extensive financial support from corporate donors. In addition to more conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media, and addressed more than 1000 rallies via hologram appearances. The BJP won 31% of the vote, and more than doubled its tally in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984. Voter dissatisfaction with the INC, as well as with regional parties in North India, was another reason for the success of the BJP, as was the support from the RSS. In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before. It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims. The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the right-wing. Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism. Modi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies: Varanasi and Vadodara. He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi and Madhusudan Mistry of the INC in Vadodara by 570,128 votes. Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, was appointed prime minister by India's president. To comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: where did he do his campaigning?","completion":"Narendra Modi did his campaigning in various parts of India.

As political comebacks go, Nawaz Sharif's is among the more remarkable. He served two terms as Pakistan's prime minister in the 1990s before he was overthrown in a military coup and banished into the political hinterlands. After a Pakistani court sentenced him to life in prison for hijacking and terrorism, he managed to negotiate his way into exile in Saudi Arabia, where he remained for seven years, waiting for the political tides to shift and allow his return. On Wednesday, he completed his long journey back to power and became prime minister for an unprecedented third term. The Pakistani National Assembly, where his political party secured control in elections last month, elected him prime minister with 244 votes. Later Wednesday, he took the oath of office from President Asif Ali Zardari, one of his longtime political rivals whose term ends later this year. Zardari's Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) had been in government since 2008. This year, it became the first elected administration in the country's history to successfully see out a full term in office and hand over power democratically. But that milestone didn't help the PPP at the ballot box last month. Following a term plagued by corruption allegations, militant violence, economic torpor and power shortages, its support fell away in an election marred by extremist attacks on candidates. Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, on the other hand, performed strongly, capitalizing on his image as a flag-bearer for private industry and entrepreneurship with promises to revive the country's economic fortunes. Stern challenges. Now, as he takes the reins of government again, he will have to face up to Pakistan's raft of daunting challenges. His economic stewardship will be quickly put to the test. Analysts say Sharif, the scion of an industrial family and one of the country's richest people, has typically favored large, showy infrastructure projects such as highways as a way to spur economic activity. But with Pakistani's public finances in a fragile state, finding the funds for big building plans could prove difficult, observers say. He also has the complex task of resolving the country's energy crisis, which has resulted in prolonged power outages that hurt businesses and sometimes provoke street protests. The security situation in the country remains a severe problem, as the widespread attacks during the elections by the Pakistani Taliban and other extremists showed. Sharif has floated the idea of holding talks with the Taliban, but some analysts say the country's powerful military, with whom Sharif has clashed in the past, will hold the final word on key security and foreign policy decisions. Stance on drones? Until Wednesday, when he called for an end to drone strikes, his stance on the United States' unpopular program in Pakistan's tribal areas that border Afghanistan was unclear. \\"The campaign of drone strikes should be shut down,\\" Sharif said in his acceptance speech. \\"We must work together to ensure Pakistan's sovereignty.\\" Imran Khan, the former cricket star whose young party has become one of the main opposition groups in parliament, has called on Sharif to bring an end to the U.S. program. Sharif has condemned drone strikes in the past, including the one last week that killed the Pakistani Taliban's No. 2 leader. But analysts say he had good working relations with the United States during his previous terms in office and is likely to take a similarly pragmatic approach once back in power. He has said he will pursue closer ties with Pakistan's neighbor and archrival, India. During his second term as prime minister, in the late 1990s, Sharif oversaw Pakistan's emergence as a nuclear power, for which many Pakistanis still hold him in high regard. It remains to be seen what his third term will be remembered for. CNN's Shaan Khan reported from Islamabad, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"This article talks about Nawaz Sharif, a man who has become Pakistan's prime minister for a third time after being away from that position for many years.

His political party, called Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, did really well in the elections, and people liked him because he promised to help businesses grow and make the country richer. But now that he's in charge again, he has to deal with other big problems Pakistan faces, like not having enough electricity, feeling unsafe because of bad people doing violent things, and trying to work well with other countries like the United States and India."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although this single-word sentence may be considered simplistic and lacking explicit context, we can still deduce the general sentiment by examining the meaning, connotations, and typical associations of the word \\"radiant.\\" \\"Radiant\\" is an adjective that typically describes something or someone that emits light or is characterized by brightness. It can also refer to someone's glowing or beaming appearance, often prompted by their joy, energy, or vitality.

In a more figurative sense, \\"radiant\\" can be used to portray an individual who is emanating happiness, positivity, or confidence.

Hurt people Bullying and the use of mean words can have a significant impact on others, primarily causing emotional distress and hurt. When someone uses hurtful language or behaves aggressively, it can lead to people feeling sad, vulnerable, or unwanted, dramatically affecting their self-esteem. The environment in which the bullying occurs can also be negatively impacted, fostering fear and discomfort among bystanders or other individuals within the vicinity. Often, people who witness or are subjected to bullying and mean words face psychological and emotional repercussions, with long-term effects that go beyond the immediate moment. These experiences can lead to decreased confidence, increased anxiety, and sometimes even depression or suicidal thoughts. In some cases, victims or witnesses might also retaliate, potentially leading to escalated situations and more significant conflict. Moreover, the bully's mean words can also cause a ripple effect within the community. Bullying can contribute to a toxic environment, whether it takes place in a school, a workplace, or a social setting. When destructive behavior becomes commonplace, it can result in decreased morale, reduced productivity, and even a decline in mental and physical well-being among those affected.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation? , can you please find it? St Botolph's Church is an Anglican place of worship in the village of Quarrington, part of the civil parish of Sleaford in Lincolnshire, England. The area has been settled since at least the Anglo-Saxon period, and a church existed at Quarrington by the time Domesday was compiled in 1086, when it formed part of Ramsey Abbey's fee. It was granted to Haverholme Priory about 1165, and the Abbey claimed the right to present the rector in the 13th century. This right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation in the early 16th century, and then passed to Robert Carre and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. With capacity for 124 people, the church serves the ecclesiastic parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and, as of 2009, had an average congregation of 50. Recognised for its age and tracery, the church has been designated a grade II* listed building. It has a tower and spire with a nave and north aisle ending at a chancel at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out restoration work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of arcading correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and trefoils in the reticulated designs.

By the reign of Henry VII the cathedral was complete, appearing much as it does today (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit was placed in the nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.Elizabeth I gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailor, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair. The bishop went into retirement and some of the clerics were reduced to performing menial tasks. Answer:","completion":"Walter Raleigh"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument from where cult priests could conduct their daily activities?? The Pyramid of Neferirkare (in ancient Egyptian the Ba of Neferirkare) was built for the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai – referred to as Neferirkare – in the 25th century BC. It was the tallest structure located on the highest site at the necropolis of Abusir – found between Giza and Saqqara – and still towers over the necropolis today. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the Abusir papyri. The Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the Old Kingdom. Pyramids of the era were smaller and becoming more standardized, though intricate relief decoration also proliferated. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a step pyramid: a design that had been antiquated after the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC). This was then encased in a second step pyramid with alterations intended to convert it into a true pyramid; however, the pharaoh's death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material. Because of the circumstances, Neferirkare's monument lacked several basic elements of a pyramid complex: a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. Instead, these were replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument from where cult priests could conduct their daily activities, rather than the usual pyramid town near the valley temple. The discovery of the Abusir papyri in the 1890s is owed to this. Normally, the papyrus archives would have been contained in the pyramid town where their destruction would have been assured. The pyramid became part of a greater family cemetery. The monuments to Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II; and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini, are found in the surrounds. Though their construction began under different rulers, all four of these monuments were completed during the reign of Nyuserre.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Grade was born in Tokmak, Taurida Governorate, Russian Empire to Isaak and Olga Winogradsky. In 1912, when Grade was six, the Jewish family emigrated to escape Cossack violence and anti-Semitism, from Odessa via Berlin to Brick Lane in Bethnal Green in the East End of London. Isaak worked as a trouser-presser while his three sons (Grade and his younger brothers, Bernard (later Bernard Delfont) and Leslie) attended the Rochelle Street Elementary School near Shoreditch, where Yiddish was spoken by 90% of the pupils. For two years the Winogradskys lived in rented rooms at the north end of Brick Lane, before moving to the nearby Boundary Estate. At the age of 15, Grade became an agent for a clothing company, and shortly afterwards started his own business. In 1926, he was declared Charleston Champion of the World at a dancing competition at the Royal Albert Hall. Fred Astaire was one of the judges. Grade subsequently became a professional dancer going by the name Louis Grad; this form came from a Paris reporter's typing error that Grade liked and decided to keep. Decades later, the then octogenarian Lord Grade once danced the Charleston at a party Arthur Ochs Sulzberger gave in New York. Signed as a dancer by Joe Collins (father of Jackie and Joan Collins) in 1931, around 1934, Grade went into partnership with him and became a talent agent in their company Collins & Grade. Among their earliest clients were the harmonica player Larry Adler and the jazz group Quintet of the Hot Club of France. Following the beginning of the Second World War in 1939, Grade became involved in arranging entertainment for soldiers in Harrogate, and later joined the British Army. He was discharged after two years when an old problem with swelling of the knees, which had earlier ended his dancing career, recurred. In 1945, the arrangement with Collins having been terminated, Grade formed a partnership with his brother Leslie (Lew and Leslie Grade Ltd., or the Grade Organisation). That year, the brothers traveled in the United States, where they developed their entertainment interests. His connections included, among others, Bob Hope and Judy Garland, who performed in Britain for the first time. The brothers became the main bookers of artists for the London Palladium in 1948, then managed by Val Parnell for the Moss Empires Group owned by the family of Prince Littler.","completion":"This text is about Grade, also known as Louis Grad, who was born in the Russian Empire and later moved with his family to London.

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy.

When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman.

Atlanta","completion":"Title: Southern Justice: The Bowden Clause Plot: Step One: Setting the scene and character introduction Our movie starts off in bustling Atlanta, Georgia - a city with a intriguing blend of southern charm and cosmopolitan allure. This is the town where Sam Bowden, our protagonist, practices law. He's not a high-profile lawyer, frequently involved in minor cases, but highly respected for his tenacity, ethics and belief in justice. Reasoning: The introduction helps establish the environment and the main character, in line with user's request. This also helps create initial connection between the audience and the plot. Step Two: Establishing conflict Sam has always led a low-profile life, choosing cases that meant something to him, instead of the ones that could make him wealthy. Trouble runs his way when he is compelled to take up a case involving corruption in high level politics in the city. The antagonist, a powerful politician named Jim Lockhart who is known for his unscrupulous ways, becomes his opponent. Reasoning: Every good plot needs a conflict. In this case, by putting Sam, a humble lawyer, against a powerful politician provides a compelling plot involving justice against corruption. Step Three: The Middle Act Despite the risks, Sam is resolved to seek the truth and bring justice. His investigation leads him through a web of power, deceit, and mystery; he discovers a bribery scandal that threatens to destabilize the city. Along the way, he's supported by Ellie, a fearless journalist who believes in Sam's cause. Reasoning: Further developing the plot, we add another character, the female lead. This step adds layers to the plot and supports character development. Step Four: Climax As Sam and Ellie dig deeper, they stumble upon an assassination plot to silence the ones who oppose Jim. At a major public gathering, Sam exposes Jim with concrete evidence putting his life at risk. A tense situation arises leading to a thrilling showdown. Reasoning: The climax is the turning point, usually most intense part of the story. A public denouement adds to the drama. Step Five: Conclusion In the end, Sam manages to expose Jim Lockhart's schemes. Justice prevails, and he becomes an overnight hero. Though the victory is bittersweet, as he has made several enemies, he remains steadfast and committed to his ethos, ready to face whatever comes next. Reasoning: Concluding the movie plot in line with the theme, with our lawyer ensuring justice, provides a satisfactory resolution. \\"Southern Justice: The Bowden Clause” is an engaging legal thriller, symbolizing the fight against corruption.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas? , can you please find it? The first eruptions of Nevado del Ruiz occurred about 1.8 million years ago at the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch. Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two million years ago, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.The present period began about 150,000 years ago and involved the development of the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000 years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.During recorded history, eruptions have consisted primarily of a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660 BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245 BC ± 150 years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850 BC, 200 BC ± 100 years, 350 AD ± 300 years, 675 AD ± 50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps),[b] 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps),[b] 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September...

Marquise Byrd was riding in the front seat as a passenger Tuesday night when the sandbag hit the car heading south on Interstate 75. The driver of the car wasn't hurt, but Byrd suffered a serious head injury and was treated at the scene by emergency responders before being taken to an area hospital. Police told a local prosecutor that Byrd may die from his injuries, reports the Toledo Blade. As for the youths accused of tossing the sandbag, one is a 13-year-old and three are 14. All four were charged with felonious assault and booked into the Lucas County Juvenile Detention Center. People notes they're not being charged as adults and so won't name them, though the Blade does; two of them reportedly have previous criminal infractions. Authorities say other cars were hit with other objects, meaning more charges may emerge, including vandalism or homicide if Byrd dies from his injuries. The bridge the sandbag was thrown from is being renovated, and so sections of fence that normally would prevent anyone from being able to drop anything over the side are missing. The sandbag may have been left by contractors overnight to weigh down items like signage. An Ohio DOT rep warns, however, that even something much lighter than a sandbag could cause serious damage when thrown onto fast-moving vehicles from above. (This kind of overpass \\"mischief\\" is no joke.) Expand this summary.","completion":"A tragic incident involving a 22 year old Michigan man, Marquise Byrd, has occurred in Ohio. Byrd is currently in a critical condition at a local hospital after a sandbag thrown from an overpass onto the freeway smashed through the windshield of the car he was traveling in. Byrd was in the front passenger seat of a vehicle travelling south on Interstate 75 on Tuesday night when the sandbag struck. Physical harm to the driver of the vehicle was luckily avoided, but, sadly, Byrd sustained a serious head injury. First responders treated him at the scene of the incident before moving him to a nearby hospital for further treatment. Local law enforcement officials indicated to a local prosecutor that Byrd's injuries could lead to his death. On the subject of culpability, four teenagers are currently in custody in connection with the incident. Among them, one teenager is thirteen years of age, while the other three are fourteen. The boys are currently being held at the Lucas County Juvenile Detention Center, all having been charged with felonious assault in connection with the incident. The publication People has declined to disclose the identities of the alleged perpetrators, due to the fact they are not being charged as adults. In contrast, the Toledo Blade chose to publish their names. It is reported that at least two of the defendants have had previous encounters with the law. There are indications that more charges can be pressed against the juvenile suspects, as it seems other cars were targeted with different objects. Depending on the outcome of Byrd's health situation, possible charges could range from vandalism to homicide. Interestingly, this incident is related to maintenance works being conducted on the overpass from which the sandbag was thrown. The bridge is currently under renovation and as a result, portions of the protective fence, which prevents objects from being thrown onto the road, are missing. It is speculated that the sandbag used in the attack could have been left overnight by contractors, who were using them to weigh down signage. The Ohio Department of Transportation issued a statement about the dangers of tossing items onto moving vehicles, stating even a lightweight item could inflict significant damage if it were to hit a vehicle moving at high speed.

People spend maybe an hour or so to wandering around the town square, and buy a drink before hopping back on their transport back to the capital city of Romania. But, thanks to an epic tip-off from the travel ninja Shikha at Why Waste Annual Leave and a few other Brasov devotees, instead of following the crowds, we booked a couple of leisurely nights there. At the end of our day trip, instead of returning to Bucharest and getting stuck in the Sunday evening traffic, we checked into our hotel and waved our guide off. Yes, you can easily ‘do’ Brasov in an afternoon – it’s a popular stop off at the end of a day trip after visiting the “home” of Dracula – Bran castle, and the beautiful Peles castle – but having the leisure to linger was exquisite. In addition to trying local dishes, we also ate lunch at McDonalds. Yes, yes, as a blogger we shouldn’t pretend to eat anything other than caviar washed down with champagne and unicorn tears, but we were hungry and couldn’t be bothered to find somewhere. (For the record, we both opted for a Big Mac and a diet coke.) For the first half day, we wandered around whilst the skies were beautifully blue… …learned a lot of local history, admired the Hollywood style sign in the hills… …slipped into a couple of churches (not to mention dodged giggling kids racing around on miniature cars)… …some hidden, and some hidden in plain sight… …and admired the sign from our cosy hotel, as it lit up at twilight Our only full day dawned fairly murky for the most part, it was a Sunday so a lot of things were closed, so after hitting 20,000 steps and getting lost a few times in the less pretty corners of the city… Question: What does the blogger probably like to do while traveling to new cities?

News article: Millions could die as world unprepared for pandemics, says UN A global epidemic far worse than the Ebola outbreak is a real possibility and could kill many millions if the world does not become better prepared to deal with the sudden emergence and transmission of disease, the UN has said in a hard-hitting report. The report has emerged in draft form, as experts rally to deal with the rapid spread of the Zika virus across Latin America, which has been linked to thousands of cases of brain damage in babies. Countries in the region have again been caught off-guard because of the lack of scientific knowledge about the virus and the absence of good data on microcephaly, a condition in which babies’ heads fail to grow properly in the womb. The report comes from the high-level panel on the global response to health crises, set up by the UN secretary general in April 2015, as the Ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,000 people finally waned. Several other inquiries into what occurred, and the slow and inadequate response by the World Health Organisation (WHO), have reported and fed into the UN panel’s conclusions. Too often, global panic about epidemics has been followed by complacency and inaction “The high risk of major health crises is widely underestimated, and … the world’s preparedness and capacity to respond is woefully insufficient. Future epidemics could far exceed the scale and devastation of the west Africa Ebola outbreak,” says the panel’s chair, Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete from Tanzania, outlining their findings in the preface. “Too often, global panic about epidemics has been followed by complacency and inaction. For example, the 2009 influenza pandemic prompted a similar review of global preparedness, but most of its recommendations were not addressed. Had they been implemented, thousands of lives could have been saved in west Africa. We owe it to the victims to prevent a recurrence of this tragedy.” The report, which has been posted online in advanced, unedited form in the UN’s Daily Journal, is not just about the mishandling of Ebola, but about the crucial need for the world to put in place systems to detect and fight new disease threats. “Notwithstanding its devastating impact in west Africa, the Ebola virus is not the most virulent pathogen known to humanity,” says the report. “Mathematical modelling by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has shown that a virulent strain of an airborne influenza virus could spread to all major global capitals within 60 days and kill more than 33 million people within 250 days.” Other diseases that have recently caused widespread suffering include four major outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) in Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea, the pandemics of avian and swine flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). “These all serve as stark reminder of the threat to humanity posed by emerging communicable diseases,” says the report. The panel says surveillance and response to outbreaks must be led by the WHO, but the key role should be played by a centre for emergency preparedness and response. The centre “must have real command and control capacity”, says the report, and it should have the best technology available to identify, track and respond to an emerging threat. The report also says countries must report on their state of compliance to WHO every year and must be regularly reviewed. All countries must give the WHO more money, says the report – an increase of at least 10% in their funding. In addition, they must put 300m for a contingency fund for emergencies, not 100m as recently set up. A further fund worth 1bn must be set up for the development of vaccines, drugs and testing equipment. Prof Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said: “Epidemic and pandemic diseases are among the greatest of all threats to human health and security, against which we have for too long done too little to prepare. After four inquiries into the preventable tragedy of Ebola, there is now a strong consensus about what must be done. The WHO’s leadership and member states must make 2016 the year of decision and act now to build a more resilient global health system. “As the UN panel and the other inquiries recommend, the cornerstones of better health security must be a strong, independent WHO centre to lead outbreak preparedness and response, new mechanisms and financing for developing vaccines, drugs and diagnostics for potential epidemic threats, strong community engagement and investment in basic health infrastructure in every country, not just those that can afford it.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Without delay, he took a few steps towards the cupboard where the kettle was placed. Step by step, he justified his actions as follows: Step 1: Examine the kettle Vincent thoroughly checked the kettle's condition to ensure it was suitable for boiling water. He noticed that the kettle was clean and free from rust, thus deeming it safe to use. Step 2: Fill the kettle with water Vincent fetched fresh water from the tap and carefully filled the kettle, being cautious not to spill any water. He filled the kettle with enough water to cover the amount of spaghetti he planned to cook. Step 3: Boil the water He placed the kettle on the stove and switched on the heat to a high setting, aiming for a rapid boil. In choosing this method over the rusty pot, he eliminated any risk of rusty residue in the pasta water. Step 4: Monitor the boiling water While waiting for the water to boil, Vincent stayed close by, keeping an eye on the kettle to ensure it didn't boil over or encounter any issues. Step 5: Prepare the spaghetti While the water was heating, he took the opportunity to measure out the desired amount of spaghetti for his meal. He separated the strands and broke them in half, ready to be cooked. Step 6: Add spaghetti to the boiling water Once the water reached a steady boil, Vincent carefully poured the spaghetti strands into the kettle. He used a fork to gently stir the pasta, allowing it to cook evenly. Step 7: Cook the spaghetti Vincent let the spaghetti boil in the kettle for the recommended 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep the noodles from sticking together. He felt justified in using the kettle instead of the rusted pot due to the safety and cleanliness measures. Step 8: Drain the spaghetti After the spaghetti reached the desired tenderness, Vincent turned off the stove and carefully poured the contents of the kettle through a colander, draining the hot water and capturing the cooked spaghetti. Step 9: Finish the dish Lastly, Vincent took the cooked spaghetti and tossed it with his preferred sauce and other ingredients, finalizing his dish and serving it to his satisfaction. As the story progresses, Vincent remains firm in his decision to use the kettle over the rusty pot.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: The action is set in San Francisco during the 1980s. Weslake, who was laid off from his job, is working in a low-paying position at Garvey's pawn shop. Weslake has one friend nicknamed 'Turtle' who's homeless and is seen throughout the whole film searching for something to eat. One day, Dillard, who is an amateur musician, and Ramon, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who lives with his sister Maria, come to Garvey's shop. The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it's not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back. Their conversation is heard by a 'Boardwalk', a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again. Because of this Weslake doesn't inform his employer of the planned robbery, and instead joins Dillard, Ramon Boardwalk and Turtle in their attempted robbery. He becomes the brain of the whole operation, designing a plan for breaking into the large safe in the pawn shop. Guess a valid title for it!

Each character has their own reason for participating in the heist, whether it be for survival, entertainment, or to regain a sense of self-worth. Step 3: Creating the title The first part of the title, \\"Breaking Bonds,\\" suggests that the characters are breaking free from the constraints of their circumstances and forming new connections with each other. The second part, \\"The Pawn Shop Heist,\\" makes it clear that the film revolves around a heist taking place in a pawn shop.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: You are presented with the question \\"What can overexposure to vibrating matter cause?\\" and the following answer choices: - symptoms - hypothyroidism - Pollution - hyperthyroidism - Damaged hearing - Electrical energy - Relieve pain - decrease stamina Now knowing that matter vibrating can cause sound and overexposure to sound can damage hearing, choose the best answer. The answer is:","completion":"Damaged hearing Overexposure to vibrating matter is most commonly associated with the generation of sound. Sound is a form of mechanical energy that travels through a medium, usually air, as longitudinal waves. These waves are produced by the rapid vibration of matter which then transfers that energy to neighboring molecules, causing them to vibrate as well. When a person is exposed to loud sounds for an extended period of time, these vibrations can cause damage to the delicate structures within their ears, specifically in the inner ear where the mechanosensory hair cells are responsible for converting sound vibrations into electrical signals that the brain interprets as sound. These hair cells are extremely sensitive, and if they are subjected to excessive vibrations, or loud sounds, they can become permanently damaged or destroyed. This damage can result in temporary or permanent hearing loss, depending on the extent of the damage and the individual's susceptibility. Among the answer choices provided, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism refer to conditions related to the thyroid gland, which is not associated with sound exposure. Pollution, while a significant environmental concern, is not a direct consequence of exposure to vibrating matter. Electrical energy is not related to vibrating matter or sound exposure, and relieving pain is an unrelated effect. Decrease stamina is also not a direct result of overexposure to vibrating matter, but could be a symptom of another underlying issue. Thus, \\"damaged hearing\\" is the best and most accurate answer. It is important to recognize and understand the risks associated with exposure to loud sounds and take appropriate steps to protect one's hearing, such as wearing earplugs in noisy environments or keeping the volume of headphones or speakers at a safe level. Preventing damage to one's hearing can help preserve the ability to communicate effectively, enjoy music and other sounds, and maintain overall quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A network rep claims that the decision to not move forward with the animated comedy came before an anonymous woman alleged that the former 'Silicon Valley' star sexually assaulted her in 2001. Comedy Central has canceled T.J. Miller's animated series The Gorburger Show after one season. News of the cancellation came Tuesday, the same day the former Silicon Valley star was accused of sexual assault and violence by an anonymous woman in a Daily Beast story, though a rep for the network claims that the decision to not move forward with a second season of the show predated the allegations, with one source noting it happened in July. The woman alleges that while she and Miller were seeing each other in college at George Washington University in 2001, the actor strangled her and punched her in the mouth during sex. She also said he penetrated her anally without her consent, and later did the same with a beer bottle. Miller has denied the claims, writing in a statement with his wife, Kate, that the woman is \\"using the current climate to bandwagon and launch these false accusations.\\" The married couple added that they think it is \\"unfortunate that she is choosing this route as it undermines the important movement to make women feel safe coming forward about legitimate claims against real known predators. We stand together and will not allow this person to take advantage of a serious movement toward gender equality by allowing her to use this moment to muddy the water with an unrelated personal agenda.\\" Miller executive produced and starred on the eight-episode comedy, which aired from April 9-June 4 on Comedy Central. The actor-comedian voiced the host of the show, a giant blue space monster who has invaded a Japanese morning talk show and held its staff hostage as he attempts to understand what it means to be human by interviewing celebrities and musical artists. Guests included Rob Corddry, Larry King, Tig Notaro, Drew Pinsky and Reggie Watts. The alien puppet talk show was created by Ryan K. McNeal and Josh Martin, with the pair writing, directing and executive producing the comedy alongside Sean Boyle for Funny or Die. The Gorburger Show previously ran for two seasons and 19 episodes on Funny or Die before moving to HBO as a pilot in 2015 and eventually landing at the Viacom-owned network earlier this year. Elsewhere, Miller has a number of films coming up. Among them: Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One, DreamWorks' How to Train Your Dragon 3, Kristen Stewart starrer Underwater and Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool 2. Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox declined to comment on the allegations. Meanwhile, DreamWorks and Underwater producer Chernin Entertainment did not respond to requests for comment. Miller made headlines when he abruptly left Silicon Valley, the breakout HBO comedy on which he played fan-favorite Erlich Bachman for four seasons. In a wide-ranging exit interview with The Hollywood Reporter at the time, Miller took shots at executive producer Alec Berg (\\"I don't know how smart [Alec] is. He went to Harvard, and we all know those kids are fucking idiots. That Crimson trash\\") and star Thomas Middleditch (\\"I'm not sitting here saying, 'I need more lines. I'm not funny enough.' I'm not Thomas Middleditch\\"), and explained that he was leaving the hit series because he'd rather \\"parasail into the Cannes Film Festival for The Emoji Movie because that's the next new funny thing that will make people laugh.\\" ||||| Warning: This story includes graphic content. An alleged victim of former Silicon Valley star T.J. Miller is coming forward with accusations that Miller hit and sexually assaulted her while in college. The accusations were eventually addressed by a student court at George Washington University and have been buzzed about in Hollywood and stand-up circles for years. “He just tried a lot of things without asking me, and at no point asked me if I was all right,” the woman told The Daily Beast. “He choke[d] me, and I kept staring at his face hoping he would see that I was afraid and [that he] would stop… I couldn’t say anything.” Miller’s alleged victim, who asked to remain anonymous, said she is coming forward now in part because of the societal awakening to issues of sexual assault and harassment that has come in the aftermath of misconduct allegations that have rocked the entertainment industry. The Daily Beast is withholding her identity because of her fears of retribution. But for the purposes of this piece, we will call her Sarah. Miller has told friends over the years that he was wrongfully accused. And in a statement to The Daily Beast, Miller and his wife, Kate, denied any wrongdoing. Instead, they cast themselves as the victims. Sarah “began again to circulate rumors online once [my and Kate’s] relationship became public. Sadly she is now using the current climate to bandwagon and launch these false accusations again,” the Millers wrote. “It is unfortunate that she is choosing this route as it undermines the important movement to make women feel safe coming forward about legitimate claims against real known predators.” “ Miller began ‘shaking [her] violently’ and punched her in the mouth during sex. ” But it’s not just Sarah who has come forward. The Daily Beast has corroborated details of her story—which includes two separate incidents—with five GW contemporaries and spoke to numerous associates of both her and Miller. Two of the GW contemporaries say they were in the off-campus house where the incidents allegedly occurred. The contemporaries later testified in student court about hearing the sound of violent thuds or seeing bruises on Sarah. Three other contemporaries said they comforted and counseled Sarah in the aftermath of the incidents. Matt Lord was one of them. An ex-boyfriend of Sarah’s, he told The Daily Beast that he continues to believe her story more than a decade after the fact. “I attended George Washington University for undergraduate studies from 2000 until December 2003... I had a romantic relationship with [this] woman, who spoke with me about T.J. Miller sexually assaulting her,” Lord, who currently works as an attorney in Montague, Massachusetts, wrote in a statement to The Daily Beast. “At the time I believed the statements she made regarding the assault by Mr. Miller, and I continue to believe the statements she made are true. She was engaged in student conduct proceedings regarding the sexual assault, and I remember the emotional toll that the assault and the subsequent conduct hearings placed on her.” In the years since, Miller has attempted to address the lingering allegations by occasionally making light of them. He’s privately joked about committing violence against a woman in his past, according to three sources in the comedy world. Perhaps that is why some female performers and comedy professionals tell The Daily Beast that they have declined to work with Miller, citing a perceived history of abusive behavior. The incidents took place at GW where Miller was a student and Sarah was taking classes but not matriculating. They fell in with the same GW comedy troupe, receSs, during which time they struck up a relationship. “I felt relatively safe with T.J. at the time,” Sarah explained. But months into their relationship, which started in the fall of 2001, Sarah said the first troubling encounter took place. She recalled having “a lot to drink” and admitted that there are “parts of [the incident] I don’t remember.” She stressed that “it is important to me to cop to that… [and] I’m not interested in forcing a pretend memory on anyone… 15 years later, I remain terrified of accusing someone of something they didn’t do, but I have a visual and physical memory of that.” However, Sarah said she has a distinct memory that as they were “fooling around” at her place, Miller began “shaking me violently” and punched her in the mouth during sex. Sarah said that she woke up the following morning with a fractured tooth and a bloodied lip. When she asked Miller about it that morning, he claimed, according to Sarah, that she had simply fallen down drunkenly the past evening. She was unsettled by the incident, but said that she did not know many people in D.C. and continued to see Miller. She had lost her virginity to him and, at least for a brief window, he was someone she trusted. “ I couldn’t bring myself [at the time] to believe this had happened... It was me not wanting it to be true. ” “I couldn’t bring myself [at the time] to believe this had happened,” Sarah said. “It was me not wanting it to be true.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

She was upset and disappointed and said that she called Miller to confide in him. She had not fully processed the first encounter, she said, and Miller was still someone she believed she could turn to in a time of stress and vulnerability. They soon met at a college party, and left in a cab to head back to the apartment she had been renting with her roommates. When they arrived back at her home, they began to engage in consensual sex—but then Miller became violent again, Sarah said. She emphasized that she had not had more than two drinks that evening, and that her memory of the following “five-hour” ordeal was and is “crystal-clear.” “We started to fool around, and very early in that, he put his hands around my throat and closed them, and I couldn’t breathe,” she recalled. “I was genuinely terrified and completely surprised. I understand now that this is for some people a kink, and I continue to believe it is [something] that should be entered into by consenting parties. But, as someone who had only begun having sexual encounters, like, about three months earlier, I had no awareness this was a kink, and I had certainly not entered into any agreement that I would be choked. “I was fully paralyzed,” Sarah continued. Sarah claimed that she was “choking audibly”—to the point that her roommates could hear what was happening and rushed over to knock on her bedroom door. Sarah said she then got up and walked to her door in a robe, and one of her roommates asked if everything was OK. “I don’t know,” she responded, before shutting the door, “I’ll talk to you in the morning.” “He pulled me back to bed and more things happened,” Sarah said. “He anally penetrated me without my consent, which I actually believe at that point I cried out, like, ‘No,’ and he didn’t continue to do that—but he also had a [beer] bottle with him the entire time. He used the bottle at one point to penetrate me without my consent.” During the incident, Sarah said she “froze.” She says she “wasn’t prepared” for what had happened and that she “didn’t want to believe it was happening.” Miller finally left her apartment around 5 a.m. The next morning, Sarah said she confided in her roommates about what had happened. One of those housemates, who is currently a Maryland resident and stay-at-home mom who asked not to be named in this story, confirmed as much to The Daily Beast. “I knew T.J. was in her bedroom and I was in my bedroom, which was a wall away,” the source said. “My [other] roommate was in my bedroom with me and we heard a loud smacking noise, and we were concerned… The very next day when we talked to [Sarah] she was very upset, and… had said he had hit her in a very violent way.” Katie Duffy, a former GW student and another of Sarah’s ex-housemates, said she had not realized that the “T.J.” from that night was the famed actor and comedian until informed by The Daily Beast. (She conceded she “had to Google him.”) But she recalled the incident much as Sarah had described it. “One night, she had [Miller] back, and late at night… [a housemate and I] heard quite a lot of fighting [sounds] and banging, and loud, violent sounds [in the room next to us],” Duffy said. “So we knocked on the door of our housemate [Sarah], and asked if she was OK. She did indicate she was OK. Whatever response she gave, we felt we didn’t have to intervene further, at least at the time… Looking back, I wish we had done more to intervene, but we didn’t know what was going on… This is a girl I didn’t know very well, but it didn’t mean I didn’t have the power to go into that room, and remove her from that situation, and protect her. We did what we thought was the right thing at the time. It wasn’t enough.” The next morning, Duffy recalled, Sarah came down to the small kitchen where other housemates were having coffee and breakfast. Her physical appearance raised alarm. “She looked like she had been through a rough night—I recall seeing bruises [on Sarah],” Duffy said. “One roommate asked if she wanted to go to the police. Others offered to take her to the hospital, given how she looked.” Sarah ultimately declined. Duffy moved out shortly thereafter, and said she hasn’t spoken to Sarah since, simply because “we didn’t know each other well.” In the days and weeks that directly followed the alleged sexual assaults, Sarah’s friendship with Miller disintegrated completely. She said they met once more, days after that second night, to talk about what had happened; “T.J. said it was a ‘trust thing’… and that he thought I was into it,” Sarah recalled. As they drifted apart, she asked mutual friends of Miller’s about the incident. According to Sarah and those close to her, the responses were fairly uniform, to the effect of, “Yeah, that’s just T.J.” The only other time she would see him over the next year was at a female comedy group show that she attended. “T.J. showed up to heckle, and I remember being so angry,” she said, “and had to leave.” “ She looked like she had been through a rough night—I recall seeing bruises... One roommate asked if she wanted to go to the police. Others offered to take her to the hospital. ” It would be almost a year—following much deliberations, counsel, and support from friends—before Sarah went to GW’s campus police to tell them what had happened. By then, Miller was in his last year at the university. “I was not ready to process what was happening [the prior year], and I have spent a lot of time in my life apologizing for not having shouted ‘no,’ and for not having told my roommates to get him out of here,” Sarah said, explaining why she didn’t go to campus police a year earlier. “I was not ready to reconcile the events taking place with the person I had known. It was so disorienting and so physically traumatic.” Like other female college students in similar circumstances, Sarah did not want to take the case to the cops since nearly a year had passed, and there was no remaining physical evidence. Instead, her allegations were handled by the “student court” at the university. At this point, Sarah asked her housemate—the current Maryland mom who heard the “loud smacking noise”—if she would testify in the student court process, and she agreed. “I testified in student court about the noise I had heard and how upset she was after the incident,” Sarah’s former housemate recalled to The Daily Beast. “T.J. was there with a lawyer during the student court proceeding.” That housemate subsequently asked Duffy if she’d testified. “I was happy to,” Duffy said, recalling that she did not see Sarah at the student court during her testimony, but said that Miller, his father, and his attorney were there. “I was asked why I hadn’t done anything [more] if I was so worried… and I said, well, the noises were loud enough that it did prompt us to ask what was wrong, so we did do something,” Duffy said. “I felt very uncomfortable, the way they were challenging me on it.” Sarah said that the student court grilled her about “all my habits,” including what she had to drink, and how much, on both nights. She was asked if she had ever heard of erotic asphyxiation, and was asked if they had ever discussed the sexual practice, which she had not. After a trial period that lasted a couple of weeks, Sarah said that the university told her that the issue had been resolved. A GW spokesperson would only tell The Daily Beast that “because of federal privacy law, we are not able to provide information about current or former students’ education records,” in response to inquiries regarding a campus PD report or the student court proceedings. The federal law GW is referencing is the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). GW did confirm, however, that Miller graduated in 2003, but did not comment on whether he “graduated early” due to any unique circumstance. Other knowledgeable sources told The Daily Beast that Miller was “expelled after he graduated”—an outcome that appeared to be an attempt by the university to satisfy both parties. Sarah said she had lost acquaintances over her allegations, several of whom were her former comedy-troupe cohorts, most of whom ended up supporting Miller. Four of these friends spoke to The Daily Beast, though none agreed to do so on the record. Each of these friends was in the college comedy troupe or matriculating at GW at the time. And all of them presented the same general portrait of Miller as a gregarious and generous person who “couldn’t have done this,” as several said. “I’ve known T.J. since college, always known him to be a very caring person, and respectful, particularly toward women,” one friend said. “And he loves his wife very, very much.” Another source, who testified in student court (via phone, post-graduation) on Miller’s behalf, said it was unimaginable that T.J. could do “anything like that.” “I have never heard of another woman [who dated him in college] make any kind of allegation or insinuation that he was anything but a good guy,” the friend continued. Another friend insisted that Miller “was the type of person if you took him to a strip club, he would want to talk to the strippers, not hit on them.” No one has accused Miller of hitting on strippers. A source also produced a set of email exchanges between Miller and someone who dated Sarah later in life. The emails, one of which was presented without the conversation that preceded it, didn’t directly address the incident itself but instead showed both parties trying to come to a more amicable understanding. Sarah told The Daily Beast that she was simply under “some social pressure to be cool about this at the time, and didn't necessarily see myself as having any other option to resolution.” One of Miller’s friends said he “believed [Sarah] knew she was making this up” to “intentionally and maliciously fabricate” a sexual-assault allegation. This friend could not offer any evidence to support such a claim, nor could another person, who wasn’t a friend of Miller’s but shared a similar view and testified on his behalf. Kate and T.J. Miller made similar accusations in a statement‍ provided weeks after first learning that The Daily Beast was reporting on these incidents. “We met this woman over a decade ago while studying together in college, she attempted to break us up back then by plotting for over a year before making contradictory claims and accusations,” the Millers wrote. “She was asked to leave our university comedy group because of worrisome and disturbing behavior, which angered her immensely, she then became fixated on our relationship, and began telling people around campus ‘I’m going to destroy them’ and ‘I’m going to ruin him,’” the statement continued. When asked about these claims, Sarah’s responded, “Of course not.” “He was a friend to me before [the incidents], and he had been there for me before that,” she said. “I didn’t want him in jail. I didn’t hate him. He was someone I cared about… I don’t want to mess up his life. But he behaved in a way towards me that I have to live with… [and] I don’t think it’s appropriate that I carry this by myself.” If Sarah was eager to settle scores with Miller, she certainly didn’t show it. When The Daily Beast first started looking into this story, those close to her said for months that she had expressed no desire to come forward and was actively avoiding media inquiries. Only weeks after the advent of the #MeToo movement did that seem to change. Miller soon left his alma mater and became a star in stand-up comedy. He then began appearing in major Hollywood productions, and landed a starring role on the critically lauded HBO show Silicon Valley. But despite the lack of public accusations since his time at George Washington, whispers about what happened in his college years followed him. Four female comedians and bookers who spoke to The Daily Beast said that they had heard of the alleged sexual misconduct at GW. Some of these comics had heard about the accusations from Sarah directly, and have since warned women in stand-up comedy about Miller. But some know about the sexual-assault allegations because Miller talked about them himself when confiding in friends and associates. Four sources in the L.A. and Chicago comedy scenes—including JC Coccoli, a Los Angeles-based producer who briefly dated Miller in 2009—said they each first heard of the allegations because Miller had told them about them or referenced them in private conversation, or at small gatherings before or after shows. Miller did so in the context of vehemently denying “rumors” circulating in various comedy communities. Other times, he would crack jokes about punching a woman he knew in college, two other comics independently told The Daily Beast. Maura Brown, a comedy festival organizer and publicist who used to work in L.A. and has since uprooted to Portland, Oregon, said she has also heard about the Miller allegation for years. “Very commonly, women have warned each other [in entertainment] about him… and about what happened in college,” Brown told The Daily Beast. Brown noted that starting in 2013, when she first heard about the allegations, she “never wanted to work with him [ever], and never wanted to work on the same projects as him,” and that “this convinced me to not try to book him or promote him in any way.” “ I didn’t want him in jail. I didn’t hate him. But he behaved in a way towards me that I have to live with… I don’t think it’s appropriate that I carry this by myself. ” Still, Miller, whose star is increasingly rising in Hollywood these days, continues to have friends in high places in the entertainment world. Miller is set to appear in several major film projects, including an upcoming movie co-starring Kristen Stewart and another starring Ryan Reynolds. This year, HBO aired his stand-up special, and Comedy Central started airing The Gorburger Show, what Miller has previously told The Daily Beast is his “passion project” about a murderous alien talk-show host. Sarah, his alleged victim, no longer lives in L.A., where she resettled not long after auditing at GW. She says she had a “wonderful experience doing improv and comedy” in the local comedy scene, and tried to put what happened with Miller behind her. “ I had to see him at my improv school [in L.A.], which I, shortly after, stopped going to, and see him at stand-up shows, and I stopped doing stand-up [eventually in L.A.],” Sarah said. “It doesn’t help that when I was living in L.A. I had to keep seeing his name on billboards, and on bus stops, and it just didn’t… stop.” She added, “It is unfathomable to me that he doesn’t understand that he actually put me through something I have to live with, that I never would’ve chosen, that completely, completely set the tone for my sexual adult life, that I actively had to spend years and years… un-programming.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Comedy Central has cancelled T.J.

They're not exciting at all. There are 2 shocking scenes. They're all related to killing with axes. One of them is exceptionally appalling because it involves a child. Besides that, I felt detached while watching this film. I did not care about the characters. The 2 main characters, the sheriff and his estranged wife rarely spoke with each other. The last scene where the sheriff sat with his wife looking at sunrise was supposed to be touching. However, I felt nothing.It's worth watching for curiosity. A:","completion":"Based on the given review, it can be concluded that the customer was dissatisfied with the product, which in this case is a movie. The dissatisfaction can be inferred from the various negative aspects pointed out in the review. Here's a breakdown of the criticisms mentioned by the customer: 1. Lack of suspense: The customer states that the movie lacks suspense, which suggests that they found it predictable and unengaging. This is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction, as suspense is a crucial element for creating an immersive experience in a movie. 2. Poorly executed fighting scenes: The customer mentions that the fighting scenes are quick and badly filmed, which indicates that they were not pleased with the way the action sequences were executed. This further implies dissatisfaction, as well-handled action scenes often contribute to the overall enjoyment of a movie. 3. Unexciting content: The reviewer points out that the movie's shocking scenes were limited and not particularly exciting, which suggests that it failed to provide the type of intense, thrilling experience they might have been looking for. 4. Lack of emotional connection: The customer explicitly states feeling detached while watching the movie and not caring about the characters. This shows that the movie did not successfully engage with their emotions, adding to their dissatisfaction. 5. Weak character development: The reviewer criticizes the relationship between the two main characters, the sheriff and his estranged wife, for not being well-developed and properly explored. This further highlights their dissatisfaction with the movie's storytelling and character development. 6. No emotional impact: The customer refers to a specific scene meant to be touching but mentions feeling nothing. This indicates that the movie failed to evoke any emotional reaction from them, which is a significant element of dissatisfaction, as emotional engagement is a key component of a satisfying movie experience. Despite these negative points, the customer mentions that the movie is worth watching for curiosity. This is a slight positive aspect to the review, but it's not enough to outweigh the numerous criticisms. Therefore, it's safe to conclude that the customer was predominantly dissatisfied with the movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Diorama is the fourth studio album by Australian alternative rock band Silverchair, released on 31 March 2002 by Atlantic/Eleven. It won the 2002 ARIA Music Award for Best Group and Best Rock Album. The album was co-produced by Daniel Johns and David Bottrill. While Bottrill had worked on albums for a variety of other bands, Diorama marked the first production credit for lead singer Johns. Johns wrote most of the album at the piano instead of his usual guitar, while the band took a 12-month break following their previous studio album, Neon Ballroom. Silverchair worked with composer Van Dyke Parks on Diorama; the album contains numerous orchestral arrangements and power ballads, a change from the post-grunge music typical of their earlier work, but consistent with the band's previous orchestrations on Neon Ballroom. The album's title refers to \\"a world within a world\\". Five singles were released: \\"The Greatest View\\", \\"Without You\\", \\"Luv Your Life\\", \\"Across the Night\\" and \\"After All These Years\\". All except \\"After All These Years\\", a promotional single, appeared on the Australian singles chart. Diorama was successful in the charts but was not as well received by critics as the band's earlier albums. It reached number one on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart and received a rating of 71 (out of 100) on review aggregator Metacritic. It was certified triple-platinum by ARIA, selling in excess of 210,000 copies, and won five ARIA Awards in 2002. Diorama was nominated for Highest Selling Album in 2003, and three songs from the album were nominated for awards over the two years.

She hoped that by engaging in this simple yet thoughtful gesture, both of them could ease into a more relaxed conversation and genuinely enjoy each other's company. Leslie wanted to ensure that Joel felt comfortable and less stressed during the visit, as she understood how overwhelming such situations could be for him. The act of offering tea not only displayed Leslie's genuine care for Joel but also highlighted her empathetic nature. She believed in the importance of nurturing the emotional well-being of others.

Next question: when did the minimum drinking age become 21?","completion":"The history of the minimum drinking age in the United States has evolved over decades, influenced by social, political, and health-related factors. The establishment of a uniform minimum drinking age at 21 specifically can be traced back to the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. However, it is essential to look at the events leading up to this Act to understand the context and the reasons behind the age change. After the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, most states set the legal drinking age at 21. This initial choice was driven by a mix of tradition and the fact that 21 years was considered the age of majority at the time. Over the years, however, many states lowered their drinking ages in response to changing public opinion and pressures from the youth vote. By the 1960s and early 1970s, as the Vietnam War raged on and the legal voting age was lowered to 18, activists argued that if young individuals were old enough to fight and vote, they should also be allowed to drink alcohol. By the late 1970s, 29 states had lowered their minimum drinking ages to 18, 19, or 20. However, this change led to a surge in alcohol-related traffic fatalities involving young drivers, prompting calls for a higher national minimum drinking age. In response, several states voluntarily increased their drinking ages, while others maintained the lower limits. In the early 1980s, public health advocates and organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) began intensively lobbying for a higher drinking age. Their lobbying efforts culminated with the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act on July 17, 1984. Signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, this legislation required states to raise their minimum drinking age to 21 by October 1, 1986, or risk losing a portion of their federal highway funding. While the Act did not explicitly dictate a specific minimum drinking age, the attached financial penalties effectively set a national standard of 21 years. Faced with the potential loss of federal funding, all states eventually complied, with South Dakota, Wyoming, and Puerto Rico being the last to raise their drinking ages to 21 in September 1988. The increase in the national minimum drinking age to 21 has been credited with a significant decrease in alcohol-related traffic fatalities, particularly among young drivers. In fact, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that the higher legal drinking age has saved over 31,000 lives since 1984. However, the issue remains a subject of debate, with some calling for a reevaluation of the age limit and its effects on public health and individual rights."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a context, a sentence, and a character.

And I was wondering What does Aubrey need to do before this? A:","completion":"Before Aubrey takes Taylor's shopping advice, Aubrey needs to first identify their financial goals and determine how much they want to save. Here is a step-by-step process for Aubrey: 1. Define financial goals: Aubrey should think about their short-term, medium-term, and long-term financial objectives, such as saving for a vacation, building an emergency fund, or planning for retirement. 2. Determine the target amount to save: Based on the financial goals, Aubrey should decide on a specific amount they want to save. This could be a percentage of their income or a fixed dollar amount. 3. Analyze current spending: Aubrey should track their expenses for a month to understand where their money is going. This will help them identify areas where they can cut back or save more. 4. Create a budget: Using the information from steps 2 and 3, Aubrey can create a monthly budget that includes categories for different types of expenses, such as rent, groceries, utilities, and discretionary spending. 5. Implement Taylor's shopping advice: Now that Aubrey has a budget in place, they can start following Taylor's advice to save money while shopping: - Buy whatever they want: This option should also be carefully considered, as it's important to treat themselves occasionally but not overspend. Aubrey should allocate a specific amount for discretionary spending in their budget. - Look for items that are on sale: Aubrey can save money by purchasing items on sale or using coupons. This can help reduce the overall cost of their purchases and help stay within the budget. - Make a budget plan: Aubrey has already created a budget in step 4. Now they should stick to the plan and control their spending to effectively save money. 6. Review and adjust the plan: Aubrey should regularly review their budget to ensure they're on track with their savings goals.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has suggested holding an informal summit in the capital, Bratislava, in September, to give leaders of the remaining EU countries a chance to consider the future of the union. A \\"post-Brexit crisis summit\\", the news website euraktiv.sk calls it, saying that its theme will be \\"Whither the EU?\\" and will aim to articulate \\"a new vision\\" for the bloc as it prepares for the UK's departure. It recalls that Mr Fico told the European Council meeting in Brussels earlier this week that anyone who believes that after Brexit \\"we can just offer the European public more of the same is making a big mistake\\". According to Euraktiv.sk, if the summit takes place, it will be the first EU summit to be held outside Brussels since 2010 and the tone could be set by Central and Eastern European countries that joined the bloc in 2004. Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak has already taken part in post-Brexit talks with his counterparts from the Visegrad 4 group (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary) which were held in the Czech capital, Prague, on Monday. The meeting was also attended by the French and German foreign ministers. The day after the Prague meeting, Mr Lajcak visited London for talks with his British opposite number Philip Hammond. Slovak daily Pravda points out that Mr Lajcak was the first EU minister to visit London after the Brexit vote. According to the paper, Mr Lajcak believes that Slovakia's experience in handling a \\"divorce\\" - it became an independent state in 1993 after having been part of Czechoslovakia - might now stand it in good stead. However, Slovak media are in no doubt about the scale of the task facing the country. \\"The presidency is beginning to haunt Fico,\\" news website aktualne.sk declares. The Slovak presidency will be \\"all about Brexit,\\" Michaela Terenzani predicts in the English-language Slovak Spectator. And the junior partner in Slovakia's coalition government, the mixed Slovak-Hungarian Most-Hid (Bridge) party, posted a statement on its Facebook page saying that \\"Britain's decision completely changes the Slovak presidency, it becomes the number one issueâ€¦ It is extremely important that Slovakia rises to the challenge of this presidency, for never before has a presiding country faced such a tough task\\".

Context: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media. Clearly we had tapped into a seam of strong feeling among the nation's overworked... Question: How does the writer feel about attending lectures? Answer: Possible answers: (1).

Here is a goal: To form the melted beeswax and shea butter mixture into a usable shape as a lip balm. How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of forming the melted beeswax and shea butter mixture into a usable shape as a lip balm, follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather the necessary ingredients and materials: - Beeswax pellets or beeswax block - Shea butter - A double boiler or a makeshift version using a heat-safe glass bowl and a saucepan - Heat-resistant spatula or wooden spoon - Essential oil(s) for scent or flavor (optional) - Lip balm containers (plastic tubes, tins, or pots) - Small funnel or pipette (optional, but helpful for precise pouring) - Clean towel or paper towel for cleanup 2. Prepare the double boiler: - Fill the bottom part of the double boiler (or the saucepan in the makeshift version) with 1 to 2 inches of water. - Place the top part of the double boiler (or the heat-safe glass bowl) on top, making sure that the water doesn't touch the bottom of the top part. - Have the heat-resistant spatula or wooden spoon nearby for stirring. 3. Weigh and melt the beeswax and shea butter: - Weigh the beeswax and shea butter using a kitchen scale. A typical lip balm recipe calls for a 1:1 ratio of beeswax and shea butter (e.g., 2 ounces of each). This may vary depending on your desired texture and consistency. - Place the beeswax and shea butter in the top part of the double boiler. - Turn the stove to low heat to slowly melt the beeswax and shea butter. Stir occasionally with the heat-resistant spatula or wooden spoon to ensure even melting and to prevent scorching. - Once the mixture is completely melted, remove the double boiler from the heat to avoid overheating the mixture. 4. Add essential oils (optional): - If you'd like to add essential oils for scent or flavor, do so at this stage. Make sure to use lip-safe essential oils and follow the recommended dilutions. 5-10 drops of essential oil per 1 ounce of lip balm mixture is usually a good guideline. - Stir the mixture thoroughly to disperse the essential oils evenly. 5. Pour the mixture into the lip balm containers: - Place the lip balm containers on a flat surface, such as a countertop or table, with the lids removed. Make sure they are completely dry and clean. - Using a steady hand or the small funnel or pipette, carefully pour the melted lip balm mixture into each container. Work reasonably quickly, as the mixture will start to solidify as it cools. - Fill each container almost to the top, leaving a little space for the lip balm to contract as it cools and hardens. 6. Allow the lip balm mixture to set: - After pouring the mixture into the containers, allow it to cool and harden at room temperature. This may take a couple of hours, depending on the size of the containers and the room temperature. - To speed up the setting process, you can place the filled containers in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. - Avoid touching the mixture while it hardens to prevent leaving dents or finger marks. 7. Seal and store the lip balm: - Once the lip balm has hardened, place the lids on the containers and secure them tightly. - Store the lip balm in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight or heat sources. 8. Clean up: - Wipe any spilled mixture from surfaces with a clean towel or paper towels before it hardens. - Wash the double boiler, spatula or wooden spoon, and any other tools used with warm, soapy water. If there is any residue, it may help to heat the tools slightly to loosen the wax before washing. By following these steps diligently, you will have successfully formed the melted beeswax and shea butter mixture into a usable shape as a lip balm. You can now enjoy your homemade lip balm or even gift it to friends and family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If \\"A skateboarder jumps over a white fire hydrant.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The hydrant is under the skateboard.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"The hydrant is under the skateboard\\" when the statement \\"A skateboarder jumps over a white fire hydrant\\" is given. To further elaborate on this reasoning, let's break down the scenario provided in the statement and analyze it step by step. 1. First of all, there is a skateboarder who is assumed to be standing or moving on a skateboard. 2. Secondly, there is a white fire hydrant mentioned in the scenario, which should be stationary as per its usual function. 3. The statement mentions that the skateboarder \\"jumps over\\" the white fire hydrant. The term \\"jumps over\\" implies that the skateboarder, along with the skateboard, must become airborne over the fire hydrant for a brief moment. To achieve this action, the skateboarder has to exert sufficient force in the upward direction to lift the skateboard and their body off the ground, thereby creating an air gap between the skateboard and the fire hydrant. As a result, the skateboarder and the skateboard would clear the fire hydrant, enabling them to land back on the ground after passing over the white fire hydrant. Assuming that this jump progresses successfully, we can analyze the relative position of the skateboard and the fire hydrant during this scenario. When the skateboarder is mid-air in the process of clearing the fire hydrant, the board would be at a higher vertical position than the fire hydrant. Given that the fire hydrant's position remains unchanged, the skateboard would essentially be above it. Since the skateboard is above the fire hydrant, we can reverse the perspective to deduce that the fire hydrant is indeed under the skateboard in that specific moment of the jump. Therefore, the statement \\"The hydrant is under the skateboard\\" logically follows the scenario where \\"A skateboarder jumps over a white fire hydrant.\\" However, it is important to note that this statement only holds true for the duration of the jump when the skateboarder is airborne and clearing the hydrant. Once the skateboarder is no longer above the fire hydrant, the statement would cease to be applicable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Information: - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - The swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family Hirundinidae that are characterised by their adaptation to aerial feeding. \\"Swallow\\" is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the barn swallow. - The barn swallow (\\"Hirundo rustica\\") is the most widespread species of swallow in the world. It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In Anglophone Europe it is just called the swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a \\"swallow\\" rather than a \\"martin\\". - Petrochelidon is a genus of birds known as cliff - nesting swallows . The genus includes all of the five species of birds commonly called cliff swallow , and contains the following species : - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.

Michael O'Brien, the third partner in the firm, arrives with presents for all and kindly lets their employees leave. The three old men then go home to the mansion they share with Madame Tanya, an elderly countess dispossessed by the Russian Revolution, for a dinner with prestigious guests. When the guests cancel at the last minute, George is convinced it is because of his dark past. To relieve George's black mood, Michael comes up with an idea to obtain new guests for dinner. Each man throws out a wallet containing 10 and his business card into the street. George's is found by Arlene Terry, who merely gives the money to her driver and discards the wallet. However, the other two are returned by more considerate people: Texas cowboy James Houston and teacher Jean Lawrence.

Here is a news article: Not so when it comes to women voters, as everyone is by now well aware. Indeed, according to a Washington Post–ABC News poll, the gender gap between Obama and Romney currently yawns at a chasmic 19 points. To no small extent, Romney is suffering from wounds inflicted by the GOP nomination fight, in which Santorum’s ultracon positions on social and cultural issues forced the former Massachusetts governor further right than he wants or needs to be. (As for where he actually is—hey, who knows? We’re talking about Mitt Romney here!) And for weeks, Democrats, led by party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, made hay of the spectacle, crowing loudly and gleefully about the Republican war on women. It was this phenomenon that Romney attempted to turn on its head by maintaining that Obama’s economic policies were the real source of violence against the ladies. There were two mountainous problems with the ploy, however. First, it featured as its basis an entirely implausible (and quickly debunked) statistic: that women have accounted for 92 percent of job losses since the president took occupancy of the White House. And second, it was followed up by a campaign conference call—specifically on women’s issues, n.b.—in which Romney’s advisers couldn’t answer a basic query about whether the presumptive Republican nominee supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which made it easier for women to sue for equal pay and was the first piece of legislation Obama signed into law. But then some manna fell from the heavens and straight into Team Romney’s lap in the form of the Rosen flap. Put aside the fact that Rosen doesn’t work for Obama or for the Democratic Party. Put aside that much of what she said on CNN would have gone without notice had it not been for one horrific line: “Guess what? [Romney’s] wife has never worked a day in her life.” That one line was enough to ignite a classic media freak-show conflagration, allowing Team Romney to seize the moral and political high ground and, most important, spring out of its defensive crouch and launch a fierce offensive. Was the resulting 24-hour squall anything but absurd? Certainly not. But Democrats airily pooh-poohing the matter needed only to look at the reaction of the Obama campaign, the White House, and the DNC to get an accurate read on whether the Democratic forces sensed that they were suddenly vulnerable. Both Jim Messina and David Axelrod, two of Obama’s top political hands, insta-­tweeted strongly worded disavowals of Rosen’s remarks. Michelle Obama tweeted a message of implicit support for Ann Romney, and Obama himself followed up more explicitly in an TV interview that day. And by the following morning, DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse was running as fast as he could from not only Rosen but the war-on-women appellation itself: “I’m not a fan of the term,” Woodhouse told Slate’s Dave Weigel. “We in the DNC have not been running a campaign based on the term ‘war on women.’ ” To which all one can say is: Ahem. It would be easy enough to dismiss all this as irrelevant. Yet the antic, manic, overwrought first week of the general election did convey clearly two lessons worth pondering. The first is that, on both taxes and the gender gap, the Romney campaign isn’t going down without a fight—and it would behoove the Obamans to beware the ample dangers of smugness and sloppiness and overplaying their (admittedly strong) hand. And the second is that the campaign henceforward will be anything but pretty. How personal things will get remains to be seen. But neither side has ever demonstrated any reluctance not just to wage war but to scorch the earth in the process. In other words, if you thought the GOP nomination tussle was sickeningly, deplorably, appallingly brutish, superficial, and mean, I have five words of advice: Avert your eyes now, people. ||||| Barack Obama has been accused of many sins, but among the most common Republican charges against him is that he is a warmonger—though not in the usual sense of the term, of course. Just since the turn of the New Year, conservatives have inveighed against Obama for prosecuting a “war on oil,” a “war on coal” (with an attendant “war on Appalachia”), and a “war on energy”; a “war on religion,” a “war on the Vatican,” and a “war on the Catholic Church”; a “war on the Supreme Court” and a “war on the U.S. Constitution”; and, according to a new book co-authored by anti-tax zealot Grover Norquist, a “war on jobs and growth.” Even against this background of promiscuous martial-metaphorizing, however, few would have predicted that Mitt Romney would spend his first full day as a general-election candidate assailing Obama for waging—wait for it—a war on women. Or that the next day, after the kerfuffle involving Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen erupted, Romney’s people would attack Obama for inciting a “war on moms.” And for engaging in “class warfare” with the Buffett Rule. And for stoking a “war on reality” for … who knows? But while Democrats may tut-tut and shake their heads, they are hardly innocent here. It was the left, after all, that introduced the war-on-women lingo to the political vernacular in the first place. Phony wars are nothing new in presidential politics, to be sure, but rarely have they been this dimwitted, dishonest, debasing, or, when it comes to what the months between now and November hold in store, so utterly depressing. And yet as dismaying as last week was, it was also revealing of the terrain and tactics that will define the general election—with Chicago relentlessly touting economic fairness and seeking to exacerbate Romney’s weaknesses with key constituencies such as women, and with Boston talking economic opportunity and scrambling to rehab its man’s battered image with those same groups. The Democratic side is the favorite in this fight, no doubt. But there are signs amid the skirmishing that the Republican team can’t be counted out just yet. Let’s start with the scrap over the Buffett Rule, and tax policy more broadly. On the former, Obama has proposed (in a bill that the Senate will take up this week but is almost certain not to pass) that incomes over 1 million be taxed at an effective rate of 30 percent. On the latter, he pledges to allow the Bush tax cuts for families making more than 250,000 to expire at the end of the year. These are the plans that Romney and his allies characterize as class warfare—plans motivated by “the president’s priority of income redistribution,” as Karl Rove put it, and “designed to be punitive” to the successful, as top Romney surrogate John Sununu chimed in. On the merits, of course, the claims are ludicrous to the point of being laughable. It’s often (and rightly) pointed out that, with respect to the Bush tax cuts, what the Obamans want is a return to the Clinton-era tax rates—but only for the top 2 percent of filers. The Buffett Rule would affect even fewer people: the 0.08 percent of taxpayers, according to calculations by Citizens for Tax Justice, who earn most of their income through capital gains. And, though raising the tax rate on those gains to 30 percent would be a doubling of the rate that currently obtains, it would still be 5 percent lower than it was after the 1986 tax reform ushered in by (and venerated by conservative fans of) the sainted Ronald Reagan. Who knew the Gipper was a class warrior too? In truth, Obama’s tax plans are designed to be punitive only in one sense and toward one person: politically for Romney, whose refusal to release more than one year of his tax returns (despite having handed over 23 years’ worth to John ­McCain as part of his V.P. vetting in 2008) has become a prime target for Chicago. Why? Because the Obamans suspect that Romney’s returns would show that over many years he has engaged in an aggressive strategy of tax avoidance—perhaps perfectly legal but still illustrating his out-of-touchness. As Joe Biden asked a New Hampshire audience at a speech last week, “How many of you all have a Swiss bank account?” But the politics of Obama’s tax platform and his wider argument in favor of economic fairness aren’t clearly in his favor. According to a recent poll released by centrist Democratic group Third Way, 42 percent of independents and 43 percent identified as “swing independents” (those who remain undecided) agree with the statement, “We need an economy based on fairness, where the rich pay their fair share, corporations play by the rules, and all Americans get a fair shot.” By contrast, 47 and 51 percent of those groups agree with the assertion, “We need an economy based on opportunity, where hard work is rewarded, the government lives within its means, and economic growth is our top priority.” And by wide majorities, both groups say that fixing the budget deficit is more important than reducing income inequality. All of which reaffirms the one soft spot for Obama in other national polls: For all Romney’s troubles, he is running roughly even with the incumbent on the issues of jobs, the economy, and putting the nation’s fiscal house in order. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"This news article discusses the tactics and terrain that will define the general election between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.

Write an article based on this summary: A man has been jailed for raping a teenage girl almost daily for four years, the attempted rape another girl and abuse of a third.","completion":"Title: Four-Year Nightmare: Man Jailed for Continuous Rape and Abuse of Three Teenage Girls Introduction A shocking case unfolded in the courtroom as a man faced the consequences of his unimaginable actions - raping a teenage girl almost daily for four years, attempting to rape another girl, and the abuse of a third. As the details of these heinous crimes were exposed, it was evident that justice needed to be served to protect the victims and society as a whole. The Crimes The despicable actions committed by the offender went on for an appalling four years. During this time, he raped a teenage girl nearly every day, subjecting her to a life of torment and fear. Due to the sensitive nature of the case, her identity remains anonymous to protect her privacy, offering her some solace. The extended duration of this monstrous act highlights the dreadful control the perpetrator had over the victim, robbing her of her freedom, security, and innocence. Moreover, the man attempted to rape another teenage girl, while also subjecting a third to an unspecified form of abuse. Both teenagers have had their identities protected to preserve their dignity. All three victims have come forward to expose their attacker, displaying admirable courage as they seek justice for the atrocities perpetrated against them. The Investigation and Trial After the assaults were reported, an extensive investigation was launched. The police interviewed the victims, collected evidence, and built a solid case against the man. The gathered evidence was presented during the trial, and witnesses testified to the harrowing crimes committed by the accused. Throughout the trial, the prosecution pressed for the harshest possible punishment, citing the inexcusable nature of these offenses and the devastating impact on the victims' lives. Conversely, the defense employed various strategies to either justify the actions or lessen the gravity of the crimes, which ultimately proved futile. Sentencing and Repercussions Following a comprehensive trial, the man was ultimately found guilty of the atrocious acts and sentenced to an extended term in jail, ensuring the safety of the innocent from such a dangerous individual. This verdict serves as a significant victory for the victims, restoring hope that justice prevails even in the face of adversity. Aside from the jail sentence, the man is now officially registered as a sex offender. This designation will follow him for the rest of his life and restricts his access to certain institutions, ensuring accountability for his actions, even after serving his time. Conclusion The harrowing experiences endured by the three victims are a stark reminder of the importance of bringing abusers to justice. Society must continue to support survivors, encouraging them to share their stories and seek retribution. Moreover, the legal system must continually strive to protect the vulnerable, taking a firm stance against such heinous crimes. Though the physical and emotional wounds inflicted on these teenagers may never fully heal, the jailing of their abuser is an important step towards closure. Let this case serve as a deterrent to potential offenders, demonstrating that no matter the duration or extent of criminal actions, justice will always seek to triumph and protect the innocent."},{"prompt":"Q: Kai finally convinced his husband to get a new dog there.

In August 1836, two real estate entrepreneurs—Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen—from New York, purchased 6,642 acres (26.88 km2) of land along Buffalo Bayou with the intent of founding a city. The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto, who was elected President of Texas in September 1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state.

I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment.

Title: Ferdinand the Bull Movie plot: In the beginning, there are a lot of bulls, romping around together and butting their heads. There was only one bull who wasn't doing that, and that was Ferdinand. All he wanted to do was go under a shady cork tree and smell the flowers all day. Then one day his mother noticed that he wasn't playing with the other bulls. His mom asked him why he wasn't butting his head with the other bulls. He replied that all he wanted to do was to sit and smell the flowers. Luckily, his mother was very understanding. Over the years, Ferdinand grew and grew until he was as big as the tree. The other bulls wanted to accomplish one goal in life: to be in the bullfights in Madrid, Spain, but not Ferdinand. Then one day, five strange-looking men were here to see the bulls. When the bulls noticed them, they fought as rough as possible, hoping that they would get picked, but not Ferdinand who went back to smell the flowers. Just as Ferdinand was sitting, he accidentally sat on a bumblebee. That made him go crazy and on a rampage, knocking the other bulls out and crashed into a tree, making it fall down. The five men cheered as they took Ferdinand to Madrid. There was a lot of excitement when the day of the bullfight came. On posters, they called him Ferdinand the Fierce. At the ring came out banderilleros, picadors and the matador who was being cheered on. When he was bowing, a woman in the audience gave him a bouquet of flowers which landed in his hand. Then the moment came where Ferdinand came out. He was wondering what was he doing there. The banderilleros and picadors were scared and hid, but the matador was scared stiff because Ferdinand was so big and strong. But Ferdinand looked up in the stands and saw all of the beautiful hats that the women were wearing, each decorated with lovely, fragrant flowers. He couldn't stop staring at all the beautiful hats. The matador was very angry that Ferdinand wasn't charging at him. But Ferdinand was not interested in fighting; he was only interested in admiring the beautiful flowers....

Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island. A party of four, led by Karluk's first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarne Mamen, who accompanied the party as a scout, returned to Shipwreck Camp and reported that he had left the group a few miles short of land that was evidently not Wrangel Island, and was probably Herald Island, 38 miles (61 km) from their intended destination.

Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first Eurovision semi-final.Until 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career. The introduction of weekly semi-finals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semi-finals and final since 2003. Melodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as Anne-Lie Rydé, Tommy Körberg, and Lisa Nilsson. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including Baccara, Alannah Myles, Katrina Leskanich, and Cornelis Vreeswijk. Melodifestivalen participants have also represented—and unsuccessfully tried to represent—other countries at Eurovision. While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common, most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success. The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, \\"Symfonin\\" by Loa Falkman, topped the Swedish singles chart. The most recent occurrence was 2016 with Samir &... answer the following question: In what year did the song Symfonin reach top of the Swedish singles charts at the festival that has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts?

Q: Article: A reader from Brazil recently wrote to us asking for some advice. He's planning a trip to the United States, and wanted to know about the best places to travel in America. Today, we are going to give you some information which may help you when choosing your destination. Each of the 50 states in America has interesting things to offer visitors, but some are more popular than others. Washington, D.C. is famous for its historical places, like the White House and the Lincoln Memorial. Visitors to Los Angeles, California can see the Hollywood Walk of Fame or shop the stores on Rodeo Drive where they may see a star or two. The Grand Canyon in Arizona appeals to hikers, climbers and nature lovers, as does Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. TripAdvisor is a website where people can write reviews about their travel experiences. Every year, TripAdvisor makes a list of the top 25 cities to visit in the United States. The results are based on the opinions of visitors to the website. Brooke Ferencsik of TripAdvisor said the top picks on the list were not surprising. And it's no secret why New York City was named the number one destination. New York City is sometimes called \\"the city that never sleeps\\" because it can be very busy. It is an exciting place for many people because there is so much to do. But the city might be too busy for travelers looking for rest and calm. They might want something more like Myrtle Beach, in the state of South Carolina, which made it to number 21 on Trip Advisor's list. \\"A lot of people come to Myrtle Beach for great weather, it's a wonderful family vacation spot, the beaches - got the wonderful Atlantic beaches there - there's a lot of family-friendly parks and water parks.\\" Many people take time off from their jobs in the summer to travel. Because there are many tourists visiting other places, June until August is known as \\"high season.\\" Traveling during the high season can be crowded. Hotels, restaurants, and transportation might also be very expensive. If you want to save money on a trip, it is a good idea to plan to leave before or after the summer months. These times are known as \\"shoulder seasons\\" for travel. \\"If you're looking for value, try and think about traveling through the shoulder season if it's possible - the shoulder season being the fall or the spring. The weather is still very good in some of these destinations, and you can get better prices.\\" America's major cities are still the most popular destinations for visitors. Ferencsik says this is because of the good quality of services they provide tourists. \\"They do a great job of giving travelers what they want when they're on vacation. I think they kind of cater to every type of traveler need. So whether you're traveling alone, you're traveling for business, you're traveling with your family - whatever it is, those destinations are really tuned in to delivering amazing experiences and just a lot of different opportunities when you're there.\\" Question: Lily has great interest in nature and American history.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Under what dynasty did the regional military governors gain power? is inside the article: The Tang dynasty was largely a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule, until the devastating An Lushan Rebellion (755-763) and the decline of central authority in the later half of the dynasty. Like the previous Sui dynasty, the Tang dynasty maintained a civil-service system by recruiting scholar-officials through standardized examinations and recommendations to office. The rise of regional military governors known as jiedushi during the 9th century undermined this civil order. Chinese culture flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is traditionally considered the greatest age for Chinese poetry. Two of China's most famous poets, Li Bai and Du Fu, belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as Han Gan, Zhang Xuan, and Zhou Fang. Scholars of this period compiled a rich variety of historical literature, as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. The adoption of the title Tängri Qaghan by the Tang Emperor Taizong in addition to his title as emperor was eastern Asia's first \\"simultaneous kingship\\".Many notable innovations occurred under the Tang, including the development of woodblock printing. Buddhism became a major influence in Chinese culture, with native Chinese sects gaining prominence. However, in the 840s the Emperor Wuzong of Tang enacted policies to persecute Buddhism, which subsequently declined in influence. Although the dynasty and central government had gone into decline by the 9th century, art and culture continued to flourish. The weakened central government largely withdrew from managing the economy, but the country's mercantile affairs stayed intact and commercial trade continued to thrive regardless. However, agrarian rebellions in the latter half of the 9th century resulted in damaging atrocities such as the Guangzhou massacre of 878–879., can you guess it ?

Context: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. Question: What is authors role as an engineer?

Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. Just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business. At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to do it.

Article: Drew Gilpin Faust made history in 2007 when she became the first female president of Harvard University, Massachusetts, US. Faust is an excellent historian known especially for her work on the history of the American South. She was a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania for 25 years. In 2001, she became dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard. Born in 1947, Faust grew up in a traditional family. She has often spoken of her \\"continued confrontations \\" with her mother \\"about the requirements of what she usually called femininity \\". Her mother used to tell her, \\"It's a man's world, sweetie. And the sooner you learn that, the better off you'll be.\\" However, the daughter was a rebellious one. For example, Faust would fight with her mother over whether it was suitable for her to drive a car at night, even if one of her three brothers was a passenger. \\"She was raised to be a rich man's wife,\\" said a friend, Elizabeth Warren. \\"Instead she becomes the president of the most powerful university in the world.\\" As a girl, Faust rebelled against not only the strict rules of femininity, but also the racial injustice that existed in her native Virginia. At age 9, after a conversation with her family's black handyman and driver, she sent a letter to President Dwight D. Eisenhower decrying racial injustice. When studying in Bryn Mawr, a women's college in Pennsylvania, she was a student activist who would go on to march in the civil rights protests in the 1960s. What would her mother, who never went to college and died in 1966, have to say about her appointment? \\"I've often thought about that,\\" she said. \\"I've had dialogues with my dead mother over the 40 years since she died.\\" Question: Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: David \\"Davy\\" Crockett (August 17, 1786 - March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American folk hero, frontiersman, soldier, and politician. He is commonly referred to in popular culture by the epithet \\"King of the Wild Frontier\\". He represented Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives and served in the Texas Revolution. Crockett grew up in East Tennessee, where he gained a reputation for hunting and storytelling. On October 25, 1824, Crockett notified his constituents of his intention to run in the 1825 election for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lost that election to incumbent Adam Rankin Alexander. A chance meeting in 1826 gained him the encouragement of Memphis mayor Marcus Brutus Winchester to try again to win a seat in Congress. The Jackson Gazette published a letter from Crockett on September 15, 1826 announcing his intention of again challenging Rankin, and stating his opposition to the policies of President John Quincy Adams and Secretary of State Henry Clay and to Rankin's position on the cotton tariff. Militia veteran William Arnold also entered the race, and Crockett easily defeated both political opponents for the 1827-29 term. He arrived in Washington D.C. and took up residence at Mrs. Ball's Boarding House, where a number of other legislators lived when Congress was in session. Jackson was elected as President in 1828. Crockett continued his legislative focus on settlers getting a fair deal for land titles, offering H.R. 27 amendment to a bill sponsored by James K. Polk. Crockett was re-elected for the 1829-31 session, once again defeating Adam Rankin Alexander. He introduced H.R. 185 amendment to the land bill on January 29, 1830, but it was defeated on May 3. On February 25, 1830, he introduced a resolution to abolish the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York because he felt that it was public money going to benefit the sons of wealthy men. He spoke out against Congress giving 100,000 to the widow of Stephen Decatur, citing that Congress was not empowered to do that. He opposed Jackson's 1830 Indian Removal Act and was the only member of the Tennessee delegation to vote against it. Cherokee chief John Ross sent him a letter on January 13, 1831 expressing his thanks for Crockett's vote. His vote was not popular with his own district, and he was defeated in the 1831 election by William Fitzgerald. Crockett ran against Fitzgerald again in the 1833 election and was returned to Congress, serving until 1835. On January 2, 1834, he introduced the land title resolution H.R. 126, but it never made it as far as being debated on the House floor. He was defeated for re-election in the August 1835 election by Adam Huntsman. During his last term in Congress, he collaborated with Kentucky Congressman Thomas Chilton to write his autobiography, which was published by E. L. Carey and A. Hart in 1834 as A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett, Written by Himself, and he went east to promote the book. In 1836, newspapers published the now-famous quotation attributed to Crockett upon his return to his home state: I told the people of my district that I would serve them as faithfully as I had done; but if not, they might go to hell, and I would go to Texas. Did he have any major accomplishments while in the house?","completion":"While serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, Davy Crockett's primary focus was on advocating for the rights of settlers to obtain fair land titles. Although he did not have any landmark accomplishments, he frequently introduced amendments and resolutions related to this subject. For example, during his term from 1827 to 1829, he offered H.R. 27 amendment to a bill sponsored by James K. Polk, aiming to ensure fair deals for land titles. In the 1829-31 session, he introduced the H.R. 185 amendment to the land bill on January 29, 1830, but it was ultimately defeated on May 3. Crockett also showed commitment to the responsible use of public funds, introducing a resolution on February 25, 1830, to abolish the United States Military Academy at West Point, believing it was public money serving the wealthy. He was vocal against granting financial support to individuals, such as the 100,000 offered to Stephen Decatur's widow, which he felt was outside Congress's authority to do. Crockett further showcased his principle-driven nature by opposing Jackson's 1830 Indian Removal Act, being the only member from the Tennessee delegation to vote against it. This stand earned him gratitude from Cherokee Chief John Ross but also became unpopular within his constituency, contributing to his 1831 electoral defeat. Upon his return to Congress in 1833, Crockett introduced the land title resolution H.R. 126 on January 2, 1834, but it never progressed to a debate on the House floor. He lost re-election in August 1835, but during his last term, Crockett co-wrote his autobiography with Kentucky Congressman Thomas Chilton, called \\"A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett, Written by Himself.\\" The famous quote attributed to him in 1836 further reflects his dedication to his constituents: \\"I told the people of my district that I would serve them as faithfully as I had done; but if not, they might go to hell, and I would go to Texas.\\" In summary, while Davy Crockett did not have any significant accomplishments during his time in the House of Representatives, his persistent efforts to secure fair land deals for settlers and consistent actions driven by his principles are worth noting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I love the holidays as much as the next guy (even if I often have a bad case of the holiday blues), but it seems it's just being a dumping ground for a bunch of Holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year, but that doesn't make them any less painful during the season. As if we already had enough SANTA CLAUSE movies (three and *gulp* still counting), who wants to see a movie about his brother? In a plot that would be at home with Disney's SANTA CLAUSE franchise (save the occasionally crude humor and Santa's \\"Little\\" Helper wearing a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is a one-joke premise that goes on for 116 minutes. Sure, Jolly Ol' Saint Nick has a brother, but where does it go from there? It's a shame really. FRED CLAUS is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable Christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow, but it would have been so much better than this. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we are led to believe he's really the long lost brother of the never-aging Santa (Paul Giamatti), who invites his good ol' brother to visit. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and worse, an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) has come to keep a watchful eye on Father Christmas, and his THIS close to being shut down. Hah! And guess who plays Santa's mother! Kathy Bates of course. Elizabeth Banks is Santa's Helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves, and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend! SI don't know if I'd praise the casting or to bash it. Here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they're given way too little to work with. As for humor, the best that FRED CLAUS could possibly come up with is Santa's brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a DJ elf. I have to admit I had a few giggles involving Fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers (where he is joined by Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but the giggles begin and end there. Worse still, the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that's supposed to make us \\"feel good\\" and teach us a lesson about \\"what Christmas really means\\". Apparently, what Christmas means to Hollywood is getting as much of our leftover Christmas shopping money as they can. Rating: ** out of 5. Would you say this review is positive or negative? Available options: A. negative. B. positive.","completion":"This review can be considered as A. negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the film, FRED CLAUS, stating that it has a tired formula and fails to offer enough humor. The cast, though talented, is said to have little material to work with, resulting in a disappointing holiday comedy. The sentimentality in the movie is also criticized and viewed as an attempt to teach a cliched lesson about the true meaning of Christmas. Overall, the reviewer doesn't seem to find much to appreciate in the film and gives it a rating of 2 out of 5 stars."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An enduring legacy of this move is that nearby inland provinces, such as Shaanxi, Gansu, and Guizhou, which previously never had modern Western-style universities, began to be developed in this regard. The difficulty of accessing the region overland from the eastern part of China and the foggy climate hindering the accuracy of Japanese bombing of the Sichuan Basin, made the region the stronghold of Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang government during 1938-45, and led to the Bombing of Chongqing.

Two of Earth's oceans provide vast quantities of fish for human consumption. The Indian ocean hosts a large concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer. The Pacific ocean has less phytoplankton and nutrients for marine life. Hint: Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer, due to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.Endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales.An Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles). Riding the southern Indian Ocean Gyre, this vortex of plastic garbage constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the Mozambique Channel, and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.The garbage patch in the Indian Ocean will, according to a 2012 study, decrease in size after several decades to vanish completely over centuries. Over several millennia, however, the global system of garbage patches will accumulate in the North Pacific.In 2016 six new animal...

He appreciated the advantages of democracy: \\"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\\" Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy. Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle. Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Calvin and his followers viewed politics as a combination of aristocracy and democracy, valuing the freedom to elect authorities and resist political absolutism.

Сомалийский национальный альянс Translate this to English?","completion":"The phrase \\"Сомалийский национальный альянс\\" translates to English as \\"Somali National Alliance\\". The Somali National Alliance (SNA) was a political organization in Somalia, which was formed in the late 20th century during the Somali civil war. The alliance was composed of several warlords and their respective clans, who sought collectively for dominance and stability in the war-torn nation. The SNA played a significant role in the ongoing feud for control over the capital city, Mogadishu, through the 1980s and 90s. One of the prominent leaders of the SNA was General Mohamed Farrah Aidid, a influential figure during the civil war period. He, along with other warlords, sought to remove the reigning UNOSOM II, which was the second United Nations humanitarian and peacekeeping mission in Somalia. Despite its influential status during its existence, the SNA was marked by internal conflicts and power struggles, largely due to the complex clan dynamics that define Somali politics. This ultimately led to the dissolution of the organization by the late 1990s as alliances shifted, clans defected, and new organizations emerged. The legacy of the Somali National Alliance is a significant chapter in Somali history, serving as a representation of the political and social turmoil that characterized the civil war era. Its story contributes to understanding the complex clan alliances and disputes that continue to influence Somali politics and society to this day.

Scientists are observing two of the same gases at different temperatures. They are observing the speed of the particles in the gases to see how fast they are moving. Gas A has particles moving very quickly, but Gas B has particles that are hardly moving at all. Which gas is at a lower temperature? Hint: We discussed earlier some basic principles about the behavior of gases called the kinetic-molecular theory. Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature – the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed.","completion":"Based on the kinetic-molecular theory you mentioned, the gas with particles that are hardly moving at all would be Gas B.

Input: Question: Who was the founder of the party that Ohlendorf joined in 1925? Passage 1:Born in Hoheneggelsen (today part of Söhlde; then in the Kingdom of Prussia), Otto Ohlendorf came into the world as part of \\"a farming family\\". He joined the Nazi Party in 1925 (member 6631) and the SS (member #880) in 1926. Ohlendorf studied economics and law at the University of Leipzig and the University of Göttingen, and by 1930 was already giving lectures at several economic institutions. He studied at the University of Pavia, where he gained his doctor's degree in jurisprudence; and by 1933 he obtained the position of a research directorship in the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Ohlendorf was active in the National Socialist Students' League in both Kiel and Göttingen and taught at the Nazi Party's school in Berlin. He participated in major debates between the SS, the German Labour Front, and the Quadrenniel Organization on economic policy. By 1938 he was also manager in the Trade section of the Reich Business Board (). Historian quips that for Ohlendorf, Nazism was a \\"quest for race\\" in the historical continuum, and even though he never stated it that way, his faith in Germandom was akin to that of his fellow SS intellectuals. Passage 2:In 1946, Anna Mae Hutchison posted a 26-14 record with 102 strikeouts in 51 games, setting an all-time, single-season record for games pitched, and also hurled the first nine-inning no-hitter in Belles history, a 1–0 victory over the Kenosha Comets. Winter finished with a 33-9 record, including 17 shutouts and 183 strikeouts in 46 pitching appearances. The Belles claimed first place with a league-best 74-38 record, and won the semifinal round of playoffs by defeating the South Bend Blue Sox in four games. In Game 1, English drove in the winning run by hitting a double in the bottom half of the 14th inning. Then, in decisive Game 5 she knocked the winning run with a single in the bottom half of the 17th inning. In this first round series she went 11-for-31 for a .353 average, including her two game-winning RBI. After that, the Belles beat the 1945 champions, the Rockford Peaches, four games to two in the final best-of-seven series to clinch the Championship Title. Throughout the playoffs, Kurys led all players in average, stolen bases and runs. On the other hand, Winter collected four wins in the playoffs, including a 14-inning, 1–0 shutout victory over the Peaches in decisive Game Six. The winning run was scored by Kurys on an RBI-single by Betty Trezza, while Danhauser handled 22 chances flawlessly. During the regular season, the Belles again showed a great defense, notably by infielders Danhauser (1B), Kurys (2B) and English (3B), while Perlick (LF), Schillace (CF) and Dapkus (RF) patrolled the outfield. And moreover, fielding ability and speed on the bases were immensely more crucial and challenging in a dominant pitching league. Passage 3:CCGS Labrador was a icebreaker. First commissioned on 8 July 1954 as Her Majesty's Canadian Ship (HMCS) Labrador (pennant number AW 50) in the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), Captain O.C.S. \\"Long Robbie\\" Robertson, GM, RCN, in command. She was transferred to the Department of Transport (DOT) on 22 November 1957, and re-designated Canadian Government Ship (CGS) Labrador. She was among the DOT fleet assigned to the nascent Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) when that organization was formed in 1962, and further re-designated Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS) Labrador. Her career marked the beginning of the CCG's icebreaker operations which continue to this day. She extensively charted and documented the then-poorly-known Canadian Arctic, and as HMCS Labrador was the first ship to circumnavigate North America in a single voyage. The ship was taken out of service in 1987 and broken up for scrap in 1989.

Plot: Captain John Harris leads a group of ragtag soldiers who have been assigned a critical mission: they must travel deep into Confederate territory to forage for food or risk the slow death of their comrades from starvation. As the story unfolds, we meet a diverse group of men with unique backgrounds and skills. Among them are a skilled tracker, a master negotiator, and a Confederate defector who knows the terrain all too well. Together, they face numerous obstacles while traversing through enemy soil, including hostile locals, bounty hunters, and ambushes from Confederate soldiers. With each passing day, their solidarity grows stronger, and they fight not only to complete their mission but to stay alive as well. During one fateful encounter with a Southern farmer, the team discovers secrets about food distribution and supply chains in the Confederacy that could change the course of the war. Desperate Harvest takes on a more profound meaning when it's revealed that a handful of corrupt Confederate officers have been hoarding food supplies, starving their own people for profit. While the mission remains their priority, Captain Harris must decide whether to take the risk of unearthing this scandal or focus solely on completing the task at hand. As the climax approaches, the Union soldiers face a major obstacle when they are ambushed by Confederate forces. With their food supplies captured, they are surrounded and left with no obvious means of escape. Unwilling to let their people starve, Harris and his team devise a daring plan to free themselves from the enemy's grasp. They covertly dismantle the hoarded food supplies and redistribute them to not only their own battalion but also to the starving Southern population, with the hope that they will join the Union and rebel against their commanders. The movie ends dramatically with Harris and his men fleeing through the night, as now, both Confederate and bounty hunters are on their tails. As morning dawns, we see the communities they've helped and the food they have shared, creating a groundswell of support for the Union cause, showing the price of true heroism in desperate times. \\"The Desperate Harvest\\" is a gripping, heart-wrenching tale of survival, loyalty, and the human spirit that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats until the very end. With deep insights into the struggles faced on both sides of the conflict, the movie will leave viewers pondering the true cost of war and the hope that comes from an act of selfless sacrifices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: To attach pages of a book together, you can Pick from: - Use a glue stick applied to each exposed area; - Use cooking oil applied to each exposed area; Answer:","completion":"Using a glue stick applied to each exposed area is the best way to attach pages of a book together. Here's a detailed explanation of why using a glue stick is a better option than using cooking oil: 1. Adhesion: A glue stick contains adhesives that are specifically designed to hold paper together. It sticks well to surfaces once applied and provides strong bonding. On the other hand, cooking oil doesn't have adhesive properties and, therefore, won't be effective in holding the pages together. The pages may separate easily, leading to the book falling apart. 2. Drying Time: A glue stick generally dries faster than cooking oil on paper. This allows you to work quickly and efficiently while attaching pages together. Using cooking oil would likely result in a longer drying time, leading to delays in the binding process, especially if you are attempting to work with multiple pages or books. 3. Long-term preservation: Using a glue stick on paper won't have any adverse effects on the integrity of the pages over time, as its formula is designed to be used on paper products. On the other hand, cooking oil could compromise the pages' quality as it can seep into the paper fibers, weaken them, and eventually cause the pages to break or become discolored due to oxidation. 4. No staining: Glue sticks are generally transparent or slightly opaque once dried, so they don't leave visible stains on the paper. Conversely, using cooking oil may leave oil stains on the pages, causing them to look messy and unattractive. 5. Ease of use: A glue stick is easy to apply and control during the binding process. It allows for precise application of adhesive without creating a mess. In contrast, applying cooking oil to paper can be tricky and messy, leading to a difficult, time-consuming, and potentially frustrating process. 6. Readily available and affordable: Glue sticks are widely available in different sizes and brands, and are relatively inexpensive. Additionally, they are specifically designed for binding paper together, making them the perfect choice for attaching pages of a book. On the other hand, cooking oil may be easily accessible in a kitchen, but it is not the ideal material for this purpose. Its cost may also vary depending on the type of oil and region, but investing in a glue stick meant for this task is a better overall choice. In summary, using a glue stick to attach pages of a book together is a superior option because it is specifically designed for paper adhesion, dries quickly, preserves the integrity of the pages, leaves no visible stains, is easy to use, and is an affordable and widely available choice. Using cooking oil is not ideal due to its lack of adhesive properties, the potential for staining and weakening the paper, and the challenges of applying it in a controlled manner."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the following context: As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him bewailing their loss. answer the following question: What are the names of the three people who are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich?

His goal of a uniformed chief of staff as general manager and a European-type general staff for planning was stymied by General Nelson A. Miles but did succeed in enlarging West Point and establishing the U.S. Army War College as well as the General Staff. Root changed the procedures for promotions and organized schools for the special branches of the service. He also devised the principle of rotating officers from staff to line. Root was concerned about the Army's role in governing the new territories acquired in 1898 and worked out the procedures for turning Cuba over to the Cubans, and wrote the charter of government for the Philippines.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 'Kill Jews' Town Finally Changes Name A Spanish village with a name that translates to “Camp Kill Jews” has finally officially changed its name to Castrillo Mota de Judios, or “Jews’ Hill Camp.” Residents of Castrillo Matajudios first voted to change the name last year, with 29 of the village’s 57 inhabitants voting in favor of the change. The name change has now been approved by the regional government of Castilla y Leon, the Associated Press reports. The town’s former name, which dates back to 1627, was especially puzzling due to the fact that the town was founded by Jews fleeing from pogroms in 1035. Today, the town has no Jewish residents, despite its official shield containing the Star of David. Spain has a checkered history of treatment towards Jewish residents, including a 1492 edict that ordered Jews to convert to Catholicism or leave the country. In early June, Spain’s lower house of parliament approved a law paving a pathway to citizenship for descendants of Jews who were forced to leave the country during the inquisition. According to the AP, researchers believe the village actually got its name from Jewish residents who wanted to bolster the believability of their conversion.

However, if the firearm is displayed in a manner \`\`calculated to cause alarm,'' then it is \`\`disorderly conduct''.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Moss was born in London, son of Alfred Moss, a dentist of Bray, Berkshire, and Aileen (nee Craufurd). He was brought up at Long White Cloud house on the right bank of the River Thames. His father was an amateur racing driver who had placed 16th at the 1924 Indianapolis 500. Stirling was a gifted horse rider as was his younger sister, Pat Moss, who became a successful rally driver and married Erik Carlsson. During his driving career, Moss was one of the most recognised celebrities in Britain, leading to many media appearances. In March 1958, Moss was a guest challenger on the TV panel show What's My Line? (episode with Anita Ekberg). In 1959 he was the subject of the TV programme This Is Your Life. On June 12 the following year he was interviewed by John Freeman on Face to Face; Freeman later said that he had thought before the interview that Moss was a playboy, but in their meeting he showed \\"cold, precise, clinical judgement... a man who could live so close to the edge of death and danger, and trust entirely to his own judgement. This appealed to me\\". Moss also appeared as himself in the 1964 film The Beauty Jungle, and was one of several celebrities with cameo appearances in the 1967 version of the James Bond film Casino Royale. He played Evelyn Tremble's (Peter Sellers) driver. For many years during and after his career, the rhetorical phrase \\"Who do you think you are, Stirling Moss?\\" was supposedly the standard question all British policemen asked speeding motorists. Moss relates he himself was once stopped for speeding and asked just that; he reports the traffic officer had some difficulty believing him. As related in the book The Life and Times of Private Eye, Moss was the subject of a less than respectful cartoon biography in the magazine Private Eye. The cartoon, drawn by Willie Rushton, showed him continually crashing, having his driving licence revoked and finally \\"hosting television programmes on subjects he knows nothing about\\". It also made reference to the amnesia Moss suffered from as a result of head injuries sustained in the crash at Goodwood in 1962. According to the book, Moss responded by offering to buy the original of the cartoon, an outcome the book describes as \\"depressingly common\\" for its satirical cartoons about famous people. Moss is the narrator of the popular children's series Roary the Racing Car which stars Peter Kay, a role he took on, having been approached by both David Jenkins, who had the original idea, and Keith Chapman, the latter the creator of Bob the Builder, as he saw the TV show as a way of introducing motorsport to the next generation. He is one of the few drivers of his era to create a brand from his name for licensing purposes, which was launched when his website was revamped in 2009 with improved content. Moss is also a supporter of the UK Independence Party. What did the public think of Stirling Moss?","completion":"In the article, it is mentioned that during his driving career, Moss was one of the most recognized celebrities in Britain.

Dennis loved to paint but William preferred crayons since they left no mess, so","completion":"the two brothers often debated their chosen mediums. Their small home, nestled in the quiet suburb of Stowford, almost seemed to vibrate with the amalgamation of colors seeping through its walls. One lazy summer afternoon, as the sun cast golden beams upon the dusty windowpane, the siblings decided to bring their friendly rivalry to life in a challenge that would change their artistic journey forever. Dennis and William would each illustrate a grand mural that represented their respective love for paint and crayons, and they agreed that the entire town would participate in voting for their favorite piece. Even Mrs. Taylor, the boys' elderly neighbor, who had always found their artistic bickering rather amusing, was delighted to learn about the challenge. In no time, word of the competition spread throughout Stowford. It seemed as if the whole town was buzzing with excitement, eagerly waiting for the final reveal. The challenge began, and as each brother prepared his materials, they delved deep into their creative minds to develop the concepts for their murals. Dennis envisioned a vibrant landscape of rolling hills, intricately woven with delicate flowers, where the sky melted into a brilliant orange and pink. This whimsical world would dance upon the canvas to celebrate the endless possibilities that lay within the bristles of his fine brushes and the magic of wet paint. William, on the other hand, sought something more abstract. A true celebration of the raw, visceral nature of crayons, his mural would consist of an intricate and vivid tapestry with geometric patterns connecting one patch of color to another. He would use an ever-changing quilt of shapes and shades to showcase the timeless simplicity of crayons. He wanted to prove how crayons could create a visual masterpiece without the mess and fuss of paint. Days turned into weeks as Dennis and William toiled away. Their home was transformed into two distinct realms: the fragrant aroma of oil paint hung heavy in the air of Dennis' corner, while the scratchy sound of crayons on paper accompanied William in his creative space. Soon, the much-anticipated day arrived when the brothers pulled the drapes from their finished masterpieces. The inhabitants of Stowford had gathered in the brothers' backyard, their eager eyes surveying each piece of art intently. Dennis' landscape was an undeniable explosion of color and vibrancy. The flowers seemed to sway in the breeze as the sun dipped below the horizon, its golden rays reflecting brilliantly against the paint as if time itself was captured through each vivid stroke. The crowd gasped in awe as they took in the sheer depth and detail interwoven throughout Dennis' masterpiece. William's creation was vastly different yet no less entrancing. The geometric patterns of his crayon mosaic drew the eye and mind into a labyrinth of color and shapes that seemed to defy reality. Each crayon stroke, individually unremarkable, harmoniously formed an intricate mural that mesmerized the viewers. The simple, clean lines were accentuated by the bold hues chosen, showcasing the power of crayons despite their often juvenile association. The townspeople murmured appreciatively, impressed by the seamless imaging laid before them. The once-friendly competition was now fraught with tension. Stowford had never experienced such an event, and to be tasked with choosing the finest art piece was difficult, to say the least. Hushed conversations filled the room as neighbors debated the merits of paint vs. crayons, and the palpable suspense seemed to hang in the air. As the votes were tallied, Mrs. Taylor stood to announce the winner – her frail voice projecting a surprising strength. To the town's delight, the results were clear: the competition had ended in a tie. The crowd erupted in applause, with many relieved that they didn't have to choose between the brothers' fantastic creations. In that moment, Dennis and William realized that, despite their differing preferences, each medium had its own irrefutable value. The true magic lies not in paint or crayons, but in the artist's ability to channel their passion and bring their vision to life. From that day on, Dennis and William continued their artistic journeys hand in hand, embracing each other's favored medium.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Select from: (1). yes (2). it is not possible to tell (3). no","completion":"(2). it is not possible to tell To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's closely analyze both the premise and the hypothesis. The Premise: Guadeloupe's Shopping Scene The premise focuses on the shopping scene in Guadeloupe, which is a French overseas region located in the Caribbean. The shopping scene here could encompass everything from local markets and boutiques to malls and large-scale shopping centers. It could also include the variety of items available for purchase, such as clothing, jewelry, electronics, souvenirs, and local products. However, the premise does not explicitly state any specific aspect of the shopping scene, such as its size, popularity, or level of activity. The Hypothesis: Guadeloupe has one of the busiest shopping scenes. The hypothesis makes a distinct claim: it states that the shopping scene in Guadeloupe is one of the busiest. This implies that there is a considerable amount of activity involving consumers, merchants, and products. A bustling shopping scene might involve many transactions, high foot traffic in shopping areas, and a diverse array of products and shops available. When comparing the premise with the hypothesis, we can see that they both address the shopping scene in Guadeloupe. However, the premise does not provide any explicit information regarding the level of activity, popularity, or size of the shopping scene. In contrast, the hypothesis specifically claims that the shopping scene is one of the busiest, which is not supported by the information given in the premise. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and it is not possible to tell if Guadeloupe has one of the busiest shopping scenes based on the information provided in the premise alone. To determine whether the hypothesis is accurate, further research and evidence would be needed that directly addresses the level of activity and popularity of Guadeloupe's shopping scene."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Several years earlier, Tom fell more than 100 feet during a climb and because her parents Tom and Molly (Jennifer Beals) are afraid she might hurt herself, they have ordered Maddy not to climb. Tom had some internal injuries from that earlier fall which he did not know about and now the injury has paralyzed him from the neck down. There is an experimental operation costing 250,000 which can save him, but insurance will not pay for the operation and the family does not have the money. Harderbach Financial's president Brisbane (Michael Des Barres) refuses to loan the amount and does so by putting loopholes in a contract Molly signed (he is really trying to avoid loaning any money at all). When asked if he has a heart, Brisbane coldly responds \\"This is not an emotional issue, Mrs. Phillips. A bank has no heart. Only paper in a vault\\". That is when Maddy first gets the idea to rob the bank. Maddy steals three go-carts from her father's race course (Tom has a race track where people race in go-carts) and convinces her two friends Gus (Max Thieriot) and Austin (Corbin Bleu) to help her. They remain hesitant, so she tells both of them that she loves him and does not care for the other and gives half of her friendship necklace to each of them, claiming she has the other half.

Remy changed their phone number to avoid getting calls from their ex. Given the context: What will Remy want to do next? Possible answers: change their name, be left alone, avoid the ex Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it appears that Remy's primary goal is to distance themselves from their ex-partner due to unwanted communication. Changing their phone number is a clear step in achieving this goal, as it restricts the ex-partner's ability to directly contact Remy through phone calls or messages. Moving forward, there are various potential actions that Remy may consider to further ensure their privacy and peace of mind. While changing their name is an option, it is quite an extreme measure that is unlikely to be Remy's immediate next step. Legally changing one's name involves a detailed and often time-consuming process, with the additional burden of updating all personal records, documents, and informing relevant authorities. Instead, Remy may consider less drastic options to create distance from their ex without resorting to such a significant life change. One of Remy's potential next steps could be to simply focus on their own well-being and enjoy their newfound privacy. Remy might want to be left alone to recuperate from the stress of their previous relationship and the badgering they experienced in the process. They could engage in self-care activities, seek support from friends and family, and take time to rediscover their personal interests away from the influence of their ex. In addition to focusing on their well-being, Remy may want to take measures to ensure they can avoid encounters with their ex-partner. This could be accomplished by carefully evaluating their preferred locations for social or recreational activities, and possibly choosing alternative venues that decrease the likelihood of bumping into their ex. Furthermore, Remy might consider having conversations with mutual friends to explain the situation and seek their understanding for not attending events where the ex-partner may be present. In the digital age, Remy may also want to evaluate their social media presence to ensure that their ex-partner cannot access any personal information or updates. They could adjust privacy settings on their social media accounts, block or unfriend their ex, and be cautious about what they share online. Remy may choose to create new accounts or, for a temporary period, deactivate existing ones to increase their level of privacy. Additionally, Remy could explore various ways to further protect their personal information, such as registering for a Google Voice number which forwards calls to their new number without revealing it, or utilizing call-blocking apps to prevent any unwanted calls. This added layer of protection can provide Remy with a sense of security and peace of mind. In conclusion, while Remy has already taken a step towards distancing themselves from their ex by changing their phone number, there are numerous other actions they may consider to maintain their privacy, avoid unwanted interactions with their ex, and focus on their overall well-being. These options typically involve a combination of personal reflection, communication adjustments, location choices, and digital security measures. Ultimately, Remy's primary aim is to regain control of their life and find a sense of peace that allows them to move forward and heal from their past relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Baker’s political consultant wields influence on commuter rail, charter schools\\" Article:","completion":"Title: E-mails show Gov. Baker’s political consultant wields influence on commuter rail, charter schools Introduction A recent investigation has uncovered a series of e-mails that reveal a close relationship between Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker's political consultant, John Doe, and decision making in key areas such as commuter rail and charter schools. This article delves into the findings, examining the growing influence of political consultants on policy-making in the state and raises concerns about transparency and conflicts of interest in the administration. E-mail exchanges expose John Doe's involvement in commuter rail contracts Documents obtained through public records request unearthed numerous e-mails between John Doe and officials from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). The correspondence suggests that Doe played a significant role in shaping discussions on the awarding of contracts and operations for the state's commuter rail, an area where his clients had business interests. In these e-mails, Doe is seen making recommendations and suggesting strategies for officials to pursue. One example includes his proposal to prioritize a particular company to carry out repair works on rail tracks. This company, it later emerged, was a close associate of Doe's consultancy firm. Critics argue that this relationship raises ethical questions about the influence of private interests on public decision-making. Governor Baker's administration has been quick to defend the nature of the relationship, insisting that John Doe was merely providing valuable input and had no financial stake in the outcome. However, this defense has done little to mitigate concerns about conflicts of interest and the growing influence of political consultants on policy decisions. Influence on charter schools policy The investigation has further revealed that John Doe has been closely involved in the formulation of policy related to charter schools in the state. For years, Governor Baker has been a strong supporter of expanding charter schools, rallying the private sector and other like-minded politicians. As such, John Doe's close association with this policy area also raises questions about conflicts of interest. E-mails between Doe and officials from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) show a high level of involvement in shaping the public narrative around charter schools. In some instances, Doe has provided feedback on how to frame messages around new policy announcements to maximize public support. Moreover, the e-mails also suggest that Doe may have played a role in influencing the criteria for evaluating charter school proposals, in an attempt to give his private clients an advantageous position. These findings, coupled with his apparent influence on commuter rail contracts, shed light on the extent to which political consultants can impact policy across various sectors. Transparency and ethics concerns The emergence of these e-mails has raised concerns about transparency and the role of private interests in public policy making. The lack of disclosure around the nature of John Doe's relationships with both the state government and private clients creates a conflict of interest that poses risks to the integrity and fairness of policy decisions. Some critics have called for more stringent regulations that would require greater transparency around the relationships between political consultants, politicians, and private entities. They argue that clearer rules could help mitigate conflicts of interest and protect the public interest in decision-making processes. Conclusion The recent findings regarding Governor Charlie Baker's political consultant, John Doe, highlight the growing influence of political consultants on policy-making in Massachusetts. The delicate balance between private interests and public policy raises questions over transparency and possible conflicts of interest. It is paramount that stringent regulations and greater transparency are enforced to ensure that political consultants' involvement in decision-making adheres to ethical standards and protects the public interest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Darren Wilson's version of what happened when he confronted Michael Brown has expanded since he gave his first recorded interview to detectives, but the key parts have stayed largely the same. Witnesses corroborated and disputed what Wilson said about events leading up to the police officer's fatal shooting of the unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9. Much of the crime scene evidence supports Wilson's story, but there are also some key differences, according to an analysis of available material. Wilson spent 31 minutes being interviewed by police the day after the shooting, about four hours in front of the grand jury, and another 45 minutes talking to George Stephanopoulos of ABC. To both detectives and grand jurors, Wilson said that as","completion":"he approached Brown and his friend, he asked them to walk on the sidewalk instead of the street. According to Wilson, Brown reacted aggressively and a struggled ensued. Brown allegedly attempted to take Wilson's gun, leading the officer to fear for his life. Wilson fired his weapon in self-defense, first inside the police car and then outside, as Brown continued to charge towards him. Witnesses presented varying accounts of the incident, with some supporting Wilson's claim of self-defense, while others insisted that Brown posed no immediate threat and had his hands up in a surrender gesture. The inconsistencies in eyewitness testimonies created further confusion and controversy surrounding the case. The crime scene evidence, including the positioning of shell casings and bloodstains, largely supported Wilson's version of events. However, critics argue that the evidence does not conclusively prove that Brown posed a threat or that the officer's use of lethal force was justified. Ultimately, the grand jury decided not to indict Wilson, sparking outrage and reigniting debates about racial bias in the criminal justice system, the use of excessive force by police, and the need for nationwide policing reforms. Despite the lack of formal charges, the Ferguson case remains a focal point in conversations surrounding police accountability and the ongoing pursuit of social justice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hip hop artist Mos Def included the beginning verse of \\"Under the Bridge\\" in the song \\"Brooklyn,\\" from his 1999 record Black on Both Sides. He, however, changed the line \\"the city I live in, the City of Angels\\", which refers to Los Angeles, to \\"the city I live in is beautiful Brooklyn,\\" to match his song's premise.

Hypothesis: A girl is eating at a fancy dinner. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"We cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true because the information given in the premise does not directly support the hypothesis. Let's break down the premise and the hypothesis to understand why this conclusion cannot be drawn. Premise: The girl in a blue dress is eating some blue cotton candy with one shoe off and one shoe on. In the premise, we are provided with the following pieces of information: 1. The girl is wearing a blue dress. 2. She is eating blue cotton candy. 3. She has one shoe off and one shoe on. Hypothesis: A girl is eating at a fancy dinner. The hypothesis suggests that the girl is attending and eating at a fancy dinner. However, based on the information provided in the premise, we cannot conclusively determine whether this hypothesis is true. 1. While the girl is wearing a blue dress, which might be considered appropriate attire for a fancy dinner, the color or type of dress alone does not guarantee that the event she is attending is a fancy dinner. 2. The girl is eating blue cotton candy, which is an informal, carnival-style snack rather than a typical food item found at a fancy dinner. The presence of cotton candy suggests a more casual event or setting rather than a formal dinner. 3. The fact that the girl has one shoe off and one shoe on also does not support the hypothesis of her attending a fancy dinner. This detail indicates an informal and potentially playful or relaxed situation, whereas people at a fancy dinner would typically be expected to have both shoes on and maintain a more formal appearance. In conclusion, the information provided in the premise does not sufficiently support or prove the hypothesis. While some elements, such as the girl wearing a blue dress, might be consistent with a fancy dinner scenario, the presence of blue cotton candy and the girl's informal footwear situation do not align with our expectations of a formal dinner setting.

Casually propped against a wall, the two rocket launchers and hunting rifle below are just some of a cache of guns inside the home of 'weapons mad' Belgian killer Nordine Amrani. The arsenal was uncovered by police during a raid of the gunman's home during October 2007 and also includes several other powerful rifles, ammunition, and what appears to be a flak jacket. Amrani, who on Tuesday murdered four people and wounded 125 others, also used his home in the city of Liege as a cannabis factory, with police finding more than 2,800 plants during the raid. Scroll down for video... Pictured is a room in Amrani's flat raided by police in October 2007 showing various weapons and military style clothing. Firearms: Pictured are just part of the weapons cache police found at Amrani's flat in October 2007. Plantation: Police found a cannabis den containing 2,800 plants in a shed owned by Amrani in 2007. Amrani had rigged up special lighting and was growing more than 2,000 plants in a shed discovered by police. Yesterday, Amrani's lawyer said he carried out the attack because he feared being sent to back to prison for a sex crime. Killer: Nordine Amrani murdered a cleaning lady in his rented flat before heading off on a bloodthirsty rampage in the centre of the Belgian city. The. 32-year-old convicted criminal, who was due to marry his long-term. girlfriend, used grenades and a semi-automatic rifle to cause carnage in. the Belgian city before turning a revolver on himself. Among. his victims was a 45-year-old cleaning lady whom he shot dead near his. home on Tuesday morning, as well as a 17-month old baby boy. Defence. lawyer Jean-Francois Dister said Amrani, a Belgian from a Moroccan. background, was on parole and was due to answer a summons about. allegedly ‘sexually molesting’ a young woman. He is thought to have attacked the unnamed victim after driving alongside her in his van. Its number plate was captured by CCTV. One of Amrani’s numerous previous convictions was for rape, for which he had been given a two-year suspended sentence in 2003. If convicted again for a sex crime, he would have had to serve it. This would have also meant his girlfriend, a nurse called Perrin Balon, finding out about the sex allegations against him. ‘He feared being returned to prison,’said Mr Dister. ‘He called me twice on Monday afternoon and on Tuesday morning about it. ‘What worried him most was to be jailed again. According to my client it was a set-up by people who wanted to harm him. Mr Amrani had a grudge against the law. 'He thought he had been wrongfully convicted.’ After. Tuesday’s attack, the bag Amrani used to carry his haul of weapons was. found to still contain several loaded magazines, as well as a number of. live grenades. An enquiry has been launched into why he had not been under closer. supervision while on bail after early release from a sentence of nearly. five years. His weapons were confiscated because of his other criminal offences, yet. he managed to obtain a FAL Belgian assault rifle, grenades and other. weapons soon after his release in October 2010. Belgian’s. notoriously liberal criminal justice system is already facing questions. as to why, in October 2010, the killer had been released from prison. three years early after being convicted of firearms and drug offences. Destroyed: Bomb disposal experts created a controlled explosion on the killer's car after finding it parked up in Liege. Police last night conducted thorough searches of a building owned by Nordine Amrani (left) and his flat (right) Looking: Police pictured searching through Nordine Amrani's apartment last night. In. 2008 he had been found guilty of keeping 10 complete firearms, and an. astonishing 9,500 gun parts in his flat, along with 2,800 cannabis. plants nearby. On Tuesday morning, Amrani is thought. to have tried to rape the woman cleaner in his flat, where police had. found an arsenal of weapons including a rocket launcher, AK47 and. Kalashnikov. Police said he. killed her 'with a bullet to her head' and then dumped her body in a. lock-up shed where he was growing cannabis plants. He then left money for Ms Balon, with a note that said: 'Good luck! I love you.' A police source said: 'The cleaner had been working in a neighbour's home. It appears that Amrani had invited her into his own flat to discuss the possibility of cleaning his flat. 'There were signs of a struggle, and it may be that Amrani had tried to rape her. 'Whatever happened, she was undoubtedly his first murder victim on Tuesday morning.' Cedric Visart Bocarme, the Belgian. Attorney General, confirmed that the woman 'would have been murdered by. the killer just before he went to Place Saint-Lambert'. The. attack brought horror to Belgium's fifth largest city, with crowds of. shoppers, many of them children, screaming and running in panic as. grenades exploded and shots rang out. Mourning: A woman places a cuddly toy in a broken bus shelter in the Place Saint-Lambert in Liege. Grief: Five people, including the gunman himself, died in the incident which is being mourned by Belgians. Tributes: People were yesterday morning seen leaving flowers at the scene of the deadly grenade attack in Liege. Clean up: Workers yesterday started to clean up the debris from the rampage. Injured: Cynthia Cannella was wounded in the attack. Today, a small crowd gathered at the Place Saint-Lambert for a minute's silence at 12noon, 24 hours after the shooting. Students at the Saint Barthelemy High School - attended by two of the victims - also joined hands and observed the silence. Abdelhadi Amrani, another lawyer who worked for the killer but is not related, said he had grown up in foster homes after being orphaned as a child. ‘I remember a man deeply marked by the loss of his parents,’ said Ms Amrani. ‘He lost his father and mother very early. He was marked by fate. ‘I would add he was a very smart boy, gifted. 'Nordine often spoke of his desire to start a family. He was to be married to a nurse in Liege.’ Commenting on Amrani’s background, Ms Amrani said: ‘He did not feel at all Moroccan. He did not speak a word of Arabic, and was not Muslim. What he said is that he felt like a Belgian. ‘He was crazy about weapons, but as a. collector. 'He felt he had not had much luck in life and felt unfairly. treated by the courts. 'This was the fed-up cry of a tormented soul – he was estranged from justice, and against society.’ A 17-month-old baby boy called Gabriel. became the fourth victim after dying in hospital late on Tuesday night. despite undergoing hours of emergency treatment. Gabriel was in the arms of his mother. when he was hit by a bullet in the back of the head. The child and his. parents were at the bus stop just below the walkway from where Amrani. opened fire.

Movie title: The 51st State Movie plot: Alternate poster and title for the film The Fifty First State In 1971, a policeman catches Elmo McElroy, a recent college graduate with a degree in pharmacology, smoking marijuana. Because of his arrest and conviction, he is unable to find work as a pharmacologist. In the present day, a drug lord called \\"the Lizard\\" calls a meeting of his organisation, hoping to sell a brand new substance invented by Elmo. The meeting goes badly when Elmo, in a bid to escape from the Lizard's control, blows up the building, killing everyone but the Lizard. Vengeful, the Lizard contacts Dakota, a contract killer, who previously killed the only witness in a case against the Lizard. Dakota initially refuses the hit, but accepts when the Lizard offers to clear her gambling debts and give her a 250,000 bonus. Elmo leaves for Liverpool, England, where he meets Felix DeSouza, a local \\"fixer\\" who has been sent by Leopold Durant, head of a local criminal organisation, in exchange for two football tickets to a sold-out game. At the meeting, Elmo pitches POS 51, a synthetic drug that can be produced with minimal facilities and is 51 times as potent as other drugs. A second opinion from Pudsey, Durant's chemist, confirms Elmo's claims, and Durant gives him over a million dollars in bonds. Since it is 18 million short of the agreed payment, Elmo threatens to leave. In a room across the street, Dakota is about to take a shot at Elmo's head when the Lizard calls cancelling the hit; not wanting to kill Elmo until he has the formula. Instead of killing Elmo, she is to kill anyone who meets with him. She switches rifles to an automatic weapon and kills everyone but Elmo and Felix, who is shot in the buttocks. As Elmo and Felix leave the hotel, a gang of skinheads who seek the drug attack them. Elmo protects them with a golf club. Detective Virgil Kane arrives on the scene and gives a chase.

We can do this by adding 162*v to both sides of the equation. Here are the steps to solve the equation: 1. Start with the equation: -159*v + 9 = -162*v 2. Add 162*v to both sides of the equation to collect all v terms on one side: -159*v + 162*v + 9 = -162*v + 162*v 3. Simplify both sides of the equation: 3*v + 9 = 0 4.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

He says Dominicans don’t like black people. That’s not true.” De Blasio hosted a press conference in June to condemn the looming deportations of thousands of people of Haitian descent from the Dominican Republic. “It is clearly an illegal act. It is an immoral act. It is a racist act by the Dominican government,” he said at the time. While he was backed by both Dominican and Haitian elected officials, he drew the ire of Dominican-Americans. Deyanira Martinez, 45, of Manhattan, called de Blasio a “traitor.” “We all voted for you!” she said. De Blasio wouldn’t answer questions Sunday, but last week he stood by his comments and said the international opposition to the Dominican government’s policies had a positive impact. “If that situation is improving in the Dominican Republic, it’s because there was a public outcry.

Answer:","completion":"Car exhaust fumes contain a variety of harmful gases and air pollutants, but the most commonly known poisonous gas found in them is carbon monoxide (CO). Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas, which makes it particularly dangerous for humans and animals, as it cannot be easily detected. When fuel is burned in an internal combustion engine, a chemical reaction occurs between the hydrocarbon-based fuel and the oxygen in the air. This produces various exhaust byproducts, with carbon monoxide being one of them. The combustion process is typically not perfect, leading to incomplete burning of fuel and the production of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is poisonous because it has the ability to tightly bind with the hemoglobin in red blood cells. Hemoglobin's primary function is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body's cells and tissues. However, when carbon monoxide is present, it interferes with this process due to its higher binding affinity to hemoglobin than oxygen. As a result, it displaces oxygen and forms carboxyhemoglobin, leading to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues throughout the body. Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide can cause symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion, and even unconsciousness. In severe cases or high concentrations, it can ultimately lead to death due to oxygen deprivation, or hypoxia. Aside from carbon monoxide, car exhaust fumes also contain other harmful components, including: 1. Nitrogen oxides (NOx): These compounds contribute to smog formation, respiratory problems, and the production of acid rain. Diesel engines, in particular, emit higher levels of nitrogen oxides. 2. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): These are various hydrocarbon-based compounds that can evaporate from fuel and other vehicle components. Many VOCs are hazardous to human health and contribute to the formation of smog. 3. Particulate matter (PM): This refers to the tiny particles, dust, and soot contained in exhaust emissions. These small particles can penetrate deep into the lungs, causing respiratory problems, heart disease, and even cancer. 4. Sulfur dioxide (SO2): This is primarily produced when burning fuels with high sulfur content, such as diesel. It contributes to the formation of acid rain and can cause respiratory issues. 5. Greenhouse gases: Burning fossil fuels in vehicles also produces greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which contribute significantly to climate change. Many countries and regions have implemented strict regulations to reduce the emission of these harmful pollutants, and vehicle manufacturers are turning to cleaner technologies, such as electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles, as well as improving traditional combustion engines to emit fewer pollutants. Also, catalytic converters installed in modern vehicles help convert some of these harmful gases, such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, into less harmful substances like carbon dioxide and water vapor. However, more effort is needed worldwide to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel-powered vehicles and further decrease the health risks and environmental damage caused by car exhaust fumes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She navigates through love, loss, and supernatural schemes, which lead her towards an uncertain destiny. Act 1: The Dark Encounter Mina, a brilliant university student pursuing studies in history and literature, is intrigued by the mysterious myths and legends surrounding her hometown, particularly those involving vampires. One night, while researching in the library's restricted section, she stumbles upon an ancient book that seemingly revolves around Dracula's origin and his eternal quest for love. Unbeknownst to Mina, she inadvertently summons Dracula through a ritual mentioned in the book. The first encounter between Mina and the vampire lord takes place when he saves her from a group of drunken men trying to harm her. Unaware of Dracula's true identity, Mina feels a strange connection with her enigmatic savior. Meanwhile, Dracula sees a striking resemblance between Mina and his long-lost love and becomes obsessed with her. Act 2: Whispers of the Night As Mina starts to experience a series of uncanny incidents after her meeting with Dracula, she crosses paths with Jonathan Harker, a charismatic, young researcher, who shares her passion for unearthing the truth behind local legends. The two eventually fall in love, but their happiness is short-lived, as Dracula's lurking presence starts to haunt Mina's life.

Jonathan, desperate to save her, seeks the help of Van Helsing, an enigmatic professor with knowledge of the dark arts. Together, they discover that Mina's transition into a vampire can be halted, but they must act soon. To accomplish this, they need to find and destroy the source of Dracula's powers – his ancient tomb, which also binds him to his eternal existence. As Mina and Jonathan, along with a hesitant Van Helsing, embark on their quest, Dracula's vampire minions give chase, resulting in a series of battles, betrayals, and shocking revelations. Through these trials, Mina grapples with her conflicting emotions for Dracula and her love for Jonathan, realizing that the vampire lord yearns only for the love he lost centuries ago, but is misguided in his method of pursuing it. Act 4: The Shadow's End In a climactic battle at Dracula's tomb, Mina's newfound powers give her the upper hand against the vampire minions. However, as she confronts Dracula himself, her feelings of sympathy for him make her hesitate. As the castle collapses around them, Mina is finally able to convince Dracula to make amends and end the cycle of suffering he has caused.

The campers brought the snacks to the road trip but forgot the supplies because the Options: a). snacks were hidden. b). supplies were hidden.","completion":"The campers, a group of seven men and women in their late twenties, had meticulously planned a road trip across the country for months. They had spent countless evenings, planning the journey, marking spots on the maps, and making a list of essentials they needed to carry. An assortment of delightful snacks came on top of that list. As the day of their journey dawned, they woke up excited and full of anticipation, their hearts ablaze with dreams of picturesque landscapes and the taste of adventure. They packed their snacks in the early hours of the morning. It was a varied collection of chips, granola bars, trail mix, chocolates, and little packets of local confectionery from their native town that they were keen on sharing with the new people they would meet on their journey. The snacks were thoughtfully and carefully dispersed though various bags and pockets, ensuring they were never too far from a quick bite. The idea was that no matter where they were or what they were doing in the trip, a little rummage through the nearest bag would always reward them with something to munch on. It was an innovative system that they were quite proud of. Admirable as such efficient snack storage was, it did lead to one significant oversight: leaving room for other supplies. Amidst the pre-departure buzz and the unprecedented excitement of hiding snacks in every nook and corner of the van, the campers completely forgot to bring the other essential supplies. It was several miles into the journey when they first realized their mistake. When they stopped for a picnic at a sun-drenched clearing in a forest, they began to unpack what they thought were their supplies - only to discover more and more snack stashes. A quick search of the entire van confirmed it. They had forgotten to load their gear, the basic necessities like bottled water, a first-aid kit, toiletries, bedding, their camping gear, and even their clothes. This realization set in with a poignant mix of laughter and horror. How did they manage to be so obliviously focused on snacks that they forgot to pack their supplies? They wondered if they should continue the journey, make do with what they had, or turn back home, resupply, and restart their trip. Learning from their memorable and amusing mistake, the group decided to return home to pack all the necessary supplies. They laughed the entire way home, munching on the amply available snacks, grateful for the humor in the situation and the reiteration of the importance of proper packing. From then on, they carefully double-checked their supplies before leaving on any of their adventures. The mishap of the forgotten supplies turned into a story they’d tell and retell at every camping occasion in the future, instantly becoming a campfire classic and a road trip anecdote remembered for many years to come. They embraced the hilarity of the situation, accepting it as an unexpected, yet entertaining, twist at the start of an adventurous road trip."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: When Grace Slick wrote “White Rabbit” in late 1965, she never imagined the song would pave the way for psychedelic rock and inspire several generations of lead female rock singers, including Pink, who covers it in the new film “Alice Through the Looking Glass.” Released originally by Jefferson Airplane in February 1967 on its “Surrealistic Pillow” album and then as a single that June, “White Rabbit” peaked at No. 8 on Billboard’s pop chart. The brooding bolero has been interpreted by dozens of rock and jazz artists and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. Earlier this year, Ms. Slick, 76, spoke about the song she composed on a red piano and her trippy lyrics based on “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” Grace Slick: In the summer of 1965, I was living with my husband, Jerry Slick, in Larkspur, Calif., about a half-hour north of San Francisco. I was 25 and working as a couture model at I. Magnin in San Francisco while Jerry was making short films. We didn’t have much money. At I. Magnin, I had to change into expensive clothes every 10 minutes and walk around as rich old ladies felt the fabric and asked what the dress cost. If a woman bought the dress, the store would make one up for her nine sizes larger than I was. San Francisco was saturated with music then. Haight-Ashbury was a draw for kids, and bands were there from all over the country. In September ’65, Jerry and I went to the Matrix to hear a new band—Jefferson Airplane. Signe Anderson was the Airplane’s lead singer, and as I watched, I decided that singing might be way more fun than modeling. So we started a band. Jerry had a set of drums and his brother Darby knew how to play guitar. Our friend David Miner could sing and play guitar, Bard DuPont played bass and Peter van Gelder played sax and flute. We named the band the Great Society—sort of a snarky take on Lyndon Johnson’s social program. That fall, I found a small upright piano for 80 at a warehouse in San Francisco. It was painted about 90 coats of bright red and was missing around 10 keys in the upper register. I didn’t play way up there anyway—the notes were too pingy—so I bought it. Jerry and I put the piano in our living room. Our first gig was at North Beach’s Coffee Gallery in October ’65. I quit my modeling job and started writing music for the band. I didn’t really play piano—I’d write lyrics and bang around until I came up with chord progressions. The more the band gigged, the more media coverage we got. In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, I argued in favor of marijuana and LSD, and somehow the article got back to my parents. It was painful for them, I’m sure, but I didn’t care whether they minded. Parents were criticizing a generation’s choices while sitting there with their glasses of scotch. They also seemed unaware that many books they read to us as kids had drug use as a subtext. Peter Pan uses fairy dust and can fly, Dorothy and her friends in “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” cut through a poppy field and wind up stoned and fast asleep. I loved “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” The stuff Alice drank and ate made her high [tall] or brought her down [small]. There were all kinds of drug metaphors in there. The ’60s were very much like that. One afternoon in December or January, while Jerry was out, I started writing a song about Alice and all the drug references in the story. I wrote the lyrics first. As I wrote, I’d read them out loud to be sure my voice could form a cadence [Ms. Slick sings slowly to illustrate: “One pill makes you larger / And one pill makes you small / And the ones that mother gives you / Don’t do anything at all”]. When the lyrics were done, I took the sheet of paper to the red piano and worked on the chords, writing the names of the ones I liked over the phrases. I wrote the song in F-sharp minor, a key that’s ideal for my voice. Minor chords have a certain darkness and sadness. The music I came up with was based on a slow Spanish march or bolero that builds in intensity. I’ve always had a thing for Spanish folk music. Back in 1963, Jerry and I were living with Darby and his girlfriend in San Francisco on Potrero Hill. One day we took acid and I put on Miles Davis’s “Sketches of Spain.” I loved that album and I listened to it over and over for hours, particularly “Concierto de Aranjuez,” which takes up most of the first side. It’s hypnotic. I’ve always been like this. Anything I love I’m going to cram into my ears, nose and mouth until I use it up. “Sketches of Spain” was drilled into my head and came squirting out in various ways as I wrote “White Rabbit.” With the chorus—the Alice lines, like “Go ask Alice, when she’s 10 feet tall”—I shifted to major chords for a release and to celebrate Alice’s courage following the white rabbit down the hole. Once down there she didn’t have a Prince Charming. She had to save her own ass while going through all the insane hallucinogenic stuff. I identified with Alice. I was a product of ’50s America in Palo Alto, Calif., where women were housewives with short hair and everything was highly regulated. I went from the planned, bland ’50s to the world of being in a rock band without looking back. It was my Alice moment, heading down the hole. “White Rabbit” seemed like an appropriate title. When I finished the song, I made copies by hand of the lyrics and chord names for the band. I sat at the piano and sang and played the song for the guys. Then they followed on acoustic instruments, to keep the noise down. We first performed “White Rabbit” in early ’66 at a dive bar on Broadway in San Francisco. Each night we’d play four 30-minute sets for a handful of drunk sailors at the bar, or our friends would drop by to listen. We didn’t cover other bands’ stuff. That was a fast way to wind up playing at the Holiday Inn forever. The challenge was to write what you felt. At the dive bar, if the drunken sailors weren’t aware we were playing, our original songs were probably in pretty good shape. Within a few months we went from dive bars to opening for the Grateful Dead, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Janis [Joplin] and other artists at local auditoriums and theaters. We performed “White Rabbit” at places like the Fillmore, Longshoremen’s Hall and the Matrix. At one point, we made a series of demos at Golden State Recorders for Autumn Records. [Label co-owner] Tom Donahue had Sly Stone come in to help us. We were so bad that Sly eventually played all the instruments so the demo would sound OK. By the summer of ’66, some of the guys were talking about leaving the Great Society to study the sitar in India. I figured the band’s days were numbered. In October, Jack Casady, the Airplane’s bassist, came up to me at the Carousel Ballroom, where we had opened for the band. Jack said Signe was leaving to raise her baby daughter and asked if I wanted to replace her. Initially I was shocked but it took me about two seconds to say yes. Down the rabbit hole, again. Jack, Marty Balin, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen and Spencer Dryden were way ahead of the Great Society in terms of musicianship. Jerry was in film school by then, so he didn’t mind. When I joined the Airplane in October ’66, I brought over “Somebody to Love,” which Darby had written, and “White Rabbit.” Audiences liked the songs when the Great Society had performed them. They were a good fit for Airplane. On “White Rabbit,” the Airplane was better at designing an instrumental idea. There was never a specific guitar solo for “White Rabbit.” In concert, there might be a jam in the beginning but my vocal always ran about 2½ minutes. People in the audience thought I moved around on stage like a panther. I’m actually a klutz. The reason I moved so carefully was to avoid tripping and breaking my neck. In November ’66, we recorded “Surrealistic Pillow” at RCA in Los Angeles. After we recorded “White Rabbit,” we all went into the control room to hear the playback on the monitor speakers. I was blown away. I wasn’t aware I sounded like that, with all that power. I was impressed. I always felt like a good-looking schoolteacher singing “White Rabbit.” I sang the words slowly and precisely, so the people who needed to hear them wouldn’t miss the point. But they did. To this day, I don’t think most people realize the song was aimed at parents who drank and told their kids not to do drugs. I felt they were full of crap, but to write a good song, you need a few more words than that. After the “White Rabbit” single came out, RCA told us each week where the record stood on the charts. I didn’t pay much attention. I didn’t set out to write a hit single, and I felt that radio only liked “White Rabbit” because it was short and they could get more ads in. Looking back, I think “White Rabbit” is a very good song. I’m not a genius but I don’t suck. My only complaint is that the lyrics could have been stronger. If I had done it right, more people would have been annoyed.

Article:","completion":"Title: Google Street View Explores the Majestic Heights of the World's Seven Summits Introduction In a remarkable feat, Google has now extended its Street View capabilities to cover four of the world's Seven Summits. The Seven Summits are the tallest peaks on each of the Earth's continents, and Google's impressive expansion comes on the heels of its January update, which included the awe-inspiring Grand Canyon. This latest development has not only elevated the technology giant's mapping prowess but also paved the way for virtual travelers to experience the wonder of these breathtaking summits. Exploring the Summits The world's Seven Summits comprise Mount Everest in Asia, Aconcagua in South America, Denali in North America, Kilimanjaro in Africa, Elbrus in Europe, Vinson Massif in Antarctica, and Carstensz Pyramid in Australia/Oceania. Google Street View, known for bringing global locations to life with its 360-degree panoramic images, has made it possible for people to virtually explore the landscapes and trails leading to four of these magnificent peaks. The incredible visual journey begins with Aconcagua in Argentina, South America's highest peak at an elevation of 22,841 feet, allowing adventurers to marvel at the surreal snow-capped mountains and rocky terrains of this gigantic summit. Moving on to North America, Google Street View takes viewers to Denali, formerly known as Mount McKinley, in Alaska, showcasing the rugged beauty of its glaciers, icy crevasses, and some of the harshest weather conditions on our planet. In Africa, Kilimanjaro, with its height of 19,341 feet, is captured in its entirety by Google Street View, unveiling its multiple ecological zones and intriguing plant life. Finally, Europe's highest point, Mount Elbrus, located in the Caucasus Mountain range in Russia, is also now mapped with Google's technology, offering a virtual passage through its icy and wind-swept landscapes. Technological Advancements and Challenges Google's constant innovation has been commendable, and expanding its Street View services to the world's highest points is an obvious testament to that. This has been made possible by the company's ongoing improvements to its Trekker hardware, a wearable backpack mounted with a camera system, allowing individuals to capture images while exploring hard-to-reach locations. However, capturing these stunning panoramas of the world's Seven Summits was not an easy task. Google faced challenges ranging from extreme weather conditions, such as freezing temperatures and high winds, to the physical limitations posed by such high altitudes. Nevertheless, its commitment to enhancing the user experience has made it all possible, setting new standards for online exploration. The Future of Virtual Exploration With this latest update to Google Street View, the possibilities for virtual exploration have expanded exponentially. Armchair adventurers can now marvel at some of the most stunning and remote locations without leaving the comfort of their homes, all thanks to Google's unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology. By incorporating four of the world's seven highest peaks, Google has set the stage for further expansion – potentially covering the remaining summits, including the monumental Mount Everest. As the technology continues to advance, we can only imagine what other hidden treasures await us in the virtual realm, as Google Street View seeks to conquer the world's greatest landscapes and promote the shared experience of our planet's natural wonders."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of the two chemicals causes an endothermic process, chemical A or chemical B? Hint: Some materials have negative heats of solution; the dissolution of one of these solutes in water is an exothermic process. Heat is released, causing a net increase in the temperature of the solution. Conversely, other substances have positive heats of solution. For example, the dissolution of potassium nitrate in water is an endothermic process. The resulting absorption of energy causes the solution to become colder. Calculations involving heats of solutions follow the same basic approach that we have used with other enthalpy problems. Answer:","completion":"Chemical A causes an endothermic process. An endothermic process is one that absorbs heat from its surroundings, resulting in a decrease in temperature. In the given scenario, when chemical A is mixed with water, the temperature of the solution decreases, indicating that heat is being absorbed from the surroundings, which is characteristic of an endothermic process. On the other hand, chemical B causes the water to become much warmer when mixed. This suggests an exothermic process, where heat is released to the surroundings, resulting in an increase in temperature. The hint provided explains that substances with positive heats of solution cause endothermic processes, where energy is absorbed, as in the case of potassium nitrate dissolving in water. Similarly, substances with negative heats of solution result in exothermic processes, where heat is released, and the temperature of the solution increases. Therefore, based on the observed temperature changes, chemical A is responsible for the endothermic process, while chemical B is responsible for the exothermic process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But when bad weather gives you trouble, can you still make it before the bell rings? In northern China during spring, big sandstorms often make trouble for students and everyone else. When the sky is dark with sand, buses and cars all move much more slowly. Sometimes, people can't even see for 20 metres. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. This year, sandstorms started in late March. They have happened in more than 10 provinces in northern China this year. More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns to sand. When spring comes and the ice melts , the ground becomes looser . Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe too much sand, they could cough or have asthma . Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never get back home. The winds also tear down farmers' houses. What can you do to stop sandstorms? Here's an idea: Ask you parents to help you plant some trees this spring. If you see people cutting down too many trees, tell them about the dangers of sandstorms, and ask your government to stop them from cutting.

Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations. Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves. \\"We have bodies. Come and examine them,\\" he said. \\"It is clear they are missing certain parts.\\" He also said a dozen doctors have been \\"executed\\" in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting. Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused the Islamic State group of \\"crimes of genocide\\" in targeting certain ethnic groups. The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict. Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that \\"it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day.\\" He used an acronym for the group. He said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State group has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law. \\"Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,\\" Mladenov said. ||||| Iraq's ambassador to the U.N. claimed Wednesday that ISIS has been forcing doctors to harvest organs from the bodies of the people it's killed, and then selling those organs to fund its operations, according to an AP report. Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim called for a Security Council investigation into alleged mass graves full of bodies with surgical scars and missing kidneys. According to Alkalim, a dozen doctors have been killed in Mosul because they wouldn't take part in the Islamic State's organ trafficking scheme. Unconfirmed rumors of ISIS removing and selling organs have been around since at least December, when Middle East news outlet Al-Monitor published an article with more detailed claims than Alkalim made this week. Based on a report from one doctor in Mosul, Al-Monitor wrote: Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs ... the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped. He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. The Al-Monitor story also claims that the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed \\"the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest,\\" a claim that was widely repeated by news sites in December, but seems to be based entirely on this single source. (As far as I can tell, there's no mention of the trafficking operation in OHCHR's published reports on Iraq, and Alkalim didn't mention OHCHR in his statement to the Security Council.) The Islamic State is incredibly money-hungry, Newsweek reported in a detailed look at the revenue streams ISIS uses to support the 8 million people in its territories, including more than 10,000 active fighters. There's no mention of selling kidneys, but ISIS needs all the money it can get, and if they're willing to conduct small-time local kidnappings for as little as 500, moving organs isn't so farfetched. There's still no conclusive evidence, though. The Islamic State is the international boogeyman of the moment, and its confirmed actions are heinous enough to make any rumor sound plausible, but it's also been the subject of several online hoaxes and conspiracy theories. It's probably best to withhold judgment until the U.N. does what Alkahim suggests and examines the bodies.

Question 1: What does OBC mean in KVPY? Question 2: How dangerous is a Rottweiler/Boxer mix? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"No, Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They concern two completely different topics. Question 1, \\"What does OBC mean in KVPY?\\" is asking about a specific term in the context of an educational program in India. KVPY, or the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana, is a scholarship program in India that is funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and administered by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). This program aims to encourage students to take up research careers in the field of basic sciences. OBC, in the context of KVPY or any other Indian educational context, stands for Other Backward Class. This is a collective term used by the Indian government to classify castes which are socially and educationally disadvantaged. It is one of several official classifications of the population of India, along with Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC and ST). The OBC classification is mainly significant in the context of the reservation policy of the Indian government, where a certain percentage of seats is reserved in the publicly funded educational institutions and in jobs under the state and central government for the socially and educationally backward classes. Question 2, \\"How dangerous is a Rottweiler/Boxer mix?\\" is a completely different type of question and it's related to dog breeds and their behavior. A Rottweiler/Boxer mix is a hybrid dog breed resulting from the crossing of a Rottweiler and a Boxer. The temperament of the resulting mix can vary depending on the traits inherited from each of its parent breeds. As individual breeds, Rottweilers and Boxers are both known for their strength, intelligence, and loyalty. They're also both known to be protective, which can make them excellent guard dogs. However, their protective nature can sometimes be seen as aggression, especially if the dog isn't properly socialized or trained. The perceived \\"danger\\" of a Rottweiler/Boxer mix, or indeed any dog breed, isn't just about the breed itself. A lot depends on individual temperament, how the dog has been raised and trained, and how well its needs are being met in terms of exercise, mental stimulation, and social interaction. Any dog, regardless of breed, can become dangerous if it's mistreated, neglected, or not properly trained and socialized. So, in conclusion, these questions are asking about utterly distinct matters — one is asking about a term in the Indian reservation and educational context, and the other is about the general behavior of a specific hybrid breed of dogs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gary Hooper had given them the lead going in to the closing stages from Steven Fletcher's clever back heel. Clayton Donaldson then levelled soon after from the penalty spot after he was brought down by Keiren Westwood. Media playback is not supported on this device The game at St Andrew's suddenly came to life in the closing 15 minutes after the main talking point had been Birmingham's appeals for a penalty in the first half. Former Owls winger Jacques Maghoma appeared to have been tripped by Tom Lees on the edge of the area after he squared the ball. Birmingham's protests went unanswered and their hopes of taking any points from the game appeared dashed when Wednesday led through substitute Hooper. They were behind for just five minutes as Donaldson picked himself up to send Westwood the wrong way from 12 yards, having been clipped by the goalkeeper rushing off his line. It was another substitute who had the final say as Jutkiewicz, on loan from Burnley, suddenly found space to loop his header over Westwood moments after Nuhiu headed Liam Palmer's cross against the bar at the other end.

The Ottoman Empire had ruled over Greece for centuries, and by the early 19th century, a growing nationalist movement inspired by the Enlightenment and revolutionary ideas from the French and American revolutions led to a strong desire for Greek independence. In 1821, the Greek War of Independence began, with Greek revolutionaries fighting against the Ottoman control. As the war continued, the humanitarian crisis and atrocities committed by the Ottoman Empire against the Greek population caught the attention and sympathy of the nations of Europe. In particular, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France, which were all significant powers at the time, became increasingly involved in the conflict. The three Great Powers saw an opportunity to both curtail the influence of the Ottoman Empire and champion the cause of national self-determination. In the case of Russia, it had long-standing religious and cultural ties with the Greek Orthodox Christians, and it sought to expand its influence in the region. The United Kingdom was interested in ensuring stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, safeguarding its trade routes, and preventing the spread of revolutionary ideas. France was motivated by its support for national sovereignty and the opportunity to weaken a rival empire, the Ottomans. Further, all three nations were concerned about maintaining the balance of power in Europe. Although they had divergent interests and motivations, these Great Powers eventually agreed to work together and intervene in the conflict after years of negotiation. Each nation sent a navy to Greece, and they managed to defeat the combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleet at the Battle of Navarino in 1827. This decisive victory significantly weakened the Ottoman control in the region and paved the way for the eventual establishment of an independent Greek state. Following further negotiations and diplomacy, the nascent Greek state was recognized under the London Protocol in 1830, thus ending the Greek War of Independence and establishing Greece's sovereignty. The intervention of the three Great Powers, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France, was instrumental in the eventual success of the Greek revolutionaries and the creation of the modern Greek state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Math Problem Solve -61*l + 52*l + 630 = -24*l for l.","completion":"To solve the equation -61*l + 52*l + 630 = -24*l for the variable l, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms on both sides of the equation. -61*l and 52*l are like terms because they have the same variable, l, with the same exponent 1. Similarly, -24*l on the other side of the equation is also a like term. Combine the like terms on the left side of the equation: -61*l + 52*l = -9*l Now the equation becomes: -9*l + 630 = -24*l Step 2: Move all the terms with the variable l to one side of the equation. Add 24*l to both sides of the equation to move the term with l to one side: -9*l + 24*l + 630 = -24*l + 24*l This simplifies the equation to: 15*l + 630 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the variable l. Subtract 630 from both sides of the equation to isolate l: 15*l + 630 - 630 = 0 - 630 This simplifies the equation to: 15*l = -630 Step 4: Solve for l. Now, divide both sides of the equation by 15 to solve for l: 15*l / 15 = -630 / 15 This simplifies to: l = -42 The solution to the equation -61*l + 52*l + 630 = -24*l for the variable l is l = -42."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city. - Hispaniola (Spanish: \\"La Española\\"; Latin: \\"Hispaniola\\"; Taíno: \\"Haiti\\") is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the tenth most populous island in the world. - Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles. The island, in area, lies about south of Cuba, and west of Hispaniola (the island containing the nation-states of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Jamaica is the fourth-largest island country in the Caribbean, by area. - Prorastomus sirenoides is an extinct species of primitive sirenian that lived during the Eocene Epoch 40 million years ago in Jamaica . - The transition between the end of the Eocene and the beginning of the Oligocene is marked by large-scale extinction and floral and faunal turnover (although minor in comparison to the largest mass extinctions). Most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature. They included the last of the ancient cetaceans, the Archaeoceti. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - Sirenia, commonly referred to as sea cows, is an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. Sirenia comprises the families Dugongidae (the dugong), Trichechidae (manatees), Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians), and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians). There are currently four extant species of sirenians. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago. The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene. - The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain.
