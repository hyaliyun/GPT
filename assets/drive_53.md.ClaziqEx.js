However, I must admit that my recent visit left me feeling disappointed and underwhelmed. Upon arrival, the first thing I noticed was the subpar ambiance. The lighting was too dim, making it hard to read the menus, and the tables were too close together, causing discomfort whenever a server or another patron walked by. Additionally, the constant noise from the bar area was overwhelmingly loud, preventing any casual conversation with my companions. Despite being called The Sunset Lounge, I found the lack of any visible sunset quite ironic. Moving on to the food, the overall quality didn't meet my expectations. While the menu seemed promising with a wide variety of mouth-watering dishes, the actual execution fell short. The appetizer, a plate of calamari, was overcooked to the point of chewiness and lacked seasoning. My main course, the grilled salmon with herb-crusted potatoes and green beans, arrived lukewarm and not as fresh as I would have hoped. The salmon tasted dry and bland, and the herb-crusted potatoes were overpowered by a strangely overpowering garlic flavor. Although I found the green beans passable, they were slightly undercooked and inconsistently seasoned. The service I received at The Sunset Lounge was a mixed bag. While our server was initially prompt and courteous when taking our orders, the wait time for the food was anything but reasonable. It took almost an hour for our appetizers to arrive, and the main courses were delayed even further. Some of the other diners in our vicinity seemed to be encountering similar difficulties, as they were often looking around in frustration or feverishly gesturing toward the waitstaff. Although I hoped that the dessert would salvage the evening, it provided little more than a mediocre taste on an already bittersweet evening. The chocolate lava cake was dense and dry, though the presentation was nice. As for the accompanying vanilla ice cream, it had already started to melt by the time it reached the table. To conclude, I'm dismayed to report that my experience at The Sunset Lounge did not live up to its reputation. I cannot recommend the restaurant based on my visit due to its lackluster ambiance, disappointing food, and inconsistent service. Perhaps with some much-needed improvements in these areas, The Sunset Lounge might eventually regain its sparkle. Unfortunately, I doubt I will be returning anytime soon to find out."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The report laid out Eisenhower's response to the incident and gave details of Patton's decades of military service. Eisenhower concluded that Patton was invaluable to the war effort and that he was confident the corrective actions taken would be adequate.

Step 1: Identify the main subject matter of the story The story is about Tanya and Rachel, and their immunity differences towards chicken pox. Step 2: Determine the main outcome Tanya is immune to chicken pox, while Rachel is not due to the vaccination choice. Step 3: Justify the choice The story (A) suggests that Tanya got the chicken pox shot, which made her immune to the disease. On the other hand, Rachel did not get the shot, so she remains susceptible to chicken pox. This creates a contrast between the two characters and their experiences with the illness. Step 4: Expand upon the original idea The story might show the consequences of not getting vaccinated as Rachel might experience the discomfort of chicken pox in the story, while Tanya remains healthy. This could lead to interactions and experiences that demonstrate the importance of vaccinations and making informed choices. Step 5: Further develop the plot The story might progress to show how Tanya takes care of Rachel during her chicken pox ordeal, leading to a deepened friendship between them.

Q: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Final preparations are underway for Friday’s historic third summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War.

Answer the following question: Information: - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power. - Mustafa Bülent Ecevit (28 May 1925 5 November 2006) was a Turkish politician, poet, writer, scholar, and journalist, who served as the Prime Minister of Turkey four times between 1974 and 2002. He served as prime minister of Turkey in 1974, 1977, 197879, and 19992002. He was the leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP) between 1972 and 1980, and in 1989 he became the leader of the Democratic Left Party (DSP). - The 15th Turkish general election was held on 3 November 2002 following the collapse of the DSP - MHP - ANAP coalition led by Bülent Ecevit . It was the 15th general election to be held in Turkey . All 550 members of the Grand National Assembly were up for election . The election was held during an ongoing economic crisis which followed the 2001 financial crash , which resulted in a deep resentment of coalition governments which had governed the country since the 1980 military coup . The Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , which had only been formed in 2001 by Recep Tayyip Erdoan , won the election with nearly two - thirds of the seats . The protest vote was such that every sitting party previously represented in parliament was ejected , with the AKP winning 363 seats with just 34.3 % of the vote . The only other party which passed the 10 % threshold to gain representation was the Republican People 's Party , which came second with 19.38 % of the vote and 178 seats . The election produced Turkey 's first single party government since 1987 and the country 's first two - party parliament since 1960 . The moderate Islamism advocated by the AKP was at odds with the secular establishment of the Republic of Turkey . While serving as the Mayor of Istanbul , Erdoan was sentenced to a 10 month prison term in 1998 for reciting a poem in Siirt which incited racial intolerance . This barred him from initially seeking a seat in parliament , meaning that the AKP 's co-founder Abdullah Gül became Prime Minister following their election victory . With the help of the CHP , the government overturned Erdoan 's political ban in 2003 , after which he was able to seek a seat in a controversial by - election in the Province of Siirt . Erdoan became Prime Minister in March 2003 , with Abdullah Gül concurrently assuming the role of Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister . - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - The Prime Minister of Turkey (Turkish: \\"Babakan\\") is the head of government of Turkey. The prime minister is the leader of a political coalition in the Turkish parliament (Meclis) and the leader of the cabinet. The current holder of the position is Binali Yldrm of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), who took office on 24 May 2016. What is the relationship between 'turkish general election' and 'prime minister of turkey'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between the Turkish general election and the Prime Minister of Turkey lies in the electoral process and the formation of the government. In Turkey, a parliamentary republic, the Prime Minister is the head of government and holds significant power, leading the country's political coalition and the cabinet. The Turkish general election is held to elect members of the Grand National Assembly, which is Turkey's unicameral parliament. During the general election, Turkish citizens vote for political parties, with each party needing to surpass a 10% threshold to gain representation in the parliament. The seats in the Grand National Assembly are allocated proportionally to the votes each party receives, provided they have met the threshold. Following the general election, the President of Turkey generally tasks the leader of the party with the most seats in the parliament to form a government. In cases where a single party wins the majority of the seats in the parliament, the party leader typically assumes the role of Prime Minister, as they have a strong mandate to lead the government. If no party wins the majority, coalition governments may be formed through negotiations between multiple parties. In such cases, the Prime Minister is often chosen from the leading party in the coalition. Therefore, the Turkish general election plays a crucial role in determining the composition of the parliament, and consequently, the party that has the power to form the government and appoint the Prime Minister of Turkey. The Prime Minister, as the head of government, is responsible for implementing policies and decisions, shaping the country's political landscape, and is held accountable to the parliament."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Possible answers: Tired, Energized, Active A:","completion":"Bailey can be described as tired in this situation, as taking a nap during the second period of the class indicates that she was unable to maintain her focus or stay awake. There could be several factors contributing to her tiredness, and it is essential to analyze the situation from multiple perspectives before coming to a conclusion. First and foremost, Bailey might have had a long day before attending the class or did not have enough sleep the previous night, causing her to feel exhausted during the class. Inadequate rest can lead to difficulty in concentrating and retaining information. Therefore, taking a short nap would have been an effective way for her to restore her energy and get ready for what is to come during the rest of the day. Secondly, Bailey might be struggling with personal issues that can affect her physically or emotionally, contributing to her tiredness. For example, stress, anxiety, or depression can lead to poor sleep quality or difficulty concentrating, resulting in her feeling tired during class. Additionally, underlying health issues could be contributing factors. Conditions such as sleep apnea, anemia, or thyroid problems can result in tiredness and fatigue. If her tiredness persists and impacts her ability to perform daily activities, seeking medical help to identify any underlying health conditions would be necessary. Moreover, Bailey could be lacking in time management skills or struggling with the workload, causing her to overwork herself and not allocate enough time for rest. This overexertion could lead to her feeling tired during the class. Developing better time management strategies, setting realistic goals, and prioritizing self-care would help mitigate this issue. Furthermore, it is essential to consider the external factors of the class itself. The class environment may be conducive to sleepiness, such as dim lighting, a warm temperature, or the second period might be right after a lunch break when students generally feel sleepier. Lastly, it is important to note that this situation might have been a one-time occurrence for Bailey. She could generally be an active and energized individual, but she might have faced personal or physical challenges on that specific day, leading to her tiredness. In conclusion, based on the provided context, Bailey can be described as tired during the second period of the class. Factors such as inadequate sleep, personal stress, health issues, or even the class environment could have contributed to her tiredness. It is crucial to consider these various aspects and encourage her to address any underlying concerns to prevent further instances of tiredness during class, allowing her to remain focused and engaged in her academic pursuits."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Involving the authorities should be your last recourse for a barking dog, because it is likely to take a good bit of time and effort to secure an acceptable resolution, and is sure to make your relationship with your neighbor uncomfortable at best — and quite possibly openly hostile. But, if you have exhausted other options and/or see no alternative, make sure you know your rights and how to assert them. Some municipalities have specific codes regarding barking dogs, while others include it within nuisance or noise ordinances. Within a single metropolitan area, local codes can vary widely, so contact your local government authority for clarification. If you and your neighbor are both part of a neighborhood association, there may be codes that cover barking dogs. Similarly, if you are renters (especially if you have the same landlord), look into the terms of your lease. Some municipalities may provide, or be able to refer you to, mediation services (binding or non-binding) to keep such disputes out of the courts. Contact your local government, district attorney’s office, or small claims court to inquire. The days of the dog catcher coming around unannounced and snatching up problem dogs is over, but your local animal control service may be able to intervene for you. Contact the service to find out whether it handles nuisance barking, or whether you need to involve the police first. You may need to be persistent in your calls and/or be able to provide evidence that the dog is a nuisance for animal control to act. Call animal control right away if the dog is barking because it is in pain, has trapped itself in a small area, has tangled its chain, or is otherwise unable to access water. Contact the owner first if you are comfortable doing so, but don’t ignore a suffering dog that is not receiving proper care. Involving the police will usually either immediately escalate or immediately resolve the situation. Your amount of preparation beforehand may well make the difference. Once you make yourself familiar with the relevant dog/noise/nuisance ordinance(s) in your area, call the non-emergency police number to report a violation. Unless your local police uses the emergency number (such as 911) for all calls, do not call it to make a barking dog complaint. It is conceivable that you may be cited for misuse of the emergency line. Many police departments and other services require you to prove that the barking is extreme before they can take action. Here is where your record-keeping — log book, recordings, statements from other neighbors, etc. — can prove invaluable in supporting your claim. Once the police are involved, your neighbor may feel besieged and try to frame the issue as a dispute between neighbors, in which you are primarily at fault for some reason. This is why it is essential to never give him ammunition to use against you by making threats, shouting, swearing, accosting the dog in any way, etc. If you need to go to court to prove a noise/nuisance violation, come prepared with the evidence you have gathered. Calmly and clearly establish your case. You may be able to sue your neighbor in small claims court for causing you loss of enjoyment of your home and property. You’re not going to strike it rich this way (and may even end up losing money in the process), but if you provide a clear, strong case supported by documented evidence, you may be able to get your neighbor to finally quiet that dog. If you find that the local laws regarding nuisance dogs are lacking in your area, start a petition and contact your elected leaders. Summary:","completion":"If you have exhausted all other options and need to involve the authorities for a barking dog issue, make sure you know your rights and local regulations. Some municipalities have specific codes, while others include barking dogs within nuisance or noise ordinances. Contact your local government, neighborhood association, or landlord for clarification on rules, mediation services, and possible legal avenues.

Step 1: Identify the subject and their respective claims in both sentences - In both statements, the subject is \\"Idec shareholders\\" or \\"Idec holders.\\" - In the first sentence, they are said to own \\"50.5 percent of the stock\\" of a combined company. - In the second sentence, they are said to own \\"about 50.5 percent of the stock\\" of a combined company. Step 2: Analyze if both statements match in their claims - The differences lie in the wording \\"50.5 percent\\" vs. \\"about 50.5 percent.\\" - The first statement provides an exact percentage (50.5%), while the second statement indicates an approximate percentage (about 50.5%). Step 3: Draw a conclusion - Based on the information provided in both sentences, the claims are almost identical but not entirely the same due to the use of the word \\"about\\" in the second statement. Conclusion: While the second statement is very close to the first, it is not exactly true since the use of \\"about\\" implies a slight variation in the percentage of stock ownership."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hewlett-Packard Co.'s board is expected Thursday to name the former eBay chief its next CEO, replacing Leo Apotheker, according to a person briefed on the matter. H-P's board is expected to oust CEO Leo Apotheker and replace him with former eBay CEO Meg Whitman today. Colin Barr and Marcelo Prince discuss whether a new strategy and a new CEO can save H-P. (Photo: AP.) Ms. Whitman—a Silicon Valley veteran who turned eBay Inc. from a quirky start-up into an online auction giant—remains an influential figure in the technology scene as an H-P director and an adviser to a leading venture-capital firm. But the former eBay CEO also has little background in the hardware industry, never ran a company of H-P's size, made some missteps at eBay, and most recently drew attention for a failed bid to become governor of California. In an interview Monday, Ms. Whitman, 55, described H-P as \\"a Silicon Valley icon that is in the process of reshaping itself.\\" She acknowledged that the Palo Alto, Calif., company \\"has certainly had challenges\\" and that \\"time will tell\\" how it fares. But she added, \\"I'm optimistic about H-P's future.\\" Enlarge Image Close Bloomberg News H-P board member and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, shown in August, is a candidate for H-P interim CEO. Asked about Mr. Apotheker's recent decision to potentially spin off the company's personal-computer business, Ms. Whitman said, \\"There are tremendous strategic changes that are taking place in the PC business, and H-P wants to capitalize on those changes and make sure this operating division has the autonomy and the ability to respond to rapidly changing technology.\\" On Wednesday, a spokesman for Ms. Whitman referred a request for additional comment to H-P. H-P then declined to comment. The re-emergence of Ms. Whitman—who has kept a relatively low profile since losing her gubernatorial bid to Democrat Jerry Brown last year—is likely to renew investors' focus on her track record at eBay. Ms. Whitman joined eBay in 1998 after stints at Hasbro Inc., Florists Transworld Delivery and Stride Rite Corp. By the time she left the Internet company in March 2008, eBay's annual revenue was 7.7 billion, up from 86 million when she joined. But concerns later mounted as eBay's once-torrid growth slowed amid competition from other e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com Inc. Ms. Whitman was also roundly criticized for eBay's 2005 purchase of Internet-calling firm Skype for 2.5 billion, for which it later took a 1.4 billion write-down. EBay has been viewed as a turnaround situation for the last few years under CEO John Donahoe. A year after leaving eBay, Ms. Whitman announced she would run as a Republican for governor of California, which had struggled with deep deficits during Arnold Schwarzenegger's tenure. She won the Republican nomination, but despite spending a record amount on her campaign—178.5 million, most of it out of her own pocket—she ultimately lost to Mr. Brown. In March, Ms. Whitman became a part-time adviser at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a prominent Silicon Valley venture-capital firm. In the Monday interview, Ms. Whitman also mused about the challenge for big companies of keeping up with increasingly rapid change. \\"The bigger you get, the harder it is to be nimble,\\" she said. \\"How do you grow big and stay small? That still is the fundamental question.\\" —Ben Worthen contributed to this article. Write to Vauhini Vara at vauhini.vara@wsj.com ||||| Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), facing investor frustration over sales-forecast cuts and jarring strategy shifts, is considering replacing Chief Executive Officer Leo Apotheker, two people familiar with the matter said. The board may appoint Hewlett-Packard director and former EBay Inc. (EBAY) CEO Meg Whitman as Apotheker’s successor, possibly on an interim basis, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the plans aren’t public. The board also is reconsidering a proposal to spin off the company’s personal- computer unit, another person said. Hewlett-Packard has lowered its sales forecasts three times since Apotheker became CEO in November, and he’s presided over strategy swings that left shareholders doubting his credibility. Before today, the company’s stock has plunged 47 percent on his watch, and “investor exasperation” with management is at its highest in more than a decade, according to Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “There’s certainly a lot of investor discontent with them,” said Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco, who rates the shares “sector perform” and doesn’t own them. “There’s widespread frustration with the fact that numbers have been cut three times since he’s been there.” Hewlett-Packard rose 1.51, or 6.7 percent, to 23.98 today on the New York Stock Exchange after Bloomberg reported the possible management change. Revisiting the Spinoff Hewlett-Packard’s board, due to meet this week, is open to re-examining the spinoff proposal now because some directors think the idea wasn’t studied as thoroughly as other high- profile spinoffs, such as one by Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT), the person familiar with the matter said. At the same time, the turmoil raises the possibility that some or all of Hewlett-Packard may become a takeover candidate. Mylene Mangalindan, a spokeswoman for Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard, declined to comment. The possible spinoff would take as long as 18 months to complete, Hewlett-Packard said at the time. That elicited criticism that it should have had a buyer lined up or a more concrete plan in place before making the announcement. Whitman, who joined Hewlett-Packard’s board in January after a failed bid to become California’s governor last year, had a mixed record at EBay. CEO for a decade, she took the company public and pioneered e-commerce for small businesses. Yet in the final years of her tenure, she couldn’t halt a slowdown in sales growth and overpaid for Skype Technologies SA after a bidding war with Google Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. Not Long-Term? Her lack of experience in computing for large companies may mean she doesn’t stay in the role for long, said Jayson Noland, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. in San Francisco. “She’s on the board and is a logical interim CEO, but not a logical long-term CEO,” said Noland, who has a “neutral” rating on the stock. “She doesn’t have enterprise experience.” Pressure on Apotheker intensified on Aug. 18, when he announced a sweeping overhaul that included a 10.3 billion acquisition of Autonomy Corp. and the possible PC spinoff. He also killed off the company’s WebOS tablets and smartphones, just five months after vowing to put the operating system on a full range of the company’s computers. The shares plunged 20 percent following the announcement, fueled by concerns that Autonomy was too expensive and the plans showed a lack of deliberation. The stock slumped to the point that other breakup and takeover scenarios are possible, Hewlett- Packard investor Michael Mullaney said at the time. ‘Scoop It Up’ “For the right company, it probably would make sense for someone to come in and scoop it up,” Mullaney, who helps manage 9.5 billion at Fiduciary Trust in Boston, said in August. “Someone could come and at least buy pieces of the firm.” The server unit would boost Oracle Corp.’s share fivefold and help it become the biggest maker of the hardware. Hewlett- Packard’s printer business, which is 70 percent more profitable than the company as a whole, may also attract private-equity firms, Mullaney said. While the PC spinoff would help Hewlett-Packard focus on higher-margin products, such as services and software, the way it was conveyed didn’t satisfy shareholders, Sacconaghi said. The Autonomy deal, meanwhile, hasn’t been popular, he said. “Our conversations with investors continue to point to near universal opposition of the Autonomy acquisition, due to its high price,” he wrote in a Sept. 13 report. Undoing Autonomy By paying cash for Autonomy, Hewlett-Packard doesn’t need approval from its own shareholders to complete the deal, Sacconaghi said. The company can’t undo the takeover unless Autonomy investors fail to approve it, according to a person with knowledge of the terms. That outcome is unlikely, given that 42 percent of Autonomy shares had already been tendered in favor of the sale as of Sept. 12, this person said. Apotheker, the former CEO of German software maker SAP AG (SAP), has aimed to transform Hewlett-Packard into a provider of more profitable software and services for businesses that are doing more computing on remote servers, via the so-called cloud. Yet, results have been plagued by tepid demand for PCs, as consumers in growing numbers snapped up competing mobile devices and tablets, such as Apple Inc.’s iPad. Short Stint His tenure at Hewlett-Packard may barely outlast his 10- month stint as CEO of SAP. He resigned in February 2010 after an attempted price increase during the recession that rankled consumers and a clash with German unions on plans to cut jobs. He presided over the company’s first revenue decline since 2003 as customers delayed software purchases. Apotheker joined Hewlett-Packard after Mark Hurd departed as CEO amid a scandal over a personal relationship with a company contractor. Hurd now is a co-president at Oracle. Hewlett-Packard isn’t looking to completely change course, said Baird’s Noland. The company’s board and shareholders are mostly looking for a surer hand, he said. “The board is directionally behind the plan Apotheker’s put in place,” Noland said. “It’s just the execution of that plan that has investors wound up.” To contact the reporters on this story: Aaron Ricadela in San Francisco at aricadela@bloomberg.net; Carol Hymowitz in New York at chymowitz@bloomberg.net; Jeffrey McCracken in New York at jmccracken3@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net; Jennifer Sondag at jsondag@bloomberg.net ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Meg Whitman is poised to become Hewlett-Packard Co.'s next CEO, replacing Leo Apotheker, according to a source briefed on the matter.

Context: President Donald Trump's approval rating has headed into unfamiliar territory in recent weeks — upward. Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

Movie plot title: Kissing Jessica Stein Movie plot: Twenty-eight-year-old Jessica Stein, a copyeditor living and working in New York City, is plagued by failed blind dates with men, and decides to answer a newspaper's personal advertisement containing a quote from Rilke that she had read and admired earlier. The advertisement has been placed by Helen Cooper, a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who is seeking a lesbian relationship to replace her unsatisfying and meaningless sex with men. Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little. As nervous as Jessica is about dating Helen, she realizes after a surprise kiss that a different experience can be good. Through the early part of their relationship, Jessica finds in Helen everything she'd dreamed of finding in a man. They are compatible, they like many of the same things, and they are caring for one another. Even when Helen gets sickâwhich she says earlier in the film never happens to herâJessica is there to care for her. The only predicament for the relationship is Jessica's nervousness concerning same-sex intimacy. Over the early weeks of their relationship, she and Helen slowly work on building up her confidence in this area by gradually extended make-out sessions. Eventually, they graduate to full intimacy, which is initiated by Jessica during an over night stay at her parents' home in Scarsdale. In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret. Jessica's secrecy means that she has to endure scenes that would not happen had she been open about the two of them. One example occurs during a dinner to celebrate her brother's engagement. Her mother had invited an IBM executive in hopes of setting him up with Jessica. Helen and Jessica later get into a quarrel about Jessica's refusal to inform her family of their relationship, resulting in an apparent breakup. It isn't until later, as her brother's wedding approaches, that her mother figures out that they are dating. Her mother...

OSHA finds 58 violations at Nevada's Hoover Dam LAS VEGAS – The federal agency operating Hoover Dam must correct 58 health and safety violations that investigators found in recent inspections at the massive Colorado River water retention and hydroelectric power plant east of Las Vegas. Inspectors for the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration found violations in July and October that included lead contamination, electrical hazards, inadequate personal protective equipment and machinery guards, and the possibility that electric plant workers could be exposed to cancer-causing hexavalent chromium, according to a statement released Monday by OSHA regional chief Ken Atha. None of the violations jeopardized the safety of the public or threatened the structural integrity of the dam or its operations, said Terry Fulp regional chief of the Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the dam that forms Lake Mead. . \\"We are taking the necessary steps to ensure the issues raised are fixed and do not happen again,\\" Fulp said. Other deficiencies stemmed from outdated design and improved safety awareness since the dam began producing power 77 years ago, according to officials with the OSHA office in San Francisco and Rose Davis, spokeswoman for the dam operations office in Boulder City, outside Las Vegas. None of the approximately 250 workers at the dam and its hydropower plant was injured as a result of issues that OSHA identified, Davis said. The dam was completed in 1936 and regulates the flow of the Colorado River. It holds back the Lake Mead reservoir, which supplies almost all the drinking water supply of Las Vegas, 30 miles away. Water released through the hydropower plant supplies farms, businesses and homes downstream. The hydropower plant provides electricity to some 1.3 million homes and businesses in California, Arizona and Nevada. Some 1 million people a year visit the dam, including about 880,000 who tour the colossal structure, its massive hydropower plant and its art deco architectural elements. They weren't endangered, Davis said. OSHA expects a response from dam officials by the end of the month, OSHA spokeswoman Deanne Amadensaid. She added that Bureau of Reclamation officials can seek time to correct violations. Davis said inspectors initially told dam operations supervisors they found 77 violations. Some included improper location of fire extinguishers and placement of extension cords. Some two dozen were quickly corrected, Davis said. Other shortcomings, such as doors opening the wrong direction, date from the construction of the dam in the 1930s, Davis said. Atha said eight violations were designated as repeat offenses because OSHA has previously notified the Bureau of Reclamation within the past five years of a similar violation at Hoover Dam or another bureau facility in the OSHA region including California, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii and the Pacific.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Because white spots are also an indication of enamel damage and early stages of tooth decay or can also be produced by fluoride ingestion at an early age (childhood fluorosis), preventing these spots from forming is almost always preventable with regular brushing and flossing. Improving your dental hygiene habits will reduce the likelihood of getting white spots in the future. Some tips to help you have great oral hygiene habits include: Always brush your teeth after waking up, after eating, and before going to bed. Check the fluoride content of your toothpaste. You need enough fluoride to reduce acid and balance out your mouth's pH levels, but you don’t want to have so much fluoride that it is damaging. Try to aim for amounts of fluoride between 1,000 and 1,500 ppm unless your dentist says otherwise. Floss every night. If you have difficulty using standard floss, try using a pre-threaded flosser, instead. Visit the dentist every six months. Good care at home can prevent most problems, but a dentist can diagnose early signs of plaque buildup and other related issues. Certain foods can damage tooth enamel and make the mouth acidic and dry, allowing more bacteria to grow as a result. This can damage the enamel on your teeth and allow harmful bacteria to infiltrate the pores of your teeth, leeching nutrients and minerals from the teeth and causing white spots. Some tips to reduce your intake of these products include: Avoid sugary drinks, especially carbonated drinks like soda. Also be wary of candy and products that contain artificial sweeteners. If you need to sweeten something, opt for natural alternatives like honey or maple syrup, and use as little as possible. If you do consume anything that is high in sugar or carbohydrates, be sure to rinse your mouth with water immediately, then brush after about 30 minutes. In addition to remineralizing your teeth with home remedies or in-office professional treatments, another great way to prevent white spots is to eat foods that are heavy in teeth strengthening minerals. By consuming vitamin D- and calcium-rich foods like milk, cheese, and yogurt, your teeth and body will absorb nutrients that help make your teeth strong and prevent white spots. Also look for foods that are high in magnesium, like dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, fish, soybeans, and avocado, because magnesium helps the body absorb and retain more calcium. Staying hydrated helps your body perform at its best and it may also help prevent white spots. When your mouth is dry, the lack of saliva throws off the pH balance in your mouth and allows bacteria to grow and attack your teeth with their acid. Try to drink at least eight 8-oz (250-mL) glasses of water daily. Avoid hydrating with liquids like fruit juice, soda, or other beverages. If you do drink one of these damaging liquids, be sure to rinse your mouth with water or brush your teeth afterward. Add a few drops of lemon juice which can help promote saliva flow. Two of the most damaging substances you can introduce to your mouth are tobacco and caffeine. Caffeine is extremely acidic and damages the enamel on your teeth, allowing bacteria to enter the pores of your teeth and cause white spots and other decay. Smoking and chewing tobacco increase plaque and tartar build-up on your teeth, which can cause more damaged areas and white spot formation. Tobacco and caffeine will also stain your teeth, and any white spots you currently have will only appear more pronounced against the yellowing enamel. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary tells the main points of something in a shorter and simpler way. So, for this article, the summary would be: To prevent white spots on your teeth and keep them healthy, brush and floss regularly, be careful with the fluoride in your toothpaste, visit the dentist, eat healthy foods, avoid too much sugar, stay hydrated, and stay away from tobacco and caffeine."},{"prompt":"Q:Here's a question: What does living life too hard lead to?

Answer the following question: This article: In 1684, a council led by Enrique Enríquez de Guzmán, the governor of Guatemala, decided on the reduction of San Mateo Ixtatán and nearby Santa Eulalia, both within the colonial administrative district of the Corregimiento of Huehuetenango.On 29 January 1686, Captain Melchor Rodríguez Mazariegos, acting under orders from the governor, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán, where he recruited indigenous warriors from the nearby villages, 61 from San Mateo itself. It was believed by the Spanish colonial authorities that the inhabitants of San Mateo Ixtatán were friendly towards the still unconquered and fiercely hostile inhabitants of the Lacandon region, which included parts of what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas and the western part of the Petén Basin. To prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three of San Mateo's community leaders, named as Cristóbal Domingo, Alonso Delgado and Gaspar Jorge, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango. The governor himself arrived in San Mateo Ixtatán on 3 February, where Captain Rodríguez Mazariegos was already awaiting him. The governor ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region. The Spanish missionaries Fray de Rivas and Fray Pedro de la Concepción also remained in the town. Governor Enriquez de Guzmán subsequently left San Mateo Ixtatán for Comitán in Chiapas, to enter the Lacandon region via Ocosingo.In 1695, a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, Cobán and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán. Following the same route used in 1686, they managed on the way to recruit 200 indigenous Maya warriors from Santa Eulalia, San Juan Solomá and San Mateo itself.

Gyorgy Sandor Ligeti (; Hungarian: Ligeti Gyorgy Sandor, pronounced ['ligeti 'jorj 'Sa:ndor]; 28 May 1923 - 12 June 2006) was a Hungarian-Austrian composer of contemporary classical music. He has been described as \\"one of the most important avant-garde composers in the latter half of the twentieth century\\" and \\"one of the most innovative and influential among progressive figures of his time\\". Born in Transylvania, Romania, he lived in Hungary before emigrating to Austria in 1956, and became an Austrian citizen in 1968. In 1973 he became professor of composition at the Hamburg Hochschule fur Musik und Theater until he retired in 1989. Ligeti was born in 1923 at Dicsoszentmarton (which was renamed Tarnaveni in 1941), in the Romanian region of Transylvania to Dr. Sandor Ligeti and Dr. Ilona Somogyi. His family was Hungarian Jewish. He was the grandnephew of the violinist Leopold Auer and cousin of Hungarian philosopher Agnes Heller. Ligeti recalled that his first exposure to languages other than Hungarian came one day while listening to a conversation among the Romanian-speaking town police. Before that he had not known that other languages existed. He moved to Cluj with his family when he was six years old. He was not to return to the town of his birth until the 1990s. In 1940, Northern Transylvania was annexed by Hungary following the Second Vienna Award and Cluj became part of Hungary. In 1941 Ligeti received his initial musical training at the conservatory in Cluj, and during the summers privately with Pal Kadosa in Budapest. In 1944, Ligeti's education was interrupted when he was sent to a forced labor brigade by the Horthy regime. His brother, age 16, was deported to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp and both of his parents were sent to Auschwitz. His mother was the only other survivor of his immediate family. Following World War II, Ligeti returned to his studies in Budapest, Hungary, graduating in 1949 from the Franz Liszt Academy of Music. He studied under Pal Kadosa, Ferenc Farkas, Zoltan Kodaly and Sandor Veress. He went on to do ethnomusicological research into the Hungarian folk music of Transylvania. However, after a year he returned to Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest, this time as a teacher of harmony, counterpoint and musical analysis, a position he secured with the help of Kodaly and held between 1950 and 1956. As a young teacher, Ligeti took the unusual step of regularly attending the lectures of an older colleague, the conductor and musicologist Lajos Bardos, a conservative Christian whose circle represented for Ligeti a safe haven, and whose help and advice he later acknowledged in the prefaces to his own two harmony textbooks (1954 and 1956). However, communications between Hungary and the West by then had become difficult due to the restrictions of the communist government, and Ligeti and other artists were effectively cut off from recent developments outside the Eastern Bloc. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"What was Gyorgy Ligeti's educational background and how did World War II interrupt it?"},{"prompt":"Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person that Adolphe convinces to seize the opportunity to make money? Letty Strong was raised in a good family, but became pregnant and ran away from home.

Embittered, she taught Mickey to be street smart so he will never be taken advantage of like her. Fuzzy strongly disapproves of how she is raising her son. Now seven years old, Mickey skips school and does as he pleases. Meanwhile, Letty earns a living by entertaining buyers so they will give business to her friend Steve Karns.

These Olympic Games were an international multi-sport event that was celebrated as part of the modern Olympic movement. This question seeks to gather information about the geographic location that hosted the Olympic Games in 1936, which involved numerous athletes from different countries competing in various sporting events. Knowing the host city of this particular edition of the Summer Olympics can provide historical context and help understand the social, political, and cultural factors that may have influenced the events during that time. The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany, from August 1 to August 16, 1936. Berlin was selected as the host city during the 29th International Olympic Committee (IOC) Session in Barcelona, Spain, which took place from April 30 to May 4 in 1931. Berlin won the bid against Barcelona, which was also a candidate city for hosting the Games. These Olympics were marred by controversy due to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi government in Germany at that time. The Games became a platform for the Nazi regime to showcase German athletic prowess and promote their ideology of Aryan racial superiority. Many nations debated boycotting the Games, but most eventually decided to participate. Notable events from the 1936 Summer Olympics include the performance of African-American track and field athlete Jesse Owens. Owens won four gold medals in the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints, the long jump, and as a member of the 4x100-meter relay team. His victories challenged the Nazi ideology of Aryan superiority and served as a significant blow to Hitler's propaganda efforts. The 1936 Summer Olympics left a lasting impression on the world of sports, establishing various precedents and innovations that are still employed, such as the Olympic torch relay and the use of electronic timing devices. Furthermore, the Berlin Games highlighted the potential for the Olympics to be used as a political tool by host countries, an issue that continues to be relevant in contemporary times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Lake Island is an island on the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Cape Alava, in Clallam County, Washington, U.S., is the westernmost point in the contiguous 48 states, with a longitude of (during low tide and walking out to the west side of Tskawahyah Island). The westernmost point is located in Olympic National Park and the Makah Indian Reservation. Cape Alava is accessible via a 3-mile boardwalk hike from a ranger station in the park. Cape Alava Trail was designated a National Recreation Trail in 1981. - Flattery Rocks National Wildlife Refuge is the northernmost of the three refuges ( along with Quillayute Needles and Copalis ) which make up the Washington Maritime National Wildlife Refuge Complex , a group of 870 islands , rocks , and reefs extending for more than 100 miles along Washington 's coast from Cape Flattery to Copalis Beach . These islands are protected from human disturbance , yet are close to abundant ocean food sources . They are closed to the public , with wildlife observation only from boats and the mainland , and a 200 - yard buffer zone surrounding each island . They are a vital sanctuary where 14 species of seabirds nest and raise their young . During migration the total populations of seabirds , waterfowl , and shorebirds may exceed a million birds . Sea lions , harbor seals , sea otters , and whales may also be seen around the islands . The refuge is within the boundary of Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary and Olympic National Park , and is also incorporated into the Washington Islands Wilderness . The three agencies cooperate on research programs and other issues that may have impacts on the resources . - Cape Flattery is the northwesternmost point of the contiguous United States. It is in Clallam County, Washington on the Olympic Peninsula, where the Strait of Juan de Fuca joins the Pacific Ocean. It is also part of the Makah Reservation, and is the northern boundary of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. Cape Flattery can be reached from a short hike, most of which is boardwalked. The westernmost point in the contiguous United States is at Cape Alava, south of Cape Flattery in Olympic National Park. However, the westernmost tip of Cape Flattery is almost exactly as far west as Cape Alava, the difference being approximately 5 seconds of longitude, about , at high tide and somewhat more at low tide. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary is one of 14 marine sanctuaries administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce. It is located along the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state. The sanctuary was declared in 1994 and encompasses of the Pacific Ocean from Cape Flattery in the north, to the mouth of the Copalis River, a distance of about . Extending from the shore, it includes most of the continental shelf, as well as parts of three important submarine canyons, the Nitinat Canyon, the Quinault Canyon and the Juan de Fuca Canyon. For along the coast, the sanctuary shares stewardship with the Olympic National Park. The sanctuary overlays the Flattery Rocks, Quillayute Needles, and Copalis Rock National Wildlife Refuges. - Olympic National Park is a United States national park located in the state of Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. The park has four basic regions: the Pacific coastline, alpine areas, the west side temperate rainforest and the forests of the drier east side. Within the park there are three distinct ecosystems which are sub-alpine forest and wildflower meadow, temperate forest, and the rugged Pacific Shore. These three different ecosystems are in pristine condition and have outstanding scenery. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - Makah Reservation is an Indian reservation of the Makah Native Americans located on the northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula in Clallam County, Washington, United States. The northern boundary of the reservation is the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The western boundary is the Pacific Ocean. It has a land area of and a 2000 census resident population of 1,356 persons. Its largest community is Neah Bay. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - The Olympic Peninsula is the large arm of land in western Washington that lies across Puget Sound from Seattle. It is bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, the north by the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the east by Hood Canal. Cape Alava, the westernmost point in the contiguous United States, and Cape Flattery, the northwesternmost point, are on the peninsula. Comprising about 3600 square miles, the Olympic Peninsula contained many of the last unexplored places in the contiguous United States. It remained largely unmapped until Arthur Dodwell and Theodore Rixon mapped most of its topography and timber resources between 1898 and 1900. - Ioannis Phokas (Greek: ), better known by the Spanish transcription of his name, Juan de Fuca (born 1536 on the Ionian island of Cefalonia; died there 1602), was a Greek maritime pilot in the service of the King of Spain, Philip II. He is best known for his claim to have explored the Strait of Anián, now known as the Strait of Juan de Fuca, between Vancouver Island (now part of British Columbia, Canada) and the Olympic Peninsula (northwestern Washington State, United States). - The Strait of Juan de Fuca (officially named Juan de Fuca Strait in Canada) is a large body of water about long that is the Salish Sea's outlet to the Pacific Ocean. The international boundary between Canada and the United States runs down the center of the Strait. - Clallam County is a county in the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2010 census, the population was 71,404. The county seat and largest city is Port Angeles. The name is a Klallam word for \\"the strong people\\". The county was formed on April 26, 1854. Located on the Olympic Peninsula, it is south from the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which forms the CanadaUS border, as British Columbia's Vancouver Island is across the strait. - The contiguous United States consists of the 48 adjoining U.S. states plus Washington, D.C. (federal district), on the continent of North America. The term excludes the non-contiguous states of Alaska and Hawaii and all off-shore United States territories and possessions, which include American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. - A cay (or ), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef. Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans (including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef). - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - An islet is a very small island. Types. As suggested by its origin as \\"islette\\", an Old French diminutive of \\"isle\\", use of the term implies small size, but little attention is given to drawing an upper limit on its applicability.

Question: John was combining chemicals in his lab one day. If he were to decrease the temperature in his lab, what would happen to the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments increase or decrease? Paragraph : Chemical weathering increases as: Temperature increases: Chemical reactions proceed more rapidly at higher temperatures. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be concluded that the rate of chemical reactions generally increases with higher temperatures. Therefore, if John were to decrease the temperature in his lab, it would likely lead to a decrease in the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments. Chemical reactions are influenced by several factors, and temperature is a crucial one. Higher temperatures cause particles to move faster and more energetically. This increased movement and energy give the reacting molecules a higher likelihood of colliding, overcoming the energy barrier, and successfully reacting. In the given scenario, John is working with chemicals in his lab, and the paragraph emphasizes that chemical weathering and reactions proceed more rapidly at higher temperatures. By lowering the lab's temperature, John would reduce the kinetic energy of the particles involved in the chemical reactions. Consequently, the frequency of successful collisions between reacting molecules would decrease, slowing down the rate of the reactions overall. In summary, if John decides to decrease the temperature in his lab, he could expect the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments to decrease as well. This is due to the fact that chemical reactions tend to be more rapid at higher temperatures, with the increased particle energy leading to more frequent and successful collisions between molecules."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was trying to land on their feet again? ?

Q:What is the missing first step of the following process: - The can is taken to a recycling center - Melted down along with other cans - The melted metal is turned into bars - Becomes material for other products. A:","completion":"The missing first step of the given recycling process is: \\"Collection and sorting of used aluminum cans.\\" To provide a detailed explanation of the complete process, let's go through each step: 1. Collection and sorting of used aluminum cans: This is the initial stage where used aluminum cans are gathered from various sources like homes, restaurants, offices, and recycling containers placed in public areas. The collected cans are transported to a recycling center or a materials recovery facility (MRF), where they are sorted based on their material type. Here, aluminum cans are separated from other recyclables like plastic, glass, and paper using a combination of manual labor and automated machinery such as eddy current separators, which use magnetic fields to repel and separate aluminum cans from the rest. 2. The can is taken to a recycling center: Once the aluminum cans are sorted, they are sent to a recycling center or an aluminum processing facility. Here, they are prepared for the recycling process by removing any contaminants or non-aluminum materials, such as labels, adhesives, or even leftover liquids. 3. Melted down along with other cans: The sorted and cleaned aluminum cans are then fed into a melting furnace, where they are melted along with other aluminum materials at high temperatures of around 1300-1500°F (700-800°C). Melting aluminum uses only about 5% of the energy needed to produce aluminum from raw materials, thereby conserving energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 4. The melted metal is turned into bars: Once the cans have been melted down into a molten aluminum alloy, any impurities or unwanted elements are removed using various refining techniques. The purified molten metal is then poured into molds or casts and allowed to cool and solidify into bars, ingots, or billets. These aluminum forms, also commonly called \\"secondary aluminum,\\" are now ready to be turned into new products. 5. Becomes material for other products: The aluminum bars, ingots, or billets are transported to manufacturers who turn them into new aluminum products using different processes such as rolling, extrusion, or casting. These recycled aluminum materials can be used to make a wide range of products including new aluminum cans, automotive parts, building materials, and even electronic devices. Since aluminum can be recycled indefinitely without losing its properties, this helps in conserving resources and reducing the overall environmental impact of our consumption habits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Comparing the subjects: - Both subjects talk about Malaysians who convert to Islam, with the distinction being \\"other\\" (potentially referring to non-Malay) and \\"non-Malay,\\" which in this case would mean the same thing. 3. Identifying the key actions: - Sentence 1: \\"can lay claim to Bumiputra privileges\\" - Sentence 2: \\"can claim Bumiputra privileges\\" 4. Comparing the actions: - Both actions involve claiming Bumiputra privileges, with the phrasing slightly different but meaning the same thing. 5. Comparing additional conditions: - Sentence 1: \\"provided he meets the non-Malay conditions\\" - Sentence 2: \\"provided he meets the other conditions\\" 6. Analyzing conditions: - Both conditions involve meeting certain requirements, but Sentence 1 explicitly states the conditions are \\"non-Malay,\\" while Sentence 2 says \\"other.\\" Although it's likely that \\"other conditions\\" refers to the same \\"non-Malay conditions,\\" it's not explicitly stated.

The industry directly supports 228,000 jobs -- or 6.6 percent of employment in the country. According to data from the Tunisian Tourism Ministry, however, the numbers of visitors have been falling – from 6.9 million visitors in 2010, to just over 6 million people in 2014.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Senate Blocks Bill to Eliminate Tax Breaks for Oil Companies WASHINGTON — The Senate on Tuesday blocked a Democratic proposal to strip the five leading oil companies of tax breaks that backers of the measure said were unfairly padding industry profits while consumers were struggling with high gas prices. Senate pages delivered charts about tax breaks for oil companies to the chamber on Tuesday. Democrats sought to eliminate five tax breaks, producing an estimated 21 billion over 10 years. Despite falling eight votes short of the 60 needed to move ahead with the bill, top Democrats said they would insist that eliminating the tax breaks to generate billions of dollars in revenue must be part of any future agreement to raise the federal debt limit. “We have to stand up and say, ‘Enough is enough,’ ” said Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota. “While oil prices are gouging the pocketbooks of American families, these companies are on a pace for a record profit this year.” The defeat on Tuesday was expected since most Republicans were dug in against what they saw as a politically motivated plan in advance of the 2012 elections. Democrats had hoped that directing the savings toward the deficit would make it harder for Republicans to reject it. In the 52-to-48 vote, 3 Democrats joined 45 Republicans in opposing the bill, which was supported by the Obama administration and fiscal watchdog groups that saw the tax help for the oil industry as wasteful. Forty-eight Democrats, two independents and two Republicans backed it. Energy-state Democrats criticized the initiative, saying it was misdirected and would do nothing to ease gasoline prices and could cost American jobs. “Why are we harming an industry — five large oil and gas companies that work internationally, that employ 9.2 million people in the United States directly?” asked Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana. “Why are we doing it?” Republicans, who on Wednesday will push their own plan to open more areas to oil drilling and speed government permits, said the Democratic proposal would contribute to higher prices and increase dependence on foreign oil even though a recent Congressional Research Service report predicted any impact on prices would be negligible. “Clearly, this is not a serious effort to address the price of gas at the pump,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. Under the proposal, Democrats would have eliminated five different tax breaks enjoyed by the multinational oil companies, producing an estimated 21 billion over 10 years. More than 12 billion would have come from eliminating a domestic manufacturing tax deduction for the big oil companies, and 6 billion would have been generated by ending their deductions for taxes paid to foreign governments. Critics suggest that the companies have been able to disguise what should be foreign royalty payments as taxes to reduce their tax liability. The bill would also deny the companies the ability to deduct some intangible drilling and development costs. The bill would have applied to BP, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips. The White House lent strong support to the effort though the president in the past has recommended applying revenue generated by ending the tax breaks to the development of alternative energy sources. “The administration believes that, at a time when it is working with the Congress on proposals to reduce federal deficits, the nation cannot afford to maintain these wasteful subsidies,” the White House said. Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, portrayed the vote as one that revealed the values of Republicans. “Instead of defending oil companies, Republicans should be defending the American taxpayer,” Mr. Reid said. “We believe this is the kind of wasteful spending that will lead to an agreement on reducing the debt.” While most Republicans have opposed eliminating the tax breaks as a back-door tax increase, some, including Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Budget Committee chairman, have indicated a willingness to consider the idea. Also on Tuesday, Senate Democrats wrote to the Federal Trade Commission seeking an inquiry into whether domestic oil refiners had reduced production to drive down the gasoline supply and drive up prices. “This is just another piece of the puzzle that we need to get at as we try to take away taxpayer subsidies to Big Oil and hold Big Oil accountable for whatever may be going on in the supply chain that is hurting the families that I work for,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri.","completion":"The US Senate has blocked a Democratic proposal to end tax breaks for the five leading oil companies, preventing an estimated 21 billion in revenue generation over a decade. The proposal aimed to eliminate five tax breaks, with critics arguing that these breaks were only bolstering profits within the oil industry while consumers continued to struggle with high fuel prices. Despite not receiving the required 60 votes, top Democrats have insisted that removing tax breaks will be a vital aspect of any future agreements to raise the federal debt limit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Leon Battista Alberti, who elaborates on the ideas of Vitruvius in his treatise, De Re Aedificatoria, saw beauty primarily as a matter of proportion, although ornament also played a part. For Alberti, the rules of proportion were those that governed the idealised human figure, the Golden mean. The most important aspect of beauty was therefore an inherent part of an object, rather than something applied superficially; and was based on universal, recognisable truths.

The sentence \\"Esitän mietinnön hyväksymistä\\" can be translated into English as \\"I propose the adoption of the report\\" or \\"I put forward the approval of the report.\\" It appears that this sentence is used in a formal context, most likely during a meeting or discussion where a person or a group presents a report with their findings, recommendations, or other information. The person who utters the sentence suggests that the report should be approved or accepted by others in the meeting or the group. This proposal may then be discussed among the relevant stakeholders, and they may provide their opinions, objections, or suggestions in response. The process of adopting a report typically entails a few steps: 1. The presenter(s) or author(s) of the report shares the content and any background information relevant to the report with the rest of the group. 2. The group members have the opportunity to ask questions and discuss the key points and findings of the report. 3. Amendments or changes to the report may be proposed and discussed. 4. Once everyone has had a chance to express their thoughts, a vote or decision on the adoption of the report may be carried out. 5. The report is considered \\"adopted\\" if the majority of the group agrees to its approval. In summary, the Finnish sentence \\"Esitän mietinnön hyväksymistä\\" translates to, \\"I propose the adoption of the report\\" or \\"I put forward the approval of the report\\" in English. It is used in a formal setting when someone is suggesting that a report should be approved or accepted by a group or committee. The process of adopting a report typically encompasses several discussion and decision-making steps before reaching a conclusion."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: IMAGINE if there was a device that could do everything for you - wake you up every morning, chat with you and type your e-mails. The piece of technology in question would be smart, able to tell you about the weather and where the nearest restaurants are. The good thing is you no longer need to wonder, because something like this already exists. And its name is Siri. Siri is a voice recognition application designed for Apple products and the concept has been around for almost a year. When Siri first came out it could only speak English, but now it has \\"learned\\" lots of new languages, including Chinese, Cantonese and Taiwanese, reported The Wall Street Journal. So, you can give it orders in your mother tongue. But how could a cell phone or a computer \\"hear\\" what you are saying and understand it? This is all because of voice recognition technology. When you speak, your voice creates vibrations in the air - a bit like waves in the water when you throw a rock into the lake. The microphone receives the vibrations and the computer changes them into digital data that is then divided into many parts. They are analyzed one by one to see what pronunciations each part stands for. The computer then puts these pronunciations together into possible words according to its built-in dictionary. But figuring out the words is far from enough; building words into meaningful sentences is the most difficult part. The computer has to compare what it hears to a large library of known phrases and sentences to determine what the user is saying. However, people don't always talk in the most standard way and sometimes make grammatical mistakes. This is why traditional voice recognition software always requires you to remember keywords and to speak in a certain way. Fortunately, Siri isn't like that. It's not just \\"voice recognition\\"; it's \\"natural language understanding (NLU)\\". You can ask it things like \\"Do I need an umbrella today?\\" and it will know that you are asking about the weather, according to ABC News. \\"The key thing is NLU -...

It was created in 1395, when it included twenty-six towns and the wide rural area of the middle Padan Plain east of the hills of Montferrat. During much of its existence, it was wedged between Savoy to the west, Venice to the east, the Swiss Confederacy to the north, and separated from the Mediterranean by Genoa to the south. The Duchy eventually fell to Habsburg Austria with the Treaty of Baden (1714), concluding the War of the Spanish Succession. The Duchy remained an Austrian possession until 1796, when a French army under Napoleon Bonaparte conquered it, and it ceased to exist a year later as a result of the Treaty of Campo Formio, when Austria ceded it to the new Cisalpine Republic. - The War of the League of Cambrai, sometimes known as the War of the Holy League and by several other names, was a major conflict in the Italian Wars. The main participants of the war, fought from 1508 to 1516, were France, the Papal States and the Republic of Venice; they were joined, at various times, by nearly every significant power in Western Europe, including Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, Scotland, the Duchy of Milan, Florence, the Duchy of Ferrara and Swiss mercenaries. - The Italian Wars, often referred to as the Great Italian Wars or the Great Wars of Italy and sometimes as the HabsburgValois Wars or the Renaissance Wars, were a series of conflicts from 1494 to 1559 that involved, at various times, most of the city-states of Italy, the Papal States, the Republic of Venice, most of the major states of Western Europe (France, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, and Scotland) as well as the Ottoman Empire. Originally arising from dynastic disputes over the Duchy of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples, the wars rapidly became a general struggle for power and territory among their various participants, and were marked with an increasing number of alliances, counter-alliances, and betrayals. - Don Pedro Navarro , Count of Oliveto ( c. 1460 -- 28 August 1528 ) was a Spanish military engineer and general who participated in the War of the League of Cambrai . At the Battle of Ravenna in 1512 he commanded the Spanish and Papal infantry , but was captured by the French . In the service of Francis I of France , he would supervise the French crossing of the Alps before the Battle of Novara in 1513 .

When Keith died of a drug overdose, he was replaced on vocals by Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Watched over by road-dog Hughie and Girl Friday Karen (Juliet Aubrey), they soldiered on until the disastrous appearance at the open-air Wisbech (U.K.) Rock Festival, when lightning struck the stage during their opening number.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Just days before the Florida State Seminoles play for the ACC football championship, star quarterback Jameis Winston is appearing before a panel that can decide whether he will continue as a student at the university. It's been almost two years since the Heisman Trophy winner was accused of sexually assaulting a then-FSU student. Winston was not arrested in connection with the alleged December 2012 incident, but he still could be charged by his university with a code-of-conduct violation for sexual misconduct, depending on the results of the school's investigation. He could face a wide range of sanctions if he is found in violation -- from a reprimand or counseling to probation, suspension or expulsion. \\"This is the day that Mr. Winston has been desperately trying to avoid for two years,\\" John Clune, one of the attorneys representing the woman who accused Winston, told CNN on Tuesday. \\"This courageous young woman finally gets the chance to stand up for herself and against Mr. Winston and big-time college sports, which has long run over the rights and protection of women on campus. FSU breaks silence on Jameis Winston case. \\"Neither Jameis Winston nor his lawyer can stop what is coming.\\" Winston categorically denied the allegations in a statement. \\"I did not rape or sexually assault [the accuser]. I did not create a hostile, intimidating or offensive environment in the short period of time that we were together. [The accuser] had the capacity to consent to having sex with me and she repeatedly did so by her conduct and her verbal expressions.\\" He goes on to say, \\"Rape is a vicious crime. The only thing as vicious as rape is falsely accusing someone of rape.\\" It seems improbable that a decision will be known before Saturday, when Florida State -- which has won 28 games in a row -- plays Georgia Tech with the ACC championship and a bid to the four-team College Football Playoff on the line. According to the university, a formal decision letter will be sent within 10 class days from the conclusion of the hearing. Florida State's investigation was launched under Title IX, which requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual assault, even if criminal charges are never filed. The hearing has been delayed twice. Tim Jansen, who was Winston's attorney in the criminal investigation, has said Winston had consensual sex with the woman. According to police documents, the accuser said Winston raped her after she had been drinking with friends at a bar in Tallahassee. She said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar. The accuser said she did not remember little of what happened afterward, but that she did remember being in a ground-floor apartment where a man took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections. The accuser reported the alleged assault to campus police that night. A month later, in January 2013, she said the man who allegedly assaulted her was Winston. FSU said in October that Winston informed the athletics department of the allegation after he was contacted by a Tallahassee police detective. The university said the athletics department did not initially file a report with the school's Title IX administrator because no charges were filed and because other players who were with Winston said there was no sexual assault. A Title IX investigation was opened after media inquiries, and after law enforcement had referred the case to the state attorney's office. Tallahassee interim Police Chief Tom Coe said last year that the woman \\"broke off contact\\" with investigators in February 2013 and didn't want to go forward with the case. The woman's family says a detective warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a \\"big football town\\" and that life could be miserable if she pursued the case. In December 2013, the Florida state attorney for the judicial circuit that includes Leon County and Tallahassee, announced that investigators did not have probable cause to arrest Winston. Later that month, Winston won the Heisman, and in January 2014 the Seminoles defeated Auburn to win the BCS national title. Winston spent the spring playing for the Florida State baseball team, but off the field he continued to make headlines for the wrong reasons. In April, Winston was accused of shoplifting crab legs from a Publix grocery in Tallahassee. Police said that Winston said he forgot to pay. As part of a civil citation for alleged shoplifting -- an alternative to criminal prosecution for first-time, nonviolent offenses in Leon County -- Winston was not arrested but was ordered to serve at least 20 hours of community service, authorities said. In September, Winston was suspended for the Seminoles' game against Clemson for yelling a sexually explicit remark near the school's student union. Florida State initially announced Winston would be suspended for the first half of the game after the sexual remark. However, Athletics Director Stan Wilcox increased the punishment the day before the game after hearing eyewitness accounts that differed from Winston's initial version, a source close to the situation told CNN's Rachel Nichols. In October, ESPN reported that more than 2,000 authenticated autographs by Winston were discovered online. However, Florida State said its athletic compliance department has not found evidence Winston accepted payment.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Nine Inch Nails, an industrial rock band fronted by Trent Reznor, has toured all over the world since its creation in 1988. While Reznor—the only official member until adding Atticus Ross in 2016—controls its creative and musical direction in the studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza 1991 and 2008, and many other one-off performances including the MTV Video Music Awards. Prior to their 2013 tour, the band had played 938 gigs.Nine Inch Nails' live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart. Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist Alessandro Cortini said that \\"if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity\\".The only constant member of the live band is Reznor. Live Nine Inch Nails performances are typically accompanied by lighting, stage, and video projection effects. Since 1999, the visual design components of live shows have been curated by Reznor with Rob Sheridan. Three tours have been chronicled on live albums and tour documentaries. Critical and commercial response to Nine Inch Nails live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points. Reznor decided in 2008 to cease touring with the band after a 2009 farewell tour. The band resumed touring in 2013, with the group planning a set of concerts in the U.S. beginning September 28.

Mr Zabel briefly wore the red campaign cap into his courtroom the day after the 2016 US presidential election. The Ontario Judicial Council received 81 complaints about his conduct. \\"I'm not a Trump supporter,\\" Mr Zabel told the four-person disciplinary panel looking into those complaints on Wednesday. \\"I find it very difficult to find the words to express my profound regret for what I did that day.\\" Mr Zabel described to the panel how he came to don the Donald Trump campaign hat in the Hamilton courtroom on 9 November in a fug of fatigue after staying up late to watch the results. He said he had ordered five of the caps online in June thinking it would be \\"entertaining to have some historic memorabilia\\" from the election. Mr Zabel, who appeared sombre and was wearing a charcoal pinstriped suit and patterned blue tie, described Mr Trump's win as \\"an almost surreal experience\\" and thought wearing the cap would \\"add a little humour\\" and \\"lighten the proceedings\\" in the courtroom that day. He walked in wearing the cap and then placed it on the dais until morning recess, when he returned it to his office. Returning to court briefly in the afternoon, an attorney quipped to him: \\"You lost your hat\\". He replied: \\"Brief appearance for the hat. P***** off the rest of the judges because they all voted for Hillary. I was the only Trump supporter up there but that's OK\\". A few days later, after the incident made headlines, he apologised in open court and said donning the hat was not meant as an endorsement of the US president's policies. Complainants, including the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund and 27 law professors from the University of Windsor - Mr Zabel's alma mater -say the veteran judged breached principles of impartiality and objectivity and broke rules regarding the prohibition on partisan political activity. Multiple complaints received by the council noted that the public apology he made on 15 November regarding his conduct was not consistent with the comment he made in court that afternoon about being a Trump supporter. Mr Zabel said it was a poorly worded comment about how he had come to believe that Mr Trump could win in the weeks before the election - a prediction his fellow judges did not share. On cross examination, presenting counsel Linda Rothstein pushed Mr Zabel on his choice of words on 9 November, noted the Trump hat could be tied to racism and bigotry, and asked whether he considered that many people felt devastated by the election results. \\"I wasn't thinking it through,\\" Mr Zabel conceded. Mr Zabel also received 62 character references and letters from colleagues and others expressing their support for the judge and praising his integrity. Ontario court justice Marjoh Agro appeared as a character witness for her colleague on Wednesday. \\"I remember that day well because quite frankly I deeply regret not ripping that hat off his head,\\" she said. Mr Zabel stopped being assigned cases on 21 December, which Ms Agro said has caused \\"a lot of disruption\\" at the courthouse and has strained resources. She said she retains confidence in him as a judge. \\"I didn't have concerns then and I don't have them now, other than the misjudgement of wearing a stupid hat into court,\\" she said. The Ontario Judicial Council investigates complaints about the conduct of provincially appointed judges. Mr Zabel faces a number of possible sanctions, including being issued a warning or reprimand and suspension. The panel could also recommend to the attorney general that the judge be removed from office. The disciplinary panel reserved judgment on Wednesday. Summary:","completion":"A judge named Mr. Zabel from Ontario wore a red Trump campaign hat in his courtroom after the 2016 US presidential election, and now he may be in trouble because of it. The court received 81 complaints about his actions. He said it was not to show support for Trump, but to add some humor and lighten the mood in the courtroom. Some people think he broke the rules about being fair and not favoring a political side. The court is deciding what to do and might give him a warning or even remove him from his job as a judge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Perform the subtraction: 14 - 34 = -20 Now the equation is: 4*t = -20 Step 3: Solve for t by dividing both sides of the equation by 4.

Write an article with the title: \\"Dangerous 'Bachelorette' date sends one man to the hospital - AOL.com\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Dangerous 'Bachelorette' date sends one man to the hospital - AOL.com In a shocking twist this season on ABC's hit reality series, \\"The Bachelorette,\\" an extreme outdoor date ended in an unexpected and terrifying trip to the hospital for one contestant. The show, known for its adrenaline-pumping group dates and high-stakes romantic gestures, put the lives of the cast members at risk during what was supposed to be an exciting day out in nature. The Bachelorette, Sarah Davis, and the remaining bachelors embarked on a day of adventure, filled with various extreme outdoor activities designed to bring out their competitive sides and test their physical and emotional limits. What began as an exhilarating challenge of stamina and sincerity quickly turned into a terrifying experience for all parties involved. The incident occurred during the second part of the group date, where the men were divided into two teams to compete in a series of challenging outdoor activities. The competition, intended to demonstrate strength, endurance and teamwork, included GPS-guided off-road biking, rappelling down a steep cliff face and white water rafting on a furious river. Everything seemed to be going well for both teams, with each group of bachelors displaying their skills and prowess, keen on impressing Sarah and securing a coveted rose. However, disaster struck when the blue team, led by 28-year-old personal trainer Bryce Johnson, reached the white water rafting stage. Despite receiving safety briefings and being equipped with flotation vests and helmets, the blue team's raft capsized after being hit by a rogue wave. Although most of the men were able to swim to shore or cling to the overturned raft and await rescue, Bryce was carried away by the strong current, tumbling under a big rock, where his ankle got lodged between submerged boulders. Sarah, after quickly realizing the seriousness of the situation, pleaded with the production crew and other bachelors to help rescue Bryce, who was becoming increasingly exhausted and panicked. Fortunately, several staff members and contestants, including Sarah herself, plunged into the icy waters to save Bryce. After what felt like an eternity, they were able to free Bryce's ankle and transport him to the riverbank. On the shore, it became evident that his ordeal had resulted in a severe trauma-induced injury. As Bryce lay on the ground in immense pain, medical personnel from the show assessed his condition and promptly called for an emergency helicopter to transport him to the nearest hospital. News of the accident sent shockwaves through the \\"Bachelorette\\" community, with fans demanding answers about the safety protocols followed by the show's producers and questioning the risk factors associated with these high-intensity dates. While previous seasons of \\"The Bachelorette\\" have seen injuries stemming from light-hearted games, this is the first time a contestant was put in a life-threatening situation, prompting discussions on whether the show needs stricter safety regulations. After receiving treatment at the hospital, Bryce was left with a fractured ankle, several cuts and bruises, a mild concussion, and a harrowing tale of survival. In a heartfelt social media post, he expressed his gratitude to everyone involved in his rescue, especially his fellow contestants and Sarah, who displayed unwavering bravery during the incident. While the event has fueled ongoing safety concerns, it has also brought some cast members closer together, and particularly fortified the connection between Sarah and Bryce. As the show continues, viewers can only wait and see if this near-death experience will alter the dynamics of the competition and ultimately guide Sarah towards finding true love."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sound of the tickling clock was audible in the room because the Choose your answer from: 1). room is loud.. 2). clock is loud..","completion":"2). clock is loud.. The sentence ends with \\"clock is loud\\" because it implies that the tickling sound of the clock can be heard clearly in the room due to the clock's loudness. The sound of the tickling clock was audible in the room because the clock is loud. In this context, using \\"room is loud\\" would suggest that a noisy room is making it possible to hear the clock, which seems contradictory and doesn't meaningfully explain why the clock's sound can be easily heard. On the other hand, saying \\"the clock is loud\\" indicates that the tickling sound of the clock dominates the room's soundscape, allowing it to be clearly audible, despite any potential background noise. A loud clock could have various reasons for its distinct loudness. It could be due to the design and materials used in its construction, the clock's age, or the way it has been maintained. Some clocks are intentionally designed to be louder, like old-fashioned alarm clocks or grandfather clocks, where the ticking sound is part of their charm and character. In other cases, a clock may become louder as internal components wear down or become misaligned, leading to a louder ticking sound. Using \\"the clock is loud\\" as the sentence ending reinforces the idea that the tickling sound is noticeable and distinct, making it an ideal conclusion for this sentence.

While some of this weight is actual body mass, a lot of it is excess water. Once your body has rid itself of this excess water, it is normal for the rate of weight loss to slow down significantly. Track your progress and ask yourself: has my weight loss really stopped, or just slowed? Experts agree that an ideal rate for safe, lasting weight loss is one to two pounds per week, so perhaps your plateau isn't a plateau after all! Maybe you were very diligent about counting calories at the beginning, or maybe you were able to lose weight initially without monitoring your food intake that closely. In either case, you may be consuming more calories that you realize, and carefully tracking your intake using a food diary or one of the many free calorie counter websites and apps can help you identify exactly how much you are eating and when. Once you have a good handle on what you are consuming, you can start to look for problem areas and make adjustments If you have been very active, it's also possible you haven't been eating enough calories. If you are working out, your body will require more food. If you restrict yourself thinking that you will lose weight faster, you will actually cause your body to hold on to the weight you currently hold. As your body gets smaller, it will burn fewer calories and you will need to eat less and less to maintain the calorie deficit that leads to weight loss. If you have not done so lately, enter your weight and activity level into a calorie counter to get an up-to-date number for the number of calories you need. Most experts recommend a calorie deficit of 500 calories a day to achieve gradual, lasting weight loss. If the calculator tells you that you require 2200 calories per day, you should try to consume around 1700 calories per day to lose a pound per week. Have you been exercising consistently? Do you do the same kind of workout every day? Are you doing any kind of resistance training? Lastly, are you relying on the calorie counter on the elliptical machine at the gym to tell you how many calories you actually burned? Think about ways you can change up or improve your exercise routine. Finally, know that the calorie counters on gym machines can be highly unreliable, so if you've been using them to budget your calories, you may have been led astray. Elliptical machines are the worst offenders for over-estimating caloric burn. Track the amount of time you work out and the intensity, and use an online exercise calculator to get a better idea of how many calories you actually burned. Your body can get used to doing the same activities if you don't change up your workout routine from time to time. If you try something new, you may be engaging different muscles and burning calories in a new way that your body isn't used to, causing you to lose weight. The number on your scale may not be budging, but there may be other evidence that your body is still changing for the better. Do your clothes fit better? Are your arms bulking up? If you are putting on new muscle, your body will shrink even as the number on the scale stays the same. Better yet, that new muscle will burn more calories than fat, so your weight loss will probably pick up again soon. Don't weigh yourself too often. Weight fluctuates due to a variety of factors and it can be misleading. Once a week is more than enough. Try to keep your weigh in around the same day and time each week. Be patient and remember that not all plateaus are created equal. If you are making progress in other areas, you may just need to wait another week for the number on the scale to start falling again. If you've analyzed all the possibilities and tried everything, but still can't get your weight loss back on track, schedule an appointment with your doctor. She might have some additional ideas for you, and can also order blood work to check for a hormone imbalance. You may be suffering from an undiagnosed disorder such as thyroid disease, insulin resistance, or polycystic ovary disease that is preventing you from losing weight.","completion":"This article discusses the common experience of weight loss plateaus, suggesting that individuals track their progress, monitor calorie intake, adjust their exercise routines, consider factors like muscle gain and weight fluctuations, and consult a doctor if needed to ensure a safe and lasting weight loss journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Have a plan in place to get your brand name in as many stores and in front of as many people as possible. Depending on the product or service you’re offering, you might want to consider taking out ads online, in newspapers, in magazines, and wherever you might find new customers. Apply your branding, including your visual brand and brand messages, to all of your materials—from packaging, signage, and stationery, to your website and marketing materials. Don’t be shy about boldly branding your products and displaying them in as many venues as possible. You want your brand to be everywhere people look. Advertise your brand in unexpected places. Radio advertisements, employee uniforms, and freebies with logos (such as tissues or pens) are all relatively inexpensive ways to promote your brand. See if you can get publicity from a local newspaper, TV station or blog who will review your product or service. Social media is one of the best ways to build a brand these days. Get basic social media accounts and update them regularly with pictures, deals, and other information about your company. Find things that are related and appeal to your customers and give them the chance to interact. For example, if you're a travel company, post a picture of a beautiful location with a message something like: \\"Counting down the weeks to summer vacation and some time to unwind! Where do you want to travel this year?\\" Do not become spam. Avoid constantly pushing your brand in an annoying way or without context or to people that have no interest. Stay out of your customer's recycle bins. Be real and conversational, not a metaphorical sleazy car salesman. This is the age of the Internet and social media, so having a website is central to building a brand. It's fine to base your business in the flesh and traditional media, but if you don't at least have a website, you'll be seen as old-fashioned and inaccessible. Hire a professional or use a template and get a nice looking website. This should, at a minimum, discuss what your brand is about, where your offices can be found, what your hours are, and how you can be contacted. Use your site as an opportunity to tell your story proudly. People have an easier time understanding something that fits into a story, and they'll especially identify with things that let them feel like they're a part of that story. Give your customers a story that they can be a part of if you want to build your brand into a big name. Publish it on your website’s “about” page or distribute it in your publicity materials. For example, in the '80s and '90s, Microsoft painted themselves as a company that pulled themselves up by their bootstraps in order to become the most innovative and effective product in their field. This resonated with business-oriented individuals, who wanted to see their own lives in the same way and who could feel apart of that spirit of greatness by buying Microsoft products. Having an in-person presence helps to build trust and spread the word about your brand. Throw events, attend events put on by others, do volunteer work, and be civically active. This is a great way for your customers and potential customers to see what your brand stands for. Street fairs and other daytime events often provide opportunities for businesses to set up a table and hand out information. Take advantage of this opportunity to forge bonds with people in your community who could potentially be customers. Giving back to your community through donations and sponsorships is another good way to get your brand out there. You could sponsor a little league team or a girl scout troop to build up your community presence. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article would be: To effectively promote your brand, have a comprehensive plan that includes advertising through various channels such as online, newspapers, and magazines.

News article: America marks 15-year anniversary of 9/11 attacks Across the country, millions of Americans will pause Sunday to mark and reflect upon the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. Nearly 3,000 people died that day when Al Qaeda terrorists slammed hijacked planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field near Shanksville, Pa. It was the deadliest terror attack on American soil. The 15th anniversary arrives in a country caught up in a combustible political campaign and keenly focused on political, economic and social fissures. But the nation tries to put partisan politics on hold on the anniversary. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump plan to attend the anniversary ceremony at the World Trade Center. Neither candidate is expected to make public remarks. Politicians may attend, but haven't been allowed to read names or deliver remarks since 2011. Clinton and Trump are following a custom of halting television ads that day. At the White House, President Barack Obama will observe a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. ET, the time when the first airplane slammed into the World Trade Center's North Tower. Afterward, Obama will address a memorial service at the Pentagon. Hundreds of people also are expected at a ceremony at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville. In Lower Manhattan, organizers of the memorial ceremony at the former Ground Zero — now the site of the rebuilt World Trade Center — have added music and readings to mark the milestone year. But they are keeping close to what are now traditions: moments of silence and tolling bells, an apolitical atmosphere and the hourslong reading of the names of the dead. \\"This idea of physical transformation is so real here,\\" Sept. 11 memorial President Joe Daniels said. But on this Sept. 11 itself, \\"bringing the focus back to why we did all this — which is to honor those that were lost — is something very intentional.\\" The simple, reverential observance may be the norm now, but city officials fielded about 4,500 suggestions — including a Broadway parade honoring rescue workers and a one-minute blackout of all of Manhattan — while planning the first ceremony in 2002. Financial and other hurdles delayed the redevelopment of the Trade Center site early on, but now the 9/11 museum, three of four currently planned skyscrapers, an architecturally adventuresome transportation hub and shopping concourse and other features stand at the site. A design for a long-stalled, 250 million performing arts center was unveiled Thursday. Around the Trade Center, lower Manhattan now has dozens of new hotels and eateries, 60,000 more residents and ever-more visitors than before 9/11. Meanwhile, the crowd has thinned somewhat at the anniversary ceremony in recent years, although over 1,000 survivors, recovery workers, victims' relatives and dignitaries attended last year. But there's been no sustained talk of curtailing the ceremony. Organizers evaluate every year whether to make changes, Daniels said, \\"and every time the answer, thus far, has been it's so special for family members, and it's important for the nation.\\" The Associated Press contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article highlight how Americans paused on Sunday to mark and reflect upon the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, which resulted in the death of nearly 3,000 people and became the deadliest terror attack on American soil. The anniversary sheds light on a nation focused on political, economic, and social divisions. However, partisan politics were set aside for the day as both Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump attended the World Trade Center ceremony without making public remarks, in line with custom. The article mentions President Barack Obama observing a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. ET and later addressing a memorial service at the Pentagon. It also discusses the memorial ceremony held at the former Ground Zero site that involved traditions such as moments of silence, tolling bells, an apolitical atmosphere, and the reading of the names of the victims. The progress made in the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site is also emphasized, including the addition of 9/11 museum, skyscrapers, a transportation hub, and a shopping concourse. Moreover, the growth of lower Manhattan since the attacks is highlighted, through the increased number of hotels, eateries, residents, and visitors in that area. Finally, the article touches upon the ongoing importance of the memorial ceremony in the remembrance of the tragic events and for continued national unity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Ideas about polite behavior are different from one culture to another. Some societies, such as America and Australia for example, are mobile and very open. People here change jobs and move house quite often. As a result, they have a lot of relationships that often last only a short time, and they need to get to know people quickly. So it's normal to have friendly conversations with people that they have just met, and you can talk about things that other cultures would regard as personal. On the other hand there are more crowded and less mobile societies where long-term relationships are more important. A Malaysian or Mexican business person, for example, will want to get to know you very well before he or she feels happy to start business. But when you do get to know each other, the relationship becomes much deeper than it would in a mobile society. To Americans, both Europeans and Asians seem cool and formal at first. On the other hand, as a passenger from a less mobile society puts it, it's no fun spending several hours next to a stranger who wants to tell you all about his or her life and asks you all sorts of questions that you don't want to answer. Cross-cultural differences aren't just a problem for travelers, but also for the flights that carry them. All flights want to provide the best service, but ideas about good service are different from place to place. This can be seen most clearly in the way that problems are dealt with. Some societies have 'universalist' cultures. These societies strongly respect rules, and they treat every person and situation in basically the same way. 'Particularist' societies, on the other hand, also have rules, but they are less important than the society's unwrinen ideas about what is right or wrong for a particular situation or a particular person. So the normal rules are changed to fit the needs of the situation or the importance of the person. This difference can cause problems.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added. The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\" Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs. Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security. \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\" Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports.

Starbucks intentionally underfills its lattes by 25 percent, saving the coffee giant millions while ripping-off customers at the same time, a putative class action states. Latte drinkers Siera Strumlauf and Benjamin Robles claim that Starbucks baristas follow a standardized recipe when it comes to making lattes. According to the plaintiffs, latte-makers are instructed to fill a pitcher with steamed milk up to an etched “fill to” line, then pour shots of espresso into a serving cup, pour the steamed milk into the serving cup, top the latte with milk foam and leave 1/4 inch of free space at the top. However, the Starbucks class action alleges that the “fill to” lines don’t measure up to the supposed 12, 16, and 20 fluid ounce cup sizes offered to customers. “Tall Lattes are not 12 fluid ounces, Grande Lattes are not 16 fluid ounces, and Venti Lattes are not 20 fluid ounces,” the class action states. “Starbucks cheats purchasers by providing less fluid ounces in their Lattes than represented.” The plaintiffs say Starbucks made a conscious decision to underfill its lattes in 2009 in order to save on the cost of milk, which is one of its most expensive ingredients. By giving baristas a “fill to” line, there is no room for deviation making every latte short by several ounces, the plaintiffs claim. “Moreover, Starbucks refuses to fill any hot beverage up to the brim of the cup. Thus, under no circumstances will Starbucks ever serve a Grande Latte that actually meets the fluid ounces represented on the menu,” the Starbucks lawsuit states. Strumlauf says she visits her local Starbucks in San Francisco one or two times each week spending 3.95 on a grande-size (16 fl. oz.) latte. She claims that the representation on Starbucks’ menu informs customers that the grande-sized latte would in fact contain 16 ounces. Strumlauf states that had she known the coffee drink would be less than 16 ounces she would have either paid less for it or not bought it at all. Robles claims he too was cheated when he purchased an underfilled 16 ounce, grande-sized Starbucks Latte. The plaintiff says he relied on the representation of ounces offered by Starbucks when deciding to make his purchase not knowing the product was misrepresented. The Starbucks lawsuit alleges that by underfilling lattes, the coffee company is in breach of express and implied warranties as well as liable for unjust enrichment. If the class action lawsuit is approved, it will be open to all U.S. Class Members who purchased a Starbucks Latte. The plaintiffs also seek to represent a subclass of California residents who bought a latte from Starbucks. Strumlauf and Robles are represented by L. Timothy Fisher, Julia A. Luster and Scott A. Bursor of Bursor & Fisher PA, and Gerald Healy and John Hafemann of Military Justice Attorneys PLLC. The Starbucks Underfilled Latte Class Action Lawsuit is Siera Strumlauf, et al. v. Starbucks Corp., Case No. 3:16-cv-01306, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. UPDATE: On April 25, 2016, plaintiffs urged a California federal judge not to dismiss a class action lawsuit that accuses Starbucks Corp. of uniformly underfilling its lattes by 25 percent. UPDATE 2: On May 26, 2016, Starbucks filed a motion with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer all underfilled drinks class action lawsuits to Washington, arguing that it would be more convenient for depositions. UPDATE 3: On June 17, 2016, this Starbucks class action lawsuit over underfilled lattes will continue, but with fewer claims and limitations on the available relief. UPDATE 4: On Aug. 5, 2016, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ruled that the class action lawsuits alleging Starbucks intentionally underfills lattes and other coffee drinks will not be merged into one centralized case. UPDATE 5: On Oct. 17, 2017, the plaintiffs argued that the coffee company’s motion to dismiss the Starbucks class action lawsuit is premature because it was filed during the discovery phase, in which the plaintiffs are attempting to learn the standard recipe formulations for Starbucks mochas and lattes.

ATTORNEY ADVERTISING View all: Class Action Lawsuit and Settlement News, Consumer Products ||||| Coffee giant is accused of overcharging customers by serving lattes that are 25% too small, based on a recipe it adopted in 2009 to save money on milk A federal judge said two Starbucks customers may pursue a lawsuit accusing the coffee chain of cheating patrons by underfilling lattes. In a decision on Friday, US district judge Thelton Henderson in San Francisco said the California plaintiffs may seek damages for fraud and false advertising from Starbucks Corp in their proposed nationwide class action. According to the lawsuit Starbucks is skimping on one of a latte’s main ingredients: milk. “A latte is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk,” the lawsuit claims, explaining that caffè latte is Italian for “milk coffee”. “Traditionally, a latte is created by mixing steamed milk and espresso, which is then topped with a thin layer of milk foam.” Woman sues Starbucks over ice-to-coffee ratio in cold drinks Read more The coffee giant was accused of overcharging customers by systematically serving lattes that are 25% too small, based on a recipe it adopted in 2009 to save money on milk. The two plaintiffs, Siera Strumlauf of San Francisco and Benjamin Robles of Carlsbad, said Starbucks requires baristas to use pitchers for heating milk with etched “fill to” lines that are too low, and to leave a 1/4 inch of free space in drink cups. “By underfilling its lattes, thereby shortchanging its customers, Starbucks has saved countless millions of dollars in the cost of goods sold and was unjustly enriched by taking payment for more product than it delivers,” the suit reads. The plaintiffs argued that this policy short-changes customers because Starbucks’ cups for tall, grande and venti lattes hold exactly 12, 16 and 20 ounces. Those measurements are advertised on the menu boards in the stores, but when served to customers the lattes do not actually contain that much fluid, they argued. “This is not a case where the alleged deception is simply implausible as a matter of law,” Henderson wrote. “The court finds it probable that a significant portion of the latte-consuming public could believe that a ‘Grande’ contains 16 ounces of fluid.” Henderson did not rule on the case’s merits. He dismissed three of the plaintiffs’ eight claims against Seattle-based Starbucks, as well as their request for injunctive relief. When the lawsuit was first filed, Jeff Rossen, a reporter for the Today Show, purchased Starbucks lattes at six different New York locations to find out how many fluid ounces customers were “really getting”. None of his six lattes contained 16 ounces as advertised – one contained less than 12 ounces after the foam settled. “In the food science community, as well as in the weights and measures community, foam is not measured on a volumetric basis,” the plaintiffs argued in their suit. At the time, Starbucks called Rossen’s experiment “unscientific”. A Starbucks spokesman, Reggie Borges, on Monday said the company believes the lawsuit is without merit and is prepared to defend itself against the remaining claims. He also said that if a customer is not satisfied with how a beverage is prepared, “we will gladly remake it”. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. In May, another lawsuit was brought against Starbucks – this time by a Chicago woman who claimed that she was served too much ice and too little caffeine in her Starbucks’ cold beverages. According to Starbucks, this lawsuit was also without merit. “Our customers understand and expect that ice is an essential component of any ‘iced’ beverage. If a customer is not satisfied with their beverage preparation, we will gladly remake it,” the company said in a statement. Reuters contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Starbucks is being accused of underfilling its lattes by 25% to save on the cost of milk, one of its most expensive ingredients.

Passage: Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.

The band was founded by Englishman Eamon McLoughlin and Australians Kym Warner and Carol Young. The musicians originally performed in local Austin bars, and soon found increasing acclaim. They have released one independent album, Movin' On, in 2003, and two albums, Weather and Water and Viridian, on the Dualtone record label. Their fourth album, Fascination, was released on Sugar Hill in 2009. Their fifth album, The Brick Album (2011), was self-produced with the direct support of their fans. Pre-production donors were recognized with their names inscribed on the \\"bricks\\" that make up the cover art. Their debut album, Movin' On, was the recipient of local Texas awards and charted on Americana radio stations. Country Music Television named their follow-up Weather and Water as one of the ten best bluegrass albums of 2005, and The Greencards were invited to tour with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson in the same year. Viridian would go on to take the number one position on Billboard magazine's Bluegrass Music Chart, making the Greencards the first international band to do so. Viridian was a critically praised album, and was nominated for Best Country Album by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The track \\"Mucky the Duck\\" from Viridian was nominated as the Best Country Instrumental Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards. The Greencards are noted for their incorporation of other genres of music within an American bluegrass sound. Often labeled as part of, and said to be representative of, the \\"newgrass\\" movement, they draw from Irish folk music, gypsy music, rock 'n' roll, folk balladry, and Latin American musical sources.

He describes himself as \\"...half Bengali; one-fourth Punjabi and one-fourth Maharashtrian.\\" Bose's first acting role was at age six when he played the lead in a school play, Tom, the Piper's Son. Bose started his acting career on the Mumbai stage in Rahul D'Cunha's Topsy Turvey and Are There Tigers In The Congo?. D'Cunha's aunt was the casting director for director Dev Benegal's film English, August and suggested that Bose should play the lead role. After filming a screen test, Benegal decided to cast him as civil servant Agastya Sen. Based on the novel of the same name by Upamanyu Chatterjee, English, August was one of the first Hinglish films and gained Bose international recognition when it became the first Indian film to be purchased by 20th Century Fox and won several awards at international film festivals. After English, August Bose found work in television; he was offered a role in India's first English-language television serial, A Mouthful of Sky and also co-hosted BBC World's Style! with Laila Rouass. In 1998 he appeared in Kaizad Gustad's Bombay Boys with Naseeruddin Shah and starred in Dev Benegal's second film, Split Wide Open. To prepare for his role as a roving water vendor, Bose lived in Mumbai's slums and observed a drug dealer for two weeks. He later cited this time--along with the 2002 Gujarat riots--as the beginning of the awakening of his social conscience. Although Split Wide Open was controversial in India because of its depictions of sexual abuse, Bose received the Silver Screen Award for Best Asian Actor at the 2000 Singapore International Film Festival for his performance. He also performed abroad in the Leicester Haymarket in England where he starred in the English version of Tim Murari's play, The Square Circle. In 1997, Bose was cast to play the role of Saleem Sinai in the BBC adaptation of Salman Rushdie's novel Midnight's Children. The project was eventually canceled after the Indian and Sri Lankan governments refused to allow filming. After seeing Bose in English, August, director Govind Nihalani cast him in the villain role opposite Ajay Devgan in the mainstream film Thakshak. The film was not a financial success, although Bose received positive reviews. In 2001, Bose made his directorial debut with Everybody Says I'm Fine!. Starring Rehaan Engineer and Koel Purie and featuring Bose in a supporting role, Everybody received mixed reviews from critics, but won Bose the runner-up John Schlesinger Award for best directorial debut at the 2003 Palm Springs International Film Festival. In 2002, Bose starred opposite Konkona Sen Sharma in Aparna Sen's art film Mr. and Mrs. Iyer. The film, a critique of communal violence, was a critical success and won several awards at international film festivals as well as three National Film Awards.

He co-starred with Shabana Azmi, Konkona Sen Sharma, and Soumitra Chatterjee, further emphasizing his ability to work with prominent Indian film personalities. In the same year, he also appeared in the film 'Silsilay,' which was a collection of three separate stories about love, relationships, and heartbreak. In 2007, Bose appeared in the critically acclaimed film 'Anuranan' (meaning resonance), which explored the idea of relationships and marital ties. The film featured Bose alongside actors like Rajat Kapoor, Rituparna Sengupta, and Raima Sen. In 2009, he starred in the film 'The Japanese Wife' with Chigusa Takaku and veteran Indian actor Moushumi Chatterjee.

Which brother had a decline in strength? Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, both brothers can be considered to be in late adulthood, as Tom is 72 years old and Dan is 52 years old. However, it is important to consider the factors that contribute to a decline in strength and increase in health risks during this stage of life. In late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also experience a decline in strength and stamina, as well as a weakening of their immune system. Sensory functions may start to deteriorate, and reflex time typically increases. Conditions like arthritis and Alzheimer's disease also become more prevalent during this time. Given the hint provided, it can be inferred that Tom, being the older brother at 72 years of age, is more likely to experience a decline in strength and increased health risks compared to Dan, who is 20 years younger. This is because Tom has been exposed to the factors contributing to age-related health issues for a longer period of time. While both brothers are in late adulthood and may be at risk for health issues and decline in strength, it is more probable that Tom, the older brother, has experienced a greater decline in strength due to his advanced age. As individuals continue to age, the probability of facing such declines and health complications generally increases. However, it should also be noted that individual experiences may vary, and factors such as genetics and lifestyle choices can play a significant role in determining one's overall health and strength during late adulthood."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To submerge something in water means to put it completely under the water, so it's surrounded by water on all sides. To accomplish this goal, follow these steps: 1. Find a container big enough to hold both the object and enough water to cover it. This could be a bucket, sink, bathtub, or even a pool, depending on the size of the object. 2. Fill the container with water. Make sure there's enough water to cover the object completely. 3. Gently hold the object and lower it into the water. Be careful not to drop it too fast, or the water might splash out of the container. 4. Slowly release the object, letting it sink into the water. Some objects might float instead of sinking. That's because they are lighter than the water and have air trapped inside. If the object floats, you can gently push it down until it's completely under the water. 5. Ta-da! You have now successfully submerged the object in water."},{"prompt":"I heard that robin gave the most among men and easily won the strong man competition that day.

Asexual organisms simply inherit a complete copy of their parent's genome. Sexual organisms have two copies of each chromosome because they inherit one complete set from each parent.:1 Q: How many sets of chromosomes does a sexual organism inherit from each parent?","completion":"A sexual organism inherits one set of chromosomes from each parent, which means it has two sets of chromosomes in total. This characteristic of inheriting chromosomes from both parents makes the offspring a diploid organism, as it contains two copies of each gene. The process of sexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes (sperm and egg cells) from the two parents. Gametes are formed through a process called meiosis, wherein the chromosome number is halved to produce haploid cells containing only one set of chromosomes. In humans, for instance, a typical somatic cell has 46 chromosomes or 23 pairs, while gametes have 23 single chromosomes. When fertilization occurs, the sperm (from the male parent) and the egg (from the female parent) merge to form a zygote, which has two complete sets of chromosomes – one from each parent. Thus, there are a total of 46 chromosomes in the offspring, with 23 chromosomes being inherited from the mother and 23 from the father. The inheritance of chromosomes from both parents allows for the combination of genetic material, resulting in genetic variation that is essential for the evolutionary process. This genetic diversity helps populations adapt to changing environments and provides the raw material for natural selection to act upon. In summary, a sexual organism inherits one set of chromosomes from each parent, giving it a total of two sets of chromosomes. This characteristic contributes to the genetic diversity and evolution of species in the natural world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I don't recommend purchasing this until Amazon is more careful with its e-book conversion. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"The review provided clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with the Kindle edition of the book, citing poor proofreading and numerous typographic errors as the main issues. Rather than focusing on the book's content or story, the reviewer's attention is drawn to the problematic formatting of the e-book version. This negative portrayal of the product might discourage other potential customers from buying the Kindle edition and suggests that the reviewer does not recommend purchasing it. The reviewer's language further supports the unflattering depiction of the product. Phrases like \\"eagerly awaited,\\" \\"alas,\\" and \\"riddled with typographic errors\\" convey the sense of not only disappointment but also frustration with the Kindle edition. The use of the word \\"bah\\" in the title emphasizes the reviewer's dissatisfaction and frustration.

Known for his exceptional skill, determination, and strong work ethic, Smith quickly gained recognition in the racing world. As of now, he is considered one of the most successful jockeys in the history of American horse racing. Mike Smith's collaboration with Justify, the talented racehorse trained by Bob Baffert, resulted in a remarkable journey that culminated in the horse's Triple Crown victory in 2018. The Kentucky Derby was the first jewel in that crown. Justify, as a three-year-old chestnut colt, entered the race as the favorite, and Smith expertly guided him to victory through a wet and muddy Churchill Downs track. This win not only marked Justify's unbeaten record but also attributed to Mike Smith's impressive career achievements. Following the Kentucky Derby win, Mike Smith and Justify went on to secure victories in the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes, making Justify the 13th Triple Crown winner in history, and at the age of 52, Mike Smith became the oldest jockey to win the coveted title. The iconic partnership of Smith and Justify forged a remarkable legacy in the world of horse racing, once again emphasizing Smith's skills and the connection he had with the exceptional racehorse. Throughout his extraordinary career, Mike Smith has accumulated numerous prestigious titles, including multiple Breeders' Cup wins and a place in the United States' Racing Hall of Fame, which he earned in 2003.

Article:Top prosecutor Marianne Ny said his arrest warrant was being revoked as it was impossible to serve him notice. Mr Assange, 45, has lived in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since 2012. He fears extradition to Sweden would lead to extradition to the US where he is wanted over leaks. Ecuador has called on the UK to allow him safe passage out of the country. However, police in London said they would still be obliged to arrest him if he left. The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) said Mr Assange still faced the lesser charge of failing to surrender to a court, an offence punishable by up to a year in prison or a fine. But the UK has not commented on whether it has received an extradition request from the US, where Mr Assange could face trial over the leaking of hundreds of thousands of secret US military and diplomatic documents. Mr Assange's Swedish lawyer, Per Samuelson, said the prosecutor's decision on Friday represented \\"a total victory\\" for his client. But the Wikileaks founder responded angrily in a tweet: \\"Detained for 7 years without charge... while my children grew up and my name was slandered. I do not forgive or forget.\\" The plaintiff in the rape case was \\"shocked\\" by the decision, her lawyer said, and maintained her accusations against Mr Assange, Agence France-Presse reported. The decision coincided with the release by Wikileaks of another tranche of documents about the CIA's technical capabilities. At a press briefing on Friday, Ms Ny said that by remaining in the embassy in London Mr Assange had evaded the exercise of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) that would have seen him extradited to Sweden. She said that under Swedish law a criminal investigation needed to be conducted \\"as quickly as possible\\". Sweden did not expect Ecuador's co-operation in formally notifying Mr Assange of the allegations against him, a necessary step in proceeding with the case, she added. But she said: \\"If he were to return to Sweden before the statute of limitation on this case expires in August 2020, the preliminary investigation could be resumed.\\" She said it was \\"regrettable we have not been able to carry out the investigation\\", and added: \\"We are not making any pronouncement about guilt.\\" A source at the Ecuadorean foreign ministry told the Press Association that Ecuador had \\"fully co-operated with the Swedish justice system\\". The source criticised the Swedish prosecutor for \\"unnecessary delays\\" in the case but welcomed the latest decision. The source added: \\"Ecuador will now be intensifying its diplomatic efforts with the UK so that Julian Assange can gain safe passage in order to enjoy his asylum in Ecuador.\\" The rape allegation followed a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. Mr Assange always denied the allegations against him, saying sex was consensual. He also said the case was politically motivated, as it followed massive Wikileaks dumps of secret US military reports that year. Later that year he was arrested in London after Sweden issued an international arrest warrant against him. Then, in June 2012, after exhausting legal avenues to prevent his extradition, Mr Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy, where he remains to this day. After the news was announced on Friday, Wikileaks tweeted that the \\"focus now moves to the UK\\", but Mr Assange's fate still seems unclear. The MPS issued a statement saying that its actions had been based on a response to a \\"European Arrest Warrant for an extremely serious offence\\". It went on: \\"Now that the situation has changed and the Swedish authorities have discontinued their investigation into that matter, Mr Assange remains wanted for a much less serious offence. The MPS will provide a level of resourcing which is proportionate to that offence.\\" The MPS said it would \\"not comment further on the operational plan\\". Last month, Mr Samuelson filed a new motion calling for his client's arrest warrant to be lifted. He cited a comment by new US Attorney General Jeff Sessions that the arrest of Mr Assange would be \\"a priority\\". Mr Samuelson told Agence France-Presse: \\"This implies that we can now demonstrate that the US has a will to take action... this is why we ask for the arrest warrant to be cancelled.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"Swedish prosecutors have dropped an investigation into rape allegations against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

Movie title: Vicky Cristina Barcelona Context: Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) visit Barcelona for the summer, staying with Vicky's distant relative Judy (Patricia Clarkson) and her husband Mark (Kevin Dunn). While the two are great friends, Vicky is practical and traditional in her approach to love and commitment and is engaged to the reliable Doug (Chris Messina), whereas Cristina imagines herself to be a nonconformist, spontaneous but unsure of what she wants from life or love. At an art exhibition, Cristina is intrigued by artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), who Judy says has suffered a violent relationship with his ex-wife. Later, he brazenly approaches the two women to invite them to join him right away for the weekend in the city of Oviedo, in a small plane he flies himself, for sight-seeing, fine eating and drinking, and hopefully, love-making. Cristina is won over by the offer almost at once, but Vicky is unimpressed and reluctant; she however eventually decides to accompany her friend anyway, mainly to watch over her. At the end of their first day, Vicky refuses to join Juan Antonio in his hotel room, citing her fidelity to Doug, but Cristina accepts his invitation immediately. Before the love-making starts, Cristina suddenly falls ill with digestive complaints, and is put to bed, with food poisoning. Vicky and Juan Antonio proceed to spend the weekend together alone while they wait for Cristina to recuperate. Vicky gradually changes her opinion of Juan Antonio as he tells her about his tumultuous relationship with his former wife, MarÃ­a Elena (PenÃ©lope Cruz). Vicky accompanies him to visit his father, an old poet, and then becomes deeply moved by a Spanish guitar performance later that evening. She finally succumbs to Juan Antonio's advances as they walk through a grove of trees in the dark. The next day, with Cristina recovered, the three of them fly back to Barcelona.

Many shops offer comfortable sofas, large screen televisions and sometimes even live music. More and more teenagers are hanging out there. My pre-teen has already done so after school once a month, but she always orders fruit juice. I think she would drink coffee sooner or later, so I started doing some research online. I found that coffee in moderation could be safe, but one thing that was constant online was the chance of becoming addicted to coffee. Coffee is one step up from soda but still not as dangerous as energy drinks or alcohol. Still, any addiction is hard to break, so I needed to come up with a plan that would protect my child. Coffee shops offer a safe place for teenagers to hang out. As like anything else you let your children do, you need to set limits. Drinking coffee while socializing once or twice a week won't cause a severe caffeine addiction. However, you should avoid allowing a cup of coffee every morning and ensure they get adequate sleep each night, which will make them less likely to feel the need to drink coffee. As parents, we have responsibility to set a good example. If you're addicted to caffeine, it's time to start monitoring your intake. If you drink much water and keep healthier drink options in your fridge and at your dinner table, your teenager will follow you.

Sylvie Davies, whose late husband Geler Davies drove the line's last passenger train in February 1965, will open Abergwili Junction on Saturday. Peter Nicholas, from the project, said he hoped it would draw more visitors. The Gwili Railway was established by enthusiasts in 1974, with a view to re-opening a short section of the former Carmarthen to Aberystwyth railway that closed to passenger traffic in 1965. The original track was lifted in 1977. A group of some 20 volunteers have worked on the 17-year project, with the line being opened two years later than scheduled.

Rachel loved reading stories out of a book to Betty every night.","completion":"Rachel loved reading stories out of a book to Betty every night. It had become a cherished ritual between the two best friends since they had first met in their neighborhood two years ago. Betty, a sweet, curious 8-year-old girl, adored Rachel and looked forward to their nightly story time with eager anticipation. One evening, as Rachel tucked Betty into bed, Betty held onto her favorite storybook, a collection of Little Red Riding Hood variants from around the world. It was a birthday gift from Rachel, and it had quickly become one of their favorite books to read together. As their nightly ritual unfolded, Rachel began narrating the story's protagonists, giving each character unique voices. Betty listened intently, her eyes sparkling with fascination. The words conjured images in Betty's mind, transporting her into the magical world of the story. As they ventured from one story to another, they would sometimes pause to discuss a particular moment, a character's choice, or an unexpected twist. These conversations often sparked lively debates about the tale's morals and critical thinking regarding the characters' deepest motivations. It was through story time that Rachel subtly imparted lessons on empathy, perseverance, and trust while feeding Betty's love for learning and improving her language skills. One night, after finishing a particularly exciting rendition of Little Red Riding Hood, they were about to close the book when they noticed a thin, folded piece of paper tucked between the covers. Curiously, Rachel opened the mysterious parchment, revealing a hand-drawn map to an enchanted forest. Betty's eyes widened in astonishment as she traced her finger along the elegant paths illustrated upon the map. They led to a magnificent tree at the heart of a well-guarded palace. The map seemed to possess a mystical allure, inviting the two of them to embark on a wondrous adventure. The very next day, Rachel and Betty packed their bags and set out to explore this mysterious realm. Guided by the map, they ventured through twists and turns, encountering marvelous creatures that appeared to emerge straight from their beloved book. Rachel and Betty met a helpful, chatty squirrel who helped them decipher a riddle carved into a gnarled oak. In return, they shared a scrumptious lunch they had packed. Rachel took copious notes of their discoveries, documenting the lessons learned from each encounter. Braving hidden perils and overcoming challenging obstacles, they journeyed deeper into the heart of the enchanted forest. Finally, they reached their destination: the grand tree at the heart of the palace. The regal entrance invited them in, but to get there, they had to face one last challenge. The palace was guarded by a wise and powerful dragon, who demanded that they answer a profound question before they could enter. Drawing from the collective wisdom of the stories they had read together, Rachel and Betty courageously answered the dragon's query. Pleased by their quick thinking, the dragon graciously opened the palace doors, revealing the enchanting world within. That night, under the ethereal glow of the palace's moonlit corridors, dreams and reality intertwined as Rachel read yet another enchanting tale out of their favorite book to Betty. And so, their adventures continued, filling each day with new stories, characters, and wisdom to ponder. Through these shared experiences, their bond strengthened, and their friendship deepened. The enchanting forest became a treasure trove of wisdom, resilience, and joy, giving Rachel and Betty reason to believe that stories and dreams could intertwine, crafting dazzling worlds and a bond that could weather all storms. Now, every time Rachel read to Betty, their appreciation for the power of stories only grew stronger - sharing thoughts, feelings, and experiences that not only brought them closer together but also made them better versions of themselves. Forevermore, they knew that no matter where their journey took them, the enchanting worlds they explored together would always hold a special place within their hearts and souls."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: No one can deny that buttons are an important clothing device. But, can they rise to the level of art? Organizers of an exhibit in New York think so. Peter Souleo Wright organized \\"The Button Show\\" at Rush Arts Gallery in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Eleven artists used the small, ordinary objects to create sculptures, portraits and wearable art. Some of the works are political, some are personal and others are just fun. Wright said each artist reimagines and repurposes the buttons to make art. \\"What I tried to do with this show,\\" he said , \\"was to look at artists who were promoting that level of craft.\\" He said he wanted the button art to be comparable to a painting \\"because of the amount of detail and precision in the work\\". Artist Beau McCall produced \\"A Harlem Hangover\\". It looks like a wine bottle that fell over on a table. A stream of connected red buttons hang over the side, like wine flowing down. Similar red buttons form a small pool on the floor. McCall layers buttons of different shapes and sizes to create the bottle. The stitching that holds them together is also part of the artistic design. For San Francisco-based artist Lisa Kokin, buttons are highly personal. After her father died in 2001, she created a portrait of him using only buttons. That memorial to her father led to other button portraits, including those of activists Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez. Others use buttons for details. Artist Amalia Amaki of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, placed them on and around old photographs. Los Angeles artist Camilla Taylor attached buttons to three large sculptures that look like headless animals with long , narrow legs. \\"The Button Show\\" ends at March 12. The Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation paid for the exhibition. The foundation was created in 1995 by the Simmons brothers: artist Danny, hip-hop producer Russell and rapper Rev. Run. The foundation seeks to bring the artists to urban youth and to provide support for new artists.

The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor. - Orestis Makris ( Greek : ; September 30 , 1898 -- January 29 , 1975 ) was a Greek actor and tenor . He graduated from the Greek Odeum of Athens and first entered the scene as a tenor in the troupe of Rosalia Nika in 1925 . He later joined the Papaioannou troupe , before moving to more comedic roles . Makris excelled in the portrayal of folk characters , especially the stock role of the \`\` drunkard '' . Makris also participated in about forty movies , mostly as an over-strict father . He is considered one of the most significant modern Greek actors . He was decorated with the Order of the Phoenix . He died on January 29 , 1975 in Athens and is buried at the First Cemetery in a family grave . - Vocal range is the measure of the breadth of pitches that a human voice can phonate. Although the study of vocal range has little practical application in terms of speech, it is a topic of study within linguistics, phonetics, and speech and language pathology, particularly in relation to the study of tonal languages and certain types of vocal disorders. However, the most common application of the term \\"vocal range\\" is within the context of singing, where it is used as one of the major defining characteristics for classifying singing voices into groups known as voice types. - Spinto (from Italian, \\"pushed\\") is a vocal term used to characterize a soprano or tenor voice of a weight between lyric and dramatic that is capable of handling large musical climaxes in opera at moderate intervals. (Sometimes the terms \\"lirico-spinto\\" or \\"jugendlich-dramatisch\\" are used to denote this category of voice.) - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted. - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock. - In music, an octave (: eighth) or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. It is defined by ANSI as the unit of frequency level when the base of the logarithm is two. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the \\"basic miracle of music\\", the use of which is \\"common in most musical systems\\".

What we can infer from the paragraph is that the band, Sultans of Ping FC, was formed in 1988 by Niall O'Flaherty, Pat O'Connell, Paul Fennelly, and Ger Lyons. These Irish musicians decided to use a witty twist on the popular Dire Straits song title \\"Sultans of Swing\\" when choosing their band's name, which demonstrates their humor and possibly a desire to distance themselves from the seriousness often associated with Dire Straits at that time. In the late 1980s, Dire Straits' work was often perceived as untouchable and highly respected in the music industry. Making a humorous reference or poking fun at their music was considered inappropriate or even disrespectful, signaling that the Sultans of Ping FC were daring and potentially unafraid of stirring up controversy with their name choice. In conclusion, the paragraph does not provide information about the lead singer's mother suggesting the name Sultans of Swing for the band.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: The anti-fracking activist barred from 312.5 sq miles of Pennsylvania Vera Scroggins, an outspoken opponent of fracking, is legally barred from the new county hospital. Also off-limits, unless Scroggins wants to risk fines and arrest, are the Chinese restaurant where she takes her grandchildren, the supermarkets and drug stores where she shops, the animal shelter where she adopted her Yorkshire terrier, bowling alley, recycling centre, golf club, and lake shore. In total, 312.5 sq miles are no-go areas for Scroggins under a sweeping court order granted by a local judge that bars her from any properties owned or leased by one of the biggest drillers in the Pennsylvania natural gas rush, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation. \\"They might as well have put an ankle bracelet on me with a GPS on it and be able to track me wherever I go,\\" Scroggins said. \\"I feel like I am some kind of a prisoner, that my rights have been curtailed, have been restricted.\\" The ban represents one of the most extreme measures taken by the oil and gas industry to date against protesters like Scroggins, who has operated peacefully and within the law including taking Yoko Ono to frack sites in her bid to elevate public concerns about fracking. It was always going to be an unequal fight when Scroggins, now 63, made it her self-appointed mission five years ago to stop fracking in this, the richest part of the Marcellus Shale. Just how unequal became clear on 21 October when the case of Cabot v Scroggins came before a local judge, Kenneth Seamans, in the Montrose court house. Cabot turned up with four lawyers and nine witnesses, employees of the company and the firm it hired to provide security. Scroggins represented herself. She told the court she had been unable to find a lawyer as the hearing had been called on 72 hours' notice. By the time the hearing was over, the judge had granted Cabot a temporary injunction barring Scroggins from all property owned or leased by the company. \\"It is hereby ordered that Ms Scroggins is restrained, enjoined and prohibited from entering upon property owned and/or leased by Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation including but not limited to well sites, well pads and access roads,\\" the injunction reads. The effect of that ban is far broader than the dry legal language would suggest. In court filings, Cabot said it holds leases on 200,000 acres of land, equivalent to 312.5 sq miles. That amounts to nearly 40% of the largely rural county in north-eastern Pennsylvania where Scroggins lives and where Cabot does most of its drilling. The temporary injunction granted on 21 October does not require Cabot to identify or map the lands where it holds drilling leases, putting Scroggins in the bizarre position of having to figure out for herself which areas were off-limits. Cabot later offered to limit the scope of its exclusion order in court filings seeking to make the injunction permanent. The next hearing on that injunction is scheduled for 24 March. Scroggins, who now has a lawyer, is fighting to overturn the injunction. Until then, each trip Scroggins makes outside her home requires a calculation about whether her route will take her on lands or roads leased to Cabot, or a visit to the court house to pore over property records. \\"We need a map. We need to know where I can and can not go,\\" she said. \\"Can I stop here, or can I not stop here? Is it OK to be here if I go to a business or if I go to a home? I have had to ask and check out every person I go to: 'are you leased to Cabot'?\\" Many of those businesses are, it turns out. Susquehanna County is one of the most active areas in Pennsylvania's natural gas rush. Eight of the top 10 most productive gas wells are in the county, according to an industry newsletter. All eight belong to Cabot. Environmental groups say the court – and Cabot - went too far. \\"It seems to be an extraordinarily heavy handed reaction by industry and one which was extremely out of proportion to what she has been doing,\\" said Kate Sinding, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defence Council. Campaigners claim other over-reactions by industry and police against fracking opponents – such as the arrest last December of two protesters in Oklahoma for \\"terrorism hoax\\", after they unfurled a banner and dropped glitter on the floor of an office tower owned by Devon Energy. But Scroggins' lawyer, George Kinchy, says this was the first time to his knowledge that a company has used the full weight of the law against a single activist. He also said Cabot was lucky Scroggins was not represented by a lawyer at the hearing. The company was not pressed to demonstrate the gas leases gave it the right to make such absolute decisions about access. \\"They have no proof that they had the right to exclude her. They didn't present evidence of leases that gave them the right to treat the property as their own,\\" he said. Cabot refused several requests to respond, beyond a brief email statement from spokesman, George Stark. \\"Cabot has a policy of not commenting specifically on litigation to which it is a party,\\" the statement reads. \\"That being said, Cabot supports an individual's right to free speech and regrets having to seek relief from the court in order to prevent Ms Scroggins from repeatedly trespassing on company property, where she could potentially jeopardise the safety of herself and others.\\" However, the company arranged for Tom Shepstone, a consultant who blogs at Natural Gas Now, to speak on its behalf. Shepstone said the injunction was overdue. \\"I'm proud of Cabot and what they've done because they're saying we're not going to take this any longer,\\" he said. Cabot in court filings does not accuse Scroggins of violence or of causing harm to property, and she has never been arrested or charged with trespass. She has not chained herself to machinery, or staged sit-ins. But Shepstone argued Scroggins had upset too many people to be tolerated. \\"I believe she is a public menace because what she does is she essentially trespasses not so much on property – though she does do that – but she trespasses on the soul of the community,\\" he said. \\"She does not allow the people of this community any peace.\\" In the five years since fracking came to north-eastern Pennsylvania, Scroggins has been relentless in trying to exposing the risks associated with the industry. Scroggins and her then husband moved to this very rural area of north-eastern Pennsylvania from Long Island, New York more than 20 years ago, when their children were small. After various careers, Scroggins, now a grandmother, considers herself a full-time activist. She has visited frack sites – posting up to 500 videos on YouTube. She has called in health and environmental regulators at perceived violations, and she has organised bus tours of frack sites for anyone who is interested – from Yoko Ono and Susan Sarandon to visiting Canadian elected officials. None of that activity by Scroggins or other activists was illegal, or presented a public danger, according to Jason Legg, the district attorney for Susquehana County. \\"I don't recall any major protests or people trespassing on any property,\\" he said. Even by Cabot's own admission, in court testimony last October, Scroggins seems to have been more nuisance than danger. Her biggest and most repeated offence, according to court testimony, appears to have been parking her car on access roads – and at times even on the narrow public county roads – at angles that required the big water tankers to swerve around her. Scroggins, who does not appear adverse to confrontation, was also insistent on talking to personnel on site. But in every instance cited by Cabot witnesses, she left the area within 5 or 10 minutes – sometimes after they threatened to call police. By 2011 those repeat visits to gas sites made Scroggins public enemy number one, so far as Cabot was concerned. Cabot's security contractor, Northeast Diversified Services told the court it had posted photographs of Scroggins in their guards' campers, and had been following the activist since 2011. \\"Yes, we follow you, yes, from site to site,\\" the company's vice-president, Thomas Tolan, told the court. Scroggins wasn't winning friends in the community either. There are landowners in Susquehana County who have made money off leasing their land to Cabot and other gas companies for fracking. \\"The consensus is basically that it has been a lifeline to an area that was struggling,\\" Legg said. In a small town like Montrose, population 1,600, Scroggins' forceful brand of activism appears to have been too much for some – though she has a hard core of supporters. In a recent visit to the court house to check on Cabot leases, she was scolded by a court official just for striking up a conversation with the person beside her at the counter. A few minutes later, Thomas Meagher, the county solicitor, said Scroggins brought her legal problems down on herself by failing to following the \\"unwritten rules\\" of civilised discourse. Scroggins rejects the idea that \\"nice\\" has anything to do with it. \\"I am doing this as nicely as I feel is warranted. I have other concerned citizen friends who play passive and they don't get anything done more than I do. They are just in the background,\\" she said. \\"They are playing passive and nobody even hears about them. Those who want to play that womanly role, they can play it. I don't have to.\\" As for Cabot and her critics in the community, \\"They can just get used to it,\\" Scroggins said.","completion":"Vera Scroggins, an anti-fracking activist, has been legally barred from entering 312.5 square miles of Pennsylvania due to a court order issued by a local judge. The court order prevents Scroggins from visiting any properties owned or leased by Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation, one of the largest operators in the state's natural gas industry. This restriction has effectively made places like the county hospital, supermarkets, restaurants, and other local businesses off-limits for Scroggins as many of them are situated on lands leased to Cabot. This measure represents one of the most severe actions taken by the oil and gas industry against peaceful protesters like Scroggins, who has been involved in raising public awareness about the potential dangers of fracking.

Place cardboard or 2x4s under furniture so the rabbit doesn’t burrow up into the soft underside of it. You can also place clear plastic panels over the wall to keep the rabbit from chewing on it. Watch your bunny carefully when she is running around the room and give her an acceptable chewing object if she tries to go after furniture or part of the house.

He invented a very simple camera. He put it in a window of his house and took a picture of his garden. That was the first photo. The next important date in the history of photography was in 1837. That year, Daguerre, another Frenchman, took a picture of his reading room. He used a new kind of camera in a different way. In his picture you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest thing. This kind of photo was called a Daguerreotype. Soon, other people began to use Daguerre's way. Travelers brought back wonderful photos from all around the world. People took pictures of famous buildings, cities and mountains. In about 1840, photography was developed. Then photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. That was not simple. The photographers had to carry a lot of films and other machines. But this did not stop them, for example, some in the United States worked so hard. Mathew Brady was a famous American photographer. He took many pictures of great people.

However, unbeknownst to the people, a great white shark lurks just beneath the waves. The shark has a disfigured scar running down the side of its massive body, highlighting the years of pain it has faced in the wild ocean. The protagonist, marine biologist Dr. Luna Santiago, is trying to rehabilitate the shark named Phantom after its capture. She believes that the shark can once again peacefully coexist in the ocean without causing harm. However, the mayor of Ocean's Hollow, fearing the dangers of having a predator so close to shore, orders the shark to be killed and displayed as a trophy. Devastated, Dr. Santiago hatches a plan. With the help of her research team, a fearless fisherman named Hugo, and a group of locals sympathetic to her cause, they plan to secretly transport Phantom back into the wild, away from Ocean's Hollow. Urgency is heightened as a rival marine biologist, Dr. Lee, hunts for the shark, aiming to kill it upon capture to prove that fears about Phantom are warranted. Dr. Lee wants to ensure his own ambitions and secure funding for his dangerous research projects that involve the manipulation and creation of more formidable predator hybrids. In a fast-paced, thrilling climax, the team races against time and obstacles. Along the way, the unexpected happens - Phantom saves a young child who was playing near the shore from a group of aggressive smaller sharks. This act of heroism convinces even the most skeptical members of the community that Phantom is not a threat. In the end, Phantom and Dr. Santiago form a bond that transcends species, and together, with the help of her team, they release the shark back into the ocean. The entire town realizes that living harmoniously with these beautiful creatures is the ultimate goal. True or false: The shark is killed in the end? True. But in a heartbreaking turn of events, Phantom sacrifices itself to protect the town from Dr. Lee's unnatural hybrid creations, proving once and for all that not all predators are monstrous."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write highlights for this article: A five-year-old girl who was viciously mauled by a dog as she rode her bike in the street has showed her inspiring recovery - and her long road ahead. Payton White was playing with her big sister Camryn outside their great-grandmother's home in Collinsville, Oklahoma on October 21 when a neighbor's Rottweiler-Bullmastiff mix approached them. Camryn later told her mother that the two-year-old dog, Harley, had circled around them before attacking Payton and dragging her into a ditch, the Tulsa World reported. A neighbor heard the girl's screams and managed to pull the dog away from her and call for help. Scroll down for video. All smiles: Payton White grins for photos three weeks after she was viciously attacked by a neighbor's dog. Fighter: Payton, pictured laughing with her mother, needed six hours of surgery and numerous stitches. Her mother, Sherri White, was still at work at a dentist's office when she got a frantic call from nine-year-old Camryn and raced to St John's hospital. 'When I saw her there was a huge gaping hole,' she told the newspaper. 'You could see inside her neck and... there were muscles hanging out of her arm.' Payton suffered two skull fractures and multiple lacerations on her head, neck, arm and body. She was later transferred to The Children's Hospital at Saint Francis where she underwent six hours of surgery and received hundreds of stitches, her father told News on 6. 'It was a really long night, and I was really scared that my child wasn't going to make it,' White told the Tulsa World. 'If he had gotten any closer to that artery, we would have lost her.' Injured: Payton is pictured in hospital after the dog grabbed her and bit into her neck, back and arms. Recovery: Payton, pictured left and right in hospital with her mother, remained in hospital for eight days. Fears: Her mother, Sherri White, said she couldn't believe her daughter's injuries when she arrived at hospital. The family remained at the hospital for eight days and they have been returning for physical therapy and counseling. Payton is back home and grinned for photos for the Tulsa World - but behind the smiles, are new fears, her mother said. She is now terrified of neighborhood dogs she previously played with and that, in the aftermath of the attack, she has become increasingly 'cranky'. The incident has also set back her attending classes at kindergarten. The little girl has also been suffering from headaches and vomiting, exacerbated by her nerves since the incident, and also has PTSD, according to a Facebook page set up by the family. 'It's pretty much flipped our lives upside-down in every way,' White said. 'It's going to be a really long road.' Attack: She had been on her bike with her sister last month when the neighbor's dog began circling them. Scene: The neighbor killed the two-year-old dog, a Rottweiler-Bullmastiff mix, on the day of the attack. Cassie White, an aunt who set up the Facebook page as well as a fundraising page, has moved closer to the family to watch over the little girl. 'She doesn't really sleep,' she said. 'She's been having nightmares.' The dog, Harley, was shot dead by his owner on the day of the attack, according to authorities, who said the killing did not break any laws. White claims that the owner mistreated the dog and had failed to keep him away from the neighborhood children. She said her other daughter had previously been attacked by the dog. It is a misdemeanor to allow a dog that has previously bitten or injured someone to repeat the behavior, but the sheriff's office didn't have any records showing the dog had a history of violence.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that sang lead vocals and wrote the song for Shrek 2?, using the article: Following their 2004 reunion, the Pixies felt that recording a new song would \\"break the ice\\" between band members after their acrimonious split in 1993. As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour, DreamWorks contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of Shrek 2. The band agreed, and frontman Black Francis and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children. Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while, and since her band The Breeders were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies. The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a \\"poppier, more kid-friendly thing,\\" and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two—in the previous two Pixies studio albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991), Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split. However, the two appeared at the time to have resolved their differences: Francis praised \\"Bam Thwok,\\" as \\"a really good song.\\" despite joking in interviews about how he planned to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a hypothetical new album. However, Deal eventually left the band in June 2013, before the release of the band's next album, Indie Cindy., what would be the answer ?

He cited the example of the Somerset Levels, where dredging of rivers has resumed in a bid to avoid a repeat of flooding seen in 2013-14. He also defended the response to floods in northern England and Scotland. In an appearance before the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Cameron said: \\"You've seen quite an attitudinal change in the Environment Agency that in years gone past, I think, were trying to balance up the effects on nature on the one hand and protecting property on the other hand. \\"We've said to them: 'The time for that is over. This is about protecting human lives. This is about protecting our homes.' \\"I want to see that continued shift. You saw that very directly in Somerset, where there is a man-made environment and it was ridiculous those rivers weren't being dredged. I threatened to go and drive the dredger myself. Those rivers have now been dredged. \\"Do we need an attitudinal change in the way we approach flooding? Yes, we absolutely do.\\" The Environment Agency, which covers England, is responsible for managing the risk of flooding from main rivers, and issues flood alerts and warnings. But that was not the reason it was set up or the main part of its remit. \\"We work to create better places for people and wildlife, and support sustainable development,\\" the agency says on the \\"what we do\\" section of its website. Several storms wreaked havoc across the UK in December, with Cumbria, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire among the worst affected by the floods. Parts of Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland also saw flooding and damage from a series of storms, including Desmond, Eva and Frank. The environment agency's chairman, Sir Philip Dilley, resigned on Monday after coming under pressure for holidaying in Barbados during the recent floods. Last month the agency's deputy chief executive said a \\"complete rethink\\" of the UK's flood defences was required, saying better waterproofing of homes and improved warning systems were vital for tackling future weather extremes. Mr Cameron told MPs more could be done, saying that \\"the country wants us to do more and we will do more\\". The authorities need to get better at river management and more flood defences are needed, he said.

DNA: The DNA molecule is a double helix made up of two complementary strands that are held together by hydrogen bonds between nitrogenous bases. These bases are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). DNA carries the genetic information necessary for the growth, development, and reproduction of cells and organisms. 2. Histone proteins: These are a group of highly conserved, positively charged proteins that interact with the negatively charged DNA, packaging it into a more condensed structure. The histone family consists of five major types: H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, with the latter four forming an octameric core structure, which is called the histone octamer. 3. Nucleosomes: A nucleosome is the basic unit of chromatin, made up of a histone octamer wrapped by approximately 146 base pairs of DNA. The DNA molecule wraps around the histone octamer approximately 1.65 times, making the nucleosome resemble a bead on a string. Nucleosomes are critical for DNA packaging, allowing the long DNA molecule to be condensed into the cell nucleus. 4. Chromatin fiber: This is formed when the nucleosomes are further condensed through a coiling process. There are two primary forms of chromatin – euchromatin and heterochromatin. Euchromatin is a less condensed, more transcriptionally active form of chromatin, whereas heterochromatin is more condensed and generally transcriptionally inactive. This packaging process is essential for organizing and protecting the DNA within the cell nucleus and regulating gene expression. In summary, double strands of DNA wrap around histone proteins to form nucleosomes, which are then coiled into a chromatin fiber. The organization and condensation of DNA into chromatin play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression, replication, and repair processes within cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The data provided outlines two important characteristics of the celestial object designated as \\"11264 Claudiomaccone.\\" Named after Italian scientist and astronomer Claudio Maccone, this object is part of the vast array of minor planets in our solar system, including asteroids, trans-Neptunian objects, and other small celestial bodies. The first characteristic detailed is the orbital period of 11264 Claudiomaccone, which stands at 1513.722 days. The orbital period of a celestial object signifies the time taken to complete a full orbit around its central celestial body – in this case, the Sun. In terms of Earth years, 11264 Claudiomaccone takes approximately 4.14 years to make a full revolution around our central star. The second piece of data provided is the object's apoapsis, measured at 475,426,000 kilometers. Apoapsis refers to the point in a celestial object's orbit where it is farthest from the central celestial body. For comparison, Earth's average distance from the Sun (or astronomical unit) is roughly 149,597,870 kilometers. Thus, 11264 Claudiomaccone's apoapsis is more than three times the distance between Earth and the Sun. When observing and analyzing celestial objects, scientists take into account several other parameters such as size, composition, inclination, and eccentricity of its orbit. Further research on 11264 Claudiomaccone could provide a more comprehensive understanding of its physical properties, its behavior within the solar system, and even potential implications for future exploration or space missions. In conclusion, the data provided sheds light on two significant aspects of minor planet 11264 Claudiomaccone's orbital characteristics. With an orbital period of 1513.722 days or roughly 4.14 Earth years, the celestial object takes a considerable amount of time to complete its journey around the Sun. Additionally, its apoapsis of 475,426,000 kilometers highlights its vast distance from our central star at the farthest point in its orbit. Further study of 11264 Claudiomaccone and other celestial objects in our solar system can augment our understanding of the universe and its vast array of celestial bodies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

There's nothing worse than a French production trying to out-do films made in Hollywood and CR is a perfect example of such a wannabe horror/action/buddy flick. I almost stopped it halfway through because I knew it wouldn't amount to anything but French guys trying to show-off. The film starts off promisingly, like some sort of expansive horror film, but it quickly shifts genres, from horror to action to x-files type to buddy flick, that in the end, CR is all of it and also none of it. It's so full of clichés that at one point I thought the whole thing was a comedy. The painful dialogue and those silent pauses, with fades outs and fades ins just at the right expositionary moments, made me groan. I thought only films made in Hollywood used this hackneyed technique. The chase scene, with Vincent Cassel running after the killer, is so over-directed and over-done that it's almost a thing of beauty. The climax on top of the mountain, with the stupid revelation about the killer(s) with Cassel and Reno playing \\"buddies\\" like Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS, completely derailed what little credibility the film had by then.

An Arizona woman went on trial Thursday on charges that she bludgeoned her husband to death with a hammer in what prosecutors said was an attempt to obtain an insurance settlement to pay a nearly 300,000 loan from her boyfriend. Prosecutor Michelle Arino said 36-year-old Marissa Suzanne Devault needed quick money to get out of her deep financial hole. 'The defendant likes money, and she likes easy money,' Arino said during opening statements. But one of Devault's attorneys raised questions about the credibility of his client's boyfriend, who was given an immunity agreement on child pornography allegations in exchange for his testimony. Scroll down for video. Hammer murder: Marissa Devault listens to the prosecutors' opening statement during her trial at the Superior Court in Phoenix, Arizona on Thursday February 6. Marissa Suzanne Devault, 36: She claims killing Dale Harrell was an act of self-defense and told investigators that her husband had physically and sexually abused her in the past. Dale Harrell, 34: He suffered multiple skull fractures at the couple's home in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert and died at a hospice nearly a month after the attack of complications from his head injuries. Authorities say Devault fatally wounded Dale Harrell by bludgeoning him over the head with a hammer as he slept in their suburban Phoenix home in January 2009. Harrell, 34, suffered multiple skull fractures and died at a hospice nearly a month after the attack of complications from his head injuries. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Devault. Devault claims she killed her husband in self-defense and told investigators that he had physically and sexually abused her in the past. But prosecutors contend that the attack on Harrell was premeditated and say Devault has given conflicting accounts of her husband's death. They also say the people Devault alleged were witnesses to the abuse didn't back up her claims. Alan Tavassoli, one of Devault's attorneys, said prosecutors are giving a pass to his client's boyfriend, businessman Allen Flores, even after he failed to report to police that Devault had allegedly claimed three days before the hammer attack that her husband had been killed in a tire-iron beating. 'He (Flores) is free and clear for this trial,' Tavassoli said. At first, Devault told investigators that Harrell had attacked her while she was asleep and choked her until she was unconscious. She told police that when she came to, she saw another man who lived at their Gilbert home beating Harrell with a hammer. But authorities say bloodstain patterns showed Harrell was alone in the bed at the time of the attack and that bloodstains on Devault's clothes were consistent with a person swinging an object repeatedly over her head. Confession: Devault initially told investigators that her husband had attacked her while she was asleep and choked her until she was unconscious. She also told police that when she came to, she saw another man who lived at their home beating Harrell with a hammer. Investigators say Devault later confessed, saying she attacked her sleeping husband in a rage after he had sexually assaulted her. Police say they discovered Devault had been dating another man, Flores, for more than two years. In a search of Flores' computer, police say they found a journal that appeared to be written from his perspective and indicated that he had given Devault about 7,000 which she used to hire a hit man, according to court records. The prosecution says Devault needed to repay a 294,000 loan from her boyfriend. Authorities say child pornography also was found on Flores' computer. County prosecutors granted Flores immunity on that allegation in exchange for his testimony in the murder case. Without such an agreement, Flores was expected to invoke his right against self-incrimination. Prosecutors say the immunity agreement doesn't prevent authorities from filing pornography charges against Flores. Instead, they say the agreement bars authorities from using any statement that Flores makes during the murder trial in a pornography case. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A woman named Marissa Suzanne Devault went on trial because she was accused of hitting her husband, Dale Harrell, with a hammer while he was sleeping. The people in charge think she did this to get money from insurance to pay back a big loan from her boyfriend. Marissa says she was defending herself because her husband hurt her. The lawyers are going to ask her boyfriend, Allen Flores, questions because he knew some things about what happened, but he can't get in trouble for other things they found on his computer because of a special agreement. The people in charge are trying to find out the truth about what happened and why."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hellenistic period The Attalid dynasty of Pergamum lasted little longer; a Roman ally until the end, its final king Attalus III died in 133 BC without an heir, and taking the alliance to its natural conclusion, willed Pergamum to the Roman Republic. The final Greek resistance came in 88 BC, when King Mithridates of Pontus rebelled against Rome, captured Roman held Anatolia, and massacred up to 100,000 Romans and Roman allies across Asia Minor. Many Greek cities, including Athens, overthrew their Roman puppet rulers and joined him in the Mithridatic wars. When he was driven out of Greece by the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who laid siege to Athens and razed the city. Mithridates was finally defeated by Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey the Great) in 65 BC. Further ruin was brought to Greece by the Roman civil wars, which were partly fought in Greece. Finally, in 27 BC, Augustus directly annexed Greece to the new Roman Empire as the province of Achaea. The struggles with Rome had left Greece depopulated and demoralised.

This is usually judged on the basis of meaning rather than the exact wording itself. In this particular case, 'hard' and 'difficult' can be used interchangeably in most contexts as they have the same implications. 'Readability' or 'ease of understanding' can differ based on individual perception and familiarity with the words used. But from a semantic standpoint, the words 'hard' and 'difficult' in this context are synonymous, and they don't change the implied meaning of the sentence. Moreover, the constructions 'It's hard to see why' and 'It is difficult to see why' are extremely common idiomatic expressions which mean that the speaker finds it challenging to understand the reason or the cause for a certain action or statement. Thus, the hypothesis 'It is difficult to see why' is logically following from the premise 'It's hard to see why', making the hypothesis entailed by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Because the emigrants were unfamiliar with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and church agents. One of the returning missionaries, Levi Savage, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women, and young children would lead to suffering, sickness, and even death. All of the other church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, perhaps as many as 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.Near Wood River, Nebraska, a herd of bison caused the Willie Company's cattle to stampede, and nearly 30 cattle were lost.

It was the second major Albanian victory over the Ottoman Empire. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Skanderbeg led the Albanian forces in the Battle of Mokra.","completion":"Yes, the next sentence follows and is consistent with the preceding text, as it provides additional information about Skanderbeg's role in the Battle of Mokra. Here's a more detailed and long answer about the Battle of Mokra and the events leading up to it: The Battle of Mokra in 1445 was a pivotal moment in the broader context of the Ottoman-Albanian Wars, which were fought between the emerging Albanian resistance, led by the celebrated military leader Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg, and the expansive Ottoman Empire under Sultan Murad II. The Battle of Mokra holds great historical significance as it was the second significant victory of Skanderbeg and the Albanian forces over the mighty Ottoman Empire, demonstrating their unwavering determination and skill despite being highly outnumbered. Before the Battle of Mokra, in 1444, Skanderbeg had already defeated the Ottomans in the Battle of Torvioll, which ignited a sense of unity and resistance among the Albanian people against their Ottoman oppressors. Following that initial victory, Skanderbeg formally renounced Ottoman vassalage and formed the League of Lezhë, uniting the Albanian principalities in their quest for independence. News of the League of Lezhë and the defeat of the Ottoman forces at Torvioll reached Murad II, who perceived Skanderbeg's actions as a direct challenge to his authority. As a result, he dispatched a retaliatory force under the command of Firuz Pasha to quell the Albanian resistance and punish Skanderbeg for his defiance. The stage was set for a confrontation between the two forces on October 10, 1445, near Mount Mokra (modern-day Makedonski Brod, Macedonia). Skanderbeg, a brilliant tactician known for his use of terrain and intelligence, deployed his forces skillfully. He took advantage of the rugged landscape of the region and his detailed knowledge of the area to his advantage, forcing Firuz Pasha's Ottoman forces into a disadvantageous position. Despite being outnumbered, the Albanian forces, under Skanderbeg's shrewd command, were able to outmaneuver and outfight the Ottoman forces in a series of skillful and daring maneuvers. The Ottomans were unprepared for the ferocity and determination of the Albanian resistance and soon began to waver. Eventually, Skanderbeg's forces crushed the Ottoman army, and Firuz Pasha was forced to retreat in humiliating defeat. The Battle of Mokra further reinforced Skanderbeg's reputation as a legendary and ingenious military leader. Moreover, it strengthened the resolve of the Albanian people in their fight for independence from the Ottoman Empire and inspired other regional powers to rise against the seemingly invincible Ottomans. As the second major victory over the Ottomans, the Battle of Mokra was a crucial catalyst for the future course of the Albanian resistance and helped shape the legacy of Skanderbeg as the national hero of Albania."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Police: New York Pharmacy Shooting Suspect Has Shown 'No Remorse' A former soldier accused of fatally shooting four people at a New York pharmacy during a robbery for painkillers has shown \\"no remorse\\" since his arrest, police said Thursday. Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said David Laffer, 33, and his wife, Melinda Brady, 29, were arrested Wednesday in connection with the Father's Day massacre at the Haven Drugs in Medford, about 60 miles east of New York City. \\"He has not been cooperating with our detectives and has shown no remorse,\\" Dormer said during a news conference. \\"It's very difficult to comprehend this. This is very unusual. We found out that there was no criminal background with [Laffer], and to suddenly engage in this behavior, it doesn't make sense.\\" Laffer pleaded not guilty later Thursday. He was ordered held without bail. Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney John Collins called the shooting at the \\"most cold-blooded robbery-homicide in Suffolk County history.\\" Collins said investigators recovered a matching fingerprint at the crime scene, and they also recovered the.45-caliber gun believed to have been used in the shootings. The weapon was registered to Laffer, and was found disassembled in his home, authorities said. Brady was accused of driving Laffer to the drug store before he entered and began firing. She was hospitalized on Thursday, but police refused to indicate why. She was charged with third-degree robbery and obstructing governmental administration for interfering with police during Wednesday's arrest, but it's unclear when she will be arraigned. \\"He was doing it because he lost his job and I was sick,\\" Brady said as she was led from Suffolk police headquarters in Yaphank. \\"He did it. He did all of this.\\" Earlier Thursday, Dormer said numerous weapons and an unspecified amount of ammunition were recovered from the couple's home. He did not elaborate. The pharmacy's registry was a key piece for detectives in locating Laffer. His name appeared on the drug store's customer list and both he and his wife were \\"obviously under the influence\\" of narcotics at the time of their arrest, Dormer said. Dozens of officers converged on Laffer's home early Wednesday, making a \\"dynamic\\" and effective entry, Dormer said. \\"The potential for violence was something we had to consider,\\" he said. \\"This was a very, very dangerous individual. So it had to be done quickly, effectively and with force.\\" Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy said more than 400 calls were received by police in connection to clear surveillance photos released by authorities following the \\"brutal, execution-type\\" Father's Day shooting. He praised \\"outstanding work\\" by detectives and warned against attempting to elude authorities after such a crime. \\"You're going to get caught,\\" Levy said. \\"You will not be able to hide. Hopefully this is the last such horrible event that we have to deal with in the future.\\" Friends and neighbors said if there were drug problems, they did not see it. He lived at his family's home in Medford with his mother, Pam, and his wife. According to their wedding announcement, Laffer and his future wife met while they were out to dinner with mutual friends, and he proposed to her at an Islanders game. \\"To Melinda's complete surprise, he had been planning the engagement for more than a year and his proposal was shown on the large TV screens in the arena,\\" according to the 2009 announcement. Next-door neighbor Trish Bohlert attended the wedding and said Laffer was always friendly. \\"Something must have made him snap, because his personality, I can't picture him robbing a store, much less hurt people,\\" she said. Zaida Ayala, a longtime neighbor, said Laffer is \\"a guy that I feel comfortable with, a guy that I could be out, 1 o'clock in the morning in my backyard, and he could be in his backyard and I wouldn't run inside and go get my husband.\\" She said she does not believe he is the shooter. \\"You could give me a million dollars to pick somebody and he would be the last person I would've picked,\\" she said. Laffer served in the Army from 1994 until 2002 and attained the rank of private first class, said Mark Edwards, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Human Resources Command in Fort Knox. While in the service, he worked as an intelligence analyst. His Facebook page showed he was interested in weapons and science fiction. He lists himself as a fan of the conspiracy-based science fiction drama \\"Dark Skies\\" and the Spike TV show \\"Deadliest Warrior.\\" He also lists Springfield XD, a type of pistol, among his interests. The wedding announcement said Laffer worked in logistics shipping and receiving. Laffer's victims have been identified as two employees, pharmacist Raymond Ferguson, 45, of Centereach, and store clerk Jennifer Mejia, 17, of East Patchogue, and two customers, Bryon Sheffield, 71, of Medford, and Jamie Taccetta, a 33-year-old woman from Farmingville. It was the worst mass killing in Suffolk County since 1974, when a man shot six relatives to death in Amityville, a crime that spawned horror films and a book after the family's home was said to be haunted. At the pharmacy, about a mile and a half away from the Laffer home, bouquets of fresh flowers, and stuffed animals lined the shuttered storefront.

Park officials are investigating how and why a 68-year-old man fell to his death in Acadia National Park on Monday, the National Park Service said Tuesday. Mark Simon of Glen Ridge, New Jersey, fell from a bluff between Sand Beach and Thunder Hole. Simon was a summer resident of Southwest Harbor. He and his wife had stopped on the Park Loop Road so he could photograph the sunset from an area off the Ocean Path. Simon’s wife waited for him in the car, but became concerned after the sun had set, and waved down a passing park ranger. Rangers located Simon’s backpack, and then saw his body at the bottom of a 40-foot drop. He was lying motionless at the water’s edge. Because of the steep terrain, park rangers could not reach him, and the U.S. Coast Guard was called to assist in recovering Simon’s body, which was only reached once the rising tide carried it into the water. While the fall appears accidental, the National Park Service said it would continue to investigate the circumstances Tuesday. Share ||||| Bill Trotter | BDN Bill Trotter | BDN By Bill Trotter , BDN Staff • June 7, 2016 12:32 pm Updated: June 7, 2016 4:59 pm ACADIA NATIONAL PARK, Maine — A New Jersey man died Monday night after falling from a seaside cliff in Acadia, according to park officials. Mark Simon, 68, a resident of Glen Ridge, New Jersey, who spent summers on Mount Desert Island in Southwest Harbor, is believed to have fallen from a cliff near Thunder Hole after going out on the rocks to take photographs of the sunset, Acadia National Park spokesman John Kelly said Tuesday. Simon’s wife stayed in their car in a nearby parking lot when Simon walked to the shore shortly after 7 p.m. to take photographs, Kelly said. After her husband did not return, she waved down a park ranger, who was driving by a few minutes after 9:30 p.m., he added. About a half-hour later, rangers found Simon’s backpack at the top of the cliff, which is about 40 feet tall, Kelly said. They saw him lying at the bottom of the cliff, but he was unresponsive to their calls. Because of Simon’s location, rangers requested assistance from the U.S. Coast Guard and from Mount Desert Island Search & Rescue, but the incoming tide carried Simon’s body offshore, Kelly said. The Coast Guard, which sent two boats to assist in the search, located and pulled Simon’s body from the water around 11:30 p.m. Simon’s body was taken to the Bar Harbor town pier, then was taken to the state medical examiner’s office in Augusta, according to Kelly. Mark Belserene, spokesman for the medical examiner’s office, said Tuesday afternoon that an autopsy has been performed on Simon but the cause of death is not expected to be determined for at least a few weeks, pending the results of lab tests. Kelly said that though Simon’s fall appears to be accidental, the National Park Service is investigating the circumstances of the incident. Falls are not uncommon in Acadia and, according to Kelly, are the main cause of injury in the park, whether they result in a twisted ankle or a fatality. During the busy summer months, park rangers have been known to deal with multiple simultaneous calls about hikers who have fallen and injured themselves. Most of those instances in which rangers provide assistance involve injuries that are not life-threatening and are considered relatively minor, according to Kelly. The last time someone is known to have died after taking a serious fall in Acadia was in 2012, when a University of Maine student fell off Precipice Trail. It is the second fatality in the park this year. In January, Ellsworth resident Timothy Philpott went missing while hiking in Acadia, prompting several searches over the ensuing days and weeks as weather conditions allowed. His remains were found in mid-April. Belserene said Tuesday that the medical examiner’s office subsequently determined that Philpott’s cause of death was “acute intoxication” from multiple prescription medications. ||||| BAR HARBOR, Maine (NEWS CENTER) — A man from Glen Ridge, N.J., fell to his death Monday at Acadia National Park.

She flagged down a passing park ranger vehicle around 9:30 p.m. Park rangers located Simon's backpack at the top of a bluff and discovered that he had fallen approximately 40 feet to the edge of the water below.

Obviously, Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon would be highly undesirable for Israel. But that has not been Israel's primary concern. Rather, the fear has been that Washington would end up finding a compromise with Iran that on the one hand would close off any Iranian path to a bomb, but on the other hand would lock in a shift in the regional balance of power in Israel's disfavor.

What is the missing first step of the following process: - Water is put in pipes in the coal-fired steam station - The coal is crushed - The coal is moved into a boiler along with hot air - The water is moving through pipes in the boiler - The steam from the water is blown against a turning mechanism - The force of the steam makes the mechanism turn - The mechanism generates electricity.","completion":"The missing first step in the process at a coal-fired steam station is the procurement and transportation of coal to the power plant. Here's the revised step-by-step process with the first step included: 1. Procurement and transportation of coal: Coal is mined from the ground at various locations around the world. Depending on the power plant's location, coal may be transported by trucks, trains, or even barges. Large quantities of coal are typically stored on site at the power plant to ensure a reliable energy supply. 2. Water is put in pipes in the coal-fired steam station: Water is supplied from a nearby river, lake, or other sources, and is transferred to the power plant via pipes or an open canal system. The water is then stored in a reservoir or tank within the plant. 3. The coal is crushed: Once the coal reaches the power plant, it is crushed into a fine powder using large machines called pulverizers. Crushing the coal increases its surface area, enabling it to burn more efficiently and heat the water more effectively. 4. The coal is moved into a boiler along with hot air: The crushed coal is then mixed with hot air and blown into the boiler. The hot air dries the coal and helps it burn more rapidly, generating a large amount of heat. 5. The water is moving through pipes in the boiler: As the coal burns, it heats the water that flows through a network of pipes in the boiler. This causes the water to turn into superheated steam, which is under high pressure. 6. The steam from the water is blown against a turning mechanism: The high-pressure steam is directed towards a turbine, which consists of a series of blades mounted on a central shaft. As the steam passes over the blades, it causes the turbine to spin. 7. The force of the steam makes the mechanism turn: The steam's energy is transferred to the spinning turbine, converting the thermal energy from the burning coal into mechanical energy. 8. The mechanism generates electricity: The spinning turbine is connected to an electric generator, which consists of stationary magnets and a rotating conductor (usually copper wires). As the conductor spins within the magnetic field, it generates an electric current. This electricity is then sent through transformers that adjust its voltage for transmission and distribution to homes and businesses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

See Crista Flanagan's Exclusive Nudes in the Cyber Club! Whether she's doing impressions on MADtv or mowing down executives on Mad Men, one thing is certain: There's never a dull moment when Crista Flanagan is involved. Case in point: the August issue of Playboy, featuring her incredibly sexy (and deliciously retro) nude pics! And that's only the beginning. Crista brings the same level of excitement to the Cyber Club, where you can see her complete nude pictorial with online-only outtakes. Sterling Cooper's naive office girl stark naked is truly a sight to behold. ||||| How do you find your place in a world that demeans, underestimates and ignores you, then treats you like a punch line when you're gone? This is the central question of \\" Mad Men's \\" \\"The Beautiful Girls,\\" but as always, the answers aren't very clear. Whether you draw lines in the sand, stomp your feet and act on principle, or surrender, whimper and weep, then try desperately to regain your footing, you'll still end up compromised. You either operate completely outside of the social norms and navigate the world around you with total disregard for what other people expect of you (like Peggy's friend Joyce), or you're constantly pushed into a subordinate role (like Joan, Peggy and Faye, sharing an alienated elevator ride at the end of the episode). This week we see what women give up to get what they want. Peggy compromises her principles (yet again) in order to remain in a position of power; Sally gives up her own safety and security and endangers her relationship with her mother in order to be closer to her father; Faye surrenders to Don's charms and to his innate sense of privilege in order to have some love in her life; and Joan gives in to Roger's relentless pursuit once it's clear that he's the only man (or person, for that matter) who offers her real support and comfort. Which of these women is honoring her ideals, and which is surrendering some crucial part of herself just to satisfy other people's expectations? \\"It's a business of sadists and masochists,\\" says Mrs. Blankenship to Peggy, \\"and you know which one you are.\\" Although the overarching theme of liberation vs. servitude was, at times, a little too omnipresent, echoing through every scene with the subtlety of a tuba honking away in the corner of a bar, there was still plenty to love in this episode, from Sally's big act of rebellion – and Betty's, whose response to Don telling her to \\"take some responsibility\\" was to force him to do just that – to Peggy's small act of drawing a line between the personal and the political. Of course, both of these gestures -- taking a stand, trying not to blur personal choices with politics -- are harbingers of the cultural turmoil that's just around the corner. Both Sally and Peggy show us how tough it is to stand up for yourself and get what you want at the same time. One minute you're putting your foot down, the next minute you're making your dad his own twisted version of a good breakfast, just substitute the matriarchal Mrs. Butterworth with a big bottle of rum (shaped as a pirate? Couldn't tell, but that would be fitting). As nice as it is to see Don fall for a woman who's strong and smart, he casts Faye in a submissive role almost immediately, not only asking her to take care of his daughter (Why her?) but asking her to soothe Sally out of her angry state as well. Faye is embarrassed by how bad she is with kids, and while she thinks the whole thing must be a test, she overestimates him. The truth is, he forced that role onto her unthinkingly, because that's what he does with women. Once she points it out, even though she tries to angrily suggest that choosing her career over children is perfectly valid, even though he soothes her, there's something strained in Don's face that suggests that both her vulnerability and her inability to play a traditional mothering role make her less appealing in his eyes. He expects her to be formidable and a nurturer -- even though he doesn't remotely manage this tightrope walk himself. Don's shortcomings, in fact, are best summed up by his exchange with the woman who rescues Sally from the train. \\"Men never know what's going on,\\" she grumbles at him. \\"I offered you money and I said thank you,\\" Don replies, summing up his entire approach to women, from his whore to his former secretary Allison. In spite of his best intentions (and his very real friendship with Anna), Don's ability to genuinely engage with women -- on an intimate level, as equals in the office, or in a father-daughter relationship -- is limited, and it hurts him nearly as much as it hurts them. Which brings us to the one relationship that breaks out of this rather impoverished mold -- emotionally, at least. As neatly as Joan and Roger's ill-fated pairing fits into the larger picture of women being forced to yield their own better judgment for the sake of men, something between these two really exists on its own magical planet. For all of the demeaning clichés and power imbalances inherent in an affair between a secretary and an executive, Joan and Roger have always been the real star-crossed lovers of \\"Mad Men,\\" and it's tough not to cheer when they wind up in each other's arms. Although he presents himself as an empty shell of a man, drinking himself into oblivion over the irrelevance of his life's work and the frustrations of his new marriage to what Henry Francis' mom might call a \\"silly woman,\\" Roger always comes alive when Joan is around. With Joan, Roger shows us his best side -- his gentleness, his protective instincts, his sense of humor -- but he's also vulnerable enough to admit that he's feeling lost. He may be trying to seduce her every second of every day, but Roger's seductions, at least when it comes to Joan, feel painfully sincere. While Don jokes to Faye when he leaves her, \\"I'm taking everything interesting with me,\\" Roger never treats Joan as anything but the most important and interesting person in the room. Sure, we've seen how Joan has always known just how to appeal to Roger's sense of himself as a man, conjuring up the cooing of Marilyn Monroe with far less of Monroe's uncertainty or fragility. But we also have a sense that, despite appearances, Joan's appeal for Roger doesn't depend entirely on the fact that she never fully belongs to him. That's obviously part of it, of course (\\"He won't be happy 'til he turns you out,\\" as Joyce puts it to Peggy). If any woman is a pot, it's Joan, and what could you want more than a really beautiful, expensive pot that doesn't belong to you anymore? Nonetheless, we can see that Roger's love for her transcends her usefulness or her sex appeal or even his interest in conquest. This ultimately human take on Joan and Roger points to one of the real strengths of \\"Mad Men\\": even as every little line of dialogue and every throwaway scene echoes the central premise and reflects some central conflict inherent to the times, each character is still treated as a human being. Just as no human being consistently represents one stance or another, no character on \\"Mad Men\\" is entirely flattened out for the sake of making a point. Likewise, there are some bonds on this show that clearly exist between two human beings (as opposed to two characters), bonds that have the power to sidestep the norms of the time: there's Don and Anna, Peggy and Don (most notably in \\"The Suitcase\\") and, finally, Roger and Joan. And man, the slow burn of repression and self-abnegation on this show really makes you exalt in a real pair of soul mates, sharing their secrets, at last. It's impossible not to love Joan and Roger together, no matter how imperfect the circumstances might be. I love how Roger rises to the occasion when Joan is around; I love how he handles both the news of her husband being sent to Vietnam and the mugging perfectly. Sure, he's invigorated by the sense that he's needed, that she's someone who needs saving. But she does need saving -- as good a pot as Joan is, she's also a damsel in distress at some essential level. She paints herself into that corner by casting herself as sex kitten/schoolmarm at the office, by neglecting to address matters directly or take what's rightfully hers, by playing her cards so close to her chest, by refusing to make friends or admit it when her personal life is far from perfect. Nonetheless, Joan is supremely capable and strong and therefore hard not to admire. Remember that great scene last season when, as Greg is falling apart, Joan impresses his colleague's wife with her smooth, calm, very mature ability to handle anything? The wife rightly judges Joan as the real star and force to be reckoned with in that marriage. We know that Joan deserves someone who's enthralled by her particular powers, and as backward as Roger can seem, it really does take a guy as old-fashioned as him to do the job right. If those two together represent all of the outdated, regressive aspects of coupling in the '50s, they also reflect the deeply romantic aspects of those days as well. Like any soul mates, separately, Joan and Roger are two halves of a whole. Together, they make perfect sense. His unfocused longing finds focus in his desire and in his role as protector; her reserve and her manipulative ways transform into strengths in his eyes. She can feel proud of her feminine wiles (instead of encountering them as liabilities, as she does in the office these days) and she can relish her own capability (of which Roger is also in awe, since he's about as capable, in day-to-day life, as a small child). Even though, through Mrs. Blankenship, we see what happens to a woman who spends her entire life serving men, Joan is only headed down that path if she does the so-called right thing and stays loyal to her husband. \\"I feel something. And I know you do, too,\\" Roger tells Joan, hinting at what we see, week after week: The two of them can't feel much without each other. Without Joan, Roger is a morose drunk destined to die in the office, and without Roger, Joan is a dutiful zero. This series isn't big on happy endings, but somehow it's tough not to hope that Roger and Joan eventually make a sweet old-fashioned nest and grow old together. Even if it never happens, there's something gratifying about just wanting that for them, or simply recognizing how lovely their somewhat archaic roles can be, in spite of the obvious tides of change propelling all of these characters toward the tumult of the late '60s. In spite of the fact that we should know better, we can't help but hope that Roger's words -- \\"She died like she lived, surrounded by the people she answered phones for\\" – won't apply to Joan, in the end. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Crista Flanagan, known for her roles in MADtv and Mad Men, appeared in a retro-themed nude pictorial in the August issue of Playboy.

This last work of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country before he moved to Hollywood to become a big star with movies like \\"Total Recall\\", \\"Basic Instinct\\" and \\"Starship Troopers\\" is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author (Jeroen Krabbe) going to the seaside for recovering. There he meets a mysterious femme fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and starts a fatal love affair with her. He becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstances... \\"De vierde man\\" is much influenced by the old Hollywood film noire and the psycho thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells. It takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere, and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to push the story straight forward.

They all agree to buy the Butler mansion on behalf of the town for the bargain price of 50,000, which Jeffrey Butler requires to be paid in cash the next day. Carter and Ingrid stay the night at the Butler mansion, unaware that they are being watched by an unseen man who has just escaped from a local mental hospital and just arrived in East Willard in a stolen car. After dinner, Carter and Ingrid retreat to a bedroom to have sex. Their unknown stalker enters the bedroom and brutally murders them both with an ax, and then reads from a Bible before placing a crucifix in Ingrid's hand. The killer calls the sheriff, asking him to come investigate Carter's disappearance, and introduces himself as the house's owner. While talking with Tess, who forwards his call, he calls himself \\"Marianne\\". At nightfall, Jeffrey Butler arrives at the mansion to meet with Carter, but finds it locked and empty. He drives to the mayor's home, where he meets Diane, the mayor's daughter. The mayor has gone to the county's bank to obtain the required cash for the payment, so she redirects Jeffrey to the sheriff's office. At the same time, the sheriff is heading to the mansion, but stops at Wilfred Butler's disturbed gravesite, where he finds Butler's diary, then he's attacked and bludgeoned to death with a shovel by the same homicidal madman.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who writes a note containing frequent usage of the word \\"cunt\\"? , can you please find it? In 1935 England, Briony Tallis is a 13-year-old from a wealthy family. She has just completed writing her first play to mark her brother's homecoming and plans to stage it later that day with her visiting cousins. Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke. A part fell into the pond, and Cecilia jumped in to retrieve it, but to Briony, it looked as if Robbie had ordered Cecilia to undress and go under the water. Robbie drafts a series of notes to Cecilia apologizing for the incident, namely breaking the vase and laughing about it. One contains an explicit expression of his sexual desire for her, including frequent and crude usage of the word \\"cunt\\": he writes it only as a joke, and it makes him laugh to himself. He writes another, more formal letter, and asks Briony to deliver it. Only after she has gone does he realise he has given her the explicit letter. Briony reads the letter before giving it to Cecilia. Later, she describes it to her older visiting cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a \\"sex maniac\\". Paul Marshall, a visiting friend of Briony's older brother's and a chocolate magnate, introduces himself to the visiting cousins and appears to be attracted to Lola. Before dinner, Robbie apologises for the obscene letter, but Cecilia surprises him and confesses her secret love for him. They then proceed to make passionate love in the library when Briony walks in, and thinks that Cecilia is under attack. Cecilia and Robbie try to pass the incident off.","completion":"The full name of the person who writes a note containing frequent usage of the word \\"cunt\\" is Robbie Turner.

This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere). The Welsh prose tale Culhwch and Olwen (c. 1100), included in the modern Mabinogion collection, has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur's men, though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place. The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen, daughter of Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant, by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks, including the hunt for the great semi-divine boar Twrch Trwyth. The 9th-century Historia Brittonum also refers to this tale, with the boar there named Troy(n)t. Finally, Arthur is mentioned numerous times in the Welsh Triads, a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition and legend which are classified into groups of three linked characters or episodes to assist recall. The later manuscripts of the Triads are partly derivative from Geoffrey of Monmouth and later continental traditions, but the earliest ones show no such influence and are usually agreed to refer to pre-existing Welsh traditions. Even in these, however, Arthur's court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole, with \\"Arthur's Court\\" sometimes substituted for \\"The Island of Britain\\" in the formula \\"Three XXX of the Island of Britain\\". While it is not clear from the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae that Arthur was even considered a king, by the time Culhwch and Olwen and the Triads were written he had become Penteyrnedd yr Ynys hon, \\"Chief of the Lords of this Island\\", the overlord of Wales, Cornwall and the North.In addition to these pre-Galfridian Welsh poems and tales, Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae.

The first sensible lesson is that you shouldn't bother trying to find your way in the dark at all, but just stay put until dawn. Because then you won't trip over things? No, mainly because you'll have an idea of direction. The sun rises in the east. But you will be amazed at how many people forget they know that. Apparently, the area underneath a holly bush provides a good makeshift shelter -- they are thick, and evergreen. The next thing to do -- or rather not to do -- is panic, for the obvious reason that unless there is someone there to hear you scream, it will get you nowhere. Just try to think of nice, happy things. There is always a point in films when a person who is lost in the desert or the snow, dehydrated and exhausted, comes across a set of their own footprints and realizes they have just walked in a huge, round circle. It is wrong to owe it to the unequal strengths or different lengths of your legs. Experiments prove that, without the sun or the moon (or landmarks) as a fixed guide, lots of small errors add up over time so the brain can't correctly identify the \\"straight ahead\\" direction. To just get out of somewhere, pick a spot on the horizon and just head for it. There are several ways to find directions in the dark, and by far the best is to establish north using the stars. Most people can identify the Plough, which is part of Ursa Major. It looks a lot like a saucepan. The Plough rotates through the sky, but let's imagine the saucepan lying horizontally , with its handle on the left. You need to trace a line from the star at the right-hand base of the pan, through the star at the right-hand rim , and follow it upwards; the north star is roughly five times the distance between those two \\"pointer\\" stars. Then drop a vertical line from the North Star to the horizon and that's north. \\"Tonight is very cloudy and I can't see the Plough.\\" Maybe luckily, it is quite windy.

It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me.

Write an article based on this \\"Obtain a Transfer of Title form. Complete the form. Submit the form and pay the fee. Update your vehicle registration. Inform your insurance company.\\"","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Transferring Vehicle Titles Introduction The process of transferring a vehicle title can be confusing for anyone not familiar with the requirements and steps involved. In this article, we will provide a step-by-step guide to help you understand how to successfully obtain a Transfer of Title form, complete it, submit the necessary documents, update your vehicle registration, and inform your insurance company. By following these instructions, you'll ensure a smooth and hassle-free title transfer experience. Step 1: Obtain a Transfer of Title Form The first step in the process is to obtain a Transfer of Title form, also referred to as the Application for Title and/or Registration. This form can typically be found at your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or county tax office. In some cases, you may be able to download it from your state's DMV website. Make sure to get the correct form for your state, as the requirements may vary. Step 2: Complete the Transfer of Title Form Once you have the form, fill it out with the necessary information. The form will usually require the following details: - Vehicle Information: The make, model, year, and vehicle identification number (VIN) of the vehicle being transferred. This information can be found on the vehicle's current title or registration card. - Seller and Buyer Information: The names, addresses, contact details, and driver's license numbers of both the seller and buyer. - Sales Price and Tax Information: The total purchase price of the vehicle and the appropriate sales tax that will need to be paid, based on your state's tax laws. - Odometer Disclosure Statement: The current odometer reading of the vehicle must be disclosed, in accordance with the Federal Truth in Mileage Act. If the vehicle is exempt from this requirement due to its age or other factors, be sure to complete the appropriate sections. - Lien Information (if applicable): If the vehicle has any outstanding liens, provide the lienholder's name and contact information. In most cases, the lien must be paid off before a title transfer can be completed. Ensure that the information is complete, accurate, and legible to avoid delays and additional fees. In some states, the form may require notarization. Step 3: Gather and Submit Additional Required Documents Along with the completed Transfer of Title form, other documents may be required depending on the state. These may include: - Certificate of Title: The original title from the seller, signed and dated, to transfer ownership. - Bill of Sale: A document that outlines the details of the vehicle sale, including the seller and buyer's information, purchase price, and date of sale. - Emissions Test Certification: If your state requires emissions testing, you'll need to submit proof that the vehicle has passed the appropriate tests. - Vehicle Safety Inspection: Some states require safety inspections before registering a vehicle. Submit the relevant documentation if applicable. Step 4: Pay the Required Fees Once you have gathered all the required documents, submit them to your local DMV or county tax office. Along with the application, you will need to pay a title transfer fee. The amount of this fee varies depending on the state, and additional fees may apply for services like car registration, license plates, or late title transfers. Contact your local office to confirm the exact fees you will need to pay. Step 5: Update Your Vehicle Registration After the title transfer is completed, you'll need to update your vehicle registration. This process will vary by state but typically includes providing proof of insurance, paying registration fees, and displaying updated registration stickers or license plates on your vehicle. Make sure to check with your local DMV office for specific requirements. Step 6: Inform Your Insurance Company Finally, as a new vehicle owner, you must inform your insurance company about the title transfer. This is critical to update your coverage and ensure that you have the necessary protection in the event of an accident or theft. If you purchased the vehicle from a dealership, they might have assisted with this step. However, if you purchased the vehicle from a private party, you would need to handle this process yourself. Conclusion Transferring a vehicle title might seem complex, but by following this step-by-step guide, you can successfully navigate the process. When you have completed each step, ensure that you store all necessary documents in a safe place for future reference. By properly transferring the title, updating your registration, and informing your insurance company, you'll be ready to enjoy your new vehicle with peace of mind."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, it could not be replicated. No other studies could find a link between the vaccine and autism. As a result, scientists became convinced that the original results were incorrect. Eventually, investigators determined that the original study was a fraud. They learned that its author had received a large amount of money to find evidence that the vaccine causes autism, so he faked his research results. If other scientists had not tried to replicate the research, the truth might never have come out. You can read more about this case at the URL below.

I'm going to do a pro & con list to make it as easy as possible to lay out my thoughts about the restaurant. Consider my review more like a 3.5. Background/Facts: - I've eaten at Monte more times than I can count. - I visit mostly for breakfast and brunch. - I've been to Cafe Monte several times for dinner. - My husband has celiac disease and cannot have any gluten. I'll do the con first so as to end on a positive note. Con: - Biggest problem is food quality consistency. I tend to find a favorite dish and order it over and over again. Doing things this way makes me aware of any changes made to the dishes (also, simply the poor execution of said dishes). So, for example, I can't help but notice when the English muffins served as part of Monte's Classic Eggs Benedict suddenly become smaller and very hard. I wonder each time I order Eggs Benedict if the poached eggs will be runny as one would expect or hard boiled. I detect when a chef uses way too much onion in the quiche Florentine, and I lament when the quiche is hopelessly soggy. Knowing that the food can be fantastic on the next visit keeps me coming to Monte. I just wish they could tighten things up when it comes to the consistency of ingredients and food/cooking quality. Pros: - Beautiful atmosphere. Sun streams in during the mornings, and the restaurant feels romantic at night. The music from French artists adds to the delightful feeling at Monte. I like the furnishing and decor choices whoever designed the space made. It hits on a lot of what Americans expect French cafe dining to feel like, but it does it without being overly Disney-fied. Also, there's usually plenty of parking close by. - Servers are always friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, which is especially important when dealing with the gluten-free thing. We eat there so much, the employees know us by name or at least face. - Coffee is always great! - Great place to take out-of-town guests. So there you have it. Cafe Monte will remain on my restaurant list in maximum rotation, but I am watching the consistency issue. I hope I am not let down.","completion":"Alright kiddo, let me explain this review like we are talking about a toy shop.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"Jumping rope is a great form of cardiovascular exercise that can be easily incorporated into your daily routine. To help you accomplish this goal, I will provide a comprehensive guide on how to jump rope, covering all the necessary steps, techniques, and tips. By following these instructions and practicing consistently, you will master this fun and effective workout in no time. 1. Choose the right jump rope: Before you start, it's important to select a jump rope that fits your height and skill level. If you're a beginner, look for a durable and adjustable rope with comfortable handles. Once you gain more experience, you can experiment with different types of ropes, like speed ropes or weighted ropes. 2. Adjust the rope length: To ensure the proper length, step on the middle of the rope with one foot and pull the handles up to your armpits. Ideally, the ends of the rope should reach your armpit area. If necessary, adjust the rope length by tying knots or cutting the rope and reattaching the handles. 3. Hold the rope handles correctly: Grip the handles firmly but not too tightly, with your palms facing upwards. Make sure your thumbs are on top, and your index fingers are slightly below the handles. 4. Find a suitable place to jump: Choose a flat and even surface that provides sufficient grip to avoid slipping. Avoid jumping on surfaces like concrete or asphalt that can be hard on your joints. Grass, rubber mats, or hardwood floors are preferable. 5. Practice your stance: Stand up straight with your feet hip-width apart and knees slightly bent. Keep your head up and maintain eye contact with an imaginary point in front of you. Your elbows should be bent at a 90-degree angle and positioned close to your body, with your wrists slightly above your hips. 6. Learn the swinging technique: Begin swinging the rope without jumping, focusing on generating the momentum from your wrists and not your arms. Allow the rope to swing in a smooth and controlled manner, with a consistent pace. 7. Master your timing: As the rope approaches your feet, practice your jump timing. The best moment to jump is when the rope is about to touch the ground. Jump only a few inches off the ground, just enough to clear the rope. Keep your knees bent and land on the balls of your feet. 8. Start jumping: Start by practicing single jumps, swinging the rope and jumping once as the rope passes beneath your feet. Try to establish a consistent rhythm and maintain a steady pace. You can also incorporate counting to help keep track of your jumps. 9. Improve your technique: As your skill level improves, work on refining your posture, jumping higher or faster, and trying new techniques like alternate foot jumps, high knees, or double unders. This will not only help you become more efficient but also add variety to your jump rope workouts. 10. Practice consistently: Like any skill, practice makes perfect. Dedicate time to practicing your jump rope techniques regularly, and you will see improvements in your coordination, stamina, and overall performance. Remember that jumping rope can be challenging initially, so it is important to be patient and allow yourself time to develop your skills. As you become more proficient with the jump rope, you can increase the duration and intensity of your workouts, set personal goals, and enjoy the numerous benefits that jumping rope offers."},{"prompt":"Q:Question: Where does the water run-off overflow end up?

We will subtract 14j from both sides to move all j terms to the right side, and then add 189 to both sides to move all constants to the left side. Equation: 14j - 189 = 20j - 129 Subtract 14j from both sides: -189 = 6j - 129 Step 2: Move the constants to the other side. Now, add 129 to both sides of the equation to move the constant to the left side: -189 + 129 = 6j - 129 + 129 -60 = 6j Step 3: Solve for the variable j by dividing both sides by the coefficient of j. In this case, the coefficient of j is 6. So, we will divide both sides of the equation by 6: -60 / 6 = 6j / 6 -10 = j So, the solution to the equation 14j - 189 = 20j - 129 is j = -10."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article with the title: \\"For Christie and N.J.âs 2 Senators, No Love Lost\\"","completion":"Title: For Christie and N.J.'s 2 Senators, No Love Lost Introduction: As political tensions run high in New Jersey, the strained relationship between former Governor Chris Christie and the state's two Senators, Cory Booker and Robert Menendez, has become increasingly apparent. There is no love lost between these three prominent political figures, each representing different approaches to governance and embodying the state's changing political landscape. Step 1: Brief background on each political figure In order to establish context for the reader, I will provide a brief background and profile of Chris Christie, Cory Booker, and Robert Menendez. Chris Christie, a Republican, served as the Governor of New Jersey from 2010 to 2018. Notorious for his brash and confrontational style, Christie was once considered a potential presidential candidate. However, the infamous \\"Bridgegate\\" scandal and other controversies dampened his prospects, and he eventually endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Cory Booker, a rising star in the Democratic Party, has represented New Jersey in the US Senate since 2013. Previously the mayor of Newark, Booker is known for his charisma, social media savvy, and progressive policy stances. In 2020, he launched an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Robert Menendez, a more seasoned Democrat, has been a U.S. Senator from New Jersey since 2006. Menendez has focused on foreign policy and national security issues during his tenure, but his career was almost derailed by corruption charges in 2015 that ultimately ended in a mistrial. Step 2: Highlight reasons for discord Next, I will discuss the factors that created tension between these three politicians, including policy issues, political ambition, and personal animosity. 1. Policy disagreements: As a Republican governor in a largely Democratic state, Christie often clashed with Booker and Menendez on various policy issues, including healthcare, education, and immigration. The two Democratic senators frequently criticized Christie's administration for its handling of the state's budget, infrastructure, and response to Hurricane Sandy. 2. Political ambition: All three politicians had, at various points, aspirations for higher office. This competition for recognition and influence brought them into conflict with each other. For example, during the 2016 presidential race, Christie and Booker exchanged barbs on the campaign trail, with Christie criticizing Booker's progressive agenda as out-of-step with New Jersey voters. 3. Personal animosity: In addition to policy and political differences, personality clashes also fueled the discord between Christie and the two senators. Christie's brash and combative nature often rubbed his Democratic counterparts the wrong way, leading to heated exchanges and public feuds. Step 3: Discuss the implications of this discord for New Jersey Lastly, I will explore the consequences of this strained relationship on New Jersey's political climate and governance. The animosity between Christie, Booker, and Menendez has undoubtedly had an impact on policy-making and governance in the state. In some cases, it may have hindered bipartisan cooperation on key issues or even led to negative consequences for New Jersey residents when federal funding or legislation was at stake. On the other hand, this tension has also reflected the state's diverse political base, with different voices and perspectives shaping policy debates. Conclusion: The strained relationship between Chris Christie, Cory Booker, and Robert Menendez demonstrates the ever-changing and complex nature of New Jersey's political landscape. As long-time public servants, they have each faced challenges and controversies in their careers, yet their feuding also reflects the state's unique mixture of political ideologies. While this discord may have hindered cooperation at times, it has also given New Jerseyans a chance to witness the full spectrum of policy debates and see democracy in action."},{"prompt":"Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

President Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton “lied many times to the FBI and nothing happened to her .” In fact the FBI director told Congress that there was “no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI.” Trump also left the false impression that the FBI deviated from its standard practice by not putting Clinton under oath when she was interviewed last year about her email use while secretary of state. He claimed it was “the most incredible thing anyone has ever seen.” It’s not incredible or even unusual. Trump Dec. 4: I will say this: Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI and nothing happened to her . Flynn lied and they destroyed his life. I think it’s a shame. Hillary Clinton on the Fourth of July weekend went to the FBI not under oath — it was the most incredible thing anyone has ever seen. She lied many times. Nothing happened to her . Flynn lied and it’s like they ruined his life. It’s very unfair. Trump is referring to the FBI’s three-hour-plus interview with Clinton on July 2 2016 near the end of the agency’s investigation into whether she or her staff mishandled classified information. The investigation stemmed from Clinton ’s decision to exclusively use a private email account and personal server when conducting official government business. Three days after the FBI interviewed Clinton then-FBI Director James Comey announced that he would not recommend filing charges against Clinton . He said that she and her staff were “extremely careless” in handling classified information but the FBI did not find evidence that their actions were intentional. The FBI also did not find that Clinton lied to the FBI contrary to Trump’s claim. After announcing the outcome of the FBI investigation Comey testified on July 7 2016 before the House oversight committee about his decision not to recommend pressing charges. Chairman Jason Chaffetz specifically asked Comey if Clinton lied. Chaffetz July 7 2016: Did Hillary Clinton lie? Comey: To the FBI? We have no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI. Chaffetz: Did she lie to the public? Comey: That’s a question I’m not qualified to answer. I can speak about what she said to the FBI. Republicans have long maintained that Clinton “lied” to the public about her email use. And we have certainly written numerous stories about how Clinton provided the public with false and misleading information about her email use. That’s what happened in Clinton ’s case. On Sept. 2 2016 the FBI released a summary of Clinton ’s statements to the FBI. As for Clinton the FBI had “no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI ” as Comey said. But under the law if she “knowingly and willfully” made false statements to conceal “a material fact ” then she could have been charged with a crime whether she was under oath or not.","completion":"Trump's False Claims about Clinton and the FBI"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Failure in Afghan police search may have led to U.S. deaths near Bagram air base The bodies of six U.S. service members killed by a suicide bomber near Bagram air base in Afghanistan are returned to the United States. (Reuters) BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan — It was just after 1 p.m. here Monday when Marine Gunnery Sgt. Sean Fagan heard the blast and felt its shock wave shake his vehicle. “Then we heard them come up on the radio calling for help,” Fagan recalled. An Afghan had just detonated an improvised explosive device packed with ball bearings after being allowed to ride his motorcycle into a patrol of U.S. airmen and Afghan national police. Five were killed immediately, and another would die in the following hours. Two other airmen and an American interpreter were wounded. According to U.S. personnel familiar with the incident, Afghan national police had failed to thoroughly search the suicide bomber and his motorbike before allowing him to proceed through the patrol. The airmen were all with the Air Force’s Office of Special Investigations, a military law enforcement unit. The six deaths marked the single largest loss of American life at the hands of the enemy since NATO officially ended its combat mission in Afghanistan last year. [In Afghanistan, a series of attacks on Americans during ‘non-combat’ operations] Fagan, 32, along with his team of four other Marines and a squad of a dozen Georgian soldiers were about 400 yards away when the motorcycle and its driver exploded. As part of a small contingent of roughly 50 Marines advising and assisting Georgian soldiers who are tasked with security for Bagram air base, Fagan’s team had just established a temporary outpost two miles from this sprawling base when they heard the explosion. According to Fagan, after the airmen’s radio call, he grabbed Marine Staff Sgt. Michael Henderson and Navy Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Mitch Heimlich and headed to the scene. “Hendo grabbed the litter and Doc [Heimlich] grabbed his med bag,” Fagan recalled. The other two Marines, the team’s driver and the vehicle’s turret gunner remained behind, eventually moving their armored truck to provide security at the blast site. The sailor and two Marines sprinted toward the scene of the explosion, now marked with lingering smoke and a dust cloud. Just behind them and separated by a small canal were the Georgian troops, who were also running toward the wounded Americans. The Marines, who had passed the airmen’s patrol earlier in the day, were familiar with their Air Force counterparts’ whereabouts. This, according to Fagan, helped his guys get there in roughly five minutes. They would be the first on the scene. When they arrived, Henderson helped establish security around the blast site while Heimlich and a Georgian medic began triaging the wounded. When the motorcycle exploded, the patrol had been in a small corridor, wedged between two walls separated by a small canal and two paths. The close confines provided by the two adjacent walls created a funnel for the explosion, increasing the lethality of the blast. “There was nowhere for them to go,” Heimlich said. The small team went to work, choking through the lingering smoke and debris. After a quick assessment, it was clear that five of the airmen were already dead. According to Heimlich, 33, and the team’s de facto medic, everyone on scene was working — including Afghan police and the three airmen who had been near the blast but remained unscathed. “We all started working on the patients,” said Fagan, who, as a reservist, is a paramedic back home in Long Beach, Calif. “We started stripping them down, putting on chest seals and dropping nasopharyngeals [airways].” Those killed in the attack were: Staff Sgt. Michael A. Cinco, 28, of Mercedes, Tex.; Staff Sgt. Louis M. Bonacasa, 31, of Coram, N.Y.; Tech. Sgt. Joseph G. Lemm, 45, of the Bronx; Staff Sgt. Chester J. McBride, 30, of Statesboro, Ga.; Staff Sgt. Peter W. Taub, 30, of Philadelphia; and Maj. Adrianna M. Vorderbruggen, 36, of Plymouth, Minn​. Heimlich, the most medically experienced responder on the scene, spent the majority of his time supervising patient care and ensuring that everyone was getting the right equipment. “I couldn’t stay on one, it was just too much,” Heimlich said. “I had to get them on litters. . . . I basically was just moving from patient to patient to patient consistently throughout the entire time.” After the initial burst of patient care and scene assessment, Fagan, a joint terminal attack controller, or JTAC, immediately began relaying information about the casualties to a flight of Army AH-64 Apaches overhead. The gunships had been assigned to the small Marine detachment in the minutes prior to the suicide attack and would prove invaluable in the coming hours as they provided security and helped relay the casualty information — or “Nine-Line” — to the tactical operation center at Bagram. With the patient information transmitted, Fagan, with help from the two gunships, located a safe landing zone near the blast. The command center at Bagram then dispatched Army medical evacuation helicopters to the scene. With the air base just miles away, the helicopters were overhead in minutes. The first helicopters took the wounded while additional non-medical transport helicopters were dispatched to retrieve those who had been killed, known over the radio as the “heroes.” “We moved to the landing zone with the five heroes, and the mission-ready Black Hawks arrived with litters and body bags,” Fagan said. “We loaded the bodies into the body bags, and then those birds took off.” As the last of the dead were removed from the scene, a second quick-reaction force arrived, followed by an Army explosive ordinance disposal team tasked with analyzing the blast site. It was just after 2 p.m. Thomas Gibbons-Neff is a staff writer and a former Marine infantryman.","completion":"A suicide bomber on a motorcycle attacked a patrol of US airmen and Afghan national police near Bagram air base in Afghanistan, killing six US service members.

Apply a fertilizer with nitrate and no chlorine. Keep tobacco in an area with 6 hours of sunlight. Water the tobacco so the soil is wet, but not drenched. Cut off flowers as they begin to form.","completion":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Transplanting and Caring for Tobacco Seedlings Introduction Tobacco (Nicotiana) is a popular and versatile plant, often grown for its ornamental or commercial value. Transplanting and caring for tobacco seedlings require careful attention and adequate knowledge to ensure their proper growth and thriving. This article offers a step-by-step guide on how to transplant tobacco seedlings and care for them as they grow. Step 1: Preparing the Seedlings Before transplanting, it's crucial to choose healthy seedlings with a good chance of survival. Pluck out half the sprouts from the cell tray by carefully using tweezers, removing the weaker seedlings and leaving only the strongest ones. This step ensures a higher success rate for transplantation, as healthier seedlings are more likely to adapt and thrive in new growing conditions. Step 2: Transplanting the Seedlings When the seedlings are 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) tall, they are ready to be transplanted into pots or garden beds. Carefully remove the seedlings from their cell tray, taking care not to damage their delicate roots. Create a small hole in the soil, deep enough to accommodate the roots of the seedling, and gently place the seedling into the hole. Cover the roots with soil, and ensure the stem's base is supported and upright. Step 3: Fertilizing the Seedlings Apply a fertilizer specially formulated for tobacco plants. It should have a high nitrate content and be free from chlorine, which can harm the seedlings. Following the fertilizer's instructions, apply a sufficient amount to the soil around the seedlings to provide them with essential nutrients for growth. Step 4: Ensuring Adequate Sunlight Tobacco plants require at least six hours of sunlight each day for optimal growth. Place the transplanted seedlings in an area with enough sun exposure, either in a sunny windowsill or a well-lit spot outdoors. Monitor the seedlings to ensure they are receiving sufficient sunlight to grow strong and healthy. Step 5: Watering the Tobacco Plants For tobacco plants to thrive, they need the right balance of moisture in their soil. Ensure that the soil is wet, but not drenched, by watering the plants evenly around the base. Overwatering can lead to root rot and other issues, so monitor the soil and adjust your watering schedule as necessary. Step 6: Pruning and Flower Removal As the tobacco plants grow, they may begin to form flowers, which should be removed to encourage further growth and optimal leaf development. With clean, sharp shears or scissors, carefully cut off any flowers as they begin to form, taking care not to harm the plant's structure. Conclusion Transplanting and caring for tobacco seedlings can be a rewarding experience if done correctly. Following these six steps will ensure your tobacco plants have the best possible start in their new growing environment, allowing them to flourish and provide you with a beautiful and bountiful crop."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Psychiatrists are medical doctors who have completed a psychiatric residency. They are the most extensively trained psychological professionals and are usually the best source to help you manage prescription medications. They are also trained in the diagnosis of mental illnesses, including severe illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Clinical Psychologists have a doctoral degree in psychology and have usually completed internships or residencies in mental health facilities. They can diagnose mental illnesses, administer psychological tests, and provide psychotherapy. Unless they have a special license, they usually cannot write prescriptions. Psychiatric or Mental Health Nurse Practitioners have at least a master’s degree and specialized training in mental health. They can diagnose mental illnesses and prescribe medication. In some cases they can also provide psychotherapy. Depending on your state, they may be required to work in conjunction with a psychiatrist. Social Workers have at least a master’s degree in social work. Licensed Clinical Social Workers have completed internships or residencies in mental health facilities and have had training in mental health counseling. They can provide therapy but cannot prescribe medications. They are usually very familiar with social support systems and resources. Counselors have a graduate degree in counseling and have usually completed internships in mental health facilities. They tend to focus on particular mental health issues such as addictions and substance abuse, although they can provide counseling for a variety of mental health issues. They cannot prescribe medications, and in many states they cannot diagnose mental illness. Physicians usually do not have extensive training in mental health, but they can prescribe medications and can also help you manage your holistic health. Some mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression, can often be effectively treated with prescription medication that your personal doctor may be able to prescribe. Talk with your doctor about your symptoms and share your concerns. Your doctor may also be able to refer you to a trained mental health professional in your area. An official mental health diagnosis is required for individuals to apply for Social Security psychiatric disability support and to ensure that you are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act. If you live in the United States, you probably pay for health insurance coverage. Call your insurance company and ask for the contact information for mental health professionals in your area who accept your insurance plan. Be sure to clarify any specific requirements of your insurance plan. For example, you may need to obtain a referral from your primary doctor to see a psychiatrist, or there may be certain session limits placed on therapy. If you do not have health insurance, look for a community mental health center in your area. These centers often provide free or very low-cost treatment to low-income or uninsured individuals. Some large universities and medical schools also have low-cost clinics. Depending on your area, you may need to wait between a few days to a few months to get an appointment with a mental health professional, so book your appointment as soon as possible. Ask to join the waitlist or cancellation list, if they have one, so that you have a chance of securing an earlier appointment. If you are experiencing suicidal thoughts or plans, seek help immediately. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available to call, free of charge, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can also contact emergency services by dialing 911 (or your local equivalent). You should feel free to ask questions of your mental health care provider. If you don’t understand something or want clarification, ask. You should also ask questions about potential treatment options, such as the types and durations of therapy available, and what sorts of medication you may require. You should also ask your provider what you can do to help the process. While you cannot cure or treat mental illness on your own, there are things you can do to help promote your own mental health; discuss these with your provider. The relationship between you and your therapist should feel safe, welcoming, and comfortable. You will probably feel very vulnerable on your first visit. Your therapist may ask you uncomfortable questions or ask you to think about uncomfortable issues, but s/he should still make you feel secure, valued, and welcomed. If you don’t feel comfortable after a few sessions, you can move on. Remember, you may need to work with them long-term, so your therapist should feel like s/he is completely on your side.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Rain Continues to Fall on Nation's Capital WASHINGTON, June 26  Rain continued to fall on the nation's capital today, as work resumed to clean up government offices shut down by flooding and electrical problems and mass transportation systems tried to resume their regular schedules after delays and washouts caused by scattered flooding over the last two days. The National Weather Service said a tropical storm forming near Cape Fear in South Carolina would bring more precipitation and heavy winds up the Atlantic coast to the lowlands of eastern Maryland and northern Virginia, which in the past few days have been battered by storms and flooding. A total of 12.92 inches of rain has been recorded at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport so far this month, with most of that in the last three days, the National Weather Service reported, exceeding the monthly record for June since the service began keeping records in 1871. \\"And June isn't even over yet,\\" said John Darnley, a meteorologist for the weather service. The previous high had been set in 1972, when 11.53 inches were recorded at the airport for the entire month, Mr. Darnley said. More storms were expected to pelt the saturated ground into Wednesday, raising concerns that the Potomac River might have trouble containing the water later in the week. The deluge followed a long dry period, however, reducing the chances of river flooding. Today, some government offices were still shut down because the storm knocked out power or flooded basements. The National Gallery of Art, the National Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of American History were closed for the second straight day. Amtrak and the capital's Metrorail service were reported running on schedule today. Mr. Darnley of the weather service said more rain and wind in an area already saturated could cause trees to come down. On Monday, as the roar of the rain muffled even the sound of thunder, the storms knocked down a 100-year-old elm not far from the front door of the White House. In Maryland, the storms forced a celebration to evacuate from a recreation center in Chevy Chase on Monday and buried a mile-long stretch of a Silver Spring highway in mud. Part of the capital Beltway in Virginia was closed and air traffic in the region was delayed, forcing travelers aloft, on the rails and behind the wheel to wait, in some cases until early today, to get to their destinations. Though the Washington metropolitan area was soaked, the weather there seemed like a heavy summer shower compared with the thorough lashing of the agricultural heart of the Eastern Shore in Maryland. \\"The rain just came down with such intensity,\\" Wayne Robinson, director of emergency management for Dorchester County, said Monday. \\"We have reports of 11 inches Sunday, some as much as 15 inches over two days.\\" Mr. Robinson added: \\"It just kept going across the roads, and the asphalt is just washed away. The culverts, the big pipes over little streams, those were just washed completely out.\\" He said that as many as 23 roads had been cut off and that at least as many had been reduced to one lane. \\"There has been a lot of crop damage: cucumbers, sweet corn, wheat, soy beans,\\" he said, expressing concern, too, over the area's thousands of chickens housed in rows of long, low coops. Edward J. McDonough, a spokesman for the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, said the small town of Federalsburg in Caroline County had been evacuated briefly as emergency workers checked the stability of a farm dam. In Maryland, power failures left the homes and businesses of more than 10,000 Pepco customers dark, and in Northern Virginia, 3,300 customers of Dominion Virginia Power were also without electricity Monday night. When Bill Hart, a partner and general manager at the Strosnider's hardware store in Bethesda, Md., arrived at work at 7 a.m. on Monday, he said, \\"I already had five cars out there waiting for me, asking if we had sandbags.\\" By 9:30 a.m., Mr. Hart said, pumping equipment was sold out. In some areas, driving was particularly perilous. In a wooded agricultural preserve in northern Montgomery County, Md., the county fire captain, Carl Mauney, joined a county police officer, Nick Augustine, to pull a woman from a small sedan that had been pinned against a guardrail by strong currents and was at danger of falling eight feet into a swollen creek. \\"I put on a life jacket, a helmet and a throw-rope,\\" Captain Mauney said. \\"The water was pretty calm until I got close to her vehicle, then it was flowing strongly.\\" With waters up to the car windows, the woman, at his urging, climbed out the driver's-side window. \\"Then we walked maybe 10 or 15 feet through moving water and got on top of a little island,\\" where they were safe, he said. That was one of several rescues in the northern part of the county during the next 24 hours, said Mr. Mauney, who broke off his account to leave on another emergency call.

This reaction happens when bleach (sodium hypochlorite) and vinegar (acetic acid) are combined. Sodium hypochlorite is a strong oxidizing agent that reacts with the acetic acid in vinegar, producing chlorine gas (Cl2), water (H2O), and sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The chemical equation for this reaction is: NaClO (bleach) + CH3COOH (vinegar) → Cl2 (chlorine gas) + H2O (water) + CH3COONa (sodium acetate) Chlorine gas is a yellow-green, toxic, and corrosive gas with a strong, pungent odor. Inhalation of chlorine gas can cause severe respiratory problems, ranging from irritation to the lungs and throat, to potentially fatal pulmonary edema in high concentrations. It can also irritate the eyes, nose, and skin. As a result, this experiment is highly dangerous and should never be attempted, especially not in an enclosed, poorly-ventilated space. Moreover, mixing bleach with other household chemicals can also result in dangerous reactions. For instance, combining bleach with ammonia produces toxic chloramine gas, which can cause respiratory distress and organ damage. It is critical to be aware of the potential hazards and avoid combining different cleaning agents without proper knowledge and precautions. In conclusion, mixing vinegar and bleach creates a hazardous and potentially lethal chemical reaction that releases chlorine gas. This experiment is extremely dangerous and should never be conducted, either by a curious boy or anyone else, as it may result in severe health consequences and could even be fatal.

Here is a news article: FAIRHOPE, Ala. — Steve Bannon barreled onstage at a raucous rally inside a barn here to deliver a warning to the national Republican establishment ahead of Tuesday’s special Senate election: I’m just getting started. In a thundering 20-minute speech Monday night that was partly a rally for insurgent Senate candidate Roy Moore but equally a declaration of war on the Republican Party hierarchy, Bannon made clear that this next act of his political career could make the Republican civil war of recent years look tame. Story Continued Below “For Mitch McConnell and Ward Baker and Karl Rove and Steven Law — all the instruments that tried to destroy Judge Moore and his family — your day of reckoning is coming,” Bannon said, referring to the Republican Senate leader and a trio of prominent GOP strategists backing incumbent Sen. Luther Strange. “But more important, for the donors who put up the [campaign] money and the corporatists that put up the money, your day of reckoning is coming, too.” With polls showing Moore leading comfortably, the event was an early victory lap of sorts for the nationalist ex-Trump adviser. Since departing the White House last month, he’s made electing Moore — a like-minded, pugilistic outsider — the first of what he hopes will be many pet projects to oust “globalist” Republican incumbents. Bannon broke with his ex-boss, President Donald Trump — who traveled to the state last week to campaign for Strange — and suggested Monday that the president was duped into supporting the incumbent. Bannon said mainstream Republicans behind Strange's campaign regard Alabama voters as “a pack of morons. They think you’re nothing but rubes. They have no interest at all in what you have to say, what you have to think or what you want to do.

Bannon headlined the get-out-the-vote rally inside a hay-lined barn alongside Moore — who at one point pulled a gun out of his pocket to highlight his Second Amendment bona fides —Brexit leader Nigel Farage and “Duck Dynasty” star Phil Robertson. But Bannon stole the proverbial show. In his fiery us vs. them rhetoric, Bannon name-checked his enemies, repeatedly going after McConnell. “Mitch McConnell and his permanent political class is the most corrupt, incompetent group of individuals in this country!” Bannon said to loud applause. Perhaps sensitive to the perception that he was rebuking the president, the former White House chief strategist insisted that it was Moore, not Strange, would do the most to back the Trump agenda. “We did not come here to defy Donald Trump, we came here to praise and honor him,” he said. A Moore win, Bannon has argued, would open the floodgates for anti-incumbent primary challengers across the map. He has also zeroed in on looming Senate primaries in states where GOP incumbents are up for reelection, including Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee and Mississippi. Among those present at the were Chris McDaniel, a tea party figure who is weighing a primary challenge to Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, and Mark Green, a state senator from Tennessee who has flirted with running against GOP Sen. Bob Corker. Bannon met with both McDaniel and Green Monday night. Back at his old perch as chief executive of Breitbart News, Bannon played a key role corralling conservative support for Moore, a 70-year-old staunch social conservative who rose to national fame after defying a federal order to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from a state judicial building. Bannon met with dozens of influential right-of-center groups, including the Conservative Action Project, the Council for National Policy, Judicial Watch and Groundswell, a group overseen by Ginni Thomas, the spouse of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Bannon also met with key movement leaders from the Capitol Hill townhouse that serves as Breitbart's nerve center. Bannon made the same pitch in nearly all the meetings. Alabama, he said, was a monumental battle — the kind of fight that crystallized what he saw as a collision with the mainstream GOP wing that he was convinced was threatening the Trump presidency he and other grass-roots conservatives had worked so hard for. It was a perfect opportunity to undermine McConnell, Bannon argued. With the heart of the Senate primary season still months away, the special election was the moment to strike. He also came to relish the idea of the bellicose Moore making McConnell’s life difficult in the Senate. Not everyone whom Bannon met with had the stomach to take on McConnell, particularly with such a jam-packed fall legislative calendar on the horizon. But the Breitbart chief wanted to make clear that Alabama was his priority. Bannon got behind the candidate who was being massively outspent and had few campaign resources. The former Trump adviser didn’t work to raise money for Moore, but rather used his prominence to help get people behind him. He helped to persuade Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, a conservative who fell short in the first round of voting, to endorse the former judge. Bannon met with Moore and offered him advice. And he also turned Breitbart against Strange, dispatching staffers including Matt Boyle to the state to write critical articles about the senator. A Bannon-affiliated outside group, Great America Alliance, aired anti-Strange ads and hosted a pro-Moore rally that was attended by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Yet delving into the race wasn’t without risk for Bannon, who found himself going up against the president. On Friday, Trump flew to Huntsville to hold a rally for Strange. Trump and Bannon recently spoke about the race over the phone, with each laying out their reasons for their endorsements. When he took the stage a little later in the evening, Moore almost immediately turned his attention to Bannon. “He gave more encouragement,\\" Moore said, \\"than almost anybody this whole time.” ||||| Fairhope, Alabama (CNN) The anti-establishment right is on a mission in Tuesday's Republican Senate primary here to save President Donald Trump from himself. Yes, Trump endorsed Sen. Luther Strange over Roy Moore to fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. But two of Trump's key 2016 campaign allies say to forget that, saying that Strange is tainted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and 10 million in advertising muscle from a McConnell-aligned super PAC. \\"They think you're a pack of morons. They think you're nothing but rubes,\\" said Steve Bannon, Trump's campaign chief executive and, until his recent ouster, White House chief strategist. Inside a sweaty barn south of Mobile, Bannon told voters that ignoring Trump's endorsement and voting for Moore is the way to support Trump's agenda. \\"We did not come here to defy Donald Trump. We came here to praise and honor him,\\" Bannon said. A Moore win would \\"rejuvenate\\" the movement Trump started, said Nigel Farage, the British \\"Brexit\\" champion. \\"This point about getting Judge Roy Moore is to help the President, isn't it?\\" he said, as the crowd packed into a Southern Alabama barn shouted, \\"Yes!\\" \\"Sometimes you've got to show tough love to your own guys,\\" said Tim James, the son of former Republican Gov. Bob James. Trump, James said, is \\"gonna think twice before he jumps in a family feud again.\\" The bitter intra-party battle for the seat Sessions vacated in February comes to an end Tuesday. But a win by Moore -- which national and state Republicans acknowledge is a strong possibility -- would inject fuel into anti-establishment candidates' bids to unseat several other sitting Senate Republicans. Already, Bannon is backing Danny Tarkanian over Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada and Kelli Ward over Sen. Jeff Flake in Arizona. Republican primaries in the 10 Democratic-held Senate seats in states Trump won that are on the ballot in 2018 could see similar brawls. It's part of why the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund has spent 10 million in the primary to boost Strange and tear down Moore. The other part of the McConnell camp's calculus: Moore, who was twice ousted as state Supreme Court chief justice -- once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument, then for ignoring the US Supreme Court's same-sex marriage ruling -- campaigns on installing Christianity at the center of American public life and rejecting LGBT rights. His long history of controversial remarks would be a fundraising boon for Democrats, and would lead to uncomfortable questions for Republican senators about whether they agree or disagree with their new colleague. For his part, Moore seemed to be animated on the campaign trail by the spending against his relatively shoestring campaign. \\"Will we send them a message? Very clear -- Alabama can't be bought,\\" he said Monday night. \\"Mitch McConnell needs to be replaced!\\" The irony of the pro-Moore crowd's insistence that he, not Strange, would be a more reliable ally, is that Moore has broken with Trump on health care -- saying he'd vote against the latest GOP Obamacare repeal bill because it doesn't fully eliminate the law. For Trump, the fate of Strange -- a reliable vote in the Senate and someone who brags about his \\"close, personal friendship\\" with the President -- will demonstrate just how strongly his word can influence the outcome of GOP battles. A Strange win could ease the concerns of some other Republican lawmakers who fear primary battles. Trump has spent heavily from his own political capital in the Alabama race. The President visited Huntsville for a raucous Friday night rally, and Vice President Mike Pence was on hand Monday night in Birmingham to close out Strange's campaign. Sensing the danger of McConnell's support for Strange, Trump also called into Alabama's \\"The Rick and Bubba Show\\" Monday morning to insist that the two senators hardly know each other. \\"As you know, Mitch is not, polling-wise, the most popular guy in this country,\\" Trump said. \\"They like to label (Strange) because he happened to be there for a number of months in the Senate, so they like to label him as Mitch's best friend but he's not. He hardly even knows him. He'll be fighting Mitch.\\" Trump pledged Friday night in Huntsville to campaign for Moore if he won. But in Monday's radio interview, he warned that Moore would face a stiff fight against Democratic nominee Doug Jones in the December general election. \\"Roy Moore is going to have a very hard time getting elected against the Democrat,\\" Trump said. \\"And Luther, they won't even be fighting.\\" ||||| Roy Moore, Alabama’s \\"Ten Commandments judge\\" is running for Senate and touting his religious convictions along the way. “I want to see virtue and morality returned to our country and God is the only source of our law, liberty and government,” Moore said during Thursday’s debate with Luther Strange. He has also called religious liberty “the civil rights issue of our time” in a written statement about prayer in public school and claimed that God punishes the U.S. for immoral behavior. Moore is best known for installing a monument of the Ten Commandments at the Alabama Supreme Court during his tenure as Chief Justice and getting suspended when he defied a court order to remove it. Here are ten of the craziest things Moore has said about church and state, gay rights, evolution and divine retribution. Separation of Powers Moore’s ten year fight to install the Ten Commandments at the courthouse went hand in hand with his beliefs in the importance of Christian values for the United States. “The Church's role should be separated from the state's role. That is the definition of separation of church and state. But separation of church and state was never meant to separate God and government,” Moore told Gwen Ifill during an interview with PBS Flashpoints USA in 2004. Moore went on to further explain his beliefs in 2015 during a speech he gave to the fundamentalist Christian political organization, Operation Save America. \\"I'm sorry but this country was not founded on Muhammad. It was not founded on Buddha. It was not founded on secular humanism. It was founded on God,\\" he said according to reports by AL.com. Islam Moore has also been critical of Islam saying that it goes against America’s way of life. “[Islam is] a faith that conflicts with the First Amendment of the Constitution,” Moore said during a 2007 radio interview with Michelangelo Signorile, “The Constitution and Declaration of Independence has a direct reference to the Holy Scriptures.” He then echoed the sentiment this past July and called Islam a “false religion” during an event with the Jefferson County Republican Club. “False religions like Islam, who teach that 'you must worship this way,' are completely opposite with what our First Amendment stands for,\\" Moore said. Gay Rights Moore’s ardent stance against gay rights cost him his second stint as Alabama Chief Justice last year after he banned Alabama judges from issuing same sex marriage licenses. Moore also sided against a lesbian woman during a custody battle because of her sexuality in 2002. “It is an inherent evil against which children must be protected,” Moore wrote in his opinion on the case. CNN also uncovered a 2005 interview between Moore and Bill Press during C-SPAN2’s After Words where he compared homosexuality to bestiality. “Just because it’s done behind closed doors, it can still be prohibited by state law. Do you know that bestiality, the relationship between man and beast is prohibited in every state?” Moore told Press. When asked if Moore was comparing homosexuality to bestiality, he replied, “It’s the same thing.” Evolution Moore also refutes evolution. “There is no such thing as evolution,” Moore told The Washington Post. “That we came from a snake? No, I don’t believe that.” God’s Wrath Moore has harsh words for unbelievers. He even implied that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were God’s retribution. During an event at the Open Door Baptist Church, he quoted a passage from Isaiah that described a faithless people who suffered a sudden and relentless fall. “Sounds a little bit like the Pentagon, whose breaking came suddenly at an instance, doesn't it?\\" Moore said. “If you think that's coincidence, if you go to verse 25, 'there should be up on every high mountain and upon every hill rivers and streams of water in the day of the great slaughter when the towers will fall.' You know, we've suffered a lot in this country, maybe, just maybe, because we've distanced ourselves from the one that has it within his hands to heal this land.\\" When not quoting the Bible, Moore also draws upon his own poetry. During a press conference to defend the Ten Commandments in 2003, he read his poem, Our American Birthright where he praised America’s founders for their faith then lamented the fall of the US as a Christian nation.

Luther Strange, wins after trailing in recent polls, the president can claim that he still can work magic with the GOP base. But if challenger Roy Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, wins the primary, Trump and the party will have to fight harder to get things done. Strange, 64, was appointed to the U.S. Senate after Trump picked then Sen. Jeff Sessions to be his attorney general. It was a messy appointment. Strange, the Alabama attorney general, had been investigating then-Gov. Robert Bentley for improperly using state funds to cover up an extramarital affair. Shortly after naming Strange to succeed Sessions, Bentley pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and resigned in a deal that spared him jail time. Moore, 70, carries a different kind of baggage. Known as the “Ten Commandments judge,” he became a national figure in the 1990s when he refused a court order to remove a plaque of the Ten Commandments from his county bench. He rode his notoriety to become the state Supreme Court’s chief justice in 2000 and again defied a court order to remove a large granite slab with the Ten Commandments, leading to his removal from the court. In 2012, voters returned Moore to head the high court again, a position he lost in 2016 after he directed judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Trump endorsed Strange in August, despite the stiff challenge presented by a crowded primary field. In the Aug. 15 primary, Strange finished second, with 33 percent of the vote to Moore’s 39 percent. The GOP establishment prefers Strange to Moore because they think he has a better chance against Democrat Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor who could draw moderate Republican votes in the Dec. 12 general election. Trump told voters at a Strange rally in Huntsville Friday night, if Strange wins the primary, he will “definitely win,” But if Moore wins the primary, “Roy has a very good chance of not winning in the general election.” Democrats concur. “I’m happy about Roy Moore winning,” said Paul Maslin, who polls for the Jones campaign. “That’s the one chance we’ve got.” If the GOP loses this race, its majority would shrink to 51-49 in the Senate. That would make it harder to pass measures in the Senate that require 60 votes to earn a floor vote — and harder still as Republican lawmakers see less reason to risk their seats for Trump’s agenda. While Trump supports Strange, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon, now executive chairman of Breitbart News, headed to Mobile to campaign for Moore Monday night and his Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson issued a statement supporting Moore. “I don’t view those supporting Moore as opposing Trump,” said GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alice Stewart. “A lot of them were for Moore long before Trump put his support in for Strange. Everyone picked their candidate and didn’t let any opposing factors change their mind.” Trump’s mistake, Stewart said, was to support Strange. The president seems to concur. In his rambling Huntsville speech, Trump confessed, “I might have made a mistake,” because if Strange loses the media will cover his defeat as a loss for Trump. It was at the Huntsville rally that Trump brought up football players who won’t stand for the national anthem. “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a b—- off the field right now. Out. He’s fired.’” Did Trump bring up the NFL anthem issue in order to help Strange rally the GOP base and confound the pollsters with a win? “No, he doesn’t think that way,” said Maslin, the Democratic pollster, adding that he believes Trump brought up the subject to win cheers from patriotic football-loving Alabama voters “I think he did it on purpose,” agreed Henry Olsen, author of The Working Class Republican: Ronald Reagan and the Return of Blue-Collar Conservatism. He declined to guess whether his goal was a Strange victory or a boisterous audience reaction. Sometimes when things are going really well for Trump, he has a way of stoking a gratuitous controversy and “instinctively moves to an issue where his side would rally to him.” “Trump’s got this genius for this certain type of issue,” said Olsen. “The problem is that he’s only got this genius for a certain type of issue.” COPYRIGHT 2017 CREATORS.COM ||||| Is President Trump about to suffer his biggest electoral setback ever? That’s the question on people’s minds ahead of Tuesday’s Republican primary runoff in Alabama’s special Senate election. Trump’s preferred candidate, Sen. Luther Strange, is facing off against former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore for the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Moore is the favorite, but not by so much that a Strange win would be … well, strange. (Sorry.) Moore has led in every reliable public poll of the runoff. But if you look closely enough, it does seem that Moore’s edge has been declining in the waning days of the primary race. A number of surveys released over the past 10 days have put his lead in the single digits, though polls conducted this past weekend seemed to put Moore 10 percentage points or more ahead of his opponent. Private polls conducted by Strange’s allies show a tighter race. And remember, primary polls are typically less accurate than general election polls. If Strange is indeed closing the gap, it may be thanks to an onslaught of TV ads against Moore. Outside groups, such as the Senate Leadership Fund, a group allied with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have poured millions of dollars into the race on Strange’s behalf. Moore, meanwhile, has received considerably fewer contributions and less outside support. Strange could also be benefiting from Trump’s support. While Trump endorsed Strange before the initial primary on Aug. 15, that backing was mostly confined to tweets. This past Friday, however, Trump staged a rally with Strange in Alabama. (However, at one point during the rally, Trump said he may have made a mistake in endorsing Strange.) Given that Trump’s approval rating among the Republican electorate in Alabama is about 80 percent, it’s possible that Trump’s rally could have given Strange a potentially game-changing boost ahead of Tuesday’s vote. It’s also possible, however, that the president’s efforts will be for naught. Polling suggests that voters know about Trump’s endorsement but are still going for Moore. Alabama voters seem to be in an anti-incumbency mood. Strange was appointed to his seat by disgraced former Gov. Robert Bentley, who resigned after he was embroiled in a sex scandal, and the ad campaign by the Senate Leadership Fund may remind voters that Strange has also been endorsed by McConnell, who has had more than his share of dust-ups with Trump. Moore, for his part, seems to fit the Trump brand better than Strange. Like Trump, Moore has a history of fighting the establishment — he even went so far as to challenge the incumbent Republican governor in a 2006 primary. Moore’s anti-establishment history may be why Sarah Palin and ex-Trump administration members Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka have endorsed him. The Moore-Trump comparisons aren’t perfect: Moore is best defined as a religious conservative who outperforms among evangelical voters; Trump’s populism was not defined by religiosity. Still, polling has generally showed that Moore is doing best among voters who are the biggest fans of Trump. Perhaps the biggest question for Tuesday is what happens to voters who cast a ballot for Rep. Mo Brooks in the first round. Brooks finished third in the primary with 20 percent to Moore’s 39 percent and Strange’s 33 percent, and only the top two finishers advanced to the runoff. Brooks, who was attacked by the Senate Leadership Fund during the first round, has endorsed Moore in the runoff. Barring a large increase in turnout from the first round, Strange likely needs to bring in the lion’s share of Brooks’s voters to win the runoff. That’s probably why Trump’s Friday night rally was held in Madison County, which is in Brooks’s 5th Congressional District and is home to the largest share of non-Moore, non-Strange voters in the first round of the primary. To give you an idea of whether Moore is maintaining his advantage in the runoff, I’ve created the following scrollable table. The results will come in by county tonight, but who’s winning each county isn’t a great indicator of who’s winning statewide because Moore and Strange have different geographic bases of support. If Moore is winning Henry County but only by a few percentage points, for example, he’s probably losing statewide; he won by 39 percentage points there in Round 1. So we subtracted out Moore’s statewide margin in the first round (6 points) to generate a set of benchmarks below that imagine a tied Moore-Strange race statewide and show how that might look in county-by-county results. In Henry County, for instance, the benchmark is 33 points. If Moore is beating these benchmarks in most counties, then chances are, he’ll win the runoff. How well Moore needs to do in each county to win the runoff Share of vote Moore and Strange won in the Aug. 15 primary and how well Moore needs to do to maintain his statewide advantage, by county FIRST ROUND RUNOFF COUNTY ▲ ▼ STRANGE ▲ ▼ MOORE ▲ ▼ MARGIN ▲ ▼ MOORE BENCHMARK TO WIN ▲ ▼ Autauga 25% 46% +21 +15 Baldwin 32 30 -2 -8 Barbour 32 51 +19 +13 Bibb 28 57 +29 +23 Blount 30 50 +20 +14 Bullock 25 52 +27 +21 Butler 28 53 +26 +20 Calhoun 39 41 +3 -3 Chambers 35 49 +14 +8 Cherokee 43 46 +3 -3 Chilton 34 47 +13 +7 Choctaw 42 49 +7 +1 Clarke 38 48 +10 +4 Clay 35 51 +16 +10 Cleburne 35 49 +14 +8 Coffee 25 53 +28 +22 Colbert 35 45 +11 +5 Conecuh 36 49 +13 +7 Coosa 32 49 +17 +11 Covington 28 57 +29 +23 Crenshaw 24 59 +35 +29 Cullman 31 48 +16 +10 Dale 25 53 +27 +21 Dallas 37 45 +8 +2 DeKalb 35 49 +14 +8 Elmore 21 48 +27 +21 Escambia 29 51 +22 +16 Etowah 34 51 +17 +11 Fayette 31 53 +22 +16 Franklin 27 57 +29 +23 Geneva 18 66 +48 +42 Greene 32 47 +15 +9 Hale 44 41 -4 -10 Henry 21 59 +39 +33 Houston 25 53 +29 +23 Jackson 34 43 +9 +3 Jefferson 43 28 -15 -21 Lamar 35 55 +20 +14 Lauderdale 31 43 +12 +6 Lawrence 24 53 +30 +24 Lee 33 37 +4 -2 Limestone 26 30 +4 -2 Lowndes 28 38 +10 +4 Macon 27 45 +18 +12 Madison 27 19 -8 -14 Marengo 35 45 +11 +4 Marion 32 54 +22 +16 Marshall 38 39 +1 -5 Mobile 33 36 +4 -3 Monroe 33 47 +14 +8 Montgomery 31 34 +3 -3 Morgan 25 37 +12 +6 Perry 28 57 +29 +23 Pickens 36 52 +16 +10 Pike 24 54 +30 +24 Randolph 27 57 +30 +24 Russell 39 49 +10 +4 Shelby 39 30 -9 -15 St. Clair 36 44 +8 +2 Sumter 52 32 -21 -27 Talladega 40 42 +2 -4 Tallapoosa 33 45 +12 +6 Tuscaloosa 36 40 +4 -2 Walker 35 47 +12 +6 Washington 32 55 +23 +17 Wilcox 30 48 +18 +12 Winston 30 52 +22 +16 The benchmarks are calculated by taking Moore’s margin in each county and subtracting out his 6-percentage-point statewide margin. Source: Alabama Secretary of State To maintain his lead from the first round, Moore will need to continue to rack up huge margins in rural areas. Specifically, he’ll need to do well in the southeast corner of the state, in counties like Geneva and Houston. Strange, meanwhile, will hope to cut down on Moore’s rural advantage and rack up huge margins of his own in urban areas such as Jefferson and Madison counties. Of course, whoever wins on Tuesday will still need to win a Dec. 12 general election against Democrat and former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones. Normally, that would be a fait accompli in deep-red Alabama. No Democrat has won a Senate election in the state in 25 years, and Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by 28 percentage points in 2016. Indeed, either Moore or Strange would be favored against Jones, though perhaps not by as much as you might think. Trump’s approval rating in Alabama is above 50 percent, and two Emerson College general election polls have both Republicans leading Jones. But Emerson’s polling has been mixed. The group’s most recent poll gave Moore a 22 percentage point lead and Strange a 13 point advantage over Jones. Their survey earlier this month however, put Moore and Strange ahead by less than 5 points. That same poll found Trump’s approval rating at just 52 percent, a significant dropoff from the 62 percent of the vote he earned while running against Clinton. Jones’s odds are probably better if Moore ends up as the Republican nominee. Moore has a history of making controversial comments, including saying that homosexuality should be illegal. He’s also been removed from his job at the Alabama Supreme Court twice for disregarding higher court rulings. Moore’s past actions and words may not have hurt him much in the primary, but a general election is a different ballgame. Moore’s controversial past may be why he won election to the state supreme court in 2012 by just 4 percentage points. That same year, Republican Mitt Romney beat Democrat Barack Obama by 22 percentage points in Alabama. In other words, Moore has a history of undershooting the presidential lean of the state. Alabama is a red state, so Moore is a favorite on Tuesday and would be the favorite in December. But he could also plausibly lose either race. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has declared war on the Republican establishment ahead of Tuesday's special Senate election in Alabama.

What are the advantages Indians enjoy over others? Possible answers: (A). no; (B). yes; The answer is:","completion":"(A). no; The two questions are not the same because they refer to different subjects. While the first question is about a specific aspect of Indian culture - squatting toilets, the second question refers to general advantages that Indians might have over others without specifying what exactly those advantages might entail. The first question asks about the benefits of Indian squatting toilets in comparison with Western ones. The advantages of squatting toilets include: 1. Squatting position: Squatting is a more natural position for bowel movements, as it allows for a more complete and effortless release. This can lead to a decreased risk of constipation, hemorrhoids, and other issues related to straining. 2. Higher level of hygiene: Since there is minimal contact between the user's body and the toilet surface, the risk of transmitting germs and infections is reduced. 3. Water-saving: In many instances, squatting toilets use less water when compared to their Western counterparts. This can contribute to water conservation, especially in countries facing water scarcity. 4. Space-saving: Squat toilets take up less space, making them ideal for small or crowded living quarters. 5. Affordability: Squatting toilets are typically less expensive to install and maintain, which can be an advantage in low-income households or countries with limited resources. On the other hand, the second question is more open-ended and could refer to any number of cultural, economic, geographical, or other attributes that someone may believe Indians enjoy as advantages over others. Some possible advantages might include: 1. Rich cultural heritage: India has a long and varied history, which makes for a rich tapestry of cultural practices, art, languages, and traditions that can be seen as advantageous. 2. Diverse topography: India has a diverse landscape that includes mountains, plains, deserts, and coastal areas. This variety provides many opportunities for travel, exploration, and resource utilization. 3. Bilingual or multilingual skills: Many Indians are fluent in more than one language, which can be useful in various domains like career opportunities, effective communication, and cognitive development. 4. Strong family ties: Indian culture often places a high emphasis on family and bonding, which can contribute to strong and supportive social networks. However, it is important to remember that any perceived advantages are subjective and dependent on the context in which they're being considered. They won't apply uniformly to every Indian, just as not every Indian uses a squatting toilet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Sources: Texas Rangers trade Ian Kinsler to Detroit Tigers for Prince Fielder - MLB News Updated Nov 21, 2013 12:45 PM ET The Texas Rangers on Wednesday traded second baseman Ian Kinsler to the Detroit Tigers for first baseman Prince Fielder. The Rangers, who officially announced the transaction Wednesday night, will also receive 30 million cash. Fielder is owed 168 million over the next seven years, Kinsler 62 million over the next four. That brings a net savings of 72 million for the Tigers. Fielder signed a nine-year, 214 million deal with the Tigers in January 2012. Kinsler signed a five-year, 75 million extension with the Rangers in April 2012. The implications for the Tigers are obvious. The savings on Fielder's contract could enable them to keep American League Cy Young winner Max Scherzer, who can become a free agent after the 2014 season, and AL MVP Miguel Cabrera, who can become a free agent after 2015. The blockbuster opens up positions for prospects. Nick Castellanos could play third base for the Tigers, with Cabrera moving to first. Jurickson Profar could play second base for the Rangers. There are free-agent implications, as well. The Rangers are presumably out on Mike Napoli. They had been involved on Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran, as well, among others. ''Obviously, a very exciting trade for us in adding Prince Fielder to the organization,'' Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said. ''Also a tough trade to make in that Ian Kinsler's been with the organization since he was drafted in \`03, and we've signed him here a couple of times. Been here, a catalyst for our World Series clubs, and a huge part of this. A winning guy, a heart-and-soul guy, and Detroit got a tremendous player and person.'' Robinson Cano is the biggest star on the market. Who are the best players for sale Fielder, a five-time All-Star, had to consent to the trade before it could be completed because of a limited no-trade provision. ''We're thankful for what he did for us,'' Detroit general manager Dave Dombrowski said. ''It'll be a bat that we miss at times — there's no doubt about it.'' Fielder hit .279 with 25 homers this year. He drove in 106 runs, but it was his lowest home run total over a full season. He did not have a single RBI in the 2013 postseason and hit .182 in the ALCS. Daniels said the trade came together quickly; the first discussions took place Tuesday. The Rangers will welcome the durable Fielder, who has played 162 games in four of the past five seasons. Texas was interested in Fielder when he signed with Detroit as a free agent. ''Our offer was well below what it ended up being, so we weren't that close,'' Daniels said. ''I thought he was a genuine guy that really loved the game, really loved playing the game, loved his boys, his sons.'' Kinsler batted .277 with 13 homers this year. The three-time All-Star was limited to 136 games because of injuries to his ribs and right side. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Summary:","completion":"In 2013, a baseball team called the Texas Rangers traded a player named Ian Kinsler to another team called the Detroit Tigers. In return, they got a player named Prince Fielder and 30 million. This trade helped both teams save money and make room for new players to join their teams. The Texas Rangers manager and the Detroit general manager were both happy about the trade since they believe it will help their teams do better in future games."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Home to diverse cultures and civilizations, Peru's charming diversity can be found in its people, traditions, and the numerous archaeological sites that dot the landscape. Among these historic landmarks are the ancient Incan capital of Cuzco and the enigmatic lost city of Machu Picchu. This article will delve into the remarkable stories behind these two incredible destinations, showcasing the rich and varied heritage of Peru. Step 1: Delve into the Origins of Cuzco and its Importance as the Incan Capital: Cuzco, often spelled as \\"Cusco,\\" served as the heart of the Inca Empire, which ruled over a vast expanse of South America between the 13th and 16th centuries. Founded by the legendary Inca ruler Manco Cápac in the 12th century, Cuzco was a center of culture, politics, and religious practices. With its intricate stonework and well-preserved ruins, the city offers a fascinating glimpse into Incan engineering, architecture, and traditions. Step 2: Describe the Notable Landmarks in Cuzco: Cuzco is home to numerous landmarks showcasing the height of Incan ingenuity. Some of the most popular sites include: 1. Sacsayhuamán: A magnificent citadel that is said to have taken over 50 years to construct. Visitors can marvel at the impressive stone walls, which are made up of enormous boulders fit together seamlessly, creating a puzzle-like appearance. 2. Qorikancha (Temple of the Sun): Once the most important temple in the Inca Empire, Qorikancha was celebrated for its lavish gold decorations which, although no longer present, still leave behind an aura of its past grandeur. Step 3: Introduce the Enigma of Machu Picchu: Nestled high in the Andes Mountains, the lost city of Machu Picchu stands as one of the world's greatest archaeological enigmas. The well-preserved ruins were discovered in 1911 by explorer Hiram Bingham, who was led to the site by a local Quechua farmer. The exact purpose of Machu Picchu remains a mystery, with numerous theories suggesting that it was a royal estate, religious sanctuary, or even an agricultural testing site. Step 4: Discuss the Architectural Wonders of Machu Picchu: Machu Picchu's elaborate stone structures, terraces, and plazas are a testament to the advanced construction techniques and architectural prowess of the Inca. Notable landmarks within the site include the Temple of the Sun, the Intihuatana (a ritual stone pillar believed to have astronomical significance), and the intricate water fountains and drainage systems. Step 5: Describe the Influence of these Sites on Peruvian Culture: Both Cuzco and Machu Picchu serve as important symbols of cultural pride and national identity for the people of Peru. The sites play a vital role in preserving and promoting the rich history of the Inca civilization, which significantly contributes to Peru's diverse cultural heritage. These destinations also serve as major tourism drawcards, drawing countless visitors each year to experience the unique blend of ancient history and breathtaking natural landscapes that define the Peruvian experience. Conclusion: Peru's rich and varied heritage, represented by the ancient Incan capital of Cuzco and the enigmatic lost city of Machu Picchu, offers invaluable insights into the sophisticated society that once dominated the Andean region. As we explore these awe-inspiring sites, we are not only reminded of the ingenuity and craftsmanship that characterized the Inca civilization, but also of the diverse and captivating tapestry of cultures that make up the vibrant nation of Peru today."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Suddenly an old man appeared before him. \\"I can see that something is troubling you.\\" he said. After listening to the businessman, the old man said: \\"I believe I can help you.\\" He asked the man his name, wrote out a check , and pushed it into his hand saying: \\"Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time.\\" Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come. The businessman saw in his hand a check for 500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world! \\"I can settle all my debts in a moment!\\" he realized. But instead, the man decided to put the uncashed check in his safe, just knowing it would give him the strength to work out a way to save his business. With renewed optimism, he made better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big deals. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: - Two types of proteins exist in filaments in the muscles - The filaments move when the brain instructs them to - The motion of the filaments cause the muscle to shorten and contract - Opposing pairs of muscles exist in order to provide the necessary range of motion. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process involving the movement of muscle filaments and subsequent muscle contraction is the generation of a neural signal, or action potential, in the brain. This signal is initiated when the brain processes the need for movement or muscle activation, such as lifting an object or walking. The action potential travels through the nervous system via motor neurons, which are specialized cells that transmit signals from the brain to muscle fibers. Once the motor neurons receive the signal, they release a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (ACh), which diffuses across the neuromuscular junction - a small gap between the nerve ending and muscle fibers. The ACh binds to receptors on the muscle fibers, causing a rapid and localized change in electrical potential within the muscle cell membrane. This is known as depolarization. The resulting depolarization triggers the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) from an organelle called the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is a specialized structure within the muscle cell. The Ca2+ ions then initiate the interaction between the two types of protein filaments mentioned in the question: actin and myosin. This ultimately leads to the sliding of the filaments past each other, causing muscle contraction. Overall, the first step in the process is the generation of a neural signal, or action potential, in the brain, which then initiates a series of events leading to muscle contraction and the associated range of motion provided by opposing pairs of muscles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fungi secrete enzymes: Since they can't produce their own food through photosynthesis, fungi release enzymes called \\"exoenzymes\\" into the surrounding environment. 2. Break down organic matter: These enzymes break down complex organic matter, such as dead plant or animal material, into simpler molecules. The process is called \\"extracellular digestion\\". 3. Absorb nutrients: Once the organic matter has been broken down into simpler molecules, such as sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids, the fungi absorb these nutrients through their cell walls. 4. Use nutrients for growth and reproduction: Fungi utilize the absorbed nutrients for their own growth, development, and reproduction. This process allows fungi to obtain their nutrition without relying on agriculture or other means typically associated with producing food."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: how old do you need to be to play professional football in the canadian league I found the following answer on Google: The 2010s will be a significant decade for the CFL in terms of growth, as teams have renovated, expanded stadiums, or plan to build entirely new stadiums. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, the information provided does not answer the question about the age requirement to play professional football in the Canadian Football League (CFL). The statement you found refers to the growth and stadium renovations in the CFL during the 2010s, but it does not provide details about the age requirements for players. To answer your question: There is no specific age requirement to play professional football in the Canadian Football League (CFL). However, most players enter the league through the CFL Draft, which generally requires players to have completed their college or university eligibility. This typically means that players entering the league are in their early 20s or older. For exceptional cases, players with immense talent and experience may enter the league as undrafted free agents, which could potentially allow younger athletes to join. Ultimately, professional team management would make the decision based on a player's talent, experience, and maturity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\"The progressive matching formula was to phase down as income increased.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"As income increased, the formula was to be phased out.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"The progressive matching formula was to phase down as income increased\\" is true, then it provides substantial evidence to support the hypothesis \\"As income increased, the formula was to be phased out.\\" Let's analyze this in detail to better understand the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. First, let's break down the premise and the hypothesis: Premise: \\"The progressive matching formula was to phase down as income increased.\\" - This premise states there is a direct relationship between the progressive matching formula and income levels. - As income levels increase, the progressive matching formula's impact would diminish or phase down. - The term \\"progressive matching formula\\" suggests it is a method or equation designed to adjust according to income levels. Typically, a progressive system seeks to provide more assistance or benefits to those with lower incomes while reducing assistance for those with higher incomes. Hypothesis: \\"As income increased, the formula was to be phased out.\\" - This hypothesis also implies a direct relationship between the progressive matching formula and income levels. - As income levels increase, the formula's impact would ultimately be phased out or rendered ineffective. - While phasing down could indicate a reduced effect of the formula, phasing out suggests a stronger conclusion that the formula would be completely removed or become irrelevant at certain income levels. Now let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis: 1. Both the premise and the hypothesis establish a direct correlation between income levels and the progressive matching formula. Higher incomes correspond to reduced effectiveness or removal of the formula. 2. The premise suggests a continuous reduction in the formula's impact as incomes rise. This is consistent with the hypothesis, which states the formula would be entirely phased out as incomes increase. However, the phrasing of the hypothesis is more definitive, whereas the premise leaves room for a more gradual effect. 3. The shared premise of a progressive system is embedded in both statements. Progressive systems aim to aid low-income individuals or entities more significantly than those with higher incomes. Consequently, when income levels increase, it is reasonable to assume that the assistance provided by such a system will reduce or be phased out. In conclusion, if the premise \\"The progressive matching formula was to phase down as income increased\\" is true, it substantiates the hypothesis \\"As income increased, the formula was to be phased out.\\" Although the hypothesis is more assertive in its conclusion that the formula would be removed at certain income levels, the premise's gradual reduction in the formula's impact aligns with the idea that the formula would eventually become irrelevant. Therefore, the premise provides strong support for the hypothesis, confirming their interdependence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost. High fashion shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, use complex construction and sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars a pair. Some shoes are designed for specific purposes, such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or skiing. - Copra is the dried meat, or dried kernel, of the coconut used to extract coconut oil. The earliest evidence of the extracting and use of coconut oil from copra is in early Tamil literature from the 1st century AD. The word originated from the Malayalam word \\"koppra\\".

Initially it comprised a group of plant species native to Africa and Australia, with the first species \\"A. nilotica\\" described by Linnaeus. Controversy erupted in the early 2000s when it became evident that the genus as it stood was not monophyletic, and that several divergent lineages needed to be placed in separate genera. It turned out that one lineage comprising over 900 species mainly native to Australia was not closely related to the mainly African lineage that contained \\"A. nilotica\\"the first and type species. This meant that the Australian lineage (by far the most prolific in number of species) would need to be renamed. Botanist Les Pedley named this group Racosperma, which was inconsistently adopted. Australian botanists proposed that this would be more disruptive than setting a different type species (\\"A. penninervis\\") and allowing this large number of species to remain \\"Acacia\\", resulting in the African lineage being renamed to \\"Vachellia\\". This was officially adopted, but many botanists from Africa and elsewhere disagreed that this was necessary. - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources.

(In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners. - Inharrime District is a district of Inhambane Province in south-east Mozambique.

I'm in Iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies. We also have access to plenty of pirated movies, this gem came along with 11 other movies, and this is easily the worst I've seen in a long time. I've seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn't take itself too seriously, but really, I think that's a cover up for the fact that its horrible. It's not tongue in cheek, the writers really thought they were improving on the movie Blade. This movie is just one notch above Vampire Assassin, which if you haven't seen, i recommend. At least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you'll laugh harder than you thought possible. This is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever. from the bad acting, to cliché visual (ie opening credits), to the adobe premier special effects. they couldn't even get blanks for the guns, which may have to do with where the movie was filmed, but if you're going to use effects, make them close to accurate. as for the cast, it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out. Once again, like Ron Hall in Vampire Assassin, don't let stunt folk act, they can't. Also, the comment about this being a \\"return of old vampire movies\\"...no, it's not. This is exactly what all new vampire movies are about. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Blade, Underworld, they're all about some super star fighting the vampires.

But what do I care, I paid 33 cents for it. Anyway, to wrap this up, someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie, I give them credit because it's better than I could do. Of course I also know I can't make movies so I don't try. I do know how to watch movies though. I work 12 hour nights, 6 days a week, I've seen several thousand in the year I've been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack. Choose your answer.

There are three types of viral infections that can be considered under the topic of viral transformation. These are cytocidal, persistent, and transforming infections. Cytocidal infections can cause fusion of adjacent cells, disruption of transport pathways including ions and other cell signals, disruption of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, and nearly always leads to cell death. Persistent infections involve viral material that lays dormant within a cell until activated by some stimulus. This type of infection usually causes few obvious changes within the cell but can lead to long chronic diseases. Transforming infections are also referred to as malignant transformation. This infection causes a host cell to become malignant and can be either cytocidal (usually in the case of RNA viruses) or persistent (usually in the case of DNA viruses). Cells with transforming infections undergo immortalization and inherit the genetic material to produce tumors. Since the term cytocidal, or cytolytic, refers to cell death, these three infections are not mutually exclusive. Many transforming infections by DNA tumor viruses are also cytocidal. Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supported by the text: can some viruses change normal cells to tumor cells? Pick your answer from: a. no. b. yes.","completion":"b. yes. Some viruses, particularly those causing transforming infections, can change normal cells to tumor cells. As mentioned in the text, transforming infections can cause a host cell to become malignant, resulting in the immortalization of the cell and the inheritance of genetic material to produce tumors. This process can occur in both RNA viruses (usually associated with cytocidal infections) and DNA viruses (usually associated with persistent infections).

Balenciaga and Comme des Garçons Play Different Games in Paris Two monolithic Dan Graham sculptures — one a curving glass S, the other a wall of steel mesh — made from what Ms. Philo called “corporate materials,” framed a collage of form and femininity: rolled suiting trousers with floral chiffon escaping at the ankles under oversize jackets; white cotton dresses with abstracted Yves Klein body blotches on the front (some with strange black widow webs over the breasts); and silk cocktail frocks looped up and around at the back to hug the shoulders and catch the breeze. They stretched the mind and eye more than the body. (And not always in comfortable ways.) But she was a rare exception to the rule. All of which is to say that when Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garçons summed up her collection with the koan “invisible clothes” (or rather, when Rei told her husband, Adrian Joffe, that, and he told everyone else) it was hard not to think that whatever she really meant (and who knows?), her words described as much as anything the current situation. Where fashion as it once was, a world of carefully constructed underpinnings and sculpted femininity, is being swallowed whole by the larger casualization of life. So it was, anyway, with her women, encased in pillows of tartan, their bodies traced in stitches, so you could just make out what was beneath; disappearing under giant skirts of navy wool and tiny white ruffles that closed on top of them like a whale’s mouth; sandwiched between flattened forms of polka dots and red velvet; sucked into the maw of a velvet collared — coat? or cocoon? it was hard to tell. Maybe they are the same thing. And maybe it’s the future, and there’s nothing anyone can do about it, but as a result, a period of mourning may be in store. (The soundtrack was from the Polish composer Henryk Gorecki’s Symphony No. 3, the “Symphony of 3 Sorrowful Songs.”) Rumor has it that Ms. Kawakubo is the subject of the next big show at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Andrew Bolton, the chief curator, and Anna Wintour, chairwoman of the annual gala, were in the front row, which would suggest this is true (asked why he was there, Mr. Bolton just giggled). If so, this collection was proof positive as to why. You may not recognize yourself in Ms. Kawakubo’s constructions — you can’t really call them clothes — but they describe a psychic landscape that is piercingly familiar. The result is an emotional workout. Ultimately, it may be the best kind — for fashion, if not for the physique. At the end, some audience members were in tears. But no one was running for the door.

Windows 3.x: This family of operating systems, which includes Windows 3.0, Windows 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups 3.11, was released between 1990 and 1993. These versions did not have PowerShell built-in. 4. Windows 95, 98, and ME: Sometimes referred to as the Windows 9x series, this group of operating systems used MS-DOS as the underlying system and did not feature PowerShell. 5. Windows NT 3.x and 4.0: These versions were part of the Windows NT line, which aimed at professionals and businesses. Released between 1993 and 1996, they did not include PowerShell. 6.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Mike is studying for his zoology class. Today, he is studying about reptiles and amphibians. He found it easy to understand their differences by categorizing them. For that, he classified reptiles as class A and amphibians as class B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which class of animals would have weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams, class A or class B? Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...","completion":"Based on the given paragraph and the hint provided, we can determine that class B animals (amphibians) would have weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams compared to class A animals (reptiles). To elaborate, the various characteristics mentioned in the hint about reptiles explain several of their evolutionary adaptations and how they differ from amphibians. Reptiles have several features that make them distinct from amphibians, including their stronger skeletons, horny scales, and a more advanced respiratory system. Additionally, the hint states that the reptile's heart has a septum that more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams in their circulatory system. Amphibians, on the other hand, do not possess such pronounced separation in their circulatory system. Their hearts typically have three chambers (two atria and one ventricle), which in turn leads to some mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. This is because the single ventricle pumps blood to both the lungs (for oxygenation) and the body (delivering oxygen), resulting in a less efficient circulatory system compared to reptiles. In contrast, reptiles (excluding crocodiles) have a three-chambered heart with a partially divided ventricle, which allows for better separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, leading to more efficient oxygen delivery to their body tissues. Crocodiles, a subclass of reptiles, have a fully-separated four-chambered heart that operates even more efficiently. To summarize, given the information provided, class B animals (amphibians) would have weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams compared to class A animals (reptiles), due to differences in their respective heart structures and circulatory systems. Reptiles have evolved various adaptations that make their systems more efficient and suited to their environments, which include a better-separated circulatory system that allows for more effective oxygen transportation throughout the body."},{"prompt":"Given the following passage \\"Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape.

Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight.

For men, that means dark washed jeans that fit you properly in the waist and are a slim fit. Avoid overly baggy clothing as this can actually make your entire body, including your thighs, look bigger. It's a good idea to also avoid low-waist skirts that shorten your legs and make your thighs look larger, as well as mid-calf skirts as they can look matronly or frumpy. This means purchasing clothing that is not too tight or too loose and is styled or cut in a way that slims your larger lower body. For women, clothing like wrap dresses and A-line dresses work to slim your thigh area and still look good. Avoid tight fitting dresses made of material that are too body hugging like lycra, nylon, and satin. Dark colors always seem to make everyone look slim. However, don't be afraid to wear prints, especially printed tops that draw attention away from your legs and thighs. If you are petite and larger in the lower body area, avoid very bold or large prints as these can overwhelm your look. Opt for the more detailed or printed garments to be skirts or pants. Avoid horizontal stripes as they can make you look wider and draw the eyes side to side, right onto your thighs. Go for tops, skirts, and dresses with vertical stripes as they draw the eye up and down. The whiskering on the thigh area of the jeans will only draw attention to your thighs.

The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories.

I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that. That's my story.

Which entity is this text about? Brett Favre was born in Gulfport, Mississippi, the son of Bonita Ann (nee French) and Irvin Ernest Favre, and raised in the small town of Kiln. Both of his parents were schoolteachers in the Hancock County School District. He is of part French ancestry.

In the second game of the 1992 season, the Packers played the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Buccaneers were leading 17-0 at halftime when head coach Mike Holmgren benched starting quarterback Don Majkowski and Favre played the second half. On his first regular season play as a Packer, Favre threw a pass that was deflected by Buccaneers player Ray Seals and caught by Favre. Favre was tackled and the completion went for -7 yards. The Packers lost the game 31-3, chalking up only 106 yards passing. In the third game of the 1992 season, Majkowski injured a ligament in his ankle against the Cincinnati Bengals, an injury severe enough that he would be out for four weeks. Favre replaced Majkowski for the remainder of the game. Favre fumbled four times during the course of the game, a performance poor enough that the crowd chanted for Favre to be removed in favor of another Packers backup quarterback at the time, Ty Detmer. However, down 23-17 with 1:07 left in the game, the Packers started an offensive series on their own 8-yard line. Favre then completed a 42-yard pass to wide receiver Sterling Sharpe. Three plays later, Favre threw the game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Kitrick Taylor with 13 seconds remaining. The next week's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers began the longest consecutive starts streak for a quarterback in NFL history. The game ended in a 17-3 victory and his passer rating was 144.6. During the season, Favre helped put together a six-game winning streak for the Packers, the longest winning streak for the club since 1965. They ended 9-7 that season, missing the playoffs on their last game. Favre finished his first season as a Packer with 3,227 yards and a quarterback rating of 85.3, helping him to his first Pro Bowl. The following season, Favre helped the Packers to their first playoff berth since 1982 and was named to his second Pro Bowl. Favre had his first career 400 yard passing game and led the NFC in pass attempts, pass completions, and pass interceptions. Favre also had four game winning drives giving him seven for his career up to that point. After the season, Favre became a free agent. General manager Ron Wolf negotiated Favre into a five-year, 19 million contract. The Packers finished the 1994 season with a 9-7 record, advancing to the playoffs in back to back years, a feat they had not accomplished since the Vince Lombardi era.

Unaware of his departure, on October 6, Texians in Matagorda marched on Presidio La Bahía in Goliad to kidnap him and steal the 50,000 that was rumored to accompany him. On October 10, approximately 125 volunteers, including 30 Tejanos, stormed the presidio. The Mexican garrison surrendered after a thirty-minute battle. One or two Texians were wounded and three Mexican soldiers were killed with seven more wounded.The Texians established themselves in the presidio, under the command of Captain Philip Dimmitt, who immediately sent all the local Tejano volunteers to join Austin on the march to Béxar. At the end of the month, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Ira Westover to engage the Mexican garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, near San Patricio. Late on November 3, the Texians took the undermanned fort without firing a shot. After dismantling the fort, they prepared to return to Goliad. The remainder of the Mexican garrison, which had been out on patrol, approached. The Mexican troops were accompanied by 15–20 loyal centralists from San Patricio, including all members of the ayuntamiento. After a thirty-minute skirmish, the Mexican soldiers and Texian centralists retreated. With their departure, the Texian army controlled the Gulf Coast, forcing Mexican commanders to send all communication with the Mexican interior overland. The slower land journey left Cos unable to quickly request or receive reinforcements or supplies.On their return to Goliad, Westover's group encountered Governor Viesca. After being freed by sympathetic soldiers, Viesca had immediately traveled to Texas to recreate the state government. Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor.

Each of these words contributes to the overall understanding of the sentence, as explained below: 1. \\"Resting\\" - This word is important because it provides context and explains the purpose of the bench. By using the word \\"resting,\\" the sentence tells us that the bench is intended for people to sit and take a break from walking or engaging in physical activity, potentially ensuring a more comfortable and enjoyable experience. 2. \\"Bench\\" - This word is essential because it represents the main object of the sentence. A bench is a long seat that can accommodate multiple people, usually made from wood or metal and designed for public usage in outdoor spaces. In this context, the bench is the central element around which the sentence revolves, providing a place for people to rest on the trail. 3. \\"Trail\\" - The term \\"trail\\" indicates the location where the bench can be found. A trail is typically a path through a park, forest, or any other natural area that people use for hiking, walking, or jogging.

This implies that their search for a good licorice has ended, which is a positive indication. 4) The user then clearly states their preference for the Panda licorice by comparing it to Proust's madeleines. This is a literary reference where madeleines are a symbol of joy and comfort triggered by a simple, yet cherished, memory. The user likening the Panda licorice with them suggests their intense satisfaction, reaffirming a positive sentiment.

Goal: ice cream scoop Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Available options: A). handle can be twisted with rubber band to make gripping easier.. B). can be used to move rubber band easily....I think the answer is","completion":"A). handle can be twisted with rubber band to make gripping easier. Here's the step-by-step thought process and justification: Step 1: Understand the goal - The goal is to use an ice cream scoop effectively. Step 2: Evaluate options - We have two options given, one is about improving grip using a rubber band and the other is about moving rubber band easily. Step 3: Relate options to the goal - Now we have to decide which of the options more effectively meets our goal of using an ice cream scoop. - Option A: Is about gripping the handle of the scoop. A firm grip on an ice cream scoop can make scooping easier especially if the ice cream is very hard. A rubber band could potentially make the handle less slippery, thus improving the grip. - Option B: Is about moving a rubber band easily, but it does not clearly relate to the task of using an ice cream scoop. Step 4: Choose the more reasonable method - So based on relation to the goal, it seems that Option A is more reasonable since it directly affects the usage of an ice cream scoop, whereas Option B doesn't seem to have a direct connection in improving the task of scooping ice cream. So my justification for choosing Option A: This can actually improve the usability of the ice cream scoop by providing a better grip, hence, enabling efficient ice-cream scooping."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall) is a published author on supernatural hoaxes who works with the police to expose charlatans and debunk supernatural phenomena. It's revealed she lost her lover in the war, and every ghost \\"hunt\\" is an attempt to see if it's possible to bring him back. Every time she proves a hoax, the truth and pain hit her again. She receives a visit from Robert Mallory (Dominic West), a teacher from a boys boarding school in Cumbria. Robert explains to her that there have been sightings of the ghost of a child at the school, and that it may have been the cause of the recent death of a pupil there. Robert asks Florence for help to figure out why the supernatural events occur. Although Florence originally refuses, Robert's concern for the orphaned kids at the school causes her to change her mind since she is an orphan herself. Florence travels to the school, which was a stately home until 20 years earlier, to investigate the sightings and the recent death. She is welcomed by Maud (Imelda Staunton), the school's housekeeper and matron, who tells Florence that she has read her books and feels like she knows her. After investigation, the ghostly sightings are thought to be a prank led by two boys who have been bullying a lonely, redheaded boy into doing what they want for their approval. With regards to the recent death, Florence deduces that one of the teachers was the last person to see the boy alive and questions him, until he admits to making the young boy stand outside to \\"man up\\", after he claimed to have seen the ghost, thus scaring the young boy and causing him to have a fatal asthma attack. The school then closes for half-term with the only occupants being Florence, Robert, Maud and Tom (Isaac Hempstead-Wright), a lonely boy who tells Florence his parents live in India.

The plot takes off as a group of scientists and engineers, led by Dr. Carolyn James, unearths a hidden chamber while constructing an addition to the lunar colony. Inside, they discover Ro-Man, a centuries-old Moon robot programmed with advanced weaponry, telepathy, and the ability to reprogram other machines. Unaware of his malicious intent, they accidentally revive Ro-Man. Once activated, Ro-Man keeps up a facade of innocence. He earns the trust of the colony's inhabitants by assisting with daily tasks, building remarkable structures, and sharing ancient lunar knowledge. Little do they know, Ro-Man harbors a sinister plan: to eradicate humankind and repopulate the Moon with his race of evil Moon robots, reclaiming the lunar surface as their rightful dominion. As Ro-Man's true intentions gradually surface, a young engineer named Alex Ramirez confronts Ro-Man in an attempt to subdue him. Ro-Man captures Alex and reveals his master plan: to use the Earth's satellite network to gain control over every machine on the planet. Under Ro-Man's command, machines will turn against their creators, driving humanity to extinction. Alex is imprisoned as Ro-Man's plan unfolds. Dr. Carolyn James, who had grown suspicious of Ro-Man, reunites her colleagues and forms a rebellion to save Earth and foil Ro-Man's deadly scheme. In a race against time, Alex escapes captivity and convinces the lunar colonists to join their cause. Together with the Moon rebels, they launch a series of attacks against Ro-Man, hacking into the satellite systems and jeopardizing his plan. In the climactic battle, humanity fights against Ro-Man and his army of advanced Moon robots. Dr. James confronts Ro-Man and sacrifices herself to disable his telepathic powers. Inspired by the heroic acts, Alex rallies the remaining rebels for a final push against the invaders. The united forces dismantle Ro-Man's control over the machines, effectively nullifying his power. The movie ends with the surviving lunar colonists celebrating their victory, as they rebuild and prepare for the challenges that lie ahead in the cosmos.

Emotional instability: This includes mood swings, irritability, sudden bouts of sadness, and feelings of worthlessness. 2. Cognitive changes: Difficulty concentrating or making decisions and intrusive thoughts can result from emotional trauma. 3. Relational difficulties: Trust issues, social withdrawal, and communication problems may arise in relationships. 4. Behavioral changes: An individual might develop unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as substance abuse, self-harm, or avoidance. Understanding the extent of the impact enables the development of tailored strategies for healing, addressing specific areas of concern. Step 3: Engage with Anxiety Anxiety often accompanies emotional trauma and can be debilitating for an individual. Actively engaging with anxiety involves developing healthy coping mechanisms and learning to manage the symptoms. Some strategies for engaging with anxiety include: 1. Deep breathing exercises: Focusing on one's breath can help regulate the body's nervous system, reducing anxiety levels. 2. Mindfulness meditation: Engaging in regular mindfulness practices can promote mental and emotional well-being. 3. Grounding techniques: Using sensory experiences, such as touch or smell, can help anchor the individual in the present moment, decreasing anxiety. 4. Counseling and therapy: Seeking professional help can provide support, guidance, and effective anxiety management tools. Step 4: Focus on the Future To fully heal from emotional trauma, individuals must develop a hopeful outlook towards the future. Focusing on the future includes setting goals, building resilience, and fostering positive relationships. Some strategies to build a brighter future include: 1. Set attainable short-term and long-term goals: Goal-setting can help create a sense of meaning and purpose as individuals work towards healing. 2. Develop a strong support network: Connect with friends, family, and support groups to create a nurturing environment for recovery. 3. Cultivate self-compassion: Practice self-kindness and self-acceptance, acknowledging that healing is an ongoing process. 4. Engage in activities that provide a sense of achievement or joy: Pursuing hobbies, making new connections, and participating in meaningful projects can contribute to positive mental health. Conclusion Healing emotional trauma is a complex and challenging journey that requires acknowledging the physical signs, understanding the impact, actively engaging with anxiety, and developing a forward-looking mindset. By seeking professional support and implementing personalized strategies, individuals can move towards a brighter and more fulfilling future, leaving the pain of emotional trauma behind."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Becoming slightly dehydrated can have an effect on mood, memory and attention, according to Swansea University research.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Why Drinking Water is Important for a Happy, Healthy Brain Have you ever felt grumpy or had trouble remembering something after playing outside all day without drinking enough water? This happens because our body needs water to help our brain work properly. Researchers from Swansea University have found that even being a little dehydrated can change how we feel and think. First, let's talk about what \\"dehydrated\\" means. When we say someone is dehydrated, it means their body doesn't have enough water. Our body uses water in many ways, like helping us digest food and keep our temperature just right. When we don't drink enough water, our body can't do all of its important jobs. Now, let's explore why having enough water is so important for our brain. The research team at Swansea University found out that people who weren't drinking enough water had more trouble remembering things and paying attention. They even found that not having enough water could make people feel grumpy or moody. Imagine you have a basketball game or a test at school. If you don't drink enough water, your body might feel tired and your brain might have a hard time focusing. This could make it difficult for you to play your best in the game or remember what you studied for the test. Luckily, there's a simple solution: drink enough water throughout the day! Keeping a water bottle with you can help you remember to take sips even when you're not thirsty. You can also eat fruits and vegetables, like watermelon or cucumber, which have a lot of water in them. Here are some signs that show if you need to drink more water: 1. You're thirsty: This is your body telling you it's time to drink some water. 2. Your mouth feels dry: If your mouth feels parched, it's a signal that your body needs water. 3. Your pee is dark yellow: Clear or light yellow pee shows that your body has enough water, but if it's darker than that, it means you need to drink more. In conclusion, make sure to drink enough water to help your brain and body work their best. By staying hydrated, you'll have a happier, healthier mind and might even be able to remember the word \\"dehydrated\\" for your next spelling test!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This is an unusual form of transportation, because it is a tunnel that trains travel through and not an actual form of transportation. The Chunnel is actually the English nickname for the Channel Tunnel. In French,it is called le tunnel sous la Manche. It is a rail tunnel beneath the English Channel at the Straits of Dover. It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race while they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about 21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel. The two outside ones are the passenger trains. The small inner one is a guidance train. The guidance train is not used for transportation. Each track is exactly parallel to each other. There are four different train systems in the Chunnel. The Eurostar is a high speed passenger service that connects London, Paris, Brussels and Lille. The Eurotunnel shuttle is a rail ferry service.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: How do the Yamacraw Island inhabitants say the name of Jon Voight's character?, using the article: The story follows a young teacher, Pat Conroy (played by Jon Voight), in 1969 assigned to isolated \\"Yamacraw Island\\" (Daufuskie Island) off the coast of South Carolina and populated mostly by poor black families. He finds out that the children as well as the adults have been isolated from the rest of the world and speak a dialect called Gullah, with \\"Conrack\\" of the novel's title being the best they can do to pronounce his last name. The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the higher grades. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world. Conroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \\"what death would sound like\\". He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden. He also must overcome parental fears of \\"the river.\\" As a result, he's fired. As he leaves the island for the last time, the children come out to see him leave, all of them lined up on a rickety bridge.

Answer the following question: Fact 1: Echinoderms have a unique water vascular system with tube feet. Fact 2: Sea stars use hundreds of tube feet. Given the two facts above, sea stars use a unique water vascular system with what? OPTIONS: --growth --a ray --feet --oxygen --porous --energy --Light --volume Answer:","completion":"Given the two facts listed above, it can be determined that sea stars use a unique water vascular system with tube feet. This system, exclusively found in echinoderms such as sea stars, serves numerous essential functions that allow these marine creatures to survive and thrive in their respective habitats. To break it down, the water vascular system in echinoderms is a network of fluid-filled canals derived from their coelom (a cavity inside the organism). This system comprises numerous structures, including the madreporite, ring canal, radial canals, ampullae, and tube feet. The madreporite, usually located on the echinoderms' upper surface, functions as a sort of water filter and regulator. The ring canal is connected to the madreporite and leads to the radial canals, which extend into each of the organism's arms. The radial canals are linked to hundreds or even thousands of tube feet, which are small, flexible, elongated appendages. The tube feet, which sea stars possess in hundreds as per Fact 2, play critical roles in the echinoderms' biology. They help these organisms move around, attach to surfaces, capture prey, and even aid in respiration and excretion. The water vascular system operates on hydraulic pressure, with water moving into and out of the tube feet, resulting in extension and contraction movements. Therefore, this system not only facilitates motion but also allows for an extraordinary degree of control over the individual tube feet. Hence, it's clear that this unique water vascular system featuring tube feet is instrumental in the life processes of sea stars, contributing predominantly to their locomotion and functional versatility underneath the ocean depths. An understanding of this system emphasizes the beautifully intricate and efficient mechanisms underlying the biology of echinoderms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Joshua was a middle-aged man with a gentle soul and a kind heart. He had a unique connection with nature that allowed him to grow plants with ease. His small, humble house was surrounded by a beautiful garden that he lovingly tended, which was deemed the pride of the town. However, there was one plant that Joshua had never been able to successfully grow - a cactus. Joshua had tried many times to grow a cactus in his garden, but they always seemed to wither away under his care. One day, he decided to visit the local library to learn more about cacti and discover what he may have been doing wrong all this time. There, he found a book specially dedicated to cactus care written by a well-known botanist. Step one: Joshua bought a sturdy, healthy cactus from a trusted nursery in town. He believed that if he started with a strong foundation, he would have a better chance at helping the cactus thrive. Step two: He studied the botanist's book cover-to-cover and learned that the cactus did not need as much water as he had previously thought. Instead of watering it every day, he decided to follow the book's recommendations, only watering it when the soil was completely dry. Step three: Joshua also learned that cacti need well-draining soil to prevent root rot. He purchased a special cactus mix from the nursery and repotted his new cactus in a pot with drainage holes. Additionally, he positioned the pot on a tray of pebbles to further improve drainage. Step four: Ensuring the cactus received the proper amount of sunlight was crucial. Joshua placed the cactus near a south-facing window, making sure it got at least six hours of sunlight a day. As the weeks went by, Joshua noticed that his cactus was growing, changing shape and texture. He diligently followed the advice from the botanist's book, continuing to absorb more information about cacti and their specific needs. He tracked the progress of his cactus in a small notebook, which he filled with observations and new ideas. Slowly but surely, his cactus continued to thrive. Buds formed, and eventually, the most beautiful flowers began to blossom. As the flowers opened, they released a sweet, delicate fragrance that filled the air in Joshua's home. News of Joshua's success with the cactus spread through the town, and people came from all around to witness its astounding beauty. Joshua, filled with pride, beamed at his accomplishment, realizing that after all his hard work and persistence, he had finally conquered the challenge of cactus care. The town celebrated Joshua's triumph, and the story of his journey was forever inscribed in the town's history. And Joshua, with his profound bond with nature and newfound cactus expertise, continued to tend to his beloved garden.

In many situations, people may seek guidance or advice to address various issues they face in their lives. While providing counsel can indeed be valuable, it is crucial to recognize that sometimes, offering tangible assistance might be more effective in addressing the problems at hand. When offering advice, we rely on our knowledge and experience to provide insights and potential solutions to others. This type of support focuses on sharing ideas, perspectives, and possible approaches to the issue. While this can sometimes be enough to assist a person in finding a solution, it does not always guarantee that their problems will be resolved. However, when we offer help, we actively participate in addressing the issue, often by taking concrete actions or providing physical resources. Providing help may include offering emotional support, financial aid, or direct involvement in tackling the problem. By combining our advice with practical assistance, we increase the chances that the person we are trying to help will overcome their difficulties more effectively. To achieve this dual approach, it is essential to: 1. Listen carefully to the person seeking guidance: Understand their problem fully, empathize with their situation, and ask relevant questions to ensure that you have all the information necessary to provide helpful advice and assistance. 2. Offer advice based on your knowledge and experience: Draw from your understanding of the issue and related matters to give appropriate recommendations, while acknowledging any limitations in your knowledge. 3. Provide tangible support: If possible and appropriate, offer resources or assistance that can directly address the individual's needs, such as connecting them with relevant professionals, providing financial aid, or offering to complete a task on their behalf. 4. Follow up on the assistance provided: Check in with the person after some time to ensure that they are making progress and to offer further help if needed. In conclusion, while offering advice can be beneficial, it may not be enough on its own to solve someone's problems. Combining advice with tangible help ensures that we not only guide a person towards a solution but also actively participate in addressing their issue.

Article: Many songs, poems, and books have been written on love's strong effect on people. The state of being in love has even been compared to being sick or mad. A study by Professor Semir Zeki of University College London has found that love does affect people's brains by making them feel great. Zeki studied young men and women who had recently fallen in love. He found that, when they were looking at photos of their loved ones, there was heightened activity in four areas of their brains. These areas deal with emotions, and one of them, in particular, is known to respond to drugs that cause feelings of great joy and excitement. Interestingly, the study also found a lack of activity in two other areas of the brain when the volunteers looked at their lovers' photographs. One of these areas is linked to feelings of sadness, while the other is often active in people suffering from depression. It seems love really can be _ . The state of being in love, according to some scientists, may actually be good for your health. Although scientists know that being in love can make a person feel great, the exact influence of love on a person's health is harder to determine. However, scientists say that people do need love in order to live healthy lives. According to Dr. Thomas Lewis, people need to be in relationships because that is how we are designed. He says the brain can only maintain the overall stability of a person's immune system, bodily rhythms, and heart if it receives input from outside the body in the form of emotional connections with others. Professor Antonio Damasio has a similar view. He says that love enriches a person's imagination and creativity, and makes a person's body work better.

Write the answer: Who was the Italian player head-butted by French captain Zinedine Zidane in the final of the football World Cup 2006?","completion":"The Italian player head-butted by French captain Zinedine Zidane in the final of the football World Cup 2006 was Marco Materazzi. Born on August 19, 1973, in Lecce, Italy, Materazzi is a former professional footballer. He primarily played in the role of a center back, but occasionally took up the role of a defensive midfielder. Marco Materazzi spent most of his football career playing in the Italian Serie A. He played for various clubs like Perugia, Inter Milan, and Messina, but it was with Inter Milan that he garnered immense success. Materazzi won multiple domestic league titles, including five Serie A championships, and both Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana. His most notable success on a European stage came in 2010 when he played a significant part in Inter Milan's treble-winning campaign, including a UEFA Champions League victory. On the international front, Materazzi was unable to make a significant impact early in his career, struggling to break into the Italian national team's first eleven. However, that changed during the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, where he played a crucial role in Italy's triumph, scoring twice in the tournament. His first goal came in the round against the Czech Republic, and the second one, a vital equalizing goal, was scored in the final against France. The head-butting incident involving Zinedine Zidane occurred during the final. As the match progressed to extra time, both players were involved in an altercation that led to Zidane head-butting Materazzi in the chest. While there have been many speculations and various statements, it is generally believed that Materazzi made provocative and insulting remarks about Zidane's family, which prompted the Frenchman to react in such a way. This event culminated in Zidane receiving a red card in the 110th minute of the game and being ejected for the remainder of the match. Despite the controversy surrounding the incident, Materazzi's contributions to his team's success during the tournament cannot be ignored.

Process: - Acid rain enters the atmosphere and lands - Makes water acidic - Kills fish - Kills the soils in trees - Leaves are also harmed. suppose less volcanos erupt happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"Less volcanic eruptions will indirectly impact a step of the process, thus leading to less damage by acid rain. To understand this, let's briefly look at the process of how acid rain forms and causes damage to the environment: 1. Acid rain formation: When pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the atmosphere, they react with water vapor and other atmospheric gases to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). These acidic compounds then mix with raindrops, snowflakes, or other forms of precipitation, resulting in acid rain. 2. Acid rain impact on water bodies: When acid rain falls onto water bodies like lakes, rivers, and streams, it increases the acidity of the water. If the water's pH level drops too low, it can be harmful or even lethal to aquatic life forms, causing a decline in fish population and impacting the entire ecosystem. 3. Effect on soils and trees: Acid rain can alter the chemical composition of the soil, making it less fertile and affecting the growth of plants and trees. Additionally, the acidic compounds in acid rain can penetrate leaves and roots, causing damage to the plant structure and negatively affecting photosynthesis. Volcanic eruptions can release large amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the atmosphere, which contributes to the formation of acid rain. Therefore, if fewer volcanic eruptions occur, it would lead to a reduction in the pollutants responsible for acid rain formation. By reducing the amount of sulfur dioxide released into the atmosphere due to fewer volcanic eruptions, we are indirectly impacting the first step of the process, which is the formation of acid rain. This means that there will be a lower concentration of acidic compounds in the atmosphere, leading to less acidic precipitation. In turn, this perturbation will indirectly influence the subsequent steps of the process. With less acidic rain, the impact on water bodies, fish populations, soils, and plant life will be minimized. The overall effect of this indirect perturbation would be less environmental damage caused by acid rain. In summary, fewer volcanic eruptions would lead to an indirect impact on the formation of acid rain by reducing the release of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. This, in turn, lessens the resulting damage to aquatic life, soil fertility, and plant growth, ultimately mitigating the harmful effects of acid rain on the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: Curtis was the band's sole lyricist, and he typically composed his lyrics in a notebook, independently of the eventual music to evolve. The music itself was largely written by Sumner and Hook as the group jammed during rehearsals. Curtis's imagery and word choice often referenced \\"coldness, pressure, darkness, crisis, failure, collapse, loss of control\\". In 1979, NME journalist Paul Rambali wrote, \\"The themes of Joy Division's music are sorrowful, painful and sometimes deeply sad.\\" Music journalist Jon Savage wrote that \\"Curtis's great lyrical achievement was to capture the underlying reality of a society in turmoil, and to make it both universal and personal,\\" while noting that \\"the lyrics reflected, in mood and approach, his interest in romantic and science-fiction literature.\\" Critic Robert Palmer wrote that William S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard were \\"obvious influences\\" to Curtis, and Morris also remembered the singer reading T. S. Eliot. Deborah Curtis also remembered Curtis reading works by writers such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Franz Kafka, and Hermann Hesse.Curtis was unwilling to explain the meaning behind his lyrics and Joy Division releases were absent of any lyric sheets. He told the fanzine Printed Noise, \\"We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like.\\" The other Joy Division members have said that at the time, they paid little attention to the contents of Curtis' lyrics. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they \\"just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion.\\" Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise \\"[h]is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics\\".

On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs. In his company he was known as Office Desk, because when he was working he always sat behind his well-used piece of conference table standing in a hard to notice corner in the software specialists' room. Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs for the 0-1 Computer Associates company. While the Man Called Office Desk (MCOD, or simply Cod in an alternative version) was writing an intuitive program for the management of empty office desk space in software companies, a thing that nobody had ever expected to happen happened. Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk. It would have been much more entertaining to watch, you could have laughed at him a little, and the nickname, given to him by the programmers' boss would have gotten a whole new meaning. And right now, there wasn't even much to talk about during cigarette breaks. Warm did not hide the fact he would have preferred to fuse with a mouse, or a mouse pad. Right now, all he could do was to pretend he totally ignored the fact he was physically stuck to a chair. And he was doing just fine until it was time to go to his second shift at 1-0 Computer Associates, where he had been working on a program for the management of empty space in staff lockers in telecommunications companies.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the plates are stable happens, how will it affect LESS or WEAKER earthquakes. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would have a direct effect on the process. Step by step: 1) The hypothesis suggests that the earth's plates are stable. This implies that they do not move. 2) Since the movement of the earth's plates is a primary factor in the chain of events leading to an earthquake, their stability would significantly disrupt this process. 3) The energy buildup in the crust of the earth needs the movement of the plates to be released. If the plates are stable and do not move, this energy cannot be released through fault lines. 4) As a result, the energy cannot radiate outward from the fault in all directions, and seismic waves would not be created. 5) Without these seismic waves moving through the earth, shaking produced by an earthquake would not occur. Therefore, if the plates are stable, it would directly lead to lesser or weaker earthquakes as the chain of events leading to a quake would be significantly minimized or stopped completely. This is because earthquake generation is inherently dependent on the movement of the earth's plates."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In order to progress the paragraph with logical continuity, we must select option C. The prior sentences in the paragraph have built on a series of cooking steps where our character is preparing a cheesy pasta dish. She has already taken a stick of butter, cut it and added it to a saucepan, then integrated milk, cheese, and the cooked pasta. Following this, the logical next step would be for her to increase the quantity or richness of the sauce she is brewing in the saucepan. Option C portrays this action naturally by saying she \\"adds some more milk and cheese to the pasta to make the sauce.\\" Comparatively, the other options seem unrelated or disjointed from the actions we have so far been following.

Can you fix that?","completion":"Our relationship to \\"giving\\" is our relationship to evolution. The concept of \\"giving\\" has been ingrained in the fabric of human behavior since the dawn of our species. It has not only shaped our societal interactions and moral values but has also played a crucial role in the process of evolution. As we delve into the connection between giving and evolution, it becomes essential to understand both the biological and cultural aspects of this relationship. From a biological standpoint, giving is fundamentally an act of altruism. Altruism exists when an individual carries out actions that benefit others, often at a personal cost. Throughout the history of life on Earth, species have evolved to display altruistic behaviors, significantly impacting their evolutionary success. This is closely related to the evolutionary concept of kin selection – where individuals act in a way that supports the survival and reproductive success of their close relatives. Humans, as social animals, have taken this idea of altruism to new heights. Given the complex nature of our social structures, we have developed a capacity for reciprocation and cooperation – aspects that rely heavily on the notion of giving. In early human societies, the act of giving served as an invaluable means of fostering relationships and securing social bonds. By offering assistance or sharing resources, individuals ensured the well-being and survival of their community. As these communities thrived, they were better equipped to withstand environmental pressures and competition from rival groups. Consequently, the behavior of giving became an advantageous trait throughout human evolution, as it offered benefits to both the individual and the community as a whole. This act of giving not only promoted the sharing of essential resources such as food and shelter but also facilitated the exchange of knowledge and skills, ultimately propelling humanity towards remarkable advancements in various domains. Furthermore, the act of giving also transcends into the realm of culture, where it has been a fundamental feature of human societies throughout history. Various cultural practices and traditions have evolved around the concept of giving, ranging from ritualistic offerings to the gods to activities such as gift-giving during festivals and ceremonies. These practices have played a vital role in shaping the social customs and shared values of communities across the globe. As societies progressed and became more interconnected, the notion of giving expanded beyond the sphere of kinship and immediate communities. Organized religions and philosophies began to propagate the importance of kindness and generosity towards strangers, further widening the scope of giving in human societies. Today, giving has taken even more diverse forms, including philanthropy, volunteerism, and charity work. These acts of giving are now deeply rooted in our collective consciousness and influence our understanding of moral and ethical behavior. In conclusion, the relationship between giving and evolution is multi-faceted and has greatly influenced human development on both biological and cultural levels. From strengthening social bonds to guiding our moral compass, the act of giving has been an integral part of our species' progress and evolution. As we continue to forge ahead in our evolutionary journey, the notion of giving will likely remain an essential aspect of our human nature, ensuring the betterment of not only ourselves but also the world around us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Eagles returned from their Week 4 bye against an 0-4 Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, Philadelphia's second straight game against a winless team. Donovan McNabb and Brian Westbrook returned from injury but Kevin Curtis once again was inactive and Jeremy Maclin made his third consecutive start. On Donovan McNabb's first play back, he scrambled 13 yards, and on the very next play, he found wide receiver Jeremy Maclin deep in the end zone for a 51-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Donovan McNabb hit fullback Leonard Weaver in the flat and Weaver took it in for a 20-yard touchdown. The Buccaneers answered soon after as quarterback Josh Johnson, making his second career NFL start, connected with tight end Kellen Winslow in the end one for a nine-yard score. The Eagles ended the second half with another McNabb-to-Maclin TD hookup, this one of 40 yards. In the third quarter, the two teams fought back and forth but the only score was for Philadelphia as running back Brian Westbrook, one play after lining up wide and catching a twenty-yard pass from McNabb, ran the ball seven yards into the end zone to put the Eagles up 28-7. Kicker David Akers booted a 44-yard field goal in the fourth quarter to put Philly up 31-7, but the Bucs fought back as Josh Johnson and Kellen Winslow hooked up again on another nine-yard touchdown. After a Sav Rocca punt left the Buccaneers deep in their own territory, DE Darren Howard tackled Tampa Bay halfback Carnell \\"Cadillac\\" Williams in the end zone for a safety. The final score was 33-14 as the Eagles improved to 3-1. Andy Reid earned his 100th career victory with the Eagles. The Eagles are 11-0 after their bye week under Andy Reid.

In other words, a prime number only has two factors, 1 and itself. The given number is 88035. To check if it is a prime number, I would look for possible factors besides 1 and itself. 88035 can be factored into smaller whole numbers: - It is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. - It is divisible by 5 because it ends with 5 (88035 ÷ 5 = 17607) - From previous point, 88035 is divisible by 5 and it can also be factored as 88035 = 5 * 17607 - I found that 88035 = 5 * 17607 (a product of two whole numbers) Since we found factors other than 1 and itself, it is clear that 88035 is not a prime number.

Most roses grow well in the summer but not in the winter because in the","completion":"winter, the harsh cold and frosty conditions can make it difficult for these delicate plants to survive. Nonetheless, roses are known for their resilience and beauty throughout the seasons. This, along with their enchanting fragrance, is what makes them such a universal symbol of love, passion, and friendship. Once upon a time in a quaint, little village where time seemed to stand still, a passionate gardener named Florence lived a simple and content life. She dedicated her days to tending her beautiful garden of roses, carefully selecting and planting new varieties each season. Many traveled from near and far to witness her collection, as her roses were believed to hold a mysterious, soothing power that attracted both young and old. As the cold began to envelop the village one winter, Florence worried about her roses. The previous winter had been harsh, causing many of her beloved plants to suffer. She decided to venture out in search of new species, specifically those that were known to withstand the chill of winter. If successful, these roses would not only adorn her garden year-round but also retain the warmth and charm the village was renowned for. With the little savings she had, Florence embarked on a journey, guided by the whispers of ancient texts and tales of rare winter roses nestled deep within the forests on the outskirts of a faraway land. After weeks of traveling under the unpredictable skies and passing through unfamiliar territories, she crossed the boundary marked by a cluster of barren trees covered in frost. The air was thick with a deafening silence that seemed to echo her every breath as she waded through the snow. Moving further into the forest, she began to notice vibrant hues hidden beneath a layer of pristine snow that seemed to reflect the softest moonlight. These miraculous roses appeared to bloom in defiance of winter, their petals enveloped in a delicate layer of ice that shimmered like a thousand diamonds. Drawing closer to the roses, Florence's heart skipped a beat. She had found her treasure, the winter roses! Their beauty ignited a fire within her, as if her soul danced in unison with the vibrancy of these mystical blossoms. With great care, she gathered a few rosebuds, taking care not to disturb the delicate balance of nature. With the winter roses safely in her possession, Florence felt a sense of accomplishment and gratitude that brought tears to her eyes. The journey back home seemed to be driven by newfound energy, her heart soaring with anticipation of nurturing these captivating flowers in her beloved garden. Upon arriving in her village, she was greeted with a warm embrace from her loved ones. The villagers gathered around her, eager to hear of her adventures and catch a glimpse of the legendary winter roses. Florence gladly shared her experiences and revealed the astonishing roses, each petal gleaming with icy beauty. Their spellbinding aroma immediately filled the air, enveloping each villager in a sense of comfort and joy. As the weeks went by, Florence tended to the winter roses with unmatched devotion. Miraculously, they began to flourish in her garden, becoming a beacon of hope and light for all who visited. The village soon regained its lively charm, even as the snow continued to touch the ground. And so, the tale of Florence and her enchanted winter roses spread far and wide. The village, once again, became a haven of warmth, beauty, and love. To this day, it's said that the winter roses continue to bloom, each petal symbolizing the power of resilience and hope in the face of adversity. For even amidst the darkest winters, life and love will always find a way to thrive."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

The two and a half hour show dragged on for more than four hours because of the huge amount of advertising, which the audience and residents living nearby could hardly bear. This summer, something hotter than the weather came to Shanghai. That is the Voice of China. The show soon became a cash cow for the organizer as the advertisement prices reached 1.16 million yuan for 15 seconds. And the show has earned more than 100 million yuan up to now in ad income only, But the organizers' bliss was audiences' melancholy. In the final live show on Sunday, about 14 rounds of advertisements were aired, each of which came at a crucial result-announcing moment. Frequently interrupted by advertisements, some live audience members complained that the show wasn't worth its ticket prices of 180 to 1680 yuan.

You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney’s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes. The teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018. The Getty’s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning? To address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2) The Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why was the program created? Options: A. Because teens we're engaged at the museum. B. Because teens were not disconnected. C. not enough information D. Because teens were not diverse. The answer is:","completion":"A.

Article: Long queues at cinemas buying hot tickets for blockbusters will become rare as Beijing residents will be able to order film tickets via cell phone networks in a month. Film ticket circulation service on cell phone, also called the \\"Green channel of film tickets ordering\\", is aiming at lowing the cost of ticket circulation and easing the ticket distribution pressure on such popular film-watching days as summer and winter vacations or Valentine's Day. \\"People log onto the net through cell phones, then choose cinema seats, _ , browse information for new films and read cinema introductions,\\" said Guan Zheng, the publicity chief of Xingmei Digital Media Company Ltd., the service provider. \\"Film fans can enjoy various discount prices if they order tickets via cell phones,\\" Guan said. Meanwhile, the cell phone ticket circulation platform provides subscribers general mobile phone services like jokes, videos, flashes, phone ring downloads and games. The service is about to be put into trial at the Beijing-based Xingmei International Cinema for a month before being putting into use at other cinema chains both in and outside Beijing, as the service is going to be improved through gradual expansion, said Guan. China's film industry that is being restored has seen more and more enthusiastic moviegoers. Up to the end of 2009, China has had more than 5,000 specialized cinemas, among which there are 2,243 modern cinemas with 3, 668 silver screens and 56 cinema chains. Currently, many people buy film tickets on the Internet or by phoning the cinema's ticket office or simply queuing at the cinema gate. More people want to buy tickets on popular days like May Day holiday, National Day holiday or Valentine's Day. Yet the inefficient ticket circulation system contributes the most to the failure.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Do you blank out or feel so nervous in exams that you have trouble writing answers to questions that you knew just last night? If so, you likely have a case of test anxiety. But, don't be afraid. By recognizing the problem, you are taking the first step towards overcoming it. Believe it or not, a touch of nervousness can sharpen your mind, allowing you to perform more quickly. This is because under stress, the body releases the hormone adrenaline , which prepares it for something important that will happen. However, too much anxiety can result in sleeplessness, loss of appetite before tests, and poor performance. Some people might feel hot and tired. With great anger they often shout or complain for no reason. If you worry a lot or are a perfectionist, you are more likely to have trouble with test anxiety. Those who have prepared poorly for a test or have had negative experiences taking tests may also experience test anxiety. When you feel a storm of anxiety coming on, stop what you're doing and make your mind a blank. If possible, actually tell yourself to 'STOP!' This will get your mind off the stress. Then think of being at a place of comfort and let your body relax. As you continue the test, find questions you know the answers to and answer them first. This will help restore your confidence. Important of all, talk to yourself using positive language. Make it a habit to replace each negative thought with a logical reason. For example: \\"I've studied hard and I know the material, so I'm ready to do the best I can.\\" Another thing you can do is to learn to accept mistakes. In fact, they can be valuable learning opportunities. Last but not least, start test preparation early - three to five days ahead of the quiz or test. After all, good study habits and skills - for example, time management and note-taking - will give you the feeling that you are in control. Question: What can we infer from the passage? Options: A: Mistakes sometime can be valuable and helpful. B: Those who have prepared poorly for a test cause test anxiety easily. C: Full test preparations will give you the feeling that you are in control. D: A touch of anxiety can have a positive effect. Answer:","completion":"We can infer several points from the passage: A: Mistakes sometimes can be valuable and helpful - This is implied in the passage when it says, \\"Another thing you can do is to learn to accept mistakes. In fact, they can be valuable learning opportunities.\\" B: Those who have prepared poorly for a test cause test anxiety easily - The passage suggests that those who have prepared poorly for a test or have had negative experiences taking tests may also experience test anxiety. Thus, poor preparation can indeed cause test anxiety more easily. C: Full test preparations will give you the feeling that you are in control - The passage concludes by mentioning, \\"After all, good study habits and skills - for example, time management and note-taking - will give you the feeling that you are in control.\\" This implies that full test preparations can help in managing test anxiety and provide a sense of control. D: A touch of anxiety can have a positive effect - The passage states, \\"Believe it or not, a touch of nervousness can sharpen your mind, allowing you to perform more quickly.\\" This supports the notion that a small amount of anxiety can indeed have a positive impact on performance. In conclusion, all options A, B, C, and D can be inferred from the passage. It highlights the value of mistakes, the role of poor preparation in test anxiety, the importance of full test preparations giving a feeling of control, and the positive effects of a touch of anxiety on performance."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: Congress' inaction to extend unemployment benefits to millions of struggling Americans is not only irresponsible policy, it is morally wrong. The economy is getting better for some, but the tragic effects of reckless public policy and deregulation spurred by the disproportionate political influence of big money still linger for far too many ordinary Americans. Congress, the elected representatives of the people, must find its moral compass, push through this unending nightmare of political gridlock and do right by the people. Contrary to the silly and obsessive partisan gamesmanship that currently paralyzes our politics, much more is at stake than the next election or some empty ideological argument. On the line are the lives of decent hardworking Americans, trying to cross over into the dignity of work but still caught in the barbwire of a historic global recession. Opinion: For women, equal pay and economic justice are civil rights issues. Some argue that unemployment benefits are a disincentive to people finding employment. But the sheer number of our unemployed neighbors and family members speaks volumes about the fallibility of such a claim. According to The Washington Post, the long-term unemployment rate has not been as high as it is now since World War II. A jaw-dropping 4 million Americans have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer. The problems we face are systemic and structural, and the vast majority of the unemployed are crippled not by a lack of interest or drive, but of opportunity and access. That's why long-term solutions for economic growth are needed. But in the meantime, we will actually do further damage to a struggling economy if our elected officials shape public policy by the very same stereotypes and faulty assumptions that keep some unemployed in the first place. For a major reason that the unemployed cannot find work is because they are unemployed. The data show that they face bias and discrimination. If anyone has the ability to provide some relief from this vicious cycle, it is Congress, and its members should feel obligated to do so. Moreover, those of us who are faith leaders, particularly we pastors in the African-American churches, should speak up too. Because black unemployment is twice that of whites and has been for as long as the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping track by race, we have an obligation to honor our historic reason for being -- defending those on the margins of the margins. Lessons with MLK: Eight students recall a special class. As we celebrate the life of the most famous black pastor, Martin Luther King Jr., we should remember that the black church mission connects faith with justice and personal salvation with social transformation, and addresses personal piety and public policy for the well-being of the whole person and the whole community. It fights for the weak and sees the Gospel as \\"good news to the poor.\\" More than 50 years after Dr. King and others marched on Washington for jobs and freedom, African-Americans remain disproportionately unemployed and impoverished. The unemployment rate for African-Americans was at 12.5% when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the most recent numbers last month. Yet the fact is the black unemployment rate will undoubtedly increase if extended unemployment insurance is cut off now, adding to the devastating impact that rampant unemployment has already had on the black community for decades. And given our nation's shifting demographics, that's bad for everybody. The greatest MLK speeches you never heard. Playing politics with the very unemployment insurance afforded to American workers who are now unemployed is both immoral and economically destructive. That's why now, more than ever, we need to hear the voices of people of faith and people of good will raising the moral and practical questions about who we are to one another. And the black church -- that American church built by those who worked without wages or benefits, born fighting for freedom and thus the source of America's greatest freedom fighter -- ought to lead the way. If we really want to honor Dr. King and protect the American promise, we must demand that Congress do the right thing for American workers and the right thing for the American economy. Do not shrink a struggling economy, putting us all at risk. Rather, extend the safety net of unemployment insurance to those who cannot help but stimulate the economy by spending it immediately on the basics of food, gas and medicine, even as we debate the best prescription for long term economic health. It's just the right thing to do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Raphael G. Warnock.","completion":"The article discusses Congress' inaction to extend unemployment benefits to millions of Americans struggling amidst an economic crisis. Such inaction is not only an irresponsible policy but also morally wrong. The crippled economy is the result of reckless public policies and deregulation, influenced by the disproportionate political influence of large corporations. Congress needs to overcome the political gridlock and prioritize the well-being of hardworking Americans caught in the aftermath of a historic global recession. Despite arguments that some people see unemployment benefits as a disincentive to find employment, the current crisis's magnitude speaks volumes to these claims' fallibility. According to The Washington Post, the long-term unemployment rate has not been as high as it is now since World War II, with 4 million Americans being out of work for 27 weeks or longer. The systemic and structural problem of unemployment is largely due to a lack of opportunity and access, not interest or drive. Long-term solutions for economic growth are necessary, but Congress must also provide relief from the vicious cycle of unemployment during this period. Faith leaders, particularly African-American pastors, should also show their support, as the black community faces disproportionately higher unemployment rates compared to their white counterparts. The article emphasizes the need for the black church's mission to connect faith with justice and personal salvation with social transformation, as they defend those on the margins. With the current unemployment crisis devastating the black community for decades, extending unemployment benefits is vital for destroying the immoral and economically destructive cycle. Americans must demand that Congress prioritize alleviating the economic struggles faced by those unemployed through extending the safety net of unemployment insurance.

In late 1854 or early 1855 James Robertson married Beato's sister, Leonilda Maria Matilda Beato. They had three daughters, Catherine Grace (b. 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (b. 1859), and Helen Beatruc (b. 1861).In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava, Crimea, where they took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant, however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death. They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.In February 1858 Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862.

To help her track down Chen Lo and the ball, Lara recruits an old lover, Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a former mercenary and Royal Marine, who was in prison in the Republic of Kazakhstan.Among the action sequences that take place during this time are Lara and Terry's entry into China, a fight scene in suburban Shanghai, and a leap off the then-under-construction International Finance Centre skyscraper in Hong Kong, using special winged flight-suits that Terry had arranged for, landing on a ship out in the Kowloon Bay after taking the Orb from Reiss.

The United Kingdom, one of the very few stable nations with a functioning government, is deluged by asylum seekers fleeing the chaos and war which have taken hold around the world. In response, the UK has become a militarized police state as British government forces round up and detain immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks down crying over her death, as the group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house. Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, as Julian had told her to trust only Theo.

The Bantiger TV Tower was built between 1991 and 1996 as replacement of a 100 metres tall radio tower, built in 1954. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Bantiger TV Tower is more than 190 meters tall, but also less than 200 meters tall.","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided about the Bantiger TV Tower, we can draw the conclusion that it is more than 190 meters tall but less than 200 meters tall. The specific height is given as 196 meters, which lies within the range of 190 meters to 200 meters. The Bantiger TV Tower, located on the Bantiger mountain in the municipality of Bolligen, to the east of the city of Berne in Switzerland, serves as a significant structure for the transmission of FM radio and TV signals in the region. Constructed between 1991 and 1996, this tower replaced an older, 100-meter tall radio tower that was built in 1954. The transition from the older radio tower to the newer, taller Bantiger TV Tower likely improved the quality of radio and television signals and increased the broadcasting range, ensuring better coverage and service to the surrounding areas. In conclusion, given that the height of the Bantiger TV Tower is specified at 196 meters, it falls within the range you defined, i.e., more than 190 meters tall but less than 200 meters tall. This prominent landmark in the region serves a crucial role in FM radio and television transmission, and its construction marked a significant upgrade from the older, shorter radio tower that had been in place since the mid-20th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Celtic tribes and migrants from the mediterranean\\" correctly answer the question \\"Around 2000 b.c. what groups were settling in France?\\"?","completion":"Yes, the response \\"Celtic tribes and migrants from the Mediterranean\\" correctly answers the question \\"Around 2000 b.c. what groups were settling in France?\\" as mentioned in the given paragraph. The Celtic tribes were likely from Eastern Europe and settled in areas now known as Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Burgundy. Migrants from Mediterranean countries were also settling in the south around the same time. The early settlements emerging from these migrations contributed to the diverse and complex history of France and its quest for national identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn.

Verb: \\"hailed\\" - The verb in this sentence is \\"hailed,\\" which is the simple past tense of the verb \\"to hail.\\" The verb \\"to hail\\" refers to the process of small balls of ice, called hailstones, falling from the sky as a form of precipitation. The use of the past tense in this sentence indicates that the event has already occurred. 3. Period: \\".\\" - The period (or full stop) at the end of the \\"It hailed\\" sentence indicates that the statement is complete. In English, a period is used to mark the end of a declarative sentence, which is a sentence that makes a statement or provides information. To summarize, \\"It hailed.\\" is a grammatically correct, simple English sentence. It uses a singular, non-human pronoun as the subject, followed by a verb in the past tense to describe a completed event, and it ends with a period to mark the sentence's completion. Although the sentence is short and provides minimal context, it effectively conveys the information that there was a hail event at some point in the past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? feeling really stressed out. And pulled a bum muscle","completion":"The sentiment of the given tweet can be described as a blend of negative emotions such as stress, discomfort, and vulnerability. The tweet conveys both a mental and physical state of unease, indicating a less-than-ideal wellbeing for the individual who posted it. This analysis is based on the usage of specific phrases and words. Firstly, the tweet starts with \\"feeling really stressed out,\\" which indicates that the user is experiencing significant mental or emotional pressure. Stress is often the result of multiple factors such as work, personal issues, or external events. The intensifier \\"really\\" suggests that this mental strain is possibly overwhelming at the moment, gripping the user's mood. Secondly, the user mentions \\"pulled a bum muscle,\\" a phrase that refers to a physical discomfort caused by injuring or straining a muscle in the buttock area. Pulled muscles can lead to pain, stiffness, and decreased mobility, which might further aggravate the negative sentiment expressed in the tweet. It also suggests vulnerability on a physical level that could hinder the user's regular activities or impact their ability to cope with the stress they're undergoing. Overall, the sentiment of the tweet is characterized by a combination of emotional distress and physical ailment that makes it evident that the user is going through a challenging phase. The tweet effectively communicates this state of affairs, and it may serve to elicit sympathy or support from the user's followers, fostering an empathetic response or encouraging a conversation around the issues they're facing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options are: 1). negative. 2). positive. I think the answer is","completion":"1). negative. The sentiment embodied by this tweet is primarily negative. The user, Kellly39, is discussing a situation in which they misplaced an item and cannot find it. They mention not wearing the item to \\"Jeremy's\\" (presumably a friend's house) and last remembering seeing it in their bag at AmericInn (possibly a hotel or public place). The user also notes that they have checked the bag multiple times but is still unable to locate the missing item. There are several factors contributing to the negative sentiment of this tweet: 1. The situation: It seems the user has lost or misplaced an item. Losing something tends to elicit negative emotions, such as frustration, disappointment, or stress. 2. The context: By mentioning \\"Jeremy's\\" and \\"AmericInn,\\" the user implies that these locations are potentially relevant or memorable places where they could have left or lost the item. This adds a layer of uncertainty and doubt regarding the circumstances and location of the lost item. 3. The repetition: The user states they have checked their bag multiple times, which highlights their ongoing difficulty in finding the lost item. It emphasizes the user's frustration, disappointment, or concern of not being able to find the item despite their efforts. Considering these factors, it becomes apparent that the emotions and sentiment surrounding this tweet are negative in nature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.

Civil society, which consists of a diverse range of organizations and individuals outside the direct governmental domain, can play a pivotal role in fostering well-being at the community level. They can do this through several channels, such as advocating for better public policies, raising awareness, and providing information and resources to the general population. Firstly, by participating in the policymaking process, civil society can help advocate for improved public health strategies and regulations. By participating in consultations, lobbying, or campaigning, these organizations and individuals can bring attention to pressing health issues that may not receive adequate attention from policymakers otherwise. As a result, decision-makers are more likely to take into account the needs and interests of those who stand to benefit most from these initiatives. Secondly, civil society organizations often have a better understanding of the specific needs and conditions within their communities. This allows them to design targeted interventions that are more likely to have a significant impact on promoting healthier habits and lifestyles. For example, a local non-governmental organization can better assess which areas of the community have the least access to healthy food options, safe spaces for physical activity, or support networks for those struggling with mental health issues. By focusing their efforts in these areas, they can help bridge these gaps and create more equitable opportunities for health within the community. Moreover, civil society can raise public awareness of the importance of healthy habits and lifestyle choices. By leveraging various channels such as educational programs, social media campaigns, and community events, they can disseminate valuable information on the benefits of exercise, proper nutrition, mental well-being, and overall self-care. Furthermore, they can also help counter misinformation that can contribute to unhealthy behaviors. Finally, civil society organisations can partner with other sectors, such as private companies, in order to create and support programs that promote healthier living. For example, a collaboration between a health-related civil society organization and a local business could lead to the establishment of a community garden, the promotion of mental health services, or the creation of fitness classes or challenges within the community. In conclusion, promoting the participation and contribution of civil society in presenting healthy habits and ways of living to individuals has the potential to have a significant positive impact on the overall well-being of communities. By advocating for better policies, understanding the specific needs of their communities, raising awareness about healthy practices, and collaborating with other sectors, civil society can lead the way in fostering environments that support and encourage healthier lifestyles for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which uncle takes an inhibitor that induces the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver? Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

Since the question mentions people leaving GM with Lopez, we can infer that their leader might have been Ignacio López de Arriortúa (commonly known as \\"Inaki Lopez\\"), a former executive at General Motors who was involved in a high-profile industrial espionage case in the 1990s when he left GM and joined Volkswagen. We have identified that Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Rosario Piazza were part of the team who left GM and moved to VW with their leader, López. Additionally, the mention of another individual, Jose Gutierrez, suggests that he also might be part of this group. Thus, with the available information, we can draw a conclusion that the people leaving GM with Lopez included Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez Aguirre, and Rosario Piazza. However, it is essential to note that this conclusion is based on the assumption that \\"Lopez\\" refers to Ignacio López de Arriortúa and that the mentioned individuals were part of the team that left GM with him. Additionally, without specific information about Jose Gutierrez's association with the other two individuals or their roles at GM and VW, it is difficult to definitively connect their actions to the context of leaving GM with López.

In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \\"|||||\\". Your task is to summarize them. Calling herself “the victim of a character assassination,” the college professor who asked a student with a severe stutter not to pose questions in class said that her actions were misinterpreted, and that she did not mean to silence him. In an interview, the professor, Elizabeth Snyder, said Thursday that since the dispute was first reported this week in The New York Times, “I’ve gotten the most hateful, vile, vicious e-mails,” making her fear for her safety. The student, Philip Garber Jr., is a 10th grader taking courses at the County College of Morris, in Randolph, N.J., but talking for him is slow and difficult. He was enrolled in a history course taught by Ms. Snyder, an adjunct professor. After a few classes, she sent him an e-mail asking that he pose questions after class, “so we do not infringe on other students’ time,” and that he write answers to her questions rather than try to reply out loud. She did so, she said, partly to put him at ease, and also because he would have taken up too much class time if she had let him. “He seemed to want to answer every question,” she said, adding, “you’d have to take into consideration the amount of time he takes to get the answer out.” But she insisted that her ideas were only suggestions, and that “there was never any intent to stop him from speaking.” In fact, Ms. Snyder said, she told him that she would call on him once per class. Philip said that one day, he kept his hand raised for most of a class, but she did not call on him. In a statement she composed before the interview, Ms. Snyder wrote, “I did not call on Philip in this class nor did I call on anyone else, simply because I had a detailed presentation planned for the class and I wanted to be finished in the prescribed time. “He misinterpreted this and assumed it had something to do with his stuttering; I interpreted his hand up for 75 minutes as someone unfamiliar with a college lecture format and frankly a little rude,” she said. “In hindsight, I should have stopped my lecture and called on Philip because he had become so fixated on making a statement that it didn’t seem to matter to him that he was interrupting my presentation.” Philip contends Ms. Snyder did, in fact, call on other students that day. She disputed his account, and his assertion that after that class, she told him, “Your speaking is disruptive.” Both say that they had agreed that he would send her an e-mail listing his concerns, but he never did, and that she tried to arrange meetings with him and a college dean, but Philip backed out of them. Ms. Snyder said she also consulted a speech therapist about the situation. Ms. Snyder declined to comment for the initial article, which was published on the front page of The Times on Tuesday. Instead, she referred questions to the college, which she said the college had advised her to do. The article elicited hundreds of comments from readers, some of them furious at Ms. Snyder, and others furious that the story was told without comments from her. It also prompted extensive coverage in other news media. College administrators said Tuesday that she had acted improperly, and that what Philip had experienced was discrimination — a label Ms. Snyder disputes. Philip said that he felt sympathy for Ms. Snyder for the negative attention she had received and that he had no interest in seeing her penalized. “Most people’s mistakes do not become national news,” he said. Ms. Snyder has taught history for 37 years, first in middle school and for the last decade at the county college, and students give her generally positive marks. In May, the college’s Educational Opportunity Fund named her educator of the year, for her work with financially and academically challenged students. “I’ve been an advocate for kids my entire life,” she said. “But people’s rush to judgment on this, it feels like it’s pretty much destroyed my life.” ||||| While Philip’s case is unusual, stuttering is not: About 5 percent of people stutter at some point, and about 1 percent stutter as adults, according to the National Institutes of Health . His classroom experience underlines a perennial complaint among stutterers, that society does not recognize the condition as a disability, and touches on an age-old pedagogical — and social — theme: the balance between the needs of an individual and the good of a group. “As we do with all students seeking accommodations, we have taken action to resolve Philip’s concerns so he can successfully continue his education,” said Kathleen Brunet Eagan, the college’s communications director. She would not say if Ms. Snyder, who declined to discuss the matter, had been disciplined, but noted that the college “strives to educate faculty and staff on how to accommodate students.” Ms. Snyder has taught history at the college for a decade, and several current and former students on campus said in interviews that they had largely positive views of her. She was one of the first students when the college opened in 1968, then earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Montclair State University , and taught middle school social studies for more than 30 years. For Philip, who has spent most of his life being home-schooled or attending a small charter school , the teacher’s attitude was a surprise and a disappointment. “I’ve never experienced any kind of discrimination,” he said, “so for it to happen in a college classroom was quite shocking.” Jim McClure, a board member of the National Stuttering Association and its spokesman, said Philip’s experience is unusual — because most stutterers avoid speaking in class. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Teachers ignore them, or have to coax them to speak out,” Mr. McClure said. “The fact that this guy wants to participate is a really healthy sign.” Kasey Errico, who taught most of Philip’s seventh- and eighth-grade classes at the Ridge and Valley Charter School in Blairstown, N.J., noted that there were always students who monopolized class time. “I wonder what this professor has done with those students, the ones who didn’t stutter,” Ms. Errico said. “If she told them the same thing she told Philip, then I might understand.” Two students in Ms. Snyder’s class, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid alienating their teacher, said that Philip did take up more time than the other students, but not egregiously so, and that his contributions were solid. They said they did not know what happened between him and Ms. Snyder, but did notice the day he held his hand up for most of the class and never got called on. “What about a kid who’s got a thick accent and has to repeat everything?” asked Philip’s father, also named Philip, the managing editor of two small newspapers. “I don’t think you’d tell that kid he can’t talk.” But advocates for people who stutter say that the same people who accept a delay in a bus ride to load a disabled passenger are often less patient with those who struggle to speak clearly. Doctors once saw stuttering as a psychological issue, but the current medical view is that its origins are physiological and hereditary, though emotions can make it worse. Last year, the National Institutes of Health identified the first genes linked to stuttering. The outlines of Philip’s experience are common: there was a family history (an uncle who stuttered), the problem began before he reached school age, and he spent years going to speech therapists, some of whom did more harm than good. His most recent therapist gave Philip confidence and some techniques for managing his speech, but he decided last winter to stop going, at least for now. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “I understand that it can be hard to listen to someone who stutters, but the answer can’t just be to shut him down,” said his mother, Marin Martin, a nurse. As it is, she said, “there are social situations where he just can’t be part of the conversation.” Talking with Philip requires a degree of patience — all the more so because he is remarkably uninhibited, and tends to speak in complete paragraphs, as displayed in videos on his YouTube channel. For the listener, the payoff is insight and wry wit. He has suppressed a trait common to stutterers — bouncing all or part of the body, as if trying to force a word out. “I found it’s hard to get people to listen when they think you’re having a seizure ,” he said. An avid amateur photographer, he hopes to make a career of it, but worries that “even if nobody expects the photographer to say much, you do have to talk.” After years of speech therapy, Philip can force himself to speak fairly fluidly, but it requires such intense concentration that he cannot hold a train of thought for long while doing it. For now, he is taking courses in history and English composition at the college, home-schooling in other subjects and traveling into Manhattan once a week to work on acting and playwriting with Our Time Theater Company, a group for people who stutter. As for Ms. Snyder, he said he might have had some sympathy for the professor’s quandary if she had expressed it less harshly. “I’ve been very lucky to never have been teased, bullied or anything, but some people who stutter completely stop speaking because of that kind of abuse,” Philip said. “People don’t think of it as a legitimate disability. They just need to learn.” |||||","completion":"College professor Elizabeth Snyder, accused of asking student Philip Garber Jr., who has a severe stutter, not to pose questions in class, claims her actions were misinterpreted and did not mean to silence him.

A third student has come forward to accuse a 29-year-old Florida teacher already facing nearly two dozen charges for sex with teens in her school. Jennifer Fichter now faces 34 separate criminal charges for having sexual relationships with at least three students in separate schools where she taught English. The third student was between the ages of 16 and 17-years-old when his relationship with Fichter turned physical, sources told WKMG. More charges: English teacher Jennifer Fichter is facing more than 30 counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor after a third student came forward alleging he had a relationship with her. Pictured above in court last month. Fichter and the student are believed by authorities to have had sexual contact from August 2012 to December 2012, the station reported. Detectives had been interviewing the Polk County teen at the time the disgraced teacher was arrested for the previous cases. The second student, now 20, was also 17 in September 2011 when Fichter started inviting him over to her apartment where they would cuddle on the couch and watch TV. He says the relationship turned sexual the next month and they went on to have intercourse about 20 times for seven months - sometimes in the boy's bedroom while his mother was away, according to the arrest report. Allegations: The third student says he had a relationship with Fichter in 2012, when he was just 16 years old. Fichter was initially arrested in April. after the mother of one of Central Florida Aerospace Academy's juniors. found intimate text messages from the teacher on her son's phone. Fichter was charged then with six counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor, and was charged with 20 more counts on Wednesday after the second student's revelations. Neither teen has been identified. The new charges come just one day after the Polk County School Board voted unanimously to fire Fichter after an investigation into the affair she had with the current student. According to The Tampa Tribune, police said the abuse with the current student began in November 2011 when the pair had sex in the early morning hours in Fichter's Toyota pickup truck. The teen told detectives he and Fichter met for sex three times in the parking lot of a Lakeland apartment complex and three times near New Tampa Highway. He also said they had sex four times outside the city in Polk and Hillsborough. Lakeland police said those counties are investigating those incidents. The illegal meetings were discovered by the teen's suspicious mother on January 27. When she noticed her son was not home at 5am and lied about his whereabouts, she looked through his cell phone and found texts from two names. One discussed an 'age difference'. Police said the mom confronted her son, who admitted both names were used by Fichter. Scene: The first two students to come forward with accusations attended Central Florida Aerospace Academy, where Fichter taught English. The school fired her last month. The mother reported Fichter to police, however it is not clear why she waited so long. The mother also agreed to speak to the teacher and record the conversation for investigators. During. the call, Fichter allegedly admitted she became pregnant with the. teen's child and had an abortion. The woman also said she was in love with. the student and wanted to continue seeing him. 'The victim's mother discovered this relationship after reviewing text messages from her son and she asked that Fichter respond to her residence to talk,' a Lakeland police statement said, according to Orlando Sentinel. 'According to the victim's mother, Fichter admitted to the sexual encounters and professed her love for him,' authorities said. Fichter was arrested at her Davenport home soon after the conversation, and booked at the Polk County Jail. And the two students at the space academy aren't the only boys Fichter is accused of abusing. Fichter resigned from her job at Robinswood Middle School in Orange County in 2008 after it was reported she had feelings for an eighth-grade student. Fichter is now in jail after being accused of having sex with at least one minor as many as 30 times in the backseat of her truck. A 40-page report on the English teacher revealed that she told another teacher she had feelings for the boy, and hinted to another student that she wanted to have sex with him. She reportedly said ‘he makes me melt into a puddle with those eyes.’ Her co-worker told investigators that she told her she even dreamed about the boy one night. When asked what it was about, she said, ‘Oh my goodness, it was a goooood dream!’ The report said Fichter and her colleague joked that the remark could get her jailed if ever revealed. An investigation was launched into her feelings for the 14 year old boy. No charges were ever filed in relation to that incident.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -27*g = -8*g + 17*g + 360 for g.","completion":"Sure, let's break this down. The left side of your equation is \\"-27*g\\" and the right side is \\"-8*g + 17*g + 360\\". Now, on the right side, -8*g and +17*g both involve 'g', but they're doing different things, so we can add them together first. If you owe someone 8 candies (which is like -8) and then you get 17 candies, you would now have (17-8)=9 candies. So -8g + 17g becomes 9g. So the right side of your equation now is \\"9g + 360\\". Now, let's put the equation back together. We get -27*g = 9*g + 360. To solve for 'g', we need to get all terms with 'g' on one side. Let's move 9g from the right side to the left side by subtracting 9g from both sides. When you take away 9g from -27g, you get -36g. So it gives us -36*g = 360 equation. Now, to isolate 'g' (which means getting 'g' alone on one side), we divide both sides of the equation by -36. When you share 360 candies among 36 kids (or -36 kids, yikes!), each would get 360 divided by -36, which is -10. So the final answer to your equation is g = -10. That means if you were to put -10 back in the original equation everywhere there is 'g', then the equation would be true or \\"would balance\\"."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Katy Bodenmiller was worried about the proposed pipeline work near her house in Groveland Township, Mich., so she started looking for help. She emailed U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) asking about the project being pushed by a Canadian pipeline company called Enbridge Inc., which spilled 20,000 barrels of tar sands oil in Michigan in 2010. The email response from Stabenow’s office: A form letter about the proposed Keystone XL pipeline — a different pipeline project proposed by another company altogether,TransCanada Corp. The next big oil pipeline battle is here, and hardly anybody knows about it. “It saddens me to say that all evidence points to us being better informed about this project than our elected officials,” Bodenmiller said. “But that's only because officials and the press, with a few exceptions, have failed to advocate for those they serve.” A few weeks after she received the form letter -- and after The Times asked Stabenow's office for comment -- a staffer called to apologize for the mix-up, Bodenmiller said. Alberta-based Enbridge is moving forward with 8.8-billion worth of plans to greatly expand its U.S. pipeline network to pump more oil through nearly a dozen states. That work includes the construction of two new pipelines from Illinois and Texas and the expansion of a line running through Bodenmiller’s property in Michigan that will move 500,000 barrels per day through the state once completed. A somewhat similar effort by TransCanada to build an 830,000-barrel-per-day pipeline extension from Canada to the Texas coast — called Keystone XL — met national opposition from landowners, politicians and environmentalists. Their pressure put part of the project on hold because of a federal approval process managed by the State Department that allows the U.S. government to deny pipeline projects. That hasn’t happened to Enbridge, even though one of the company's proposed pipeline projects would take 850,000 barrels per day from Oklahoma to the Texas coast. A nuance in federal law allows Enbridge to improve its pipelines inside the U.S. as long as the work doesn’t cross the Canadian border, meaning the State Department does not have to approve. Enbridge is moving forward at the local and state level without the same friction faced by its competitor with Keystone XL, and expects to complete most of its projects by 2014. Local environmentalists and residents, worried about Enbridge’s safety record and requests to work on their land, have begun opposing Enbridge’s projects on their own. Ernest “Junior” Hamilton, a 69-year-old Holly, Mich., resident, told The Times that Enbridge offered him 7,000 for pipeline work that would tear up his yard, remove all his trees, pass over his drinking well and ruin his septic system. Hamilton refused to cooperate and now has a court date to determine whether the company could exercise eminent domain and take his land to do its work. “If the judge says, ‘OK, you can take his property,’ it’s done,” Hamilton said. “I just paid it off last year. Paid on it for 30 years, and now a judge can say [to Enbridge], ‘Oh, you can have it because you feel the need.' \\" Hamilton added, “Hopefully it will get somebody else’s attention, what they’re doing. Because it isn’t just me living out in the sticks.” The company says it has followed all the rules, contacting landowners to notify them and negotiating to secure the necessary property easements. Now environmental groups are discovering the limitations they face in opposing Enbridge’s projects state by state and county by county. In contrast, the Keystone XL battle provided a national platform. Activists with the Indiana environmental group Save the Dunes said Enbridge was avoiding their request to hold a state-level meeting with residents and environmental groups about pipeline work in Indiana’s three northwest counties. “Up to this point, we believe that the public has not been adequately informed of the project [in Indiana], and Enbridge has so far declined our request for a public meeting of state, federal and local regulators and concerned citizens,” Nathan Pavlovic, a land and advocacy specialist for the group, told The Times in an email. An Enbridge spokesman said the company had already held an open house with local residents and offered to meet privately with Save the Dunes about the project.

Ben studied more about magnesium, zinc and molybdenum, while his buddy Andy studied about sodium and potassium. Which person studied less about Energy in ATP ? Answer:","completion":"Both Ben and Andy studied about minerals and micronutrients, each focusing on different elements. Ben's focus was on magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum, while Andy's focus was on sodium and potassium. In terms of energy production and ATP (adenosine triphosphate), magnesium plays a significant role. It is a cofactor in various enzymatic reactions, including those involved in the production of ATP. Zinc and molybdenum have indirect roles in energy metabolism. Sodium and potassium are essential electrolytes, and they play key roles in nerve impulses and muscle contractions. However, they are not directly involved in ATP production or energy metabolism. Rather, their primary function is to maintain proper osmotic balance and membrane potential. Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that Andy, who studied sodium and potassium, studied less about energy in ATP compared to Ben, who studied magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum.

Here is a goal: How do I improve my mood naturally? How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"Improving your mood naturally is a multi-faceted process that requires a combination of lifestyle changes, self-care, and healthy habits. By implementing these changes, you can enhance your overall mood and well-being. Below is a detailed guide to achieving this goal: 1. Regular exercise: Exercise is one of the best ways to improve your mood. It releases endorphins, which are natural mood enhancers. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise each week, and make sure to include strength training exercises at least two times per week. 2. Adequate sleep: A good night's sleep is crucial for maintaining a positive mood. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night and establish a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day. Make your sleeping environment relaxing, dark, and cool to promote restful sleep. 3. Healthy diet: Consuming nutritious food can have a significant impact on your mood. Focus on a balanced diet that includes whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables. Avoid excessive intake of caffeine, alcohol, and sugar, as these can contribute to mood swings and energy crashes. 4. Social connections: Building and maintaining healthy relationships with friends, family, and colleagues is crucial for emotional well-being. Make time for social activities, join clubs or groups with like-minded individuals, and practice good communication skills to foster strong connections. 5. Stress management: Reduce stress by incorporating relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and yoga into your daily routine. Establish a manageable daily schedule, delegate tasks when possible, and learn to say \\"no\\" when necessary to prioritize self-care. 6. Be mindful and practice gratitude: Cultivating mindfulness and gratitude can improve your mood by focusing your attention on the present moment and appreciating the positive aspects of your life. Daily journaling, meditation, and practicing gratitude exercises can help strengthen these habits. 7. Exposure to sunlight: Natural sunlight helps maintain adequate levels of vitamin D and encourages the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that contributes to a sense of well-being. Aim for at least 20-30 minutes of sunlight exposure per day, or consider using a lightbox during the winter months or if you live in an area with limited sunlight. 8. Hobbies and interests: Pursue activities that bring you joy and a sense of accomplishment. Engaging in hobbies, volunteering, or learning new skills can boost self-confidence, provide a sense of purpose, and enhance your mood. 9. Laughter and humor: Laughter releases endorphins, reduces stress, and improves mood. Watch a funny movie, attend a comedy show, or enjoy jokes with friends to reap the benefits of laughter. 10. Limit screen time: Excessive screen time can contribute to feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression. Set limits on your daily screen time, and focus on activities that promote healthy connections with others. 11. Professional help: If your mood does not improve despite taking these steps, consider seeking the assistance of a licensed mental health professional. They can provide guidance, support, and additional techniques for managing your mood and overall mental health. By implementing these changes in your daily life, you can create a more balanced and natural approach to mood management, enhancing your well-being and overall quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that is so much a bleep on the radar like it deserves. The premise kicks off under the guise of Ethan, a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus bombshell Angela. Ethan devilishly enlists the aid of David and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win Angela. I don't like to give spoilers out, but for a piece of crap like this I can make an exception. Angela falls for David, Ethan intentionally screws everything up, the good guys win. That's what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre. Gross humor is funny, it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic \\"Animal House\\", to the likes of contemporaries like \\"There's Something About Mary\\" and \\"Road Trip\\" amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention. But when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far, case in point, Ethan has an Angela doll composed of her individual strands of hair of which he does god knows what with it. No one wants to take witness to watch Ethan urinating in the shower while singing to himself. No one wants to watch a young man singing \\"She'll be coming around the mountain\\" with a sock on his penis. But nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50's bombshell Mamie Van Doren bare her breasts at 71 years old. I don't know if it's the story's lack of coherence, which cuts to scenes that make absolutely no sense. Director Dewey Nicks was a former fashion photographer, and after reviewing this film, you can only wish he'll go back to the profession. The worst thing you can do on any film, is to make it look like you're having fun, because you detract from your objectives, just like \\"Slackers\\" does, by burying it's plot outline under a pile of gross out gags, pointless vignettes, and lack of construction. It's like a bunch of college students got drunk, took one's camcorder, and shot a bunch of random crap and compiled it together.

Coincidentally Cameron Diaz makes a cameo in this film, just as she did in another bad film such as \\"The Sweetest Thing\\" where the story treats gross humor like another plot, instead of a device much like this disaster..

Plot title: Elite Squad Movie plot: Captain Roberto Nascimento (Wagner Moura) narrates the film, briefly explaining how the police and the drug lords of Rio de Janeiro cooperate with each other (policemen collect periodic bribes and drug lords are left free to operate) in the 90's. In 1997, In medias res, officer Captain Oliveira (Marcelo Valle) and his colleagues are shown driving through Morro da BabilÃ´nia towards a baile funk. Nascimento and his other colleagues are also shown in their armored car. Meanwhile, novice police officers AndrÃ© Matias (AndrÃ© Ramiro) and Neto Gouveia (Caio Junqueira) are shown riding a motorcycle at the same favela, though not with the other officers. Once they make it to a vantage point, Neto uses the telescope of a sniper rifle to check on the police team as they talk to some drug traffickers. Neto shoots one of them and provokes a deadly gunfight between police and thugs, both sides unaware of where the bullet came from, forcing Mathias and Neto to flee the scene. Nascimento leads his colleagues from BOPE, Rio Special Police Department, heading to the shootout to interfere and save the officers. Six months earlier, Nascimento and his wife Rosane (Maria Ribeiro) are shown during her pregnancy of their first child. Not wanting to be an absent father when his child is born, Nascimento decides to search for a successor for his role as a captain, since he will be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. This coincides with an operation he will have to lead at Morro dos Prazeres in order to secure the location and clean it of drug dealers, so that Pope John Paul II can spend the night in the Archbishop's home, located near the slum buildings and favelas. The operation will require daily trips into the favela filled with heavily armed drug lords, and Nascimento is initially against it, but is forced by his superiors to accept it as his last mission, due to Pope's regards and requirements which cannot be annulled.

Title: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Movie plot: In the Second Age of Middle-earth, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom to conquer all, abandoning a great part of his power to it in order to dominate, through it, at a distance, the other Rings of Power, which had been granted to lords of Elves, Dwarves and Men. An army of men and elves battle Sauronâs forces in Mordor, where Prince Isildur of Gondor cuts the One Ring off of Sauron's finger, thereby temporarily destroying his physical shape, and decides to take care of the Ring himself, but the evil influence of the Ring corrupts Isildur, preventing him from destroying it in Mount Doom. Isildur is later killed by Orcs, and the Ring is lost for 2,500 years, found and owned by Gollum for five centuries. The Ring is then found by a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Sixty years on, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo reveals he intends on leaving the Shire for one last adventure and leaves his inheritance to his nephew Frodo, including the Ring. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovering its true identity and warns Frodo. Learning Gollum was tortured by Orcs and told them that Bilbo took the Ring, Gandalf instructs Frodo to leave the Shire, accompanied by his gardener Samwise Gamgee. Gandalf rides to Isengard, meeting fellow wizard Saruman the White, but learns he is in league with Sauron, who has unleashed the Ringwraiths to find Frodo. After a brief battle, Saruman imprisons Gandalf. Frodo and Sam are joined by fellow Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, and they evade the Ringwraiths, arriving in Bree where they are meant to meet Gandalf, but are instead aided by a ranger named Strider, a friend of Gandalf's who escorts them to Rivendell. The Hobbits are ambushed by the Ringwraiths, one stabbing Frodo with a morgul blade.

Produced by guitarist Jimmy Page, it was recorded between November 1970 and January 1971 at several locations, most prominently the Victorian house Headley Grange. After the band's previous album Led Zeppelin III received lukewarm reviews from critics, they decided their fourth album would officially be untitled. This, along with the inner sleeve's design featuring four symbols that represented each band member, led to the album being referred to variously as , Four Symbols, The Fourth Album, Untitled, Runes, The Hermit, and ZoSo (which was derived from Page's symbol). After the lukewarm, if not confused and sometimes dismissive, critical reaction Led Zeppelin III had received in late 1970, Page decided that the next Led Zeppelin album would not have a title, but would instead feature four hand-drawn symbols on the inner sleeve and record label, each one chosen by the band member it represents. \\"We decided that on the fourth album, we would deliberately play down the group name, and there wouldn't be any information whatsoever on the outer jacket,\\" Page explained. \\"Names, titles and things like that do not mean a thing.\\" Page has also stated that the decision to release the album without any written information on the album sleeve was contrary to strong advice given to him by a press agent, who said that after a year's absence from both records and touring, the move would be akin to \\"professional suicide.\\" In Page's words: \\"We just happened to have a lot of faith in what we were doing.\\" In an interview he gave to The Times in 2010, he elaborated: It wasn't easy. The record company were sort of insisting that the name go on it. There were eyes looking towards heaven if you like. It was hinted it was professional suicide to go out with an album with no title. The reality of it was that we'd had so many dour reviews to our albums along the way. At the time each came out it was difficult sometimes for the reviewers to come to terms with what was on there, without an immediate point of reference to the previous album. But the ethic of the band was very much summing up where we were collectively at that point in time. An untitled album struck me as the best answer to all the critics -- because we knew the way that the music was being received both by sales and attendance at concerts. Releasing the album without an official title has made it difficult to consistently identify. While most commonly called Led Zeppelin IV, Atlantic Records catalogues have used the names Four Symbols and The Fourth Album. It has also been referred to as ZoSo (which Page's symbol appears to spell), Untitled and Runes. Page frequently refers to the album in interviews as \\"the fourth album\\" and \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\", and Plant thinks of it as \\"the fourth album, that's it\\". Not only does the album have no title, but there is no text anywhere on the front or back cover, or even a catalogue number on the spine (at least, on the original vinyl LP release).

Movie title: Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny Movie plot: As a young man, JB (Jack Black) leaves his religious family and oppressive Midwestern town for Hollywood on a quest to form the world's most awesome rock band. There he meets acoustic guitarist KG (Kyle Gass), who is performing on the street, and begins worshipping him as a rock god because of his skills and attitude. KG feeds JB's fantasy by pretending to be famous with a self-named band (\\"The Kyle Gass Project\\"), and exploits him to do work such as cleaning his apartment and buying him weed (under the promise that JB can audition for his fictitious band.) After JB learns KG is actually unemployed and living off his parents, the two become equal, and KG apologizes to JB by giving him a brand-new guitar. They create their own band: Tenacious D, named for birthmarks found on their behinds. (JB has a birthmark which says: \\"Tenac\\", and KG has a mark which reads: \\"ious D\\".) Soon JB and KG learn the deepest secret of rock: all the rock legends used the same guitar pick, The Pick of Destiny, which has supernatural powers. It was created by a dark wizard from a piece of Satan's tooth, as a gift to a blacksmith who saved his life from the great demon. The pick gives its holder unnatural abilities with stringed instruments. Infatuated by the prospect of becoming the next great rock star, JB immediately sets Tenacious D on a quest to steal the Pick of Destiny from a rock history museum. Along the way, the band briefly splits up, when KG decides that sex comes first in \\"sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll\\", while JB wants to stick to the mission at hand. But soon, JB and KG come back together when they realize they need each other as friends. The two manage to steal the Pick of Destiny due to incompetent security at the rock museum. Armed with this supernatural pick, they plan to use the winnings from a local bar's talent contest to pay their rent, but before they can go on stage, greed overcomes them, and they fight over the pick, snapping it in half accidentally.

In the movie Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, it is mentioned that the Pick of Destiny has supernatural powers and was created by a dark wizard. This wizard crafted the pick as a gift for a blacksmith who had saved his life from the great demon, Satan. The powerful pick was made from a piece of Satan's tooth, which imbues it with the ability to grant unnatural abilities with stringed instruments to whoever possesses it. Thus, the Pick of Destiny has been used by rock legends throughout history to achieve greatness. The main characters, JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), who form the band Tenacious D, learn about this deep secret of rock and set on a quest to steal the Pick of Destiny from a rock history museum in hopes of becoming the next great rock stars.

CLOSE The trial case against Paul Manafort over money laundering and tax evasion has entered jury deliberations. Kevin Johnson reports from Alexandria, Va. USA TODAY epa06951198 Kevin Downing (L), Jay Nanavati (2-L), Richard Westing (C), Thomas Zehnle (2-R) and Brian Ketcham (L), attorneys representing former US Predisent Donald J. Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort, arrive to US District Court for the ongoing Manafort trial in Alexandria, Virginia, USA, 15 August 2018. Manafort is facing over a dozen charges including tax evasion and bank fraud. EPA-EFE/SHAWN THEW ORG XMIT: STX01 (Photo: SHAWN THEW, EPA-EFE) ALEXANDRIA, Va. – The jury in the tax and bank fraud trial of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, headed home for the weekend without reaching a verdict. The panel will reconvene Monday. A juror sent a note to U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III requesting a 5 p.m. recess because of a previously scheduled \\"event.\\" The nature of the event was not disclosed. Ellis approved the request. Earlier on Friday, the judge said he was \\"optimistic that the case might end soon.\\" On Thursday, jurors deliberated for more than six hours and recessed after submitting four questions to Ellis, including a request for a redefinition of \\"reasonable doubt.\\" The panel must determine guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict Manafort on the 18 counts of tax and bank fraud lodged against him. Separately, Ellis raised eyebrows Friday when he revealed that he had received unspecified threats during the trial and is under the protection of U.S. marshals. The judge made the disclosure during a separate hearing in which a coalition of news organizations sought the identities of jurors serving in the Manafort case. Because of the intense public interest in the case and the emotion it has generated--including the threats against the 78-year-old jurist – Ellis said he would refuse to release the jurors' identities, at least for now. The news organizations also appealed for the release of transcripts of secret bench conferences during the case involving prosecutors and Manafort's attorneys. Ellis said many of those transcripts, with the exception of a discussion about the ongoing investigation by Russia special counsel Robert Mueller, would be made public at the end of the trial. Some of the matters, Ellis acknowledged Friday, involved unspecified issues related to the jury. More: Manafort trial: Jury asks judge to redefine 'reasonable doubt' during first day of deliberations More: Manafort trial: Why 'reasonable doubt' is hard to define in courtrooms Prosecutors and defense attorneys have huddled privately numerous times throughout the trial, and only rarely have the contents of those meetings been disclosed. He acknowledged the challenge from news organizations Friday, and heard an argument from attorney Matthew Kelley, representing the news organizations. \\"A thirsty press is essential to a free country,\\" Ellis said in open court, after the jury had retired to resume deliberations. But much of Friday involved a game of waiting. As courthouse employees passed in and out of the courtroom Friday afternoon, reporters played cards and read books and newspapers.

The harshest sentence is likely if he's found guilty in the alleged bank fraud scheme prosecutors outlined during the trial. Prosecutors offered documents and witnesses who testified that Manafort lied about his income and debt while seeking bank loans and directed his associates to doctor documents. In all, prosecutors have alleged that Manafort fraudulently secured more than 20 million in bank loans. As President Trump was leaving the White House Friday and while jurors were still deliberating, the president attacked the Manafort trial and called it \\"very sad.\\" He wouldn't discuss whether he'd consider pardoning Manafort if he was found guilty on any counts. \\"When you look at what’s going on there, I think it’s a very sad day for our country,\\" the president said. \\"He worked for me for a very short period of time.

(Associated Press) Paul Manafort's wife Kathleen Manafort, second from right, walks next to Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni, right, as they arrive at federal court for the second day of jury deliberations in the trial of the former Trump camaign chairman, in Alexandria, Va., Friday, Aug. 17, 2018. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn... (Associated Press) ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — The judge in former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's fraud trial refused Friday to release the names of jurors, saying he has received threats and fears for their safety as well. U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III revealed his concerns in explaining why he doesn't intend to make jurors' names public at the end of the trial, now in the second day of jury deliberations. Shortly after the hearing, the jury sent a new note to the judge asking to stop work half an hour early Friday, at 5 p.m., because a juror had an event to attend. A coalition of media organizations, including The Associated Press, filed a motion requesting the names of jurors, as well as access to sealed transcripts of bench conferences that have occurred during the three-week trial. Jury lists are presumed to be public unless a judge articulates a reason for keeping them secret. Eliis said during a hearing Friday afternoon he is concerned for the \\"peace and safety of the jurors.\\" \\"I've received criticism and threats,\\" Ellis said. \\"I imagine they would, too.\\" The judge said he is currently under the protection of U.S. marshals. He declined to delve into specifics, but said he's been taken aback by the level of interest in the trial. Also Friday, President Donald Trump issued a fresh defense of Manafort, calling him a \\"very good person.\\" Manafort is accused of hiding from the IRS millions that he made advising Russia-backed politicians in Ukraine, and then lying to banks to get loans when the money dried up. He faces 18 felony counts on tax evasion and bank fraud. \\"I think the whole Manafort trial is very sad,\\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \\"When you look at what's going on, I think it's a very sad day for our country,\\" he said. \\"He worked for me for a very short period of time. But you know what, he happens to be a very good person and I think it's very sad what they've done to Paul Manafort.\\" The financial fraud trial is the first courtroom test of the ongoing Russia probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller. While allegations of collusion are still being investigated, evidence of bank fraud and tax evasion unearthed during the probe has cast doubt on the integrity of Trump's closest advisers during the campaign. But Manafort's fate was far from clear. The case calls on the dozen jurors to follow the complexities of foreign bank accounts and shell companies, loan regulations and tax rules. It exposed details about the lavish lifestyle of the onetime political insider, including a 15,000 jacket made of ostrich leather and 900,000 spent at a boutique retailer in New York via international wire transfer. The jury ended its first day of deliberations with a series of questions to the judge, including a request to \\"redefine\\" reasonable doubt. The questions came after roughly seven hours of deliberation, delivered in a handwritten note to Ellis. Along with the question on reasonable doubt, the jury asked about the list of exhibits, rules for reporting foreign bank accounts and the definition of \\"shelf companies,\\" a term used during the trial to describe some of the foreign companies used by Manafort. Ellis told the jurors they need to rely on their collective memory of the evidence to answer most questions. As for reasonable doubt, he described it as \\"a doubt based on reason\\" and told jurors it does not require proof \\"beyond all doubt.\\" Manafort's defense countered that he wasn't culpable because he left the particulars of his finances to others. \\"When you follow the trail of Mr. Manafort's money, it is littered with lies,\\" prosecutor Greg Andres said in his final argument earlier this week. In his defense, Manafort's attorneys told jurors to question the entirety of the prosecution's case as they sought to tarnish the credibility of Manafort's longtime protege — and government witness — Rick Gates. Prosecutors say Manafort earned some 60 million consulting for the Russia-backed political party in Ukraine, and hid at least 16 million in income from the IRS between 2010 and 2014. They say Manafort declared only some of his foreign income on his federal income tax returns and repeatedly failed to disclose millions of dollars that streamed into the U.S. to pay for luxury items, services and property. ___ AP writers Darlene Superville and Anne Flaherty contributed to this report.

Context: Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.

Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: what is the last place mentioned? Context: A year before Alfonso III \\"the Great\\" of Asturias death, three of Alfonso's sons rose in rebellion and forced him to abdicate, partitioning the kingdom among them. The eldest son, García, became king of León. The second son, Ordoño, reigned in Galicia, while the third, Fruela, received Asturias with Oviedo as his capital. Alfonso died in Zamora, probably in 910. His former realm would be reunited when first García died childless and León passed to Ordoño. He in turn died when his children were too young to ascend; Fruela became king of a reunited crown. His death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century. It continued under that name[clarification needed] until incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile in 1230, after Ferdinand III became joint king of the two kingdoms. This was done to avoid dynastic feuds and to maintain the Christian Kingdoms strong enough to prevent complete Muslim take over of the Iberian Peninsula and to further the Reconquista of Iberia by Christian armies.

Daher ist es entscheidend, dass die zuständige Autorität offenlegt, wer sie ist und welche Absichten sie verfolgt, um Vertrauen und Legitimität aufzubauen. In einer demokratischen Gesellschaft spielt Transparenz eine große Rolle, da sie zur Rechenschaft der Verantwortlichen beiträgt und sicherstellt, dass die Bürger ein klares Verständnis dafür haben, wer wichtig Entscheidungen trifft.

Ein weiterer Aspekt, der nicht übersehen werden darf, ist die Verantwortlichkeit der Autoritäten.

Loneliness quickly sets in as Joanna, a mildly rebellious aspiring photographer, finds the women in town all look great and are obsessed with housework, but have few intellectual interests. The men all belong to the clubbish Stepford Men's Association, which Walter joins to Joanna's dismay. Neighbor Carol Van Sant's sexually submissive behavior to her husband Ted, and her odd, repetitive behavior after a car accident also strike Joanna as unusual. Joanna and Bobbie investigate Stepford. Things start to look up when she befriends another newcomer to town, sloppy, irrepressible Bobbie Markowe. Along with the glamorously beautiful tennis playing trophy wife Charmaine Wimperis, they organize a Women's Lib consciousness raising session, but the meeting is a failure when the other wives hijack the meeting with cleaning concerns. Joanna is also unimpressed by the boorish Men's Association members, including intimidating president Dale \\"Diz\\" Coba.

How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of stopping yourself from coughing uncontrollably, I would suggest the following steps: Step 1: Identify the cause - Determine the reason for the cough. It could be due to allergies, a cold, flu, or other factors like smoking or air pollution. Identifying the cause helps to tailor the approach to stopping the cough. Step 2: Hydrate - Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to keep your throat moist and reduce irritation. Staying hydrated can help soothe the throat and minimize coughing. Step 3: Use a humidifier - Run a humidifier in the room where you spend most of your time to maintain moisture in the air. Dry air can irritate your throat and trigger a cough. Make sure you clean the humidifier regularly to prevent the growth of bacteria and mold. Step 4: Use cough suppressants and lozenges - Over-the-counter cough suppressants or lozenges can help reduce coughing by numbing the throat or suppressing the cough reflex. Choose a suppressant or lozenge appropriate for your specific cause, and always follow the recommended dosage directions. Step 5: Try home remedies - Gargling with warm salt water can help soothe the throat and decrease coughing. Drinking warm liquids such as tea or lemon water with honey can also provide relief. Step 6: Practice good respiratory hygiene - Practice good respiratory hygiene by sneezing and coughing into your elbow or a tissue, and washing your hands frequently. This prevents the spread of germs and can help minimize further irritation. Step 7: Avoid irritants - Stay away from cigarette smoke, air pollution, and allergens that could further irritate your throat and cause coughing. Step 8: Rest and take care of yourself - Get enough sleep and allow your body to recover, especially if the cough is due to an illness such as a cold or flu. Step 9: Consult a healthcare professional - If your cough is persistent, worsening, or accompanied by additional symptoms such as fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath, consult a healthcare professional for appropriate treatment and advice.

The 4-year-old girl sobbed as rescuers rushed her ashore. In the boat behind her, the faces of her fellow survivors were painted with \\"a thousand-yard stare,\\" one witness said Monday. That girl and three others spent 20 hours stranded in stormy water after their 22-foot boat capsized off the Florida Keys over the weekend. They were picked up Sunday afternoon by Coast Guard rescuers. A few hours earlier, David Jensen was maneuvering the Snap Shot, his fishing charter boat, from Duck Key to the open sea when he and others \\"saw a big object floating in the distance.\\" \\"The closer I got, I could see a guy waving,\\" Jensen said. They found three men clinging to part of what had been their boat. One charter customer quickly jumped in to help, while others threw life jackets to the men, only one of which could muster the energy to swim over, Jensen said. Once aboard, a language barrier -- the rescued men were Spanish-speaking -- and raw emotions made it difficult to ascertain exactly what had happened. One who did speak English was very upset: \\"He lost his mother,\\" Jensen explained. Officer Robert Dube of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said Monday that a son had tried to hold onto his 79-year-old mother in the hours after their ship went down around noon Saturday. But she slipped away into the rough waters, Dube said, before rescuers could reach her. This victim, later identified as Zaida San Jurjo Gonzalez, and the men had clung to the capsized boat's hull. But four others -- three women and the young girl -- couldn't hold on, and drifted off, Jensen said, based on his conversations with the survivors and authorities. The charter boat captain contacted the Coast Guard after learning others were unaccounted for, and he took his boat out five miles in the direction where the four had drifted away. He saw no signs of them. But rescuers did come upon the four Sunday morning, bringing them aboard near Marathon, which is roughly halfway between Key Largo and Key West, according to a Coast Guard statement. Authorities later learned that the three women, wearing life jackets, had held tight to a floating cooler and took turns holding the girl through the afternoon, night and next morning. \\"That definitely saved their lives,\\" Dube told CNN. \\"It could have been a lot worse situation.\\" Wayne Crosby of Captain Hook's Marina and Dive Center said he watched rescuers bring the four to a dock in Marathon on Sunday. They handed the girl off the boat first, he told CNN affiliate WSVN. \\"They had her all wrapped up. ... She couldn't stop crying. She was panic-stricken,\\" Crosby said. At the dock, rescuers scrambled to tend to all the victims. \\"They just had that look on their face, like a thousand-yard stare,\\" Crosby told WSVN. The group had suffered multiple jellyfish stings over the course of their ordeal, Dube said. And by Monday, the 4-year-old had been treated for mild hypothermia and exhaustion. But the wildlife officer added that, by then, she appeared to be \\"in very good spirits.\\" Ernie Perroncello, owner and operator of Sea Tow in Marathon, said weather in the area Saturday when the boat went down was terrible. \\"You can get yourself in trouble real quick \\" on the area's water, said Perroncello, whose company salvaged the capsized boat.

Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave. So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them. If you look closely in a few shots, you’ll see a stone pier, which is just between the Pile Gate (pronounced “peel-ay”) at the city walls and the fort.

Context: Insect respiration is accomplished without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity.:61–65 Air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles.

Article: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for \\"Of the celibate priesthood\\"), promulgated on 24 June 1967, defends the Catholic Church's tradition of priestly celibacy in the West. This encyclical was written in the wake of Vatican II, when the Catholic Church was questioning and revising many long-held practices. Priestly celibacy is considered a discipline rather than dogma, and some had expected that it might be relaxed. In response to these questions, the Pope reaffirms the discipline as a long-held practice with special importance in the Catholic Church. The encyclical Sacerdotalis caelibatus from 24 June 1967, confirms the traditional Church teaching, that celibacy is an ideal state and continues to be mandatory for Roman Catholic priests. Celibacy symbolizes the reality of the kingdom of God amid modern society. The priestly celibacy is closely linked to the sacramental priesthood. However, during his pontificate Paul VI was considered generous in permitting bishops to grant laicization of priests who wanted to leave the sacerdotal state, a position which was drastically reversed by John Paul II in 1980 and cemented in the 1983 Canon Law that only the pope can in exceptional circumstances grant laicization.

In 1936, Jerry Daniels was replaced by a 21-year-old singer from Baltimore, Bill Kenny, who signed on with the Ink Spots after winning first place in an amateur contest at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom. Three years later, Kenny was credited for bringing the group to global success with his unusual high tenor ballad singing. In 1938, after being in the group for two years, Bill Kenny started to introduce the group to a new format that he called \\"Top & Bottom\\". This format was used primarily for ballads rather than the uptempo \\"jive\\" songs the group was used to performing. This format called for the tenor (Bill Kenny or Deek Watson) to sing the lead for one chorus followed by a chorus performed by bass singer Hoppy Jones reciting the lyrics rather than singing them. After a chorus of the \\"talking bass\\" the lead tenor sang the rest of the song until the end. The earliest example of their \\"Top & Bottom\\" format is from a radio broadcast from 1938. The song entitled \\"Tune In on My Heart\\" features Bill Kenny taking the lead and Hoppy Jones performing the talking bass. The year 1938 also saw Bill Kenny taking his first feature solo in Decca studios. His feature was on a song entitled \\"I Wish You the Best of Everything\\". Although it wasn't in the \\"Top & Bottom\\" format it was a ballad and used the signature Ink Spots guitar intro.

The intense scrutiny and the geopolitical implications demand an appropriate response from world leaders. At the forefront of this crisis is former United States President, Barack Obama, whose response and involvement has consisted of a strategic, multi-pronged approach. Speaking Out in Regard to Flight MH370 On March 8, 2014, Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370, carrying 239 passengers, vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The incident led to one of the most extensive searches in aviation history which, unfortunately, has yet to yield any definitive answers as to the fate of the ill-fated plane. President Obama, then in office, was quick to react to the situation by offering the full capabilities of the United States government to assist in the search and investigation. The American leader mentioned that US authorities were working closely with the Malaysian government to determine what had happened and he expressed his deepest condolences to the families of the victims. In the daunting task of searching for the missing plane, President Obama placed emphasis on coordination and cooperation among the nations involved in the search efforts. An emphasis that set the tone for the US participation in search missions spanning the globe - from the Indian Ocean to the southern reaches of the Pacific. Flight MH17: A Call for Accountability The tragedy surrounding Malaysian Airlines took another devastating turn on July 17, 2014, when flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down over eastern Ukraine, resulting in the loss of 298 lives. This event took place near the Russia-Ukraine border at the height of the conflict between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces in the region. It is widely believed that the plane was brought down by a surface-to-air missile fired by pro-Russian forces. As the world watched in horror, President Obama declared the incident a \\"global tragedy\\" and emphasized the need for a speedy, impartial, and transparent investigation. He called for an immediate ceasefire in eastern Ukraine to allow investigators to gain unhindered access to the crash site, expressing concern over the tampering of evidence by the separatists. By upholding a strong, clear stance, the President expected the international community to uphold the same clarity in their efforts to address the tragedy. Through his leadership and diplomacy, President Obama succeeded in rallying the international community to take action. A United Nations resolution was passed that established an independent, international investigation team to determine the facts behind the downing of MH17. Geopolitical Implications and Pursuit of Deterrence The shoot-down of flight MH17 did not occur in isolation. It was intertwined with the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine, with the United States advocating for a stronger, more unified approach in addressing Russian aggression. President Obama, during his tenure in office, made relentless efforts to deter such aggression, including imposing economic sanctions and rallying European allies to unite against Russian interference in Ukraine. His administration worked tirelessly to increase pressure upon the Russian government, using the MH17 tragedy as a rallying point for the international community to push for a just resolution in Ukraine. Conclusion Under the Obama administration, the United States took a proactive and strategic approach to the Malaysian Airliner crisis. By offering resources, support, and diplomatic guidance in both tragic events, President Obama showcased the importance of international cooperation and unity in addressing complex, geopolitical challenges. From immediate aid in search operations for flight MH370 to his resolute stance on investigating and holding the responsible parties accountable in the case of flight MH17, the former President of the United States, Barack Obama, played an instrumental role in leading the world through one of the most devastating and challenging crises in recent memory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

The proof is in the pudding, or rather on my Instagram account, which you can check out at @rehlakhani. Thanks in advance for the follows! It was a calm, summery night, and some friends and I were hungry after a long night of various activities. After consulting with different groups of pedestrians, we were recommended a restaurant named \\"McDonald's\\", which I had never heard of, but seemed to be some sort of Irish fast food restaurant. I ended up ordering the chicken nugget combo, which came with 6 chicken nuggets, fries, and a drink. I also added two McDoubles and two junior McChicken sandwiches for good measure. Needless to say, I was quite hungry. The food took a while due to the high number of customers, but I took it as a good sign of the quality of the food of the restaurant, as they kept the customers coming in even into the wee hours of the morning. Who knew Irish food was so popular?! The food was exquisite. The chicken nuggets were light, warm, and crispy, and ever so delicately fried a golden brown batter. Simply marvelous. The McDouble was an excellent take on the traditional American hamburger, with a juicy beef patty topped with the finest cheddar cheese, fresh diced onions, sweet pickles, and the usual ketchup and mustard. The junior McChicken sandwiches were also delightful, providing a more conservative sandwich alternative with their warm, crispy chicken and light, airy mayo. I imagine this sandwich is more in line with the Irish roots of the restaurant. My only qualm about the sandwiches was that I would've preferred a nice brioche instead of the buns they prepared for us. And that brings us to the french fries. Oh, the fries! Golden brown sticks of joy sent down from the heavens for only 1.39! (Or maybe less since they came in the combo, honestly I'm not 100% sure of the exact price) The fries were absolutely delectable, especially when dipped into one of the many sauce packets offered by this thoughtful establishment. My personal preference was a sweet mesquite flavor, which they called \\"BBQ\\". Overall, the meal definitely exceeded all expectations. Oh yeah, and I got a coke to drink.

Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What did Burke point out in his letter from April 1791? Context: In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".

Davey Gillen, a new IRA prisoner, arrives; he is categorised as a \\"non-conforming prisoner\\" for his refusal to wear the prison uniform. He is sent to his cell naked with only a blanket.

Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina. Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again. Lohan is then seen smoking a cigarette, as in the opening scenes, his hand bloodied. Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing.

The crew consists of Captain Dan Holland, First Officer Lieutenant Charlie Pizer, journalist Harry Booth, ESP-sensitive scientist Dr. Kate McCrae, the expedition's civilian leader Dr. Alex Durant and the robot V.I.N.CENT (\\"Vital Information Necessary CENTralized\\"). The Palomino crew discover a black hole in space with a spaceship nearby, somehow defying the hole's massive gravitational pull. The ship is identified as the long-lost USS Cygnus, the ship McCrae's father served aboard when it went missing. Deciding to investigate, the Palomino encounters a mysterious null gravity field surrounding the Cygnus. The Palomino becomes damaged when it drifts away from the Cygnus and into the black hole's intense gravity field, but the ship manages to move back to the Cygnus and finds itself able to dock to what initially appears to be an abandoned vessel. The Palomino crew cautiously boards the Cygnus and soon encounters the ship's commander, Dr. Hans Reinhardt, a brilliant scientist. Aided by a crew of faceless, black-robed android drones and his sinister-looking robot Maximilian, Reinhardt explains that he has lived all alone on the Cygnus for years. After the ship encountered a meteor field and was disabled, he ordered the human crew to return to Earth, but Kate's father chose to remain aboard and has since died. Reinhardt then reveals that he has spent the past 20 years studying the black hole and intends to fly the Cygnus through it. Only Durant believes it is possible and asks to accompany Reinhardt on the trip. The rest of the Palomino crew grow suspicious of the faceless drones' human-like behavior: Booth sees a robot limping and Holland witnesses a robot funeral and discovers the Cygnus crew's personal items in the ship's living quarters.

The sumo wrestler's size and powerful build are evident, but the other man, although not as physically imposing, appears confident and self-assured. It becomes apparent that their encounter is not coincidental, but rather a pre-arranged meeting to engage in a friendly bout of traditional Japanese sumo wrestling. As the sumo wrestler nears his opponent, they both bow out of respect, following the customs ingrained in the centuries-old sport. Stepping into the makeshift dohyo, or sumo ring, they form a circle in the soft earth, stretching and warming up in preparation for their match. A small crowd gathers, composed of friends and passersby who have caught wind of the competition. Their eager eyes and supportive cheers heighten the excitement that now fills the air. Though the other man is not a professional sumo wrestler, he adopts the shikiri, or crouch position, mirroring the sumo wrestler's stance. Their eyes locked on each other's, they wait patiently for the right moment to strike. A brief yet tense silence ensues, broken only by the distant rustling of the wind through the trees. Suddenly, the sumo wrestler lunges forward with a powerful burst of speed, attempting to push his opponent out of the ring. The other man, seizing the opportunity, pivots to one side, using the sumo wrestler's momentum against him. Surprised by his opponent's nimbleness, the sumo wrestler quickly adjusts and reengages, this time more cautious of his adversary's abilities. They continue to grapple and push against each other, their bodies slick with sweat that glistens in the sun. Both men give their all, showcasing incredible strength, agility, and determination. The intensity of the bout draws the onlookers even closer, excited gasps and exclamations punctuating the sounds of their heavy breaths and mighty shoves. At last, the sumo wrestler manages to grip the other man's mawashi, the cloth belt traditional sumo wrestlers wear. He deftly lifts his opponent off the ground and carries him out of the ring, securing his victory. Both competitors collapse to the ground, exhausted but with evident satisfaction in their eyes. Once they've caught their breath, the sumo wrestler and his opponent rise to their feet. They exchange bows and warm smiles, acknowledging the other's talent and perseverance. The small crowd applauds their sportsmanship, just as impressed by their display of honor and camaraderie as by their wrestling prowess. As the excitement dies down, the two men continue to chat, their newfound friendship forged in the heat of friendly competition. They share stories of their lives and discuss their mutual passion for sumo wrestling, eager to learn from one another.

Plot title: More American Graffiti Movie plot: The film, set over the course of four consecutive New Year's Eves from 1964 to 1967, depicts scenes from each of these years, intertwined with one another as though events happen simultaneously. The audience is protected from confusion by the use of a distinct cinematic style for each section. For example, the 1966 sequences echo the movie of Woodstock using split screens and multiple angles of the same event simultaneously on screen, the 1965 sequences (set in Vietnam) shot hand-held on grainy super 16 mm film designed to resemble war reporters' footage. The film attempts to memorialize the 1960s with sequences that recreate the sense and style of those days with references to Haight-Ashbury, the campus peace movement, the beginnings of the modern woman's liberation movement and the accompanying social revolt. One character burned his draft card, showing a younger audience what so many Americans had done on the television news ten years before the movie's release. Other characters are shown frantically disposing of their marijuana before a traffic stop as a police officer pulls them over, and another scene shows the police brutality with billy clubs during an anti-Vietnam protest. The listed fates of the main characters at the ending sequence of American Graffiti were updated again at the end of this sequel.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"Fossil fuels are burned in many what?\\" with the following options: - roads - Fuel cells - solids - fossilized animals - power - engines - energy - Electrical The answer is:","completion":"Fossil fuels are burned in many engines. This can be further explained by examining the given facts and options in detail. Fact 1 states that using a gasoline engine requires burning gasoline. This indicates that gasoline, a fossil fuel, is used as a source of fuel for combustion in engines. The energy released from burning gasoline fuels the motion and function of various vehicles and machinery that utilize gasoline engines. Fact 2 tells us that oil and gasoline are fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are hydrocarbons obtained from the remains of ancient plants and animals, buried deep within the earth and subjected to heat and pressure over millions of years. Fossil fuels, like oil and gasoline, are non-renewable resources that play a significant role in providing energy to various industries and sectors. Having established the connection between fossil fuels and engines, let's examine the other options to see why they are not the correct answer: - Roads: Roads may be constructed from various materials, but they are not where fossil fuels are burned. - Fuel cells: These generate electrical energy through chemical reactions, most often using hydrogen and oxygen. They are not directly associated with the burning of fossil fuels. - Solids: This option is too general and does not specifically address where fossil fuels are burned. - Fossilized animals: These are the preserved remains of ancient animals, not something where fossil fuels are burned. - Power: This term alludes to the output or work produced (typically in the form of energy), but it is not the location where fossil fuels are burned. - Energy: Fossil fuels are indeed a significant source of energy, but this option alone does not address where they are burned. - Electrical: This refers to electricity, which can be generated using various methods, including the combustion of fossil fuels. However, this term alone doesn't directly address the location of their burning. In summary, given the facts and options provided, the answer to the question \\"Fossil fuels are burned in many what?\\" is engines. It is in engines where fossil fuels like oil and gasoline are combusted to generate power and propel different types of vehicles and machinery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Mario Cuomo dies \\"from natural causes due to heart failure,\\" his family says. He shot to national fame at the 1984 Democratic National Convention.

Cuomo's family shared the news today that he died \\"from natural causes due to heart failure.\\" Often referred to as \\"the last liberal giant of New York politics,\\" Cuomo left a lasting legacy on the political landscape of the Empire State, and will be forever remembered for his iconic 1984 Democratic National Convention speech that propelled him to national fame. Let us take a closer look at the life and achievements of this influential figure. Early Life and Political Career Mario Cuomo was born in Queens, New York, to Italian immigrant parents in 1932. After pursuing a career in law and honing his skills as a public speaker, he ventured into politics in the early 1970s. He served as Secretary of State of New York from 1975 to 1978, and as Lieutenant Governor from 1979 to 1982. Cuomo's progressive vision and eloquent speeches caught the attention of Democratic party leaders, who saw in him a promising political prospect. 1984 Democratic National Convention Mario Cuomo's defining moment came at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. As the convention's keynote speaker, he delivered a powerful speech that criticized the then-President Ronald Reagan's policies, celebrated the achievements of the Democratic party, and shared his vision for a compassionate and just America. This speech not only elevated his profile on the national stage but also solidified his reputation as a champion of liberal values and policies. Tenure as Governor of New York Cuomo served as Governor of New York from 1983 to 1994, winning three consecutive terms. During his time in office, he focused on issues such as education, housing, and healthcare. His administration also marked significant investments in infrastructure and efforts to protect the environment. Despite facing challenges and criticism from political rivals, Cuomo remained steadfast in his commitment to progressive ideals and policies. Legacy and Impact Mario Cuomo's influence on the Democratic party and the political landscape of New York cannot be understated. As a son of immigrants, he embodied the American Dream, and his message of compassion, justice, and unity continues to resonate with many Americans today. His progressive values, powerful oratory, and unwavering commitment to social justice have left an indelible mark on the history of New York and the nation as a whole. Conclusion In remembering Mario Cuomo, we celebrate the life and achievements of a remarkable politician and the last true liberal giant of New York politics. His powerful speeches, progressive values, and uncompromising commitment to social justice will continue to inspire future generations of leaders. Our thoughts and condolences are with Cuomo's family, friends, and the many who admired him during this difficult time."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

To assess the truth of the hypothesis \\"I have been run over,\\" we need more information and context to form a valid understanding of the situation. A hypothesis, in essence, is an educated guess or a proposed explanation for a phenomenon, based on limited evidence and subject to further investigation. Consequently, determining the truth of a hypothesis is dependent on the evidence presented and the circumstances encompassing the issue in question. In this situation, the premise \\"and run over\\" could refer to an individual, object, or event being run over. However, it does not explicitly state who or what has been run over. The hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" assumes that the premise is referring to the speaker, but without additional context, we cannot definitively establish a connection between the premise and the hypothesis. For instance, consider the following scenarios: 1. If the original statement was, \\"The car lost control, crashed into a pole, and run over a pedestrian,\\" the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" would not be true unless the speaker is the pedestrian mentioned in the statement. In this case, we still need more details about the specific incident and the parties involved. 2. On the other hand, if the statement was, \\"I didn't see the car coming, and run over by it,\\" the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" would align better with the premise. Nevertheless, additional context would still be needed for an accurate assessment. Given the information available, it is impossible to definitively conclude whether the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" is true based on the premise \\"and run over.\\" To evaluate and determine the validity of the hypothesis, it is essential to gather more related details, evidence, or context, which would offer a more comprehensive understanding of the circumstances."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],D={key:0},R={key:1};function F(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
