Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. Now, I have a new situation: Steve and Chris sit down at a new cafe that just opened up in town after hearing rave reviews of it at work. They look at the menus trying to decide what to order when a waiter shows up and asks if they would like anything to drink. Steve says he would like a glass of water that has molecules far apart. Chris orders water with molecules closer together. The waiter looks at them with a rather confused look and asks them to please elaborate. Answer this question please: Whose cup of water is more dense? A:","completion":"Chris's cup of water is more dense. Here's the reasoning behind this: Density of water is related to the distance between the molecules. The closer the molecules are, the more dense the water is. According to the information provided, when water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. This increase in density continues until the water temperature is around 4°C, at which the water reaches its highest density. So, when Chris orders water with molecules closer together, he is implicitly ordering colder water, which is denser. In contrast, Steve’s water, with molecules far apart, would be warmer and less dense."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. I am facing a new situation today: There are two neighboring planets in another solar system. The people of Mandron use many fossil fuels to power things that require electricity. The people of Liptar have found a way to use water as a source of power and they barely use any fossil fuels at all. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: The habitats of which planet's animals are in more danger? A:","completion":"Based on the information from the background article about the impact of fossil fuel usage on global warming and its consequences on habitats and species, the habitats of the animals on the planet Mandron are in more danger. This is due to the fact that the people of Mandron heavily rely on fossil fuels for their energy needs. Burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change. As a result, habitats undergo significant and potentially destructive changes, putting the animals living in those habitats at a higher risk of extinction. On the other hand, the people of Liptar have found a way to use water as a source of power, significantly reducing their dependence on fossil fuels and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, their approach to energy production is more sustainable and poses less threat to the habitats of animals on their planet. Consequently, the habitats of Liptar's animals are comparatively safer than those on Mandron."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the given review, it is unlikely that the user would recommend this product to others. Although their dog Merlin seemed to enjoy the product at first, the user expressed concerns about the hard and sharp texture, which caused Merlin to cough and hack after consumption. This indicates that the product might not be safe or suitable for the dog's health. The user also mentioned trying to soften the product by soaking it in water overnight, but this attempt was unsuccessful. The fact that they ultimately decided to discard the remaining product due to their fear for their dog's health further supports the idea that they would not recommend it to others. In summary, despite their dog’s initial enthusiasm for the product, the user's experience with the hard and sharp texture, as well as their unsuccessful attempt to improve it, suggest that they would not endorse this product to other dog owners.

About 2,600 villages have been submerged across 19 districts. The army and navy have been called in to help as many villagers are still stranded and dependent on food drops from helicopters. Heavy monsoon rains have been battering South Asia for days but southern Pakistan has borne the brunt of the bad weather in recent weeks. Almost one million houses there have been destroyed or damaged and floods have affected nearly 4.2m acres of land, the UN says. The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Karachi says that the rain is heaping misery on the hundreds of thousands living out in the open. Many people remain stranded on high ground and rooftops surrounded by flood waters, our correspondent says. The United Nations Children's Fund, Unicef, said up to 2.5 million children had been affected. One official said children and families, many of them still recovering from last year's devastating floods, are in urgent need of help before the situation worsens. More rain has been forecast for the coming days. \\"The situation in Sindh is already serious and there will be more flooding and more problems because of these rains,\\" Arif Mehmood, a meteorology official, is quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency.

Given the question: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light.

This was compared to their significant others ironing, drilling or sawing. Seven out of 10 women likened receiving a home-made coffee to receiving a gift. Article:","completion":"Title: The Secret to a Happier Relationship: Making Coffee for Your Partner Introduction It's no secret that maintaining a healthy and happy relationship requires constant nurturing and effort from both parties involved. But could something as simple as making a cup of coffee for your significant other be the key to a more harmonious connection? According to a recent study conducted on 20 real-life Australian couples, it turns out that coffee might just be the magic ingredient that keeps partners feeling loved and appreciated. The Study The intriguing research was carried out by a team of London neuroscientists who carefully monitored the reactions of female partners when their male significant others performed various household tasks. The selected tasks included ironing, drilling, sawing, and, of course, making a cup of coffee. By observing the responses of the women in these scenarios, the researchers were able to deduce which tasks triggered the most positive reactions. The Findings What the researchers found was truly fascinating. Among the four tasks carried out by the men, making a cup of coffee seemed to elicit the most appreciative reactions from their female partners. Ironing, drilling, and sawing, on the other hand, did not seem to have the same effect on the emotions of the women. Seven out of 10 women in the study reported that receiving a home-made cup of coffee from their partners felt akin to receiving a gift. This finding suggests that the simple act of brewing coffee for your partner can have a profound impact on their overall happiness and sense of appreciation in a relationship. The Possible Explanations But what is it about coffee that makes it the magic potion for a happier partnership? One possible explanation could be attributed to the soothing and pleasurable aroma of freshly brewed coffee. The smell of coffee has long been known to have a calming effect on the human brain and has even been found to reduce stress. Furthermore, the act of making coffee for your partner could serve as a tangible representation of your love and care for their well-being. In this busy world, taking the time to prepare a warm, comforting beverage for someone can provide a sense of comfort and security that strengthens the emotional bond between partners. Lastly, coffee has always been synonymous with socialization and connection. Offering a freshly brewed cup of coffee to your partner can create an opportunity for conversation and bonding, reinforcing the emotional foundation of your relationship. Conclusion The study conducted on Australian couples is a reminder of the power that lies in simple, everyday gestures. Making a cup of coffee for your significant other may seem insignificant, but it could serve as a meaningful act of love and appreciation that strengthens the fabric of your relationship. So, the next time you want to make your partner smile and feel loved, grab a coffee mug and your favorite coffee beans. After all, the key to a happier relationship might just be hidden in that warm, fragrant cup of Joe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During the new year, the Nixon administration took what it called a \\"strategic counter-measure\\" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him. Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and he was denied permanent residency in the US; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory. A double LP, it contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card. The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found its political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless. The NME's review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided Lennon as a \\"pathetic, ageing revolutionary\\". In the US, \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\" was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May, on The Dick Cavett Show.

Question: what the multiple endings of john say about its possible authorship; Suggestion: Synoptic elements such as parables and exorcisms are not found in John.","completion":"False. The given suggestion does not directly address the question regarding the multiple endings of the Gospel of John and its possible authorship. Instead, the suggestion refers to synoptic elements such as parables and exorcisms, which are not related to the endings of John or its authorship. Therefore, the proposed suggestion cannot be considered a correct answer to the question. In order to provide a more suitable answer to the question, it is essential to delve into the context and content of the Gospel of John, specifically its multiple endings and the implications these endings have on the possible authorship of the book. The Gospel of John is distinct from the three synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) in that it presents theological and narrative material that is unique to the account. Some scholars argue that the gospel has what appear to be multiple endings, particularly when looking at chapters 20 and 21. The conclusion of chapter 20 suggests a fitting end to the book, yet chapter 21 continues with another ending. Chapter 20 concludes with Jesus’ appearances to Mary Magdalene and his disciples, followed by Thomas' confession of faith. The last two verses of chapter 20 (John 20:30-31) seem to be a fitting closing statement, which reads, \\"Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.\\" However, John 21 follows with an additional post-resurrection appearance and the reinstatement of Peter, concluding with another statement that seems to hint at the purpose and authorship of the gospel (John 21:24-25): \\"This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true. Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.\\" These multiple endings have led scholars to propose various theories about the authorship of the Gospel of John. Some argue that the book could have gone through multiple stages of composition or redaction, with additional material being added by different authors or editors over time. Others suggest that the author of the Gospel of John purposefully included multiple endings to emphasize different aspects of Jesus' life and ministry. Considering the previously mentioned elements, a more accurate answer to the question regarding the multiple endings of the Gospel of John and its implications on the possible authorship would involve discussing the various theories proposed by scholars, and analyzing the content and context of the gospel's endings."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: poor quality Product review: The pan is heavy, but that is not the reason why I consider it bad. After my first use of the pan, it got rusty. So I have to return it. A:","completion":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product, and there are several reasons for this conclusion. The main factors that contribute to this assessment are the indications of poor quality in both the title and the content of the review, as well as the specific issue of rust after just one use. First, the review title - \\"poor quality\\" - immediately sets a negative tone and suggests that the product may not be up to satisfactory standards. As a potential buyer, it is important to look for well-crafted and reliable products, and a \\"poor quality\\" label would naturally detract from the overall appeal. Secondly, the review addresses the heaviness of the pan. Although the reviewer acknowledges that the pan's weight is not necessarily a negative feature, it is still mentioned in the context of their overall dissatisfaction. As a potential buyer, I would be looking for a balance of quality and ease of use, and the mention of the pan's weight might lead me to consider other options with a lighter design. The most significant factor influencing my decision, however, would be the mention of rust after just one use. Rust development is indicative of poor construction and low-quality materials used in the manufacturing process. Having a rust-prone cooking utensil is both a health concern and a sign that the item would likely not have a long lifespan. For someone in search of a reliable, long-lasting product, this would be a major red flag. Additionally, the reviewer's decision to return the pan serves as further evidence of their dissatisfaction with the product. Consumers generally only return items that have failed to meet their expectations or have proven to be seriously defective. Consequently, the mention of returning the pan would further decrease my interest in purchasing the product. In conclusion, the details provided in the review would significantly decrease the chances of me buying the product in question. The negative aspects highlighted – poor quality, heaviness, and rust development after just one use – are all factors that raise concerns about the product's durability, reliability, and overall performance. As a potential buyer, these insights would make me more inclined to seek alternative options that have better reviews and fewer reported issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which language is this?","completion":"The sentence \\"Hän piirsi hiekkaan rajan.\\" is in Finnish, which is a Uralic language primarily spoken in Finland and by Finnish people. Finland's neighboring countries, such as Sweden, Estonia, and Norway, are also home to Finnish-speaking populations, as well as in various other countries with Finnish expatriates. Finnish is a member of the Finno-Ugric subfamily of the Uralic languages, which also includes Estonian, Hungarian, and several minority languages spoken in Russia, like Karelian. It's an agglutinative language, meaning that it uses a system of adding various morphemes to words in order to express grammatical relationships between words. This feature causes Finnish words to often be longer and more complex compared to languages like English. Returning to the initial sentence \\"Hän piirsi hiekkaan rajan,\\" it roughly translates to \\"He/She drew a line in the sand\\" in English. Here is a breakdown of the sentence: 1. Hän: A pronoun which means \\"he\\" or \\"she.\\" Finnish lacks grammatical gender, and the same pronoun is used for both male and female subjects. 2. piirsi: A verb in the past tense, derived from the infinitive form \\"piirtää,\\" which means \\"to draw\\" or \\"to trace.\\" 3. hiekkaan: The illative singular form of \\"hiekka\\" (sand), indicating movement into or towards something. \\"Hiekkaan\\" can be translated as \\"into the sand\\" or \\"in the sand.\\" 4. rajan: The accusative form of \\"raja\\" (line, border), functioning as a direct object in this sentence. In this context, it refers to a line drawn in the sand. This brief analysis serves to further illustrate the unique characteristics of the Finnish language. With its distinct grammatical and morphological features, Finnish remains an intriguing and vibrant language spoken by millions of people worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We then flash forward twenty years, where Randy \\"The Ram\\" is getting ready for a match in a small, local auditorium on the underground circuit. He interacts with the other wrestlers backstage, most of whom are much younger than he is (Randy is acknowledged to be in his 50's). Ironically, though they are foes inside the ring, outside the wrestlers are all friendly, discussing with each other how they want to perform the \\"act\\" that night, and after the show go drinking together. Randy preps for the match and it's obvious his age has caught up with him; his joints are cracking as he stretches and becomes short-winded easily. After he stretches he puts a small piece of a razor blade in his wrist bandages, in which later he uses to cut himself on the forehead to draw blood, making the match more dramatic for the fans. Afterward, Randy is given a meager payday, as the promoter claims the audience was smaller than expected. Randy's manager then poses a 20th anniversary rematch with his most notable opponent, the Ayatollah, which sold out Madison Square garden in the 80's. Randy agrees, hoping this kind of high-profile match could help him get back to the top.Randy goes home to find he has been locked out of his trailer for not paying his rent. He takes pain medication with a beer and falls asleep in the back of his van. The next day he goes to work to load boxes at a supermarket where he asks his boss if he could have more hours.

And the answer is?","completion":"Titania and Oberon are moons of the planet Uranus. Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is an ice giant that is most notably known for its unusual axis tilt, with its rotational axis inclined about 98 degrees relative to its orbital plane. This unique tilt causes the planet to experience extreme seasonal variations, with each pole experiencing approximately 42 years of continuous sunlight or darkness as Uranus orbits the Sun. Titania and Oberon are the largest and most well-known of the 27 known moons orbiting Uranus. These two moons were discovered by the British astronomer Sir William Herschel on January 11, 1787. Herschel, who also discovered the planet itself in 1781, named these moons in honor of characters from William Shakespeare's play \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\\" Titania represents the queen of the fairies, while Oberon stands for the king of the fairies who are central characters in the play. Titania, the larger of the two moons, has a diameter of approximately 1,578 kilometers (981 miles) and is the eighth largest moon in our solar system. Its surface is composed mainly of water ice, with a mix of rock and an abundance of impact craters, as well as some immense fault lines or fractures that are believed to have formed due to the expansion of its outer ice shell as the underlying warmer layer of ice deformed over time. Oberon, in contrast, is slightly smaller than Titania, with a diameter of about 1,523 kilometers (946 miles). Much like Titania, its surface is mainly composed of water ice, mixed with some rock, and is also marked by a considerable number of impact craters. Oberon exhibits signs of some past geological activity, as it has fewer craters than Titania, suggesting that parts of its surface have been resurfaced at some point in time. Since their discovery, Titania and Oberon have been the subject of several observational studies and exploration missions to better understand their composition, geological history, and relationship to Uranus as well as the broader solar system. The most famous of these missions was the Voyager 2 spacecraft flyby in 1986, which provided close-up images and valuable data on these intriguing moons and their parent planet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999. Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission. \\"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business,\\" said Lawrence R.

Question: Who does Mamuwalde pursue? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Blacula Context: In 1780, Prince Mamuwalde (William Marshall), the ruler of the Abani African nation, seeks the help of Count Dracula (Charles Macaulay) in suppressing the slave trade. Dracula refuses to help, and transforms Mamuwalde into a vampire, whom he names Blacula and imprisons in a sealed coffin. Mamuwalde's wife, Luva (Vonetta McGee), is also imprisoned and dies in captivity. In 1972, the coffin has been purchased as part of an estate by two interior decorators, Bobby McCoy (Ted Harris) and Billy Schaffer (Rick Metzler) and shipped to Los Angeles. Bobby and Billy open the coffin and become Prince Mamuwalde's first victims. At the funeral home where Bobby McCoy's body is laid, Mamuwalde spies on mourning friends Tina Williams (Vonetta McGee), her sister Michelle (Denise Nicholas), and Michelle's boyfriend, Dr. Gordon Thomas (Thalmus Rasulala), a pathologist for the Los Angeles Police Department. Mamuwalde believes Tina is the reincarnation of his deceased wife, Luva. On close investigation of the corpse at the funeral home, Dr. Thomas notices oddities with Bobby McCoy's death that he later concludes to be consistent with vampire folklore. Prince Mamuwalde continues to kill and transform various people he encounters, as Tina begins to fall in love with him. Thomas, his colleague Lt. Peters (Gordon Pinsent), and Michelle follow the trail of murder victims and begin to believe a vampire is responsible. After Thomas digs up Billy's coffin, Billy's corpse rises as a vampire and attacks Thomas, who fends him off and drives a stake through his heart. After finding a photo taken of Mamuwalde and Tina in which Mamuwalde's body is not visible, Thomas and Peters track Mamuwalde to his hideout, the warehouse where Bobby McCoy and Billy Schaffer were first slain. They defeat several vampires, but Mamuwalde manages to escape. Later, Mamuwalde lures Tina to his new hideout at the nearby waterworks plant, while Thomas and a group of police officers pursue him. Mamuwalde dispatches several officers, but one of them manages to shoot... Answer:","completion":"In the movie Blacula, Prince Mamuwalde pursues Tina Williams, who he believes to be the reincarnation of his deceased wife, Luva. The story begins in 1780 when Mamuwalde, the ruler of the Abani African nation, seeks Count Dracula's help in suppressing the slave trade. Dracula refuses to help and instead transforms Mamuwalde into a vampire, renames him Blacula, and imprisons him in a sealed coffin. Mamuwalde's wife, Luva, is also imprisoned and later dies in captivity. Fast forward to 1972, when two interior decorators, Bobby McCoy and Billy Schaffer, purchase the coffin as part of an estate and ship it to Los Angeles. They inadvertently release Mamuwalde from his coffin, and he kills both Bobby and Billy. During a scene at Bobby McCoy's funeral, Mamuwalde spots Tina Williams, who bears a striking resemblance to his late wife. Convinced that Tina is the reincarnation of Luva, Mamuwalde begins to pursue her. As Mamuwalde continues to kill and transform people he encounters, Tina begins to fall in love with him. Dr. Gordon Thomas, a pathologist with the Los Angeles Police Department and Michelle's boyfriend, along with his colleague Lt. Peters, start investigating the murders and develop a theory that a vampire is responsible. They follow the trail of murder victims and eventually confront Mamuwalde.

The condition usually occurs in people who have experienced a head injury or a stroke a sudden loss of consciousness, sensation, or movement caused by a blocked or broken blood vessel in the brain. The condition was first identified during the Second World War in a Norwegian woman whose head was injured during an attack by the German military. The woman recovered but was left with a German-sounding accent, to the horror of fellow villagers who avoided her after that. Researchers have discovered that the combined effect of the damage to several parts of the brain makes victims lengthen certain syllables, mispronounce sounds, and change,the normal pitch of their voice. Those changes in speech add up to what sounds like a foreign accent. Another researcher, a phonetician ,says victims of the syndrome don't acquire a true foreign accent. Their strangely changed speech only resembles the foreign: accent with which it has a few sounds in common. When an English woman named Annie recently developed foreign accent syndrome after a stroke, she spoke with what seemed to be a Scottish accent.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Solubility may increase or decrease with temperature; the magnitude of this temperature dependence varies widely among compounds. Notice in particular the curves for NH4NO3 and CaCl2. The dissolution of ammonium nitrate in water is endothermic (ΔHsoln = +25.7 kJ/mol), whereas the dissolution of calcium chloride is exothermic (ΔHsoln = −68.2 kJ/mol), yet Figure 13.9 \\"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\\" shows that the solubility of both compounds increases sharply with increasing temperature. In fact, the magnitudes of the changes in both enthalpy and entropy for dissolution are temperature dependent. Because the solubility of a compound is ultimately determined by relatively small differences between large numbers, there is generally no good way to predict how the solubility will vary with temperature. The variation of solubility with temperature has been measured for a wide range of compounds, and the results are published in many standard reference books. Chemists are often able to use this information to separate the components of a mixture byfractional crystallization, the separation of compounds on the basis of their solubilities in a given solvent. For example, if we have a mixture of 150 g of sodium acetate (CH3CO2Na) and 50 g of KBr, we can separate the two compounds by dissolving the mixture in 100 g of water at 80°C and then cooling the solution slowly to 0°C. According to the temperature curves in Figure 13.9 \\"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\\", both compounds dissolve in water at 80°C, and all 50 g of KBr remains in solution at 0°C. Only about 36 g of CH3CO2Na are soluble in 100 g of water at 0°C, however, so approximately 114 g (150 g − 36 g) of Saylor URL: http://www. saylor. org/books.

Write a title for this article: In Brussels and other European capitals, the fear of Vladimir Putin is becoming palpable. The mood has changed in a matter of weeks from one of handwringing impotence over Ukraine to one of foreboding. The anxiety is encapsulated in the sudden rush to Moscow by Angela Merkel and François Hollande. To senior figures closely involved in the diplomacy and policymaking over Ukraine, the Franco-German peace bid is less a hopeful sign of a breakthrough than an act of despair. “There’s nothing new in their plan, just an attempt to stop a massacre,” said one senior official. Carl Bildt, the former Swedish foreign minister, said a war between Russia and the west was now quite conceivable. A senior diplomat in Brussels, echoing the broad EU view, said arming the Ukrainians would mean war with Russia, a war that Putin would win. Announcing the surprise mission to Kiev and Moscow, Hollande sounded grave and solemn. The Ukraine crisis, he said, started with differences, which became a conflict, which became a war, and which now risked becoming “total war”. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former Danish prime minister and until recently the head of Nato, publicly voiced fears that Putin could expand what is seen as Soviet revisionism to countries now in Nato and the EU. In the Baltics, Putin might risk a little exercise in “hybrid warfare”, he said, just to test how the western alliance would react. That Merkel has gone to Moscow is telling in itself and speaks to the sudden gravity of the situation. The Russian-speaking German chancellor has talked to the German-speaking Putin more than 40 times in the past year as the main western mediator on Ukraine. But until Friday she had never gone to Moscow. Only a few weeks ago she vetoed a summit in Kazakhstan with Putin because she believed there was no point negotiating with someone she no longer trusted. Putin is demanding that a large tract of eastern Ukraine, taken by force by his separatist proxies in recent weeks, be granted internationally licensed autonomy and that a new frontline be recognised as a basis for a putative ceasefire. The parallel might be 1991 in Croatia when the Serbs took a quarter of the country and then consolidated their grip behind lines patrolled by UN peacekeepers. It crippled and destabilised Croatia. European policymakers say this is Putin’s aim in Ukraine. In Croatia the land-grab lasted four years until Zagreb, gradually armed by the Americans and Europeans, quickly routed the Serbs militarily. The big difference then was that the Serbs were stretched by a bigger war next door in Bosnia where eventually Nato bombed them to the negotiating table. That will not happen with the Russians. Arming the Ukrainians, meanwhile, will open up big divisions between the Americans and most Europeans. Putin is playing on those divisions as he plays on splits between the Europeans. He does not need to try very hard. The divisions are ever-present over sanctions. On Monday the EU will impose more sanctions, extending a blacklist of pro-Russia separatists and Russians by 19 names. These penalties are minor. The broader economic sanctions in force against Russian banks and companies are more serious. They lapse in July unless extended by all EU governments. Last year the biggest opponent was Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, whose then foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, now coordinates EU foreign policy. The new leftwing pro-Russia Greek government may be this summer’s problem. The sanctions policy has so far held up, but is showing acute strains. Senior diplomats from EU governments regularly say the sanctions are hurting but are not working because they have not changed Putin’s behaviour. The EU is split in two, with Britain leading the pro-sanctions side and a sizeable group complaining that the punishment has cost the EU an estimated 15% of exports to Russia. Germany is the pivot, the swing power. Putin is increasingly seen as a reckless gambler who calls bluffs and takes risks, and is inscrutable, paranoid and unpredictable. Trying to work out what he wants is guesswork. The Europeans sound scared. Ukraine is a huge problem for Europe, not least the dawning realisation that fixing it will cost tens of billions and will take a very long time. But for Europe it is becoming clear that the real nightmare is not Ukraine, but Putin’s Russia.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person that Kipp tells something to that makes Dr. Spencer worried? from the following article ? A prologue explains the role of the bounty hunter. A wanted criminal named Burch tries to ambush bounty hunter Jim Kipp, but Kipp gets the better of him. Kipp takes Burch's corpse into town to collect the reward. A representative of the Pinkerton Detective Agency asks Kipp to hunt a trio of fugitives. Three masked men committed a robbery and fled with 100,000. Kipp, who has the reputation that he will do anything for money, is offered a huge reward if he can capture the culprits dead or alive. Kipp rides into the town of Twin Forks, and uses an alias. He seeks information about one fugitive's wounds from Dr. Spencer, who is wary of revealing too much. Kipp is immediately attracted to the doctor's daughter, Julie. A limping man named Bill Rachin, who works at the hotel, draws Kipp's suspicion. So does George Williams, a card dealer. Williams' wife, Alice, flirts with Kipp and tries to coax information out of him. Kipp does not reveal the purpose for his visit. Vance Edwards identifies Kipp and his reputation as a bounty hunter. Edwards mistakenly believes Kipp is seeking him for another crime. The townspeople become anxious as the truth about Kipp becomes known. Led by the postmaster, Danvers, they offer Kipp a bribe to leave town. Kipp tells several people that he is expecting a package on the next day's stagecoach and in the package is a likeness of one of the robbers. Dr. Spencer later overhears Kipp telling his daughter the same thing and he becomes worried.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: The Browns are an abomination but they're far from the worst team in NFL history The Cleveland Browns are bad. They are very bad. They hover pitifully at the bottom of the uninspiring AFC North with an 0-11 record, and it doesn’t take much imagination to see them going 0-16 this season. Were it not for the Cavaliers’ NBA title and the Indians’ near world championship, the Browns’ misfortune would be chronicled in headlines that prominently include the words “Cleveland” and “woebegone,” “hapless” or “misfortune.” On Sunday, as if to show how bad they really are, in a 24-9 loss to Pittsburgh, the Browns gave up eight sacks, lost one quarterback (more on that later) and couldn’t manage a touchdown even when they had a first down just inches from the goalline. And yet this year’s Browns, as bad as they are, won’t be the worst team in NFL history. Not even close. For Cleveland can still run a functional offense at times. They can score points on occasion and they’ve even come close to winning two games this fall – although one of those was against the Jets. The 2016 Browns will never be as bad as the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They will always have that. The ‘76 Bucs were dreadful. They didn’t score a point until the season’s third game and then after a 17-point uprising in week four, they were shut out again the following week. In fact, they went scoreless in five of their games that year. Unsurprisingly, they were 0-14 and would have easily been 0-16 had the NFL played 16-game seasons back then. Things were so bad, their coach, John McKay, joked: “We can’t win at home and we can’t win on the road; what we need is a neutral site.” Unfortunately for the Bucs there were no international games in 1976 and they were left to be as awful as they could be. But at least the Bucs had the excuse of being an expansion team. Three years later they were in the NFC Championship Game. The Browns might not even be as bad as the 2008 Detroit Lions, who are the NFL’s only 0-16 team. They gave up 517 points that year, which was the second-worst total in league history. Cleveland’s defense is not very good but they’ve managed to hold opponents to just under 30 points a game, meaning they won’t be as awful as the 2008 Lions or even the 1981 Baltimore Colts who allowed 533 points. Those Colts won their first and last games but lost the 14 in between which, come to think of it, is better than the Browns are doing right now. Still, the chances are that history won’t frown on these Browns as much as it does on the 1990 New England Patriots who had the NFL’s worst offense and second worst defense. That team managed to pull out a two-point victory (which was swiftly followed by a sexual harassment scandal) and finished 1-15. It was a miserable enough season that a move to St Louis seemed to be imminent until a local businessman named Robert Kraft stepped in to save the franchise. The Browns aren’t leaving Cleveland. They’ve already done that to their loyal and eternally-patient fans. But ever since the expansion Browns arrived in 1999, they’ve done everything they can to break hearts. Going 0-16 would set a new low ... even if it isn’t the lowest the NFL has ever seen. “It’s bullcrap. We can’t keep doing this and we can’t keep letting our guys get hit.” Yes, it was a bad day for the Browns. One made worse when their rookie quarterback, Cody Kessler, who was supposed to be a reason for Cleveland fans to hope, appeared to have suffered his second concussion this season when he was knocked to the ground by Pittsburgh’s Lawrence Timmons. That outraged the Browns other hope this year: receiver Terrelle Pryor. After the game, Pryor went off to reporters about the team’s offensive line, which has turned the team’s quarterback position into a turnstile. There’s a decent chance Kessler will miss the season, meaning he will avoid the disaster the Browns campaign has become. Pryor, who has 51 catches for 627 yards this year and four touchdowns, has the right to criticize his team-mates. He has performed. He also has revived his career and is a free agent at season’s end – meaning he will probably escape the mess soon enough. Vikings Linval Joseph absolutely destroys Fox sound guy during pregame intros https://t.co/4C3Afhj3tU The worst part about this is collision is you can see it happening. Everyone in the stadium can see it happening. Everyone but this poor network sound technician and the Minnesota Vikings who trampled him. 12. The number of missed extra points on Sunday, breaking the previous record of 10. After much debate about the usefulness of the extra point, the NFL moved the spot from which it would be kicked from the two to the 15. The idea was that by moving the kick back, extra points would be more exciting and the league would be more exciting too. Now, in Week 11 of the most unpopular NFL season in recent memory, we get overwhelmed by kicking imperfection. Certainly, it was windy in some NFL stadiums on Sunday. Especially New Jersey’s Met Life Stadium where New York’s Robbie Gould missed two extra points and Chicago’s Connor Barth failed on one attempt. Cincinnati’s Mike Nugent could blame the cold for his two misses. New England’s Stephen Gostkowski and San Francisco’s Phil Dawson could say it was the rain in Santa Clara that prompted their misses. But Jacksonville’s Jason Myers and Minnesota’s Kai Forbath missed indoors. At least Seattle’s Steven Hauschka and Detroit’s Matt Prater can say their attempts were blocked … As if that justifies everything. There was a time, earlier this year, when Dak Prescott was seen as a fragile placeholder for Tony Romo in the Cowboys offense. Though Dallas’s coaches seemed happy with the rookie’s training camp, he wasn’t supposed to actually lead the Cowboys to the playoffs. His first few games as the team’s starter reflected that as he played carefully and conservatively, trying not to make many mistakes. Now that the team is officially his, he has been given more and more freedom. Sunday he completed 27-of-36 passes for 301 and three touchdowns against no interceptions. It was his second straight 300-yard passing game. More importantly, he has 14 touchdowns and only two interceptions for the 9-1 Cowboys. Oh, and he picks up his litter. Shame on you for not choosing him when you had the chance on draft night. – The Vikings ended their four-game losing streak with two length-of-the-field returns to beat Arizona 30-24. Xavier Rhodes picked off a Carson Palmer pass at the goal line and ran 100 yards for a second quarter touchdown. Then in the fourth quarter, Cordarrelle Patterson took a kickoff 104 yards for a score. – Kansas City lost a costly game they probably did not expect to drop when they went down 19-17 at home to Tampa Bay. Bucs quarterback Jameis Winson has been responsible for a touchdown in every one of his 26 NFL games. On Sunday, he threw for 331 yards and a touchdown. – The New York Giants won a game they needed to keep up with Dallas when the out-fought the Bears 22-16 at the Meadowlands. After a flat start, the Giants defense overwhelmed Chicago and quarterback Jay Cutler in the second half. Cutler’s last-chance desperation pass was intercepted ending another disappointing game for him. Eli Manning threw for two touchdowns. – Indianapolis beat Tennessee for the 11th straight time as Andrew Luck threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns. It was a game the Colts desperately needed to win to move to 5-5, tying them with the Titans for second in the AFC South and putting them closer to the 6-3 Houston Texans who play in Mexico City on Monday night. – Detroit continue to surprise, winning for the fifth time in six games and moving to 6-4 with a 26-19 victory over Jacksonville. Matthew Stafford continued his strong run with 278 yards passing. The Lions also returned a punt and interception for touchdowns. – Russell Wilson became the first quarterback in Seahawks history to catch a touchdown pass when receiver Doug Baldwin hit him with a 15-yard scoring throw in Seattle’s 26-15 win over the Eagles. - Miami scored two touchdowns in the final two minutes to ruin Jared Goff’s first NFL start as the Dolphins beat the Rams 14-10. Goff, the top pick in last spring’s draft, was 17-of-31 for 134 yards and no touchdowns or interceptions on a rainy afternoon in Los Angeles. - Patriots quarterback Tom Brady played near his San Francisco Bay area home for the first time in his pro career and threw four touchdowns in the rain as New England beat the 49ers 30-17. Summary:","completion":"The Cleveland Browns are not doing very well in the NFL and have not won any games this season. They lost another game on Sunday to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Life would be easier. However, education cannot promise all wishes, dreams, and desires.Society must reject the foolish idea that a college education's main purpose is to satisfy our desires and secure success.Like most challenging things, education is a gamble in which results depend entirely on people's ability to look past their wants to see the realism and reason behind their wants. For instance, my first year of college, I took a sociology class.In class, we were taught that Third World countries were poor.We learned that our quality of life would be almost impossible for an average person in those countries.I began to examine my own desire to be rich.To always go after money felt selfish when knowing others had none at all.Learning about other society's financial situations forced me to look beyond what I wanted. Through the process of education, everything once desired is tested.Wanting something no longer is enough; it's more important to examine why we want it and whether we really want it.When my desire for money changed, everything changed.I stopped longing for money-driven careers and stopped valuing the people who had them.I began to examine the things I purchased and my reason for wanting them.

Question: suppose More mass is burned by the red giant happens, how will it affect a SMALLER white dwarf star. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze the steps involved in the process: 1. A red giant burns more mass: It means the red giant will have a higher rate of nuclear fusion in its core, producing more energy. 2. This mass creates high core temperatures: The higher mass burning will result in higher core temperatures. 3. The mass decreases: As more mass is burnt, the overall mass of the red giant will decrease. 4. The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center: As the mass decreases, there will be a point where the red giant cannot sustain fusion of carbon and oxygen in its core. 5. The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers: At this stage, the star's gravity will be weaker due to the decrease in mass, and the outer layers will not be held as tightly. 6. The layers break away: Eventually, the outer layers will be expelled, leaving behind only the inner core. 7. Only the inner core remains: Once the outer layers have dispersed, what remains is the inner core, which is known as a white dwarf. Now, let's consider the effect on a smaller white dwarf star if a red giant burns more mass: A smaller white dwarf star is already the final stage of stellar evolution for a low or medium mass star. Assuming the two stars are not interacting or in a binary system, the red giant burning more mass will not directly affect the smaller white dwarf star.

The U.S. State Department has condemned the attack, calling it a \\"horrific, senseless act of violence\\" in a statement. Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to \\"severely punish the terrorists in accordance with the law.\\" Authorities said police shot four perpetrators dead on the scene and captured a wounded female suspect. They have also linked the rampage to separatists from the country's far western Xinjiang region, where tensions between Han Chinese and the largely Muslim Uyghurs have sometimes turned violent.

Dong, a 50-year-old street vendor from the countryside, was trying to buy a train ticket home to visit his sick mother when he was hacked. \\"His whole face was covered in blood,\\" his wife described the sight greeting the family at the hospital, which has received most of the people injured in the attack. \\"We're now waiting for him to go through surgery,\\" said Huixian, the 17-year-old daughter. \\"But those with even more severe injuries need to be operated on first.\\" \\"Those Xinjiang people are just horrible and I hate their guts,\\" she added. A spate of violent incidents has rocked restive Xinjiang in recent months. Only two weeks ago, police announced the death of 11 terrorists in a foiled attack in Aksu Prefecture. Last October, a jeep carrying a Uyghur family plowed into crowds in front of Tiananmen Gate in central Beijing, killing two tourists and injuring 40. Authorities have responded by intensifying their crackdown on suspected Islamic separatists, including the arrest last month of prominent Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti. The killings in Kunming -- a city of more than six million residents, known for its mild weather and leisurely pace -- shocked the nation and occurred at a particularly sensitive time as Chinese lawmakers are set to start their annual session Wednesday to hear the first government work report under President Xi's leadership. Far away from Beijing but a short drive from Dong's hospital is a small, nameless street in front of the massive Kunming Railway Station. Lined with supermarkets, restaurants and a post office, it was again bustling with passengers hauling luggage Sunday afternoon, the blood stains in the area already washed away. Uniformed police, SWAT teams and paramilitary troops patrolling the station's sprawling ground regularly passed the street on foot and in cars. Food sellers on the sidewalk exchanged details they had seen or heard about the carnage. READ MORE: China's train station killings described as a terrorist attack. Chang Changwei's mobile phone shop was open but his mind kept wandering back to the night before when screaming crowds from the station suddenly ran toward his street. \\"So many people were trying to find a place to hide,\\" the 27-year-old shop owner recalled to CNN. \\"The restaurant next to me and I let everyone in.\\" \\"I asked my wife and mother to bring my son inside,\\" he continued. \\"Then I grabbed some metal pipes for myself and a few others, and said, we have to stick together to take them down.\\" The attackers never came this way, but his mother's recollection of the scene was more harrowing. \\"I saw four people die nearby,\\" said 58-year-old Hu Xuerong. \\"One person was lying face down in the blood with a knife still stuck in his back.\\" GALLERY: Kunming terror attack, in photographs.

In social media, some users' attempts to reflect on the root causes -- including waves of Han migration into Xinjiang and the treatment of Uyghurs in their native land -- to the latest terror were quickly drowned out by the overwhelming sound of fury. Chang, the shop owner, admitted he'd never given much thought to Xinjiang separatists.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person Lennon become involved with in a protest? , can you please find it? In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" and joined marches in support of the magazine. Eager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that \\"it contains a substantial portion of good music\\" but warned of the possibility that \\"his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\\".

While Ainsley is urinating, Sampson falls silent; Ainsley finds Sampson killed. He grabs his harpoon, only to be murdered by a monstrous being. During a Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans, a group of friends including Ben and his best friend Marcus decide to go on a haunted swamp tour. They find the tour closed because the guide, Rev. Zombie, was sued for negligence. Rev. Zombie suggests they try a place farther down the street, owned by the over-the-top, inexperienced tour guide Shawn. Marcus decides to leave but changes his mind upon seeing two topless girls: Misty, a ditzy porn star, and Jenna, a bossy, boastful, up-and-coming actress. Their sleazy director, Doug Shapiro, is also present. Ben pays for himself and Marcus and Shawn leads them to his tour bus, where the other tourists, Jim and Shannon Permatteo, a Minnesota married couple, and the quiet, hot-tempered Marybeth are waiting. Shawn does not know what he is doing, which the others realize as they arrive at the swamp. Shapiro has Misty and Jenna strip down and film a scene for Bayou Beavers as everyone boards the boat, while a homeless swamp-dweller named Jack Cracker warns them away from the swamp. Shawn leads them through swamplands and past abandoned houses, including one where Victor Crowley, a deformed creature, lived. The boat hits a rock and begins sinking, leaving them stranded. As the crew walks through the woods, they encounter the shabby Crowley house, and Marybeth shares the legend of Victor Crowley. Victor was a deformed child with a rare disease, bullied by other kids and was kept hidden by his father, Thomas Crowley.

The group becomes increasingly uneasy, but they have no choice but to push forward in hopes of finding a way out. As they continue on their journey, they come across the gruesome remains of Sampson and Ainsley, confirming their worst fears. It becomes obvious that the monstrous being that killed the father and son is none other than Victor Crowley himself. The group, now terrified, decides to split up to cover more ground and hopefully find a way out of the swamp faster. Ben and Marcus stick together, while Jim and Shannon, Misty and Jenna, and Marybeth go in separate directions. As they explore, they find themselves hunted by Victor Crowley, who is relentless in his pursuit to kill anyone who enters his domain. One by one, the members of the group become victims of Victor Crowley. Misty and Jenna are brutally murdered while filming their scene for Bayou Beavers. Jim and Shannon are ambushed, and despite their best efforts to escape, they fall to the hands of the vengeful spirit. Doug Shapiro, in his quest for profit, is also killed by Victor Crowley after he stumbles upon his location while filming the girls. Ben, Marcus, and Marybeth, who are the remaining members of the group, decide to band together to find a way out and try to fight against Victor Crowley. They realize that they need to learn more about the legend to see if there is a way to defeat him or understand why he continues to haunt the swamp. The trio manages to find more information about Victor Crowley and his father, Thomas Crowley. It turns out that after Thomas accidentally killed his son, he was overcome with grief and desperation. He sought the help of a local voodoo practitioner to bring Victor back to life. Instead, the ritual cursed Victor, creating an immortal being filled with rage, forever trapped in the swamp. Armed with this new knowledge, Ben, Marcus, and Marybeth devise a plan to confront Victor Crowley and put an end to the nightmare once and for all. They lure him into a trap, managing to incapacitate him temporarily. However, as Victor is seemingly defeated, he rises once again, proving his immortality. At this point, the group understands that the only way to stop the rampage is to leave Victor's swamp and never return. Their numbers significantly reduced, and having lost friends and loved ones to the hands of Victor Crowley, Ben, Marcus, and Marybeth finally escape the haunted swamp. They are left to ponder the tragic story of Victor Crowley and the terrible fate that befell them all, realizing the importance of understanding local legends and respecting the histories and territories which they visit. In the end, the movie \\"Hatchet\\" serves as a cautionary tale, reminding viewers of the consequences of treading into unknown territories, especially when they are haunted by vengeful spirits with a thirst for blood.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Obama: U.S. 'a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws;' blasts Arizona law Saying the United States \\"must remain a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws,\\" President Obama called today for changes to a \\"broken\\" immigration system and condemned a new Arizona law requiring migrants to carry documentation. \\"Our failure to act responsibly at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others,\\" Obama said during a naturalization ceremony for two dozen new U.S. citizens, all of them members of the military. The Arizona law -- described here by our sister paper, The Arizona Republic -- requires migrants to produce papers when asked by law enforcement officials. Gov. Jan Brewer signed the bill today, reports our colleague John Fritze in the OnPolitics blog. The law threatens to \\"undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe,\\" said Obama, who has asked his Justice Department to investigate possible civil rights implications. In Washington, Senate Democrats and Republicans are working on a compromise immigration bill, and Obama said he would try and assist those efforts. He called for a \\"comprehensive\\" law, which includes tighter security at the border as well as a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who are already here. \\"Passions are great and disagreements run deep,\\" Obama said. \\"Yet surely we can all agree that when 11 million people in our country are living here illegally, outside the system, that's unacceptable. The American people demand and deserve a solution.\\" Obama spoke after the swearing-in of the nation's newest citizens, including immigrants from China, Ethiopia, Mexico and Papua New Guinea. Obama congratulated his guests for renewing \\"the spirit of possibility\\" and \\"the very essence of the country that we all love.\\" Obama also presented Sgt. Ledum Ndaanee, a Marine, with the Outstanding American by Choice award. Here are bios of the new U.S. citizens, courtesy of the White House. Biography of Sergeant Ledum Ndaanee, U.S. Marine Corps (E-5), recipient of the Outstanding American by Choice recognition: Sergeant (Sgt.) Ledum D. Ndaanee was born in Nigeria on May 2, 1982. At the age of 16, he moved to the United States with his family, settling in Richmond, Va. After attending a local community college, Sgt. Ndaanee had his heart set on serving his new country by joining the U.S. Marine Corps. He enlisted in September 2004. Sgt. Ndaanee deployed to Iraq on two separate occasions with the 1st Battalion, 2d Marines in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On August 4, 2007, while assigned as a turret gunner conducting combat operations, he suffered a concussion and traumatic brain injury as the result of an improvised explosive device. While recovering from his injuries at Wounded Warrior Battalion-East in Camp Lejeune, NC, Sgt. Ndaanee played a vital role in the recovery process of his fellow Marines and Sailors. He was instrumental in encouraging others to overcome their injuries by serving as a mentor. After recovering from his wounds, Sgt. Ndaanee achieved an important milestone in his life by becoming a U.S. citizen in November 2007. Sgt. Ndaanee is currently serving as the non-commissioned Officer-in-Charge of the Warrior Athlete Reconditioning (WAR) Program's Strength and Conditioning Team and is also a member of the aquatics team within Wounded Warrior Battalion-East.

They run into Alan Jeffcote, the son of the owner of the mill in which they work, who has also traveled to Blackpool with a group of friends while his fiancée is detained on business in London. Jenny and Alan hit it off immediately, and he persuades her to leave Blackpool to spend the week with him at Llandudno in North Wales. To cover her tracks, Jenny leaves a postcard with Mary, asking her to send it to her parents (Edmund Gwenn and Sybil Thorndike) later in the week. She and Alan leave their friends and set off for Wales. Shortly afterwards, Mary is involved in a serious road accident and is killed. Her possessions are returned to Hindle and the unmailed postcard is found in her luggage.

Answer based on context: The Steelers traveled to Chicago to take on the Bears. In the first quarter, the Bears scored first when Jordan Howard ran for a 3-yard touchdown to take a 7-0 lead for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, the Steelers managed to tie it up at 7-7 when Ben Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 7-yard pass.

As Julie kept asking question after question, all I could think of was how desperately I needed a normal, healthy relationship. As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"Your question does not list specific methods, so I will provide insights on different methods to protect your neck from the sun and analyze which are more reasonable. 1. Wear a wide-brimmed hat: This method is quite effective as the wide brim provides good shade for your neck and face. It also keeps your head cool, which is a bonus during hot temperatures. Moreover, they are available in various styles and materials, allowing you to choose one that matches your preferences and fashion sense. This is a very reasonable and practical method to protect your neck from sun exposure. 2. Applying sunscreen: Sunscreens with a high SPF (Sun Protection Factor) provide sufficient protection against UVA and UVB rays. It would help if you applied sunscreen on your neck and other exposed body parts. Although sunscreen is effective, you may need to reapply it periodically, especially after sweating or swimming. This method may be less favorable than wearing a hat, as it might require more maintenance and leaves room for error if it is not applied evenly or adequately. 3. Sports or outdoor neck gaiters with UV protection: A UV-protective neck gaiter offers excellent sun protection. It's versatile and can be worn in various ways, ensuring that your neck remains covered from sun rays. Additionally, it can be used to protect your face during outdoor activities like biking, hiking, or jogging. Therefore, outdoor neck gaiters are a reasonable and effective method. 4. Using sun protective clothing: There are specially designed clothes, including shirts and jackets, with an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) that shields your skin from harmful rays. These garments usually offer protection for several body parts, including your neck. Investing in sun-protective clothing might be a reasonable choice depending on your specific needs and the outdoor activities you engage in. 5. Finding shade when possible: Staying in the shade when you're outdoors is an excellent way to minimize sun damage. However, this method might not be feasible in all cases, especially during long outdoor excursions or when shade isn't readily available. 6. Using an umbrella: Carrying a portable umbrella can help protect your neck from the sun. However, this method may not be practical during some activities, and it can be cumbersome to carry around an umbrella during outdoor activities. Considering the various methods discussed above, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and using a UV-protective neck gaiter appear to be the most reasonable and effective options for protecting your neck from the sun. These methods provide good coverage without significant inconveniences and are suitable for most outdoor activities. In addition, by combining these methods with sunscreen for extra protection, you can further shield yourself from the sun's harmful rays."},{"prompt":"Question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

Nevertheless, he continued to visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence.

Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air.

The three countries in the South Caucasus were once part of the Soviet Union, but after its break-up in 1991, they gained independence. Although people there now enjoy greater social freedoms than ever before, there is a divide between how men and women are treated. Many women, despite being old enough to vote, feel society will look down on them if they go out late in the evenings. As a woman from Azerbaijan, I grew up seeing the women around me choosing to stay in during the evenings. But people who range from their 20s all the way to their 60s have a new approach to this now. I know many women who defy the stereotypes and will go out at night, not only to dance at night clubs, but also to for a walk, or enjoy the beauty of the lights of night-time Baku. Of course, Western influences through education or increased tourism have begun to permeate these countries with music venues, bars and nightclubs becoming more prolific. And as the number of women working in the region increases, so does their spending power - and their desire for somewhere to spend it. The proportion of women employed in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia increased slightly between 2006 and 2011, according to the World Bank. Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia But for others, embracing this new lifestyle means getting a reputation as a \\"good-time girl and being ostracised by neighbours and families. They will share their pictures on social media, but take steps to ensure they remain anonymous. Others, however, want the whole world to know just what a a good time they are having. \\"I do go out at night. When everyone else in the city falls asleep, a new crowd takes over Yerevan and the nightlife begins. So far I haven't faced any criticism; in fact I feel like part of a community. \\"Every year I notice an increase in the number of women going out. I think one reason is because young women are becoming financially independent and more and more women are making their own choices regardless of public opinion. Also, there is a new generation of young women who don't concede to the archaic concept of reputation; to be a so-called \\"good-time girl\\". \\"Women who fear the opinions of others or their neighbours keep their personal lives a secret.\\" \\"I may go to a club or go for a walk with the people I know and trust, but I worry this might be misunderstood. There are some people who say 'if it is late, then this is bad', without checking where and who you are out with. Every Armenian girl who wants to live in an unassuming way should consider public opinion of course. But now these kind of stereotypes are disappearing - you can stay out until 23:00 local time. \\"I try to be at home at 22:30. If I come home late, my parents don't like it, and I know the neighbours will grumble. This could then affect my future life and reputation. I know I am not doing anything wrong, but I need to adapt to the circumstances. \\"Sometimes I go to karaoke clubs with my friends. There are many discos in Armenia, though these have not been easily accepted by society. People say a 'normal' girl would not go to these clubs. The situation is worse outside Yerevan. For example, in the second biggest city, Gyumri, there are no entertainment centres open at night because no-one goes. \\"But karaoke is seen to be something a bit more acceptable; you can dance, sing and have fun, and people won't call you names. \\"The situation may change, but it won't be easy - it might take 50 years at least.\\" \\"I have a master's degree in education and I work for a hospital in the capital city Baku. \\"I don't think men or women should have a night life. It's not a healthy form of entertainment, and sleeping at night is very important. Also they drink alcohol in night clubs. I think people who drink alcohol are not thinking straight. \\"For me, women's freedom is not about going on a night out. A woman should only think about getting educated, to be independent financially and to be confident enough to speak her own mind. I don't go on nights out and I have never been. Nobody in my close family goes clubbing. \\"I have never been subject to any restrictions imposed by my family; I have had no interest in going to clubs. If I wanted to, I could go. I do sport after work, or I meet my friends, or I visit my relatives. When I go out with my friends, first we go to a cafe to have lunch, then we go for a walk in the city. \\"I spend my holidays in foreign countries like Russia, Turkey and Iran. I also don't go clubbing in countries I visit. I'm interested in the culture and history of foreign countries, so I visit museums and libraries there.\\" \\"I go on nights out as well as evening concerts and night clubs. \\"I think a woman should have time to go out and have fun in order to help her to get rid of the stress of her workload, the negative feelings and the aggression of the week, and also to get know new people. Otherwise this anger affects other people. \\"Everyone should go to popular concerts at least five times a year. \\"Let's consider that a woman stays at home, but a man goes to tea houses, clubs and so on. Does it mean that only men have the right to have fun? If so, let them change the name of Azerbaijan to 'the Male Republic of Azerbaijan'. \\"The people who think that a woman should stay at home have been conditioned by their families. But some of the women cannot go out, because of lack of money, or safety or they want to be a 'good girl' so they can get married. \\"My family used to think like this, but I have changed them. If you have a love of life, you try to resist these restrictions. \\"I'm not 18 anymore.\\" \\"I meet family members and friends on Fridays after work and on Saturdays as well. We go out to restaurants first, then go clubbing. We don't go out every week, but it is mostly how we spend our weekends. \\"I'm the mother of a young daughter, so she stays with her grandmother when I go out to get a bit of time for myself. \\"I don't hear any kind of criticism from the older generation or religious people. But it hasn't always been like this. In the 1990s there were no night clubs: we had war and poverty. But at the end of the 1990s jazz clubs were established where we had discos and house parties.

It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution.

Stepping out of the bus into 90-degree heat, they marched in circles in front of the copper-domed Arizona State Capitol. Latino men and women struck Korean janggu drums, and Korean American adults and kids carried tall placards with messages in Spanish: LegalizaciÃ³n Ahora! L.A. had arrived in the Valley of the Sun.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions.

Article: Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Hundreds of infants and toddlers have died after accidentally being left in the car. This simple trick could help you never forget that your child is in the back seat. VPC Cobb County police investigate an SUV where a toddler died June 18, 2014, near Marietta, Ga., when the father forgot to drop his child off at day care and went to work. Justin Ross Harris, 33, was being held without bond on a felony murder charge. (Photo: Ben Gray, AP) An average of 38 children have died in hot cars each year in the USA since 1998. And many of these incidents could have been prevented. One simple way to make that happen: leave something you need in the back seat. If you are driving a child, after you put them in a back seat — in a car seat, booster or buckled in with a seat belt — put your left shoe back there, too. This year, according to the Department of Geosciences at San Francisco State University, 13 children have died after being left in cars, and the summer has just started. Last year 44 children died after being left in hot cars.The heat and holidays give more reason to find a way to prevent more deaths from occurring. The results of a recent survey, published on the SafeKids.org website stated that: • 14% of parents have intentionally left their children in a parked car. • 11% of parents admit to forgetting their child in a car. • Nearly 1 in 4 parents of a child younger than 3 has forgotten the child in a car. • Dads are nearly three times more likely than moms to leave a child in a parked car. Not all deaths were caused because people forgot. Some parents believe cracking the window will make the car cool enough. About 6% of the people in the Public Opinion Strategies survey cited above thought it was OK to let a child stay in a parked, locked vehicle for longer than 15 minutes. Some deaths are caused because kids get into cars, are trapped and die before anyone discovers them. Still, a little more than half of all child heat stroke deaths in cars were caused because a parent forgot their child was in the car. The parent is distracted, preoccupied or running on autopilot, like many busy parents of babies and toddlers. The child falls asleep. The parent gets out of the car and leaves the baby behind. MONDAY: Ga. boy's mom also researched hot-car deaths, police say SATURDAY: Father researched child deaths in hot cars, warrants show Often the death comes when a parent breaks a routine, safety experts say. For Reginald McKinnon of Cape Coral, Fla., it was picking up his daughter Payton from day care and taking her to the doctor. After the appointment he put her in the rear-facing car seat in the back seat and headed back to work. He spent the day there not realizing his 17-month-old was still in the back seat. When he opened the door to his SUV to go home, Payton was dead, still strapped into her seat. McKinnon was sentenced to five years of probation and community service for Payton's March 2010 death. He is dedicated to honoring Payton's memory by educating parents and friends about the risk of hyperthermia when children are left in cars. In Phoenix, Daniel Bryant Gray, 33, was sentenced June 20 to four years in prison followed with seven years probation after he left his 3-month-old son, Jamison, last year in a car parked outside a bar where Gray worked. JUNE 25: Police press murder case in Ga. toddler's hot-car death JUNE 20: Fla. father arrested after daughter dies in hot car The day before in Murfreesboro, Tenn., Samantha Harper pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted aggravated child neglect in the hot-car deaths of her two 2-year-old, Savannah Marise, and 3-year-old, Daniel Marise. She was sentenced to 16 years in jail and will have to serve eight years before being eligible for probation. The same day in Marietta, Ga., Justin Ross Harris, 33, was booked on murder charges after he told investigators that he forgot to drop his son at day care and went to work instead. On his drive home, he discovered that his 22-month-old son, Cooper, had died in the back seat. And Steven Lillie, 31, was arrested June 20, four days after his 9-month-old daughter, Anna Marie Lillie, died after being left in a hot pickup truck in Rockledge, Fla. What will work is some kind of system that won't fail to remind a person a child is in the back seat. In 2012 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration published a report, \\"Reducing the Potential for Heat Stroke to Children in Parked Motor Vehicles: Evaluation of Reminder Technology.\\" It found reminder and detection devices to be unreliable and required too much effort from caregivers for them to operate. Putting something on the back seat as a reminder isn't a new idea. Safety groups have been pushing it for years telling people to put something you will need when you reach your destination. You may not always have your laptop, your purse, or your cellphone. But you do always have a shoe. So when you put your kid in the back, put your left shoe back there, too.

(AP) — A Louisiana police officer rescued a 5-week-old baby locked for more than a half hour inside a sweltering car on a summer day after someone noticed the child unconscious in the back seat and called 911, authorities said. The woman told police she had just dropped off her other child and forgot the baby was in the back seat in the strip mall parking lot. Temperatures outside reached above 90 degrees on Tuesday. The temperature inside the car was about 130 degrees. The baby has made a full recovery. The mother of the infant, Gloria Elzy, 44, of Slidell, Louisiana, was in custody Wednesday on a charge of second-degree cruelty to juveniles and a warrant for failure to appear for an unrelated case. The age of Elzy's older child is not known but both children are now with Child Protective Services, which has opened an investigation into the incident. \\"With all the media attention on this type of issue, it's mindboggling to me that someone can leave, better yet, forget, about a child inside of a vehicle,\\" Slidell Police Chief Randy Smith said. Police said someone reported seeing an unresponsive child in a car around 5 p.m. on Tuesday and called 911. When Officer Joshua Funck arrived, he used a device to unlock the vehicle and removed the infant, who was sweating profusely. The child was rushed to an area hospital, revived and has since made a full recovery, Seuzeneau said. \\"If the citizen wouldn't have immediately called Slidell Police, and Officer Funck didn't act quickly, the baby would not have survived,\\" Smith said. \\"They are both heroes in my book.\\" Slidell Police Detective Daniel M. Seuzeneau said in a news release Wednesday that bond had not been set for Elzy and he did not know if she was represented by an attorney. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"An average of 38 children have died in hot cars each year in the USA since 1998, and many of these incidents could have been prevented.

Translate \\"Impacto ambiental en Lleida\\" from Spanish to English.","completion":"\\"Impacto ambiental en Lleida\\" can be translated to English as \\"Environmental impact in Lleida.\\" Lleida is a city in the Catalonia region of Spain. The phrase refers to the effects that human activities, industry, and development have on the natural environment and ecosystems in and around Lleida. Different factors may contribute to the environmental impact in Lleida. These factors include but are not limited to: 1. Industrial pollution: Industries located in Lleida may release pollutants into the air, water, and soil. Examples include manufacturing plants, chemical industries, and food processing plants. Emissions from these industries may lead to respiratory issues, water contamination, and damage to the region's biodiversity. 2. Urbanization: As Lleida continues to develop and grow, there may be an increase in urban sprawl and the expansion of built-up areas. This leads to habitat fragmentation, deforestation, and loss of green spaces. Urban heat island effects may also become more pronounced, causing an increase in ambient temperatures in the city. 3. Agriculture and livestock production: Lleida is an important agricultural region in Catalonia, with a heavy focus on fruit, vegetable, and cereal production, as well as livestock farming. Intensive agricultural practices, including the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides, can lead to soil degradation, contamination of water sources, and loss of biodiversity. Livestock production can also contribute significantly to the emission of greenhouse gases, such as methane. 4. Transportation: Increased vehicular traffic and the use of fossil fuels can lead to higher levels of air pollution in Lleida. Emissions from cars, buses, and trucks contribute to air quality degradation and climate change. 5. Waste management: The management and disposal of waste, whether it be domestic, industrial, or agricultural, is a key challenge for Lleida. Improper waste disposal can lead to soil pollution, contamination of water sources, and the release of harmful gases. Inadequate recycling and waste reduction efforts can also exacerbate the problem. 6. Climate change: As a global phenomenon, climate change affects Lleida as well. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns can impact local ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources. This, in turn, may result in increased pressure on the environment. To reduce the environmental impact in Lleida, both the local government and citizens can implement various measures. These could include promoting sustainable development, adopting cleaner technologies, investing in renewable energy sources, and supporting conservation efforts. Commuting via public transportation, cycling, or walking, recycling waste, and conserving water resources are also critical steps that individuals can take to contribute to a healthier and more sustainable Lleida."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In that respect, the SEC should reexamine the amount and targeting of its civil sanctions, its use of criminal statutes, and working effectively with the Department of Justice to put violators behind bars when appropriate. Does it follow that \\"The SEC should think about its civil sanctions.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it follows that \\"The SEC should think about its civil sanctions.\\" This statement is an accurate summary of the original statement, emphasizing the need for the SEC to reevaluate its current approach concerning civil sanctions, the application of criminal statutes, and coordination with the Department of Justice. A longer, more detailed response would discuss the SEC's role, the existing regulatory framework, and the potential benefits and considerations for a reexamination of its enforcement strategies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a prominent US federal regulatory agency that aims to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient financial markets, and facilitate capital formation. Established in 1934, the SEC enforces federal securities laws that regulate the securities industry, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Civil sanctions are monetary penalties imposed upon individuals or entities that have violated securities laws. The SEC has the authority to impose civil sanctions, which may include fines, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and the imposition of restrictions on future business activities. These sanctions serve to deter future misconduct, promote investor confidence in the market, and provide compensation to harmed parties. The statement suggests that the SEC should reexamine the amount and targeting of its civil sanctions. This could imply that the current level of sanctions may not be effective in deterring securities law violations or might not be appropriately targeting the most egregious violators. A reevaluation may involve analyzing the specific circumstances under which sanctions are imposed, the size of penalties concerning the severity of violations, and the deterrence value of these sanctions. Additionally, the statement encourages the SEC to review its use of criminal statutes. The SEC, in collaboration with the Department of Justice, can bring criminal charges against individuals or entities for willful violations of securities laws, like insider trading or accounting fraud, if their actions meet the elements of the crime. By examining its use of criminal statutes, the SEC can determine whether it is appropriately leveraging its authority to bring the most severe cases to justice, which could provide a stronger deterrent effect. Working effectively with the Department of Justice to put violators behind bars when appropriate is another aspect for reconsideration. Enhanced cooperation between the two agencies can help ensure that the enforcement regime is fair, consistent, and efficient, allowing violators to face the appropriate penalties in a timely manner. This collaboration can also lead to better resource allocation, achieving a more significant deterrent effect, and restoring investor confidence in the market. In conclusion, it does follow that \\"The SEC should think about its civil sanctions.\\" A comprehensive reexamination can lead to more effective strategies for deterring securities law violations. This reevaluation should consider the civil sanctions' amount and appropriateness, the proper use of criminal statutes, and enhanced coordination with the Department of Justice to better serve the SEC's mission of maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient financial markets."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The characters are very similar to the characters on the tv show, so that's what was good about it. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the review for positive and negative statements. - Positive statements: \\"The movie was pretty cool\\", \\"i thought it was an overall good movie\\", \\"The characters are very similar to the characters on the tv show, so that's what was good about it.\\" - Negative statements: \\"but not good enough to get 5 stars\\", \\"This movie doesn't have a lot of Escaflowne its self surprisingly\\", \\"And there are a few minor disgusting scenes\\". Step 2: Determine the overall sentiment by weighing the positive and negative statements. - There are 3 positive statements and 3 negative statements. Step 3: If the number of positive and negative statements is equal, consider the intensity and impact of the statements on the overall review. - The negative statements are mostly about specific aspects of the movie (not enough Escaflowne, some disgusting scenes), while the positive statements are more general (pretty cool, overall good movie, similar characters to the tv show). Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the analysis. - As the majority of the positive statements are general and have more impact on the review, and the negative statements are more specific about certain aspects of the movie, it can be concluded that the product review conveys a positive sentiment. Answer: Positive sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I know that the answer to the question \\"jewishness means to\\" is in \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Jewishness, specifically in the context of Ashkenazi Jews, is referred to as \\"Yiddishkeit.\\" This term originates from the Yiddish language and encompasses not only religious aspects such as the study of Torah and Talmud for men and observing Jewish Law for both men and women, but also various traditions, ideologies, practices, and movements within the broader Jewish culture. Yiddishkeit has evolved over time as a result of modernization and the emancipation of Jews in Europe. Previously, Ashkenazi Jews in regions such as the Rhineland, Riga, and Romania would primarily speak Yiddish in their secular lives and pray in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew. The concept of Yiddishkeit has since expanded to include not only Orthodoxy and Hasidism but also a wide array of Jewish cultural expressions. While the number of people who still speak Yiddish has decreased, Yiddishkeit can be identified through various manners of speech, styles of humor, and patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a person embracing their Jewishness or Yiddishkeit would be someone who engages with Jewish culture through supporting Jewish institutions, reading Jewish literature, attending Jewish movies and theater, traveling to Israel, visiting historical synagogues, and participating in other Jewish-related activities. In summary, Yiddishkeit represents the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews and encompasses a wide range of cultural, religious, and social practices, which have evolved and expanded throughout history as a result of modernization and the emancipation of the Jewish people in Europe. An individual embracing Yiddishkeit associates and participates in various aspects of Jewish culture, traditions, and activities."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

No; Given those answer options, answer the question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what shows evolution over geologic time above the level of the species?\\" is \\"leptospirosis\\", given that speciation events show evolution over geologic time above the level of the species? A:","completion":"B). No; Justification: The task involves interpreting and answering a query about a biological/evolutionary concept, specifically evolution above the species level over geologic time. 1. The first thing to do is understand the query. The question is asking about what displays evolution over geologic time periods above the level of species. In simpler terms, it's about macroevolution – major evolutionary changes over time that lead to the diversification of species into different forms (like the evolution of mammals from reptiles). 2. The answer options provided are \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\", indicating it's a yes/no question. The statement in question, to essentially be evaluated as true or false, is: \\"Leptospirosis shows evolution over geologic time above the level of the species.\\" 3. Leptospirosis, however, is a bacterial infection caused by Leptospira bacteria, not a species or group of species. Hence, it cannot be an entity that exhibits evolution over geologic time periods. 4. The statement added that speciation events show evolution above the species level over geologic time, which is accurate. However, this doesn’t correlate with leptospirosis because, as stated, it's a disease, not a process of evolutionary diversification. Given these reasons, the appropriate response would be \\"B). No\\", because 'leptospirosis', being a disease, cannot demonstrate evolution over geologic time above the level of species."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: St Botolph's Church is an Anglican place of worship in the village of Quarrington, part of the civil parish of Sleaford in Lincolnshire, England. The area has been settled since at least the Anglo-Saxon period, and a church existed at Quarrington by the time Domesday was compiled in 1086, when it formed part of Ramsey Abbey's fee. It was granted to Haverholme Priory about 1165, and the Abbey claimed the right to present the rector in the 13th century. This right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation in the early 16th century, and then passed to Robert Carre and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. With capacity for 124 people, the church serves the ecclesiastic parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and, as of 2009, had an average congregation of 50. Recognised for its age and tracery, the church has been designated a grade II* listed building. It has a tower and spire with a nave and north aisle ending at a chancel at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out restoration work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of arcading correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and trefoils in the reticulated designs. answer the following question: What right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation? Answer:","completion":"During the English Reformation, the Bishop of Lincoln claimed the right to present the rector for St Botolph's Church in Quarrington.

This one is okay except that it keeps coming back to the same song and I find it difficult to call up the other cd's I downloaded. My original coby has a built in usb port which is very convenient because there is no extra wire to use or lose. I like having an FM radio to listen to as an option and really wanted the upgraded version of my original coby which is advertised, but for some reason not available. For the price it works well enough if all you want is extra memory and a device that is inexpensive that you don't want to worry about if you are traveling or jogging. All in all I am still getting used to it and haven't tried any of the other features such as voice recording and book downloads. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"To answer the question, I will go step-by-step through the review to analyze the positive and negative aspects mentioned. 1. The reviewer gives the item 2 1/2 stars, which indicates an average or below-average rating. 2. They liked their original COBY but wanted more memory, which the new COBY seems to provide. 3. The reviewer mentions a problem where the device keeps coming back to the same song and difficulty in accessing the other downloaded CDs. 4. They appreciated the built-in USB port and FM radio in their original COBY, implying that these might be lacking or not as good in the new one. 5. They mention the price being reasonable for extra memory and an inexpensive device for travel or jogging. 6. They also mention they are still getting used to the device and haven't tried all the features yet, like voice recording and book downloads. After analyzing the review, I would say that it depicts the product in an unflattering light because despite some positive aspects (extra memory and reasonable price), the negative points (song selection issue, possible lack of a built-in USB port, and difficulty accessing other content) outweigh the positive aspects. Additionally, the reviewer's rating (2 1/2 stars) also suggests a less-than-optimal experience with the product."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen. Question: What kept the speaker from melting?

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who are the two youngest of the Bielski brothers?, using the article: The film is based on actual events, beginning in August 1941. Nazi Einsatzgruppen (task forces) are sweeping through Eastern Europe, systematically killing Jews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettoes are the Belarusian Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the local Auxiliary Police chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader. An arrangement is made between the two groups in which the Soviet partisans agree to protect the Jewish camp in exchange for supplies., what would be the answer ?

Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Premise: \\"Everyone thinks so.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so.\\" true? OPT: [1]. yes [2]. it is not possible to tell [3]. no","completion":"[3]. no The premise \\"Everyone thinks so\\" and the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so\\" represent two opposing statements. In this specific scenario, if we assume that the premise is true, it entails that every individual in the context being referred to holds a particular viewpoint or opinion. This means that there is a unanimous agreement among all individuals concerning the subject matter at hand. On the contrary, the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so\\" suggests that no individual in the context being referred to holds the specified viewpoint or opinion. In essence, this statement implies that there is a complete absence of agreement or support for the subject matter. Given that the premise and hypothesis are mutually exclusive, it is not possible for both statements to be true at the same time. If we accept the premise as true, \\"Everyone thinks so,\\" then by default, the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so\\" must be false. Consequently, the answer is [3]. no, as the two statements cannot coexist as true under the same conditions and context. To further understand the logical implications between these two statements, we can use a more concrete example. Let's assume that the subject matter is a highly acclaimed movie. The premise \\"Everyone thinks so\\" would mean that every individual believes the movie is excellent. If that were the case, it would be logically inconsistent and impossible for the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so\\" (i.e., no one believes the movie is excellent) to also be true simultaneously.

Additionally, the premise includes the beautiful fishing villages of Peschici and Vieste that climb up a rocky promontory. Although the statement suggests that Pugnochiuso and its neighboring resorts have splendid views and historical value, it does not provide enough information about popularity or the level of preference among tourists or locals. To determine if Pugnochiuso is indeed the most popular resort due to its views, we would need more information or data supporting this claim, such as the number of visitors, customer reviews, or tourism surveys comparing Pugnochiuso and the other beach resorts mentioned. Furthermore, one must consider that the preference for a resort location or its popularity might not depend solely on its views. Factors like accommodations, activities, accessibility, and overall experience could also play a significant role in determining a resort’s popularity.

Write an article based on this summary: – When Abigail Kingston became engaged to Jason Curtis, she did not have to wonder about what she'd wear on her wedding day. The dress she had in mind has been passed down through five generations in her family, starting with her great-great grandmother Mary Lowry Warren, who wore it when she wed on Dec. 11, 1895, in Buffalo, New York. In the 120 years since, it has been worn by nine other brides in her family, making so many trips that Abigail and her mother Leslie, who wore the dress as bride number 6 in 1977, were afraid that it was simply beyond repair, reports the Lehigh Valley Express-Times. When the keeper of the dress (the mother of the last bride to wear it—that last wedding being in 1991) sent it to Kingston, it arrived filled with holes, with disintegrating sleeves and browned satin. Not only had the dress been dry cleaned just once, lace patched the wear from 10 brides of different sizes trying to make it fit. Abigail, who is tall and thin, turned to a bridal designer, who spent 200 hours restoring it to its \\"spectacular\\" original design, reports Jezebel, transforming the brown into a blush shade and painstakingly recreating the disappearing sleeves and their 80 hand-sewn pleats. Still, \\"it is very, very fragile,\\" says Abigail, so she'll slip it on after the ceremony to wear throughout the cocktail hour during her Oct. 17 wedding in Perkasie, Pennsylvania. Abigail will also wear her great grandmother's ring and a locket given to her grandmother by her grandfather. \\"It's not just the dress that's been handed down,\\" Leslie says. \\"It's the love.\\" A 12th bride is already asking about it. (This bride wore her baby.)","completion":"Title: Timeless Love: The Wedding Dress That Ties Generations Together When Abigail Kingston became engaged to Jason Curtis, she did not have to spend hours trying on countless gowns to find her perfect wedding dress. Instead, Abigail knew that she would be wearing a piece of family history; an exquisite dress that holds a story of love and tradition spanning five generations. The heirloom, first worn by Abigail's great-great-grandmother Mary Lowry Warren on December 11, 1895, in Buffalo, New York, has since been adorned by nine other brides in her family, each one adding their unique chapter to its tale. The well-traveled dress, which was never dry cleaned but only had its lace patched, found its way to bride number 6 in 1977, when Abigail's mother, Leslie, wore it on her wedding day. However, with time comes wear, and Leslie was afraid that the delicate gown was beyond repair, as it had developed numerous holes and acquired a brown hue. It appeared the gown's journey would end, but then, much like a fairy tale, a bridal designer was able to breathe new life into the dress. After receiving the fragile gown filled with holes, disintegrating sleeves, and browned satin, the designer spent over 200 hours meticulously restoring it to its former glory. The once-brown satin was transformed into a beautiful blush shade, and the disappearing sleeves were recreated, including the 80 hand-sewn pleated details. However, despite the incredible restoration, the dress remains delicate, and Abigail plans to slip it on after the ceremony to wear throughout the cocktail hour during her October 17 wedding in Perkasie, Pennsylvania. Honoring family tradition does not end with the dress for Abigail, though. She will also wear her great-grandmother's ring and a locket given to her grandmother by her grandfather. It is clear that the dress, much like the cherished memories and stories that each generation of brides shares, goes beyond its physical representation. Leslie aptly puts it, \\"It's not just the dress that's been handed down. It's the love.\\" As the time for Abigail to wear the storied gown approaches, the story of love and family connection the dress carries continues to grow. Interest in the gown remains strong, with a 12th bride already expressing her desire to carry on the tradition. One can only imagine the countless emotional, joy-filled moments the dress has borne witness to and the many more it will continue to inspire.

Track ovulation: Knowing your ovulation cycle may help you determine the best time to conceive a boy, as male sperm are believed to swim faster but do not survive as long as female sperm. Trying to conceive just before or during ovulation may increase the chances of male sperm reaching the egg first. 2. Adjust your diet: Some studies suggest that a diet high in potassium and sodium may increase the likelihood of conceiving a boy. Include potassium-rich foods such as bananas, potatoes, and spinach, and sodium-rich foods like cured meats and olives. 3. Sexual position: Some people believe that certain sexual positions, like those that allow for deeper penetration, can increase the chances of conceiving a boy. This is because male sperm may have an advantage under these conditions. 4. Maintain a healthy weight: Being at a healthy weight can generally improve fertility, so maintaining a balanced diet and exercise routine will help create optimal conditions for conception. 5. Manage stress: High stress levels may impact fertility, so finding ways to manage stress through exercise, meditation, or other relaxation techniques may help improve your chances of conceiving a baby boy.

While Tom and Maggie attend a high school football game, Jake is overheard by his babysitter, Debbie Kozac, as he speaks with Samantha. Debbie gets upset and snatches Jake, running off with him in the night. Meanwhile, Tom senses Jake is in danger and rushes home but finds him gone. Tom then sees strange flashes of red light that eventually leads him to the 'L' station where Debbie is speaking with her mother about Jake. When Tom and Maggie confront her, Debbie angrily questions them about her sister Samantha, explaining that she had an intellectual disability: having the mental capacity of an 8-year-old and thus a child's tendency to trust strangers. Tom denies knowing her to Debbie but admits to Maggie that she is the girl in his visions. Tom becomes obsessed with Samantha and begins probing members of the community about her disappearance. This attracts the attention of his landlord Harry Damon, Tom's friend, Frank McCarthy and their respective sons Kurt Damon and Adam McCarthy, who all dismiss Samantha as a runaway teen.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: total waste Product review: avoid at all costs. there's not one redeeming quality about a movie such as this one.not even the occasionally \\"so bad it's funny\\"...it is simply BAD.now you may still want to be a sucker (i'd rather use the term looser) and rent it anyway. your problem.judging from the other reviews, i'd say you've been amply warned... Answer:","completion":"The review presented would significantly decrease the chances of me buying the product. There are several reasons behind this conclusion, which can be broken down into smaller pieces for better understanding. 1. Strong negative language: The use of strong negative language such as \\"total waste,\\" \\"avoid at all costs,\\" and \\"not one redeeming quality\\" sends a clear message that the reviewer was highly dissatisfied with the product. Such language instantly creates a negative perception about the product, discouraging any potential buyers. 2. No positive aspects mentioned: Generally, a balanced review may highlight the good sides of a product alongside the bad ones. However, in this case, the reviewer explicitly states that there is 'not one redeeming quality' about the movie. This suggests that the product did not offer even minor enjoyment and failed on all fronts. 3. Disparaging other customers: The reviewer takes a strong stance against those who may still want to try the product despite the negative review by calling them 'suckers' or 'losers.' This further reiterates the gravity of the situation and the idea that trying the product would not be worth the time or money. 4. Agreement among other reviews: The reviewer mentions that other reviews echo their sentiment, which implies that the majority of people who have tried the product have found it to be undeserving of their time and money. Such a consensus makes it even less likely that the product would be worth purchasing or trying out. 5. No specific details: While the review lacks detailed information regarding the specific issues the reviewer experienced with the movie, the overall tone and strong negative language paint a clear picture of dissatisfaction. The lack of details might leave some room for doubt or make potential buyers curious to make up their mind independently. However, it is essential to weigh this factor against the already discussed negative elements conveyed in the review. In conclusion, the strongly negative review would considerably decrease the chances of me buying the product. The use of harsh language, absence of any positive aspects, disparaging remarks towards potential buyers, and the agreement among other reviewers collectively contribute to discouraging potential buyers from considering the product as a worthwhile investment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rheinmetall in Germany developed an automatic 20 mm in the 1920s and Oerlikon in Switzerland had acquired the patent to an automatic 20 mm gun designed in Germany during World War I. Germany introduced the rapid-fire 2 cm FlaK 30 and later in the decade it was redesigned by Mauser-Werke and became the 2 cm FlaK 38. Nevertheless, while 20 mm was better than a machine gun and mounted on a very small trailer made it easy to move, its effectiveness was limited. Germany therefore added a 3.7 cm. The first, the 3.7 cm FlaK 18 developed by Rheinmetall in the early 1930s, was basically an enlarged 2 cm FlaK 30. It was introduced in 1935 and production stopped the following year. A redesigned gun 3.7 cm FlaK 36 entered service in 1938, it too had a two-wheel carriage. However, by the mid-1930s the Luftwaffe realised that there was still a coverage gap between 3.7 cm and 8.8 cm guns. They started development of a 5 cm gun on a four-wheel carriage.

Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What will happen immediately after eating? Possible A: defecating, pooping, reduced, becoming full, gaining weight Why is \\"becoming full\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the context of the question The question asks about the immediate consequence of eating, and we are given a list of possible answers. Step 2: Analyze the given possible answers We have five possible answers: a. defecating b. pooping c. reduced d. becoming full e. gaining weight Step 3: Evaluate each possible answer against common sense a. Defecating: Defecating doesn't usually happen immediately after eating. It is a consequence, but it happens after the digestive process has taken place, which takes some time. b. Pooping: Pooping is a synonym for defecating, so the same reasoning as above applies. c. Reduced: It's unclear what \\"reduced\\" refers to in this context, but it is not an immediate consequence associated with eating in common sense. d. Becoming full: Becoming full is an immediate consequence of eating, as when we eat, our stomachs fill up with food. As more food is consumed, the sensation of fullness signals that we have eaten enough. This feeling of fullness is an indicator aligned with common sense that we have finished eating. e. Gaining weight: Gaining weight is also a consequence of eating, but it does not occur immediately. The body takes time to absorb the calories from food and convert them into stored energy (fat). So, this is not an immediate consequence of eating. Step 4: Choose the most appropriate answer Based on the evaluation of each possible answer, the one that aligns with human common sense the most is \\"becoming full.\\" Justification: Becoming full is an immediate and common consequence of eating, as it indicates that our bodies have received enough food to feel satisfied. Other possible answers either require additional clarification or do not occur immediately after eating."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He says that \\"chlorophyll is used for absorbing light energy by plants\\" and \\"sun emits light energy\\". So, what's the best answer to the question?","completion":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What allows plants to absorb energy from the sun?\\" is chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is a pigment found in the chloroplasts of plant cells, as well as in algae and some bacteria. It plays a crucial role in the process of photosynthesis, allowing plants to absorb and convert light energy from the sun into a usable form of energy. The sunlight that reaches Earth's surface consists of a wide spectrum of wavelengths, including visible light, which appears as different colors to the human eye. Within this visible light spectrum, chlorophyll primarily absorbs red and blue light, while reflecting green light. This is why most plants appear green to our eyes. When a plant absorbs light energy through chlorophyll, this energy isn't immediately usable by the plant. Instead, it needs to be converted into chemical energy through a series of reactions collectively known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). During the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll within the chloroplasts absorbs solar energy and uses it to power the production of energy-rich compounds like adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). These compounds serve as energy currency in the cell and are used in various processes, including the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, the energy stored in ATP and NADPH is used to produce the plant's main carbohydrate, glucose, through the conversion of carbon dioxide and water. Glucose can be used as an immediate energy source by the plant, stored for later use, or converted into other organic compounds like cellulose and starch. Ultimately, chlorophyll's role in absorbing light energy from the sun is essential to the process of photosynthesis. This process is of utmost importance not only to the life cycle of plants but also to the entire ecosystem, as it serves as the base process for energy flow in food chains and plays a critical role in the Earth's carbon cycle by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converting it into organic matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - having sex - disorientation - sickness - throwing up - snapchatting Explain why a human would choose \\"disorientation\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"disorientation\\" as the answer to the question because it directly relates to the impairing effects of alcohol on cognitive and motor functions. Drinking alcohol can lead to impaired judgment, slower reaction times, and reduced coordination, all of which are essential for safe driving. When a person is disoriented, they may have difficulty understanding their surroundings, processing information, and making appropriate decisions. This disorientation greatly increases the risk of a car crash as the individual may not be able to respond effectively to traffic signals, other vehicles, and changes in road conditions. The other options are not as directly related to the consequences of alcohol consumption and its effect on driving skills. While having sex, sickness, throwing up, and snapchatting can all potentially distract a driver or cause difficulty in operating a vehicle, they are not inherently caused by drinking alcohol. Disorientation, on the other hand, is a known effect of alcohol consumption and it has a direct and clear link to the increased risk of car crashes when a driver is under the influence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Getting to the right platform: People might be moving around trying to find the correct platform for their train, especially if they are unfamiliar with the station layout. 2. Meeting someone: It is possible that some people in the group could be waiting for friends or family members to arrive and are walking up and down the platform while waiting. 3. Killing time: Some people might be walking up and down the platform to pass the time until their train arrives or as a way to stretch their legs after sitting down for a long time. 4. Street performers or vendors: In some subway stations, there could be street performers or vendors attracting a crowd. People may be walking up and down to watch the performance or browse the goods being sold. 5. Looking for a particular exit or entrance: People might be moving around trying to locate the most convenient exit or entrance to meet their needs, such as an elevator, escalator, or stairway leading to a specific location above ground. 6. Sightseeing or exploration: Some people enjoy exploring the architecture, art, and history in subway stations, especially if the station has unique features or historical significance. They might walk around to take in these aspects. 7. Exercising: Occasionally, people might use subway stations as a place to exercise, typically walking or running along the platform, particularly when the subway station has long corridors with minimal obstructions. To draw a more accurate conclusion, we would need additional context or information to confirm the intentions of the people walking up and down the subway station. For instance, if there is an announcement about an arriving train, or if the people are checking the train timetable, we could more confidently conclude that they are waiting for a train."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Inflammatory mediators released by nonparenchymal inflammatory cells in the liver have been implicated in the progression of acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity. Among hepatic nonparenchymal inflammatory cells, we examined the role of the abundant natural killer (NK) cells and NK cells with T-cell receptors (NKT cells) in APAP-induced liver injury.', 'C57BL/6 mice were administered a toxic dose of APAP intraperitoneally to cause liver injury with or without depletion of NK and NKT cells by anti-NK1.1 monoclonal antibody (MAb). Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, liver histology, hepatic leukocyte accumulation, and cytokine/chemokine expression were assessed.', 'Compared with APAP-treated control mice, depletion of both NK and NKT cells by anti-NK1.1 significantly protected mice from APAP-induced liver injury, as evidenced by decreased serum ALT level, improved survival of mice, decreased hepatic necrosis, inhibition of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), Fas ligand (FasL), and chemokines including KC (Keratinocyte-derived chemokine); MIP-1 alpha (macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha); MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1); IP-10 (interferon-inducible protein); Mig (monokine induced by IFN-gamma) and decreased neutrophil accumulation in the liver. Hepatic NK and NKT cells were identified as the major source of IFN-gamma by intracellular cytokine staining. APAP induced much less liver injury in Fas-deficient (lpr) and FasL-deficient (gld) mice compared with that in wild-type mice.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: - A butterfly lays an egg - A larvae matures inside of the egg - The caterpillar hatches from the egg - The caterpillar eats and grows - The caterpillar spins a coccoon around itself and forms into a pupa - The butterfly forms inside of the coccoon - The mature butterfly emerges from the coccoon - The butterfly mates A:","completion":"The final step in the process after a butterfly mates is for the adult female butterfly to lay an egg, thus completing the life cycle of a butterfly and continuing on to the next generation. This process is called oviposition. During oviposition, the female butterfly selects an appropriate host plant, typically one that is a suitable food source for her offspring, and proceeds to lay her eggs on or near the plant. The selection of the appropriate plant is crucial, as the caterpillars that emerge from the eggs are highly specialized eaters that are only able to consume specific types of plants. Failure to lay the eggs on a compatible host plant can lead to the death of newborn caterpillars, as they starve due to a lack of food. The female butterfly uses a specialized organ, the ovipositor, to deposit her eggs on the selected host plant. Depending on the species, butterflies may lay their eggs individually or in clusters. The eggs exhibit a wide range of shapes, textures, and colors, which also vary across species and sometimes aid in camouflage against potential predators. Once the eggs are laid, the life cycle of a butterfly has come full circle. The new generation of eggs will develop within their protective shells, with larvae maturing inside, and the entire process will be repeated. This cycle is an essential aspect of the survival and perpetuation of butterfly species in the wild. With each successive generation, butterflies have the opportunity to pass on their genes and potentially adapt to their environment or develop new characteristics through genetic mutations. These evolutionary changes, driven by natural selection, work to ensure that butterfly populations remain healthy and vibrant in a constantly changing world. In this way, the final step of egg-laying provides not only a conclusion to the life cycle of an individual butterfly but also serves as a critical link to future generations, ensuring the continuation of these beautiful and ecologically important creatures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both of these individuals have been part of historic space missions during their respective careers, and they share a common professional interest in human spaceflight and exploration. Bertalan Farkas, born August 2, 1949, in Szeged, Hungary, is a retired Hungarian Air Force officer, pilot, and the first Hungarian national to venture into space. He flew to space as part of the Soyuz 36 mission organized by the Soviet Union's Intercosmos program. During this mission, Farkas was a research cosmonaut, performing various scientific experiments and tests. Launched on May 26, 1980, the Soyuz 36 crew spent 7 days and 20 hours in outer space, several of those days docked to the Salyut 6 space station. Farkas' spaceflight was an important moment in space history, as it represented Hungary's entrance into the global space community. Georgi Ivanov, born July 2, 1940, in Lovech, Bulgaria, is a retired Bulgarian Air Force officer, pilot, and the first Bulgarian national to travel into space. Ivanov was selected to be part of the Soyuz 33 mission, another joint spaceflight organized by the Soviet Union's Intercosmos program. Launched on April 10, 1979, Ivanov and his team spent 1 day and 23 hours in space. Though the mission experienced technical issues that prevented the spacecraft from docking with the Salyut 6 space station, Ivanov's voyage marked a significant milestone for Bulgaria, as it demonstrated the country's participation and importance within the international space community.

Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, I need to break it down into two parts: finding a country that is double landlocked and then determining if it has no Tachina lurida. Step 1: Identify double landlocked countries A double landlocked country is one that is not only landlocked but also surrounded by other landlocked countries. There are only two such countries in the world: Liechtenstein and Uzbekistan. Step 2: Research the presence of Tachina lurida Tachina lurida is a species of fly in the family Tachinidae, which is commonly found in North America and Europe. Since Uzbekistan is located in Central Asia, it is less likely to have Tachina lurida, while Liechtenstein, being in Europe, might have the species. Step 3: Confirm the absence of Tachina lurida After researching further, I could not find any evidence of the presence of Tachina lurida in Uzbekistan. Conclusion: Based on the information available, Uzbekistan is a double landlocked country and has no Tachina lurida. Answer: Uzbekistan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Both wrapping techniques have pros and cons, and the one you choose should be informed by your reason for wrapping the ankle. Take these factors into consideration when making your choice: Ace bandages are used to make compression wraps. They are made from stretchy fabric that many find to be comfortable against the skin. They are secured with metal fasteners, or you can buy adhesive wraps that use velcro or glue to keep the wrap in place. Ace bandages are conveniently reusable, so they're a good choice for people who need to wrap frequently. Athletes may find ace bandages to be cumbersome when worn during physical activity. They create a bulky padding around the ankle that can make it more difficult to run and jump. A wrap constructed from tape includes a bottom layer of underwrap, which protects the skin from getting pulled too much by the tape, and a layer of tape that is adhered to the underwrap in a pattern that supports the ankle. Tape is not reusable, so it can get expensive for people who need to wrap every time they perform a physical activity. The underwrap protects the skin somewhat, but a little pulling usually takes place. Tape feels lighter on the body, so many athletes prefer it to using an ace bandage when the wrap is intended to support the ankle during physical activity. Make sure the ankle and foot are clean and dry. Extend the leg and rest the ankle on a chair or bench to make the wrapping procedure easier. If tape will be used, it's advised to shave the hair from the bottom section of the leg and ankle. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article compares two ankle wrapping techniques: using Ace bandages and using tape. It highlights the pros and cons of each method, taking into consideration factors such as comfort, reusability, bulkiness, and cost. Ace bandages are stretchy, reusable, and comfortable, but can be bulky for athletes. Tape, on the other hand, is not reusable and can be expensive, but it feels lighter on the body and is often preferred by athletes for physical activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer. Question: What did Jimbob's mother do after the nursery called? === The answer to the above question is Options are: 1). not enough information 2). She told him to get along with the other kids more. 3). She picked him up 4). She scolded the nursery for not integrating him more.

A state news agency said the new deposits exist in \\"southern coastal areas\\" and triple Iran's estimated amount of raw uranium. The announcement comes after Western experts concluded that Iran, which has few uranium mines, had likely drained its native supply. But a former Israeli official says Iran is just trying to gain leverage before nuclear talks with US, Russia, France, Germany, and China starting Tuesday. \\"It seems that Iran is trying to raise the bidding price and to enter negotiations from a position of strength,\\" Danny Ayalon tells the Jerusalem Post. He called it \\"a negotiating pattern which is common in the Persian bazaar.\\" Iran said its upcoming power stations were for electricity only and conformed to international standards. Iran has also announced the installation of new centrifuges that enrich uranium faster at its site in Natanz—a move Washington called provocative. Expand this summary.","completion":"Iran found more raw-uranium deposits and plans to build 16 new nuclear power stations. These deposits are in the southern coastal areas and they make Iran have three times more raw uranium than before. This is important because some people thought Iran was running out of uranium. Uranium is a special rock that can be used to make electricity in nuclear power stations, but it can also be used to make very dangerous weapons called nuclear bombs. Iran says that it will only use the uranium to make electricity, but some countries are worried that they might be trying to make the dangerous weapons. Before they found these new deposits, Iran was going to talk with other countries like the US, Russia, France, Germany, and China about how they use nuclear power. Some people think that Iran is talking about the new uranium deposits and nuclear power stations to make the other countries think they have more power than they do. This way, they can get better deals in the talks. Iran has also put in new machines, called centrifuges, that can turn uranium into a special kind that is used in nuclear power stations and can also be used to make nuclear bombs. The US thinks this is not a friendly thing to do because it makes them worried that Iran might be trying to make dangerous weapons."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What artist's painting got funding for its restoration after it was feared it would soon be beyond repair? Etty had used experimental techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem made worse by the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff determined that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting would soon be beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore the surface of the painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas was added to the back of the painting, and the three layers were glued together.In 2006 the repaired painting was moved back from the conservation studios to the Manchester Art Gallery. The Gallery Nine section of the MAG was converted into a temporary studio, open to the public to watch the final retouching work until it was completed in 2010, and The Sirens and Ulysses currently hangs in Gallery Three.

Movie title: Mrs. Miniver Movie plot: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation. Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk. Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her... Answer:","completion":"The movie \\"Mrs. Miniver\\" does not provide specific details about where Vin and Carol had their honeymoon. This classic 1942 film, directed by William Wyler, is primarily focused on the experiences of the Miniver family as they live through the prelude and early years of World War II in England. While the romance between Vin and Carol is an important subplot, the movie places greater emphasis on the war's impact on the family and their community. Vin, the older son of Kay and Clem Miniver, meets Carol Beldon while he is back from Oxford University. The pair initially clashes over their divergent views on class differences and social responsibilities. However, they eventually fall in love and get engaged. Vin later joins the Royal Air Force as a fighter pilot, contributing to the war effort. The film's plot doesn't delve into the couple's honeymoon; rather, it highlights the various challenges and events that the Miniver family endures during the tumultuous period of the war. The story spans from the early days of the war, such as Clem's involvement in the Dunkirk evacuation, to the hardships experienced by the family and their community on the home front. In conclusion, \\"Mrs. Miniver\\" does not provide a specific location for Vin and Carol's honeymoon. The movie's main focus lies in the family's experiences and struggles during World War II, with the couple's romance serving as an important subplot that showcases the theme of love and unity during trying times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said.

Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte. Question: \\"How do the attorneys working with the program feel about it?\\" Answer: \\"They feel that they can use their language skills to help others\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Answer: Yes, this answer is correct. The paragraph mentions attorney Irene Mak, who is one of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program. She shares that despite earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases at NLS compared to her previous private law firm, the job is more satisfying due to her ability to use her language skills and give back to the Asian community. This indicates that attorneys working with the program feel a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment in using their language skills to assist others, particularly those in need within their community."},{"prompt":"Pick one category for the following text.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process. Environmental pollution can have various harmful effects on birds, making it harder for them to mate, reproduce, and survive. These effects can include changes in habitat, reduced food sources, and increased exposure to toxic substances like pesticides and heavy metals, which can weaken their immune systems and reproductive capacities. Although pollution may not directly alter the mating process (i.e., the physical act of mating), it can have indirect consequences on several steps in the life cycle of birds. For example, pollution can lead to a decrease in available nesting sites or suitable habitats, which may make it difficult for birds to find a mate or raise their offspring successfully. Pollutants may also accumulate in the tissues of birds and their prey, harming the health of both adult and young birds. This can negatively affect their ability to reproduce, grow, and survive. Furthermore, pollution can disrupt the natural balance of ecosystems, leading to a decline in the populations of insects and other small prey that birds rely on for food. As a result, birds may face increased competition for food resources, which can further stress their reproductive efforts. In conclusion, while environmental pollution may not directly impact a specific step in the mating process of birds, it can have significant indirect effects on multiple aspects of their life cycle, making it more difficult for them to mate, reproduce, and thrive in their natural habitats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Renegade Republicans who are trying to force a vote on immigration reform in the House of Representatives survived an attempt by leaders of their party to block their efforts. The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition. Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \\"futile\\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto. But it was House conservatives who defeated the 867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed. The House Freedom Caucus — a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House — had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow — it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive.

He has been hiding from the FBI for over thirty years, establishing an identity as a defense attorney near Albany, New York. When Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon), another former Weather Underground member, is arrested on October 3, 2011, an ambitious young reporter, Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf), smells an opportunity to make a name for himself with a national story. His prickly editor, Ray Fuller (Stanley Tucci), assigns him to follow up. Ben's ex-girlfriend, Diana (Anna Kendrick), is an FBI agent, and he presses her for information about the case.

Article: Though it may be tempting to pop a zit or pick at your acne, doing so can cause the skin to become even more inflamed and lead more acne as well as acne scars. Instead, make sure you wash the area well and apply skin care products that will work to treat and heal your acne. Never use any sharp tools on your skin, even if it is advertised as an acne removal tool. This can lead to permanent damage to your skin that can be difficult to treat or that will require more intense skin care treatments to heal. If you have a habit of resting your chin, cheek, or forehead in your hands, try to avoid doing this. If possible, try not to touch your face at all throughout the day. Your hands are carriers of bacteria and germs that may only make your acne worse if they end up on your face. As well, if you tend to have oily hair or if you have longer hair, keep it clean and away from your face. Oil from your hair can make your face and neck extra oily, leading to possible breakouts and acne in these areas. Avoid wearing baseball caps or hats throughout the day, as these can cause acne to develop on your hairline or your forehead. Wash your caps and hats often if you wear them on a daily basis so they do not carry any bacteria that can get onto your skin. Make sure your cell phone is clean, as you can get breakouts where your phone rests on your face. To make sure you are removing dead skin cells from your skin that can cause acne, you should wash your face twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. Use a cleansing product that contains salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or glycolic acid to treat your acne effectively. Avoid scrubbing your face hard with a washcloth when you clean your face. Instead, use your fingers to gently massage the product into your skin. If your skin is very sensitive, then wash with a gentle facial skin cleanser such as Cetaphil or Eucerin. You should also always wash your face after exercising or playing sports as oil buildup due to sweating can make your acne worse. If you are starting to grow facial hair, you may be tempted to start shaving. However, shaving can irritate acne-prone skin and lead to more breakouts. As well, you may end up nicking a pimple while shaving, which could cause inflammation. If you do need to shave, try to shave as lightly as possible on the surface of your skin to avoid irritating your acne. If you are using a safety razor when shaving, soften your facial hair with warm water and soap before you shave so you do not have to press too hard on your skin. Though your skin may appear better after a day out in the sun, in the long term, sunlight can actually make your acne worse and lead to sun damage on your face. As well, many acne products can make your skin more vulnerable to burning. Protect your skin by applying oil-free sunscreen before you go outside, even if it is not sunny outside. Many commercial acne products can dry out your skin, especially if your skin is still trying to get used to the ingredients in the product. To prevent dryness or chapped skin, use a moisturizer that is oil-free and noncomedogenic. This will ensure the moisturizer does not clog your pores or irritate your skin. Avoid using moisturizers that are heavy in oils, such as Vaseline and mineral oils. These products will only increase the buildup of oil and debris on your skin and make your acne worse. Ask your dermatologist to recommend an oil-free moisturizer, based on your skin type and the severity of your acne. What is a summary?","completion":"In summary, picking at or popping acne can worsen the inflammation and lead to scarring. To prevent acne, maintain good hygiene, avoid touching your face, and keep hair and personal items clean.

Given the background: Electromagnetic radiation is energy that travels in waves across space as well as through matter. Most of the electromagnetic radiation on Earth comes from the sun. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves are characterized by certain wavelengths and wave frequencies. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy. and the situation: David is experimenting with electromagnetic waves. He has four different waves to study, wave A, wave B, wave C, and wave D. In wave A, distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves is greater than that of wave B. In wave C, the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given time is greater than that of wave D. Answer the following question: Which wave has higher frequency, wave A or wave B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Wave B has a higher frequency than wave A. To understand why, let's analyze the given information and some principles of electromagnetic waves. According to the background provided, electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy. In other words, there is an inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency - as the wavelength decreases, frequency increases, and vice versa. Now, let's examine the details provided about the four waves David is studying: 1. Wave A - The distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves (i.e., wavelength) is greater than that of wave B. 2. Wave B - By comparison to wave A, wave B must have a shorter wavelength since the distance between corresponding points on adjacent waves is lesser. 3. Wave C and Wave D - These waves are relevant, as they provide information on the number of waves passing a fixed point in a given time, which is the definition of frequency. The question asks which wave has a higher frequency, wave A or wave B. Based on the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency, and since we know that wave A has a longer wavelength than wave B, we can conclude that wave B must have a higher frequency than wave A. This is because the shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency, and wave B has a shorter wavelength compared to wave A."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This being the summer of carnage in London theater – with hit productions of the vampire romance “Let the Right One In” and the torture-happy “1984” — you also know that before you can say “Drop that weapon,” these immaculate walls will be smeared with blood. Such were my first impressions on entering the Shed of the National Theater, the home to Polly Stenham’s “Hotel,” and for once my first impressions were correct. This anxiety-fueled allegory, which takes place in a luxury resort on a desert island, is an exercise in desecration, as a pale-skinned British family that stinks of privilege and entitlement is brought to its knees. That’s literally brought to its knees, all the better to be roughed up and mutilated. Ms. Stenham achieved fame at 19 with her first produced play, “That Face” (2007), a portrait of a mad monster mother and her damaged teenage progeny. Her second work, “Tusk Tusk” (2009), was a variation on the same theme. With “Hotel,” Ms. Stenham retains her signature dysfunctional clan of warped teenagers and warping parents, but expands the view around them, to reveal an entire dysfunctional world. That’s a lot of weight to place on one unhappy family, and “Hotel” buckles under the burden of topical baggage. Mummy (Hermione Gulliford) is a British cabinet minister for foreign affairs, who is angry with Daddy (Tom Beard) for derailing her career by sending pictures of his penis to a lusty online correspondent. They’re on this vacation with the kids, Ralph (Tom Rhys Harries) and Frankie (a defiantly sly Shannon Tarbet), to try to salvage their marriage. But the sins of the father ain’t nothing compared to the sins of the mother in her capacity as running-dog international treaty signer. And so the family is visited by an assortment of unwelcome guests who include one seriously angry hotel maid (the fiercely poised Susan Wokoma) and – wait for it – an army of Somali pirates. The word has been that “Hotel,” directed by Maria Aberg, is so intense and so graphic that some theatergoers have been fainting or bolting in terror. My audience, perhaps forewarned by publicity, seemed to take the torture and slaughter of this slickly mounted production in stride. I suspect, though, that there might have been some wincing at the ennobling references to Shakespeare’s “The Tempest” woven into the script. There’s blood on the floors at the Gate Theater, too, though in this case the blood is black and unmistakably ersatz. That’s because in “Idomeneus,” the German dramatist Roland Schimmelpfennig’s inventive deconstruction of a Greek myth, ink is spilled whenever its characters bite the Aegean dust. This they do in ways that include thorough evisceration. Whether such unseemly deaths ever befell Idomeneus, a Greek general who returns home to his native Crete from the Trojan War, or his unlucky kin is moot. We have only the word of a bunch of uncertain storytellers to go on. Embodied in this production by an ensemble of five, this group will be familiar to anyone with a passing acquaintance of Greek tragedy. They’re the men and women of the Chorus, those anonymous folks who can be found reliably kibitzing on the sidelines as big honchos like Oedipus and Electra pursue their majestic dooms. Mr. Schimmelpfennig (probably best known for his play “The Golden Dragon”) has placed them center stage, and by extension, he puts us up there with them. That affinity is given physical life in Ellen McDougall’s engaging, surprisingly easygoing production of “Idomeneus,” which has been translated from the German by David Tushingham. The members of the audience are invited to enter the theater by crawling through a hole in the wall, which is how the members of the chorus will subsequently make their entrance. Choruses, they’re just like us! The five performers (Alex Austin, Jon Foster, Mark Monero, Susie Trayling and Ony Uhiara) are as motley a lot as you might find in a city subway car. Of course they do have a bit of that well-enunciated, professionally charming persona that comes from years of acting classes and auditions. But otherwise they’re as goofy, self-conscious, nervous, sloppy and obsessive as we civilians are. They are also like us in that they really don’t know what truly happened in the epochal events that shaped their civilization. As they take turns recounting the legend of Idomeneus, and portraying the principal players in his story, they offer assorted alternate versions of what might have happened. This involves their getting wet and dirty, as they slide around Ana Ines Jabares Pita’s glassy, wine-dark sea of a set. The one thing our Chorus does know – as it considers the plight of the play’s title character, who was told by the gods to sacrifice his son in exchange for his own deliverance – is that the spoils of war include crippling guilt and the taint of inhuman behavior. This is not perhaps a surprising moral, but it is delivered with assured tentativeness by the ensemble here. Before the show began, a Gate employee warned the audience assembled in the theater’s minuscule lobby, “There will be haze, there will be strong language.” I was just relieved that she hadn’t said, “There will be blood.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article is a theater review discussing two different plays showing in London: Polly Stenham’s “Hotel” at the Shed of the National Theater, and Roland Schimmelpfennig’s “Idomeneus” at the Gate Theater. \\"Hotel\\" is an anxiety-fueled allegory that takes place in a luxury resort where a privileged British family experiences suffering.

Greg's grandma is a culinary expert. She is also very eager to teach others how to make great foods. One day she taught Greg how to make candied fruit. Greg was so excited about it that he bought two baskets of fruits, basket A and basket B, to make some candied fruits. He used the basket A fruits to make some candied fruits, but was too lazy to use the basket B fruits. He just kept the basket B fruits on his kitchen top. Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] A:","completion":"Basket A fruits will be preserved because they were used to make candied fruits, which undergo a process of preservation by being saturated with sugar in heated sugar syrup, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They were both from the House of Trastámara and were second cousins, being both descended from John I of Castile; on marriage they were given a papal dispensation to deal with consanguinity by Sixtus IV. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of Valladolid; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger; this marriage united both kingdoms under one crown. It is generally accepted by most scholars (John Elliott being an English-speaking example) that the unification of Spain can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella. Some newer historical opinions propose that under their rule, what later became Spain was still a union of two crowns rather than a unitary state, as to a large degree Castile and Aragon remained separate kingdoms, with most of their own separate institutions, for decades to come. The court of Ferdinand and Isabella was constantly on the move, in order to bolster local support for the crown from local feudal lords. - The New World is one of the names used for the Earth's Western Hemisphere, specifically the Americas (including nearby islands such as those of the Caribbean and Bermuda). - Genoese (\\"Zeneize\\") is a dialect of the Ligurian language spoken in Genoa (the principal city of the Liguria region in Northern Italy). - Bartholomew Columbus (Genoese dialect: Bertomê Corombo; ) (c. 1461 1515) was an Italian explorer from Genoa and the younger brother of Christopher Columbus. - Christopher Columbus ( 20 May 1506) was an Italian explorer, navigator, colonizer, and citizen of the Republic of Genoa. Under the auspices of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, he completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean. Those voyages and his efforts to establish permanent settlements on the island of Hispaniola initiated the European colonization of the New World. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Hispaniola (Spanish: \\"La Española\\"; Latin: \\"Hispaniola\\"; Taíno: \\"Haiti\\") is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles.

Since the 18th century, three scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during each specific phase. These quests are distinguished from earlier approaches because they rely on the historical method to study biblical narratives. While textual analysis of biblical sources had taken place for centuries, these quests introduced new methods and specific techniques to establish the historical validity of their conclusions. - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion. - John the Evangelist is the name traditionally given to the author of the Gospel of John. Christians have traditionally identified him with John the Apostle, John of Patmos, and John the Presbyter, though this has been disputed by modern scholars. - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. - John the Apostle ( Aramaic : Yohanan Shliha ; Hebrew : Yohanan Ben Zavdai ; Koine Greek : ; Latin : Ioannes ; c. AD 6 -- c. 106 ) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament . He was the son of Zebedee and Salome . His brother was James , who was another of the Twelve Apostles . Christian tradition holds that he outlived the remaining apostles and that he was the only one not to die a martyr 's death ( excluding Judas Iscariot who died by suicide ) . The Church Fathers considered him the same person as John the Evangelist , John of Patmos , and the Beloved Disciple , although modern theologians and scholars have not formed a consensus on the relative identities of these mean . The tradition of some Christian denominations holds that John the Apostle is the author of several books of the New Testament . - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions.

Family relationship is the inborn connection, which you can't avoid or choose at will. Love, for a student, is not always within our reach and as for friendship, personally, it's most important. Nowadays, it is common to see friendship in colleges or middle schools. What is difficult is how to deal with personal contacts between different sexes. The key is to know how to tell love from friendship. The term, friend, covers a much wider range of meanings. It can be a nodding acquaintance, a comrade, a confident , a partner, a playmate, a brother, etc. Everyone needs friendship. No one can sail the ocean of life single handed. We need help from, and also give help to, others. In the modern age, people attach more importance to relations and connections. Without stars, the night sky won't be so beautiful; without friendship, our life won't be meaningful. With friendship, life is happy and harmonious. So, friendship may be a quiet walk in the park with the one you trust if possible, while love is the company you are always feeling like keeping. And friendship is when someone gazes into your eyes, you feel only care and calm while love is when someone gazes into your eyes, you will not keep calm. Love is not a word spoken out easily. In a way, love is selfish, while friendship is selfless and extensive. Love is not necessarily to be returned. But friendship needs something in exchange. You can't wish \\"let there be love in our hearts\\", for love needs enough time to sow, to water and to take good care of and also needs a rosy, calm, relaxed, emotional and private atmosphere. With such heavy feelings of high pressure and nervousness, do you think the schoolyard the proper field for us middle school students to sow our love? In the writer's opinion, _ .

Let D = the actual distance traveled by the person at 8 km/h Let T = the time it took for him to travel that distance Step 2: Write an equation based on the given information. We know that distance = speed × time, so D = 8T (actual distance traveled) If the person walked at 12 km/h instead of 8 km/h, he would have traveled (D+20) km since he would have walked 20 km more. Hence, (D+20) = 12T. Step 3: Solve for the variable. To solve for the actual distance (D), we'll need to find the time (T) first. We can do this by equating the two expressions in terms of T: 8T = 12T - 20 We'll now solve for T: 4T = 20 T = 5 Now, we'll plug the value of T back into the equation D = 8T to find the actual distance: D = 8(5) D = 40 km Step 4: Pick the correct answer from the given options. The actual distance traveled by the person is 40 km. Answer: d) 40 km"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Kentucky Truck Assembly is one of two plants operated by Ford in Louisville, the other being the plant that opened on 180 acres in what year? A:","completion":"The Ford Louisville Assembly Plant, which is the second Ford plant in Louisville, was established on a 180-acre site in the year 1955. This manufacturing facility was built to expand Ford's production capacity and to serve the rapidly growing automotive market in the United States. Louisville is home to the Kentucky Truck Assembly and the Louisville Assembly Plant, both of which contribute to Ford's production of a wide range of vehicles. The Kentucky Truck Assembly, which primarily manufactures Ford's F-Series Super Duty trucks, Ford Expeditions, and Lincoln Navigators, was opened in 1969. Meanwhile, the Louisville Assembly Plant is known for the production of the Ford Escape and the Lincoln Corsair. In the decades since its opening, the Louisville Assembly Plant has undergone numerous transformations and expansions. This facility was initially used to manufacture the Ford Courier, a compact pickup truck that was first introduced in 1971. Over the years, various other vehicles have been produced at the plant, including the Ford Ranger, Ford Bronco II, and the Ford Explorer. The plant was also retooled in 2011 for the production of the Ford Escape, making it one of the most flexible automobile manufacturing facilities in the world. Since the Louisville Assembly Plant's initial opening in 1955, it has been an important contributor to the regional and national economy. In recent years, Ford has invested heavily in both of its Louisville plants, providing employment to thousands of people and contributing to the growth and development of the city. To summarize, the Louisville Assembly Plant, situated on a 180-acre site, was established in 1955 as the second Ford facility in Louisville, with the Kentucky Truck Assembly opening in 1969. Due to this, the Louisville Assembly Plant has a rich history and continues to play a vital role in the manufacturing capacity of the Ford Motor Company."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Team A learned about reptiles, while Team B studied more about amphibians. But I can use this background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

California lags far behind comparable states in funding legal services for the poor, a situation so dire that only 28 percent of the civil legal needs of the state's poor and lowerincome residents are being addressed. That figures translates into 2 million people without the ability to access the justice system, according to a new study by the California Commission on Access to Justice, which also found that despite increased spending, the gap between need and services remains substantial. \\"As a practical matter, in most cases there can be no access to justice without access to legal assistance,\\" said Jack Londen, past commission chair and a partner with Morrison & Foerster in San Francisco. \\"Whether we like it or not, sometimes landlords illegally evict tenants, children with disabilities are denied proper care, veterans don't get services guaranteed to them, and elderly people need legal assistance to escape the abuse of a caregiver.\\" California has the highest number of people in poverty in the nation - 6.4 million, including nearly one in five children. Half the nation's increase in poverty in the 1990s, when the number of poor jumped 30 percent, occurred in California, and nearly 25 percent of the nation's poverty increase occurred in Los Angeles County alone. Even those with jobs are suffering: 26 percent of California workers earn poverty level wages. The commission's report, \\"The Path to Equal Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" examined how the legal needs of the state's poor have changed in the last five years as well as both the shortcomings of the justice system and the improvements during that period. Despite increases in state funding to meet the legal needs of the poor, low interest rates (which have reduced the IOLTA fund), high unemployment and the present economic downturn have threatened any gains.

It's basically one messy heap of different genres, of which none really works out like it was supposed to. This movie is an attempt by Mickey Rooney to be taken more serious as an actor. He's a former child-star who always used to star in in happy comical- and musical productions at the start of his career. In this movie he picks a different approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the movie). But his role is actually quite laughable within the movie. I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player? He's an extremely small boyish looking man. He actually was in his 30's already at the time of this movie but he seriously looks more like a 16 year old. Hearing him say babe to women and hearing talking tough to gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he is just doesn't look and feel right. He simply isn't convincing in his role. Because the movie mixes so many different genres, the story also really feels as a messy one. Somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot-line and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all. It just isn't an interesting or compelling movie to watch. László Kardos is also a director who has done only 10 movies in his lifetime, despite the fact that his career span from 1935 till 1957. He must have been a struggling director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with. His movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high quality. Let's also not forget that this is a '50's movie but yet it more feels like a '40's one or perhaps even as one from the '30's. This is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black & white. Generally speaking black & white movies from the '50's often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exception. It's a rather strange sight seeing Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence. It wasn't the only movie Armstrong appeared in though and he would often pop up in these type of movies, often simply as himself. I guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music, since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What month and year were the surviving crew members of the brigantine formerly used as a whaler rescued? The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued.

Background: Kennedy was born in Inverness, the son of Mary and Ian. He was brought up as a Roman Catholic, and was educated at Lochaber High School in Fort William. He went on to study for a Master of Arts degree in Politics and Philosophy at the University of Glasgow. At university he became politically active, joining the SDP, as well as the Dialectic Society. Context: On 6 January 2006 Kennedy was informed that ITN would be reporting that he had received treatment for a drinking problem. He decided to pre-empt the broadcast, called a sudden news conference, and made a personal statement that over the past eighteen months he had been coming to terms with a drinking problem, but had sought professional help. He told reporters that recent questions among his colleagues about his suitability as leader were partly as a result of the drinking problem but stated that he had been dry for the past two months and would be calling a leadership contest, in which he would stand, to resolve the issues surrounding his authority once and for all. It was later claimed that the source for ITN's story was his former press secretary turned ITV News correspondent, Daisy McAndrew. The admission of a drinking problem seriously damaged his standing and 25 MPs signed a statement urging him to resign immediately. It was later claimed in a biography of Kennedy by the journalist Greg Hurst that senior Liberal Democrats had known about Kennedy's drinking problem when he was elected as leader in 1999 and had subsequently kept it hidden from the public. On 7 January 2006, Kennedy called another press conference, at which he announced that while he was buoyed by the supportive messages he had received from grass root members, he felt that he could not continue as leader because of the lack of confidence from the Parliamentary party. He said he would not be a candidate in the leadership election and was standing down as leader \\"with immediate effect\\", with Menzies Campbell to act as interim leader until a new leader was elected. He also confirmed in his resignation statement that he did not expect to remain on the Liberal Democrat Frontbench Team. He pledged his loyalty to a new leader as a backbencher, and said he wished to remain active in the party and in politics. Campbell went on to win the resulting leadership election, and Kennedy subsequently gave his successor full public support. His leadership had lasted slightly less than six years and five months.

After being sweet talked by Griffin, she has sex with him. The girl requests \\"hygiene books\\" from her mother Sarah Blake; however, the mother refuses because the girl is not yet married. The girl later learns from her father Dan Blake that the pilot has died in a crash. She tears up a letter she had been writing to him, and lowers her head as the film fades into intermission. The film resumes at the point when the girl discovers that her clothes no longer fit, sending her into a state of despair. She takes advice from her teacher, Carl Blackburn, who had previously been fired for teaching sex education. Blackburn blames her mother for the problem, and accuses her of \\"neglect[ing] the sacred duty of telling their children the real truth.\\" Only then is the girl able to confront her mother.The film then presents reels and charts that include graphic images of the female anatomy and footage of live births – one natural and one Caesarian. In some screenings, a second film was shown along with Mom and Dad, and contained images portraying syphilis and venereal disease.

TEXT:Before I start, let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing, which I gather from other comments was the original one which is considered inferior by some. So, it is entirely possible that subtitles or the apparently new DVD version would make a difference. I have also not read the corresponding book; I'm only familiar with one other Japanese manga and might be lacking cultural context. Potential minor spoilers ahead. I usually like darkly tinged science fiction stories (the likes of Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), but I did not enjoy this movie at all. While it started out mildly intriguing, it became tedious by the time it was only half-way finished. There are all sorts of problems; let's start with what is probably the most severe: the dialogue. The characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences; if they aren't shouting each other's names for the n-th time, they are usually grunting monosyllables (\\"Kanedaaa!\\", \\"Tetsuoooo!\\", \\"Huh?\\", \\"Grrr\\", etc.). This leaves most of the characters entirely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. It doesn't help in the least that a lot of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals. The grunting is augmented by some random pseudo-philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by Star Trek standards. There is nothing deep and meaningful here - it all seems haphazard, thrown together at random from various bits and pieces of stock sci-fi ideas with no coherency whatsoever. What little there is of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence which consists of escalating scenes of mayhem and destruction. Not that there's anything wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruction, of course; but in this case you'll find yourself asking \\"what's the point of it all, and how long until it's over\\". Character development in the last 30 minutes or so consists of little more than Tetsuo turning into Pizza the Hutt for no readily apparent reason. The ending resembles the one in 2001 - a bizarre string of images that, far from resolving or explaining anything, leave the viewer feeling he's just been looking into a kaleidoscope for two hours. I'm sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art; but to me it was just a lot of admittedly imaginative use of colour and shapes. (Some of the music was also quite interesting). Unfortunately it's all style and no substance. Tired of Disney? Want to watch animated movies dealing intelligently with \\"adult\\" themes?

Write an article using the following points: As Egypt's finance minister, Youssef Boutros Ghali has pushed for reform. Egypt's economy grew 7.1 percent in 2007, inflation still a concern. World Bank: 17 percent of Egyptian population living in poverty. Ghali: \\"We know that they deserve some of the fruits of the reform\\"","completion":"Title: Youssef Boutros Ghali and His Influence on Egypt's Sustainable Economic Development Youssef Boutros Ghali, as Egypt's finance minister, is globally acknowledged for his insightful political prowess and determined push for economic reform within Egypt, a pivotal nation in Middle-Eastern Africa. A cornerstone of his tenure as finance minister was his consistent advocacy for comprehensive financial adjustment, economic moderation, and state inclusivity. The year 2007 was a landmark for Egypt's economy under Ghali's leadership as it saw a significant growth of 7.1 percent. This growth rate was in part due to Ghali's robust fiscal policies that focused on privatization, a push for foreign investment, and the promotion of sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and construction. These sectors, in particular, have been pivotal drivers of Egypt's economy, providing significant contributions to national GDP and creating more jobs. However, an enduring concern during Ghali's term and beyond was the nation's pervasive inflation challenges. Despite the robust growth, inflation continued to remain high, driving up the cost of commodities and thereby aggravating the economic difficulties faced by the majority of ordinary Egyptians. Ghali, acutely aware of this issue, promoted policies designed to increase economic stability, but he was hard-pressed to find an immediate solution to Egypt's deeply entwined inflation problem. On a broader level, data from the World Bank elucidated a somewhat grim picture, showing that 17 percent of the Egyptian population was living below the poverty line. This added a new dimension to the economic dialog in Egypt, inferring persistent economic disparities and announcing a call to action to ensure equal distribution of wealth. Ghali was also committed to addressing the issue of poverty in Egypt. His quote, \\"We know that they deserve some of the fruits of the reform,\\" sheds light on his approach to reform – one that aimed to be inclusive and beneficial to all Egyptians, especially those afflicted by poverty. His policies often encapsulated this sentiment as he sought to create more comfortable living standards for the less fortunate while fostering a more resilient and sustainable socio-economic environment. In a bid to address the economic dilemma, Ghali worked hard to balance fiscal responsibility and growth with social spending. He sought to engineer economic reforms that could help bridge the gap between the affluent and those less fortunate, aiming to uplift those in the lower strata of society. Though the robust growth and inflation mitigation were significant parts of Ghali's agenda, so too was the quest for equitable wealth distribution. His commitment was towards not merely gross economic advancement, but fair and inclusive progress that witnessed all Egyptians reaping the benefits of economic reform. Youssef Boutros Ghali's tenure as a finance minister was one marked by assertive economic growth juxtaposed with harsh socio-economic realities like inflation and poverty. However, his commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth was a torchbearer for progressive socio-economic policies and reforms in Egypt. His efforts have been an exemplification of targeted financial leadership amid complex dynamics, socio-economic challenges, and shifts in global relations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:I read this background article the other day: The stronger of two acids will have a higher Ka than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton.

Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not \\"breed\\" their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of houseborn slaves appears to have been rather large in Ptolemaic Egypt and in manumission inscriptions at Delphi. Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of African slaves in the American South on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply.Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that \\"…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.\\" The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.Houseborn slaves (oikogeneis) often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were \\"pedagogues\\" in the first sense of the term. Some of them were the offspring of the master of the house, but in most cities, notably Athens, a child inherited the status of its mother.

Among the topics we address in our course is the retention of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves.

Read this: Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (AGG) was developed from the Finnish \\"naisvoimistelu\\". It differs from Rhythmic Gymnastics in that body movement is large and continuous and teams are larger' Athletes do not use apparatus in international AGG competitions compared to Rhythmic Gymnastics where ball, ribbon, hoop and clubs are used on the floor area. The sport requires physical qualities such as flexibility, balance, speed, strength, coordination and sense of rhythm where movements of the body are emphasized through the flow, expression and aesthetic appeal. A good performance is characterized by uniformity and simultaneity. The competition program consists of versatile and varied body movements, such as body waves, swings, balances, pivots, jumps and leaps, dance steps, and lifts. The International Federation of Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (IFAGG) was established in 2003.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: This type of x-ray is called a hysterosalpingography, and most doctors recommend you have one before you are artificially inseminated. The purpose of the test is to make sure you have at least one functioning fallopian tube. Before the test, a technician will use a speculum in your vagina and then will clean out your cervix. He or she will next inject a dye into your cervix with a catheter. An x-ray is then taken with the dye in your uterus and fallopian tubes. If your tubes are open, then dye can be seen spilling out of them on the x-ray. Basically, the procedure will feel much like a pap smear. If you have abnormal results, you may need to get treatment before proceeding with insemination. It's possible you may not be able to go through with insemination at all, but your doctor will discuss your options with you. Some possible complications this test might show include obstructed fallopian tubes, scarring, polyps or tumors, intrauterine adhesion, or a development disorder in your uterus or fallopian tubes. On a positive note, the results might be normal, as well. While not all locations require this step, you may need to have tests done for sexually transmitted diseases before being inseminated. In addition, if your partner is providing sperm, he will need to be tested too. Tests can take up to a week to come back, so you'll need to do this well in advance of your insemination appointment. As you will need to be tested for a wide range of diseases, you will likely need to provide a urine sample, as well as have a swab test done of your genital area. In addition, you'll likely need a blood test. Some people choose to try insemination the first time without the addition of fertility drugs, especially if they're having normal periods. Others choose to go ahead and try fertility drugs. One of the main fertility drugs, clomiphene citrate (Clomid), works to help you release eggs when you ovulate. This drug is mainly for women who are having trouble releasing eggs at all. For example, women with PCOS often have this problem. This drug is usually taken starting at day 3 or 5 of your period, for 5 days in a row. Day 1 of your period is when first bleed. If you don't have regular periods, you may be given a drug to start your period. One consideration is that fertility drugs increase your chances of having more than one baby at once, which makes your pregnancy more dangerous. The risk of multiples with Clomid is 7%, while it is only 1% when trying to conceive without medication. Talk to your doctor about whether this drug is an appropriate choice for you. Summary:","completion":"A hysterosalpingography is a special x-ray test that doctors suggest before doing a process called artificial insemination. This test helps to see if your fallopian tubes work well. A doctor puts a dye into your cervix and then takes an x-ray to see how the dye moves. It helps find any blockages or other issues. Sometimes, you and your partner need to get tested for illnesses too. The tests can take some time, so it's important to plan ahead. Some people may need special medicines called fertility drugs to help release eggs and improve chances of having a baby. But, these drugs may increase the chances of having more than one baby at once, which can be risky. You should talk to your doctor about what is best for you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (lead guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music. On 25 and 26 April, May and Taylor appeared on the eleventh series of American Idol at the Nokia Theatre, Los Angeles, performing a Queen medley with the six finalists on the first show, and the following day performed \\"Somebody to Love\\" with the 'Queen Extravaganza' band. Queen were scheduled to headline Sonisphere at Knebworth on 7 July 2012 with Adam Lambert before the festival was cancelled. Queen's final concert with Freddie Mercury was in Knebworth in 1986. Brian May commented, \\"It's a worthy challenge for us, and I'm sure Adam would meet with Freddie's approval.\\" Queen expressed disappointment at the cancellation and released a statement to the effect that they were looking to find another venue. Queen + Adam Lambert played two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo, London on 11 and 12 July 2012. Both shows sold out within 24 hours of tickets going on open sale. A third London date was scheduled for 14 July. On 30 June, Queen + Lambert performed in Kiev, Ukraine at a joint concert with Elton John for the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation. Queen also performed with Lambert on 3 July 2012 at Moscow's Olympic Stadium, and on 7 July 2012 at the Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw, Poland. On 12 August 2012, Queen performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The performance at London's Olympic Stadium opened with a special remastered video clip of Mercury on stage performing his call and response routine during their 1986 concert at Wembley Stadium. Following this, May performed part of the \\"Brighton Rock\\" solo before being joined by Taylor and solo artist Jessie J for a performance of \\"We Will Rock You\\". On 20 September 2013, Queen + Adam Lambert performed at the iHeartRadio Music Festival at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. Queen + Adam Lambert toured North America in Summer 2014 and Australia and New Zealand in August/September 2014. In an interview with Rolling Stone, May and Taylor said that although the tour with Lambert is a limited thing, they are open to him becoming an official member, and cutting new material with him. In November 2014 Queen released a new album Queen Forever. The album is largely a compilation of previously-released material but features three new Queen tracks featuring vocals from Mercury with backing added by the surviving members of Queen. One new track, \\"There Must Be More To Life Than This\\", is a duet between Mercury and Michael Jackson. In 2016, the group embarked across Europe and Asia on the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour. This included closing the Isle of Wight Festival in England on 12 June where they performed \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" as a tribute to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida earlier that day. On 12 September they performed at the Park Hayarkon in Tel-Aviv, Israel for the first time in front of 58,000 people. As part of the Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2017-2018, the band toured North America in the summer of 2017, toured Europe in late 2017, before playing dates in Australia and New Zealand in February and March 2018.

Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you clean the fan blades efficiently. Tools and materials: 1. Ladder or step stool (if needed) 2. Screwdriver (if needed) 3. Soft microfiber cloth or duster 4. Vacuum cleaner (with brush attachment, if available) 5. Warm water 6. Mild dish soap 7. Bucket or container 8. Protective gloves and mask (optional) Process: 1. Preparation: Before you begin cleaning the fan blades, turn off and unplug the fan to ensure safety. Make sure the fan is stable and, if it’s a ceiling fan, set it on the highest setting to stop it from rotating. For added safety, you might want to wear gloves and a mask, especially if dust accumulation is significant. 2. Access: If cleaning a ceiling fan, set up a step stool or ladder to safely reach the blades. Be sure the step stool or ladder is stable and always maintain proper balance while working. 3. Removal of the fan blades or grille (optional): For some fans, such as pedestal fans, it may be easier to clean the blades by detaching them. If you choose to do so, follow the manufacturer's instructions for removing the grille or fan blades. Use caution and ensure you do not damage the surrounding components. 4. Dusting: Start by using a microfiber cloth or duster to remove loose dust from the blades. If you have a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment, you can use it to help remove the dust. Carefully vacuum or wipe each blade, making sure to remove as much dust as possible from both sides of the blades. 5. Cleaning solution: In a bucket or container, prepare a mixture of warm water and mild dish soap. Be sure not to use harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they may damage the fan blades. 6. Washing: Soak a soft microfiber cloth in the cleaning solution and wring it out to remove excess water. Gently clean each blade by wiping along the surface, focusing on areas with accumulated dirt or grime. Make sure to clean both sides of each blade. You may need to rinse the cloth in the soapy water and wring it out multiple times as you work. 7. Rinsing: Using a clean, damp cloth with no soap, wipe down the blades to remove any remaining soap residue. 8. Drying: Before reassembling the fan or turning it on, thoroughly dry each fan blade with a clean, dry microfiber cloth to prevent any potential damage from moisture. 9. Reassembling: If you removed the fan blades or grille, carefully reattach them following the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure all components are securely in place. 10. Final step: Once the fan blades are completely dry, plug the fan back in and turn it on to check for proper operation. If the fan is working correctly, your cleaning process is complete.

President James Dale along with his aides addresses the United States concerning the historic event. The President's science aides set up a first contact meeting with the Martians in Pahrump, Nevada as President Dale watches the development on TV with his wife Marsha and his daughter Taffy. Using a translator, the Ambassador of Mars announces that they \\"come in peace\\". When a hippie releases a dove as a symbol of peace, the Ambassador shoots it, then he and the other Martians slaughter a large number of people at the event including General Casey, news reporter Jason Stone, and Billy-Glenn Norris before capturing chat show host Nathalie Lake and her pet Chihuahua Poppy whose heads they later transpose back on one of their flying saucers. Thinking that the Martians assumed that the dove was a symbol of war, President Dale tells Professor Donald Kessler to renegotiate with the Martians, whose ambassador is invited to address the United States Congress. At this meeting, the Martians massacre most of Congress. Donald begs the Martian Ambassador to stop, but is rendered unconscious and taken aboard their ship where he is later shown with his body parts dismembered and his disembodied head remaining animated.

Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Warehouse 13 is an American science fiction television series that premiered on July 7, 2009, on the Syfy network. - NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group, formerly NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment & Cable Studios, is the division of NBCUniversal that oversees all of the conglomerate's cable television channels. - The WB Television Network (commonly shortened to The WB and short for Warner Bros.) was an American television network that was first launched on broadcast television on January 11, 1995 as a joint venture between the Warner Bros.

Question: \\"What does dukkha explain: Anxiety or Conceptual?\\" Context: \\"The teachings on the Four Noble Truths are regarded as central to the teachings of Buddhism, and are said to provide a conceptual framework for Buddhist thought. These four truths explain the nature of dukkha (suffering, anxiety, unsatisfactoriness), its causes, and how it can be overcome. The four truths are:[note 4]\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Dukkha, as one of the central concepts in the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism, explains a variety of experiences that can be characterized as suffering, anxiety, or unsatisfactoriness. To fully understand and appreciate the scope of dukkha, it is essential to delve into both its anxiety-related aspects and the conceptual aspects that form the foundation of Buddhist thought. In the context of anxiety, dukkha primarily refers to the psychological and emotional manifestations of suffering or unease. People experience anxiety or stress in various life situations, such as when dealing with uncertainty, managing interpersonal conflicts, or facing challenging events. According to Buddhism, this anxiety arises from our inherent desire for pleasure and attachment to material or immaterial things. These desires and attachments can lead to a cycle of craving and suffering, which perpetuates the experience of anxiety. At a deeper level, dukkha is not limited to anxiety alone, but is understood as a more comprehensive and profound aspect of life. Buddhism teaches that all phenomena, whether mental or physical, are subject to the three marks of existence: impermanence (anicca), unsatisfactoriness (dukkha), and non-self (anatta). Thus, dukkha is not only applicable to the explicit suffering people may feel but also permeates all existence, reflecting the impermanent, insubstantial, and ultimately unsatisfactory nature of reality. The conceptual aspects of dukkha relate to understanding the causes and conditions that give rise to suffering. The second of the Four Noble Truths, the truth of the cause of dukkha (samudaya), identifies craving (tanha) and ignorance (avijja) as the root causes of suffering. Craving refers to our attachment to pleasant experiences, our aversion to unpleasant experiences, and the constant desire for a permanent sense of identity. Ignorance, on the other hand, involves a lack of understanding and recognition of the three marks of existence – impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and non-self. Buddhism offers a path to alleviate dukkha, which is the third of the Four Noble Truths, the truth of the end of dukkha (nirodha). This path involves the cessation of craving and the increase of wisdom. By letting go of attachments, expectations, and rigid views of the self, one can gradually move towards a state of equanimity, peace, and liberation from suffering. The fourth of the Four Noble Truths, the truth of the path leading to the end of dukkha (magga), presents the practical steps to achieve this liberation. Known as the Noble Eightfold Path, it consists of eight interrelated components: right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. By practicing these components, one can cultivate the qualities of wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental discipline, which align with the ultimate goal of Buddhism – cessation of dukkha and attaining enlightenment. In conclusion, dukkha encompasses both the experience of anxiety and the broader conceptual framework that underlies Buddhist thought. Suffering, anxiety, and unsatisfactoriness are integral aspects of human life. By understanding the causes of dukkha and following the Eightfold Path, one can work towards overcoming these afflictions and attaining liberation from suffering. Thus, dukkha is vital to Buddhism, as it explains the problem that the teachings aim to address and the fundamental nature of the human experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who dispatched a force with Odo in tow? from the following article ? It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were...

Information: - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. - X-radiation (composed of X-rays) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10 Hz to 3×10 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning Röntgen radiation, after the German (German-Dutch to be precise) scientist Wilhelm Röntgen, who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it \\"X-radiation\\" to signify an unknown type of radiation. Spelling of \\"X-ray(s)\\" in the English language includes the variants \\"x-ray(s)\\", \\"xray(s)\\", and \\"X ray(s)\\". - A brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is defined as the brightest galaxy in a cluster of galaxies. BCGs include the most massive galaxies in the universe. They are generally elliptical galaxies which lie close to the geometric and kinematical center of their host galaxy cluster, hence at the bottom of the cluster potential well. They are also generally coincident with the peak of the cluster X-ray emission. - A light-year is a unit of length used to express astronomical distances. It is about 9 trillion kilometres or 6 trillion miles. As defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a light-year is the distance that light travels in vacuum in one Julian year (365.25 days). Because it includes the word \\"year\\", the term light-year is sometimes misinterpreted as a unit of time. - A potential well is the region surrounding a local minimum of potential energy. Energy captured in a potential well is unable to convert to another type of energy (kinetic energy in the case of a gravitational potential well) because it is captured in the local minimum of a potential well. Therefore, a body may not proceed to the global minimum of potential energy, as it would naturally tend to due to entropy. - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown. - IC 1101 is a supergiant elliptical galaxy at the center of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster, approximately 320 megaparsecs (1.04 billion light-years) from Earth. - A galaxy cluster, or cluster of galaxies, is a structure that consists of anywhere from hundreds to thousands of galaxies that are bound together by gravity with typical masses ranging from 1010 solar masses. They are the largest known gravitationally bound structures in the universe and were believed to be the largest known structures in the universe until the 1980s, when superclusters were discovered. One of the key features of clusters is the intracluster medium (ICM). The ICM consists of heated gas between the galaxies and has a peak temperature between 215 keV that is dependent on the total mass of the cluster. Galaxy clusters should not be confused with star clusters, such as open clusters, which are structures of stars \\"within\\" galaxies, or with globular clusters, which typically orbit galaxies. Small aggregates of galaxies are referred to as groups of galaxies rather than clusters of galaxies. The groups and clusters can themselves cluster together to form superclusters. - An elliptical galaxy is a type of galaxy having an approximately ellipsoidal shape and a smooth, nearly featureless brightness profile. Unlike flat spiral galaxies with organization and structure, they are more three-dimensional, without much structure, and their stars are in somewhat random orbits around the center. They are one of the three main classes of galaxy originally described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work \\"The Realm of the Nebulae\\", along with spiral and lenticular galaxies. Elliptical galaxies range in shape from nearly spherical to highly flat and in size from tens of millions to over one hundred trillion stars. Originally Edwin Hubble hypothesized that elliptical galaxies evolved into spiral galaxies, which was later discovered to be false. Stars found inside of elliptical galaxies are much older than stars found in spiral galaxies. - Abell 2029 or A2029 is a large cluster of galaxies 315 megaparsecs ( 1,027 million light - years ) away in the constellation Virgo . A2029 is a Bautz - Morgan classification type I cluster due to its large central galaxy , IC 1101 .

The Golden State Warriors had a record-breaking 2015-2016 season, finishing their regular season with an unprecedented 73-9 win-loss record. This surpassed the previous record set by the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls, who had finished their regular season with 72-10, a record that had stood for 20 years. The Warriors, led by their point guard Stephen Curry, had been the dominant force throughout the season. Curry himself also had an extraordinary season, becoming the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) that year. Supporting Curry were other key players like Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala, creating what came to be known as the \\"Splash Brothers\\" era. Their efficient ball movement, 3-point shooting accuracy, and strong defense were pivotal factors in achieving this historic record. It is essential to note, however, that this record is strictly about regular season and doesn't account for playoffs performance. Despite setting the regular season record, the Golden State Warriors did not win the NBA Championship that year. They advanced to the NBA Finals but lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games, denying them what could have been the perfect end to their historic season. In contrast, the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls, led by the legendary Michael Jordan, not only had a near-perfect regular season record, but they also won the NBA Championship, giving them what many consider to be the best overall single-season performance in NBA history. Turning our attention to playoff records, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics both share the record for the most NBA Championship titles, each having won the prestigious Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy 17 times (as of 2021). In conclusion, while the Golden State Warriors hold the best regular-season record in NBA history, the debate about the best overall team performance in a season, considering both regular and post-season records, potentially brings other teams into the consideration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It'd been my last film in a long, long day halfway through the festival. Maybe I'd dozed. The better a film is the more likely it triggers daydreams that send me really dreaming. Don't know. Did know there was an O'Henry twist achingly just beyond my ken as things finished. And knew it had to do with the heart, hence the quietly hilarious talent search. My plot-loss remark had more to do with intricacies of Trebor's connections in France, his relation to the dog woman and so on, stuff I'd been wide awake for. Denis barely glances at details that might have anchored another director's treatment. But I write these things too often from memory, especially festival films, films whose DVD I don't have at hand (Le Lait de la tendresse humaine is one of many examples.), and plot kinks fade much more quickly than broader impressions. Still, or already, L'Inrus in my memory is beyond all else a character study of a sort of dark-side superman, a super fiend not ensconced in genre or historical trappings but active and plausible, relatively soft-spoken, driven but patient, right among us. The scar, once he attains it, makes him, just visually I mean, in image, a sort of hybrid Frankenstein monster, mad doctor and creation all in one. The actual doctors are his tools. If he doesn't extract and install the heart himself, it's only because it's not possible. He's the force, always, the parasite consuming everyone he touches and finally himself. What else is he? To suggest that he's us, the First World versus the Third, seems too simple since he feeds no less on his fellow First Worlders, on all of us. Denis's camera's eye - when it looks at things I know - goes usually where mine would, so I tend to trust her when she looks at things I don't know. Snow trekking, too-fast bicycling, and forest darkness I've known in small ways, but the South Seas not at all, so I made better entry into L'Intrus, both France and the crystalline isles of its finish, than into Beau Travail. L'Intrus is, for me, a very comfortable discomforting film. It's a sequence of places portrayed familiarly, with a intimacy that allows us to know them whether we've seen the reality or not. A single image, Trebor cycling, his massive weight on the thin racing frame, the sounds of violated air and shrieking tires, the asphalt ribbon, the dark-in-bright-sun evergreens, cued me that the film would be linear, a road trip, a single will-driven thrust. Despite Trebor's personal power, he's a human failure. No matter who he's with, he's alone, though apparently he hasn't always been. His body aborts life twice, first to need the new heart, then despite it. L'Intrus is tragedy. Trebor is hubris. I'm navigating perilously the thread of what I remember. Let's leave it at that.

Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

The pig should be centered and suspended roughly 1-2 feet (.30-.60m) above the coals. Any closer and the heat may cause the skin to scorch. Make sure the spit doesn’t slide or move around after it’s been mounted. Make sure you have help getting the pig positioned over the coals. They can be heavy! Let the pig cook at a moderate distance from the coals. One helpful guideline to keep in mind is that the pig should cook one hour for every ten pounds of its weight; for a pig of average size, 75-100 pounds (34-45kg), this means 4-6 hours on each side. Sit back and enjoy a cold beverage in the meantime! At the halfway point, turn the pig over to begin cooking the opposite side. Remember to keep the pit hot by adding more wood provisionally, and rake and reposition the coals if any one part of the pig is cooking faster than another. ”Slow and low” is what experts recommend when roasting a whole pig. It’s time consuming and demands constant attention, but makes a great centerpiece for a day of cooking and socializing. Brush on a coating of barbecue sauce, or use a turkey baster to drench the pig in a savory marinade as it cooks. This will ratchet up the flavor and keep the skin crisp and juicy. When the pig is nearing completion, its skin will begin to brown and bubble, but there’s no way to tell if the meat inside is done except to temp it. Use a professional-grade meat thermometer to take an internal temperature reading in different areas of the pig. The soft belly and bacon sections (the fatty tissue on the backside) are best served at around 145°F (63°C), while tougher, more sinewy parts like the shoulder and haunches will need to be at least 160-165°F (74°C) before they’re safe to eat. You will need to take a temperature reading several times throughout the cooking process. Do not serve the pig if any part of the meat is below 145°F (63°C). If an area is particularly slow getting done, reposition the coals underneath that area to increase the heat. After 10-12 hours the pig is now a crispy brown and the internal temperature is right—it’s time to eat! Take the pig off the coals, remove the spit and tell everybody to dig in. You can either carve the roast up into sections, dice it all together like pulled-pork barbecue or have everyone tear off their favorite sections by hand. When cooked right, the meat should be tender enough to pull apart. Slather the roast pork in your favorite sauce, serve it with a few sumptuous sides and enjoy! The meat should be juicy when fully cooked, but not bloody or red. If it isn’t quite done enough when you cut into it, it may need a few more minutes. Pair a roasted pig with other backyard cookout favorites like grilled veggies and baked beans, or go for the more island-inspired flavors of wild rice, fried plantains and pineapple.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. With all the hand-wringing about the economic perils of falling populations, there could be one beneficiary: the environment. What is a good title for this?","completion":"\\"Falling Populations: An Unforeseen Boon for the Environment Amid Economic Concerns\\" This title captures the implication that declining populations could have beneficial impacts on the environment despite the commonly cited economic disadvantages. It sparks curiosity by presenting a potential positive aspect (the environment benefiting) to a typically negative issue (decreasing populations). To start, it's important to note the symbiotic relationship between population growth and economic development. Typically, an increase in population correlates to a surge in economic growth due to the increase in consumer demand, which in turn promotes industrialization and job creation. This principle is one reason why governments, economists, and policymakers are often concerned about population decline, as it's perceived as a threat to sustained economic prosperity. However, population decline isn't necessarily all doom and gloom. From an environmental perspective, fewer people could mean less strain on our planet's natural resources, reduced carbon footprint, and diminished pressure on ecosystems. Consider each person as a consumer tool that requires certain goods and services: food, clothing, transportation, housing, energy, and so forth. Each of these demands contributes to environmental degradation in some way, be it through deforestation, carbon emissions, plastic pollution, or erosion. Let's start with carbon emissions. According to the United Nations, the world's population has grown from 1.65 billion to 7.7 billion in the last century. As a result, so, too, has our collective carbon footprint due to increased industrial activities, vehicular use, deforestation, livestock farming, etc. A smaller population could translate into lower overall emissions, assuming the per capita emissions rate remains the same. Deforestation is another critical issue linked with population growth. As more people need more space to live and grow food, forests are often cleared to make way for urban development and agriculture. These forests not only serve as homes to millions of species but also act as natural carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. Fewer people could mean less demand for such space, helping to preserve these vital ecosystems. Similarly, fewer people could decrease the demand for energy, lessening the pressure on non-renewable resources like coal, oil, and natural gas, and reducing pollution from their extraction and use. In summary, while the economic implications of falling populations are a valid concern, this change could inadvertently stimulate environmental recovery by reducing consumption, curbing deforestation, mitigating carbon emissions, and alleviating the strain on our planet's natural assets. These issues are complex and interwoven, demanding a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to balance economic development with environmental conservation. Hence, the conversation shouldn't stop at population growth versus decline but instead embrace efficient resource usage, renewable energy, sustainable production and consumption practices, and climate-conscious policies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - redemption - isolation - absolution - great relief - feel better I believe the correct choice is \\"redemption\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"When you choose to have a forgiving attitude toward someone, they receive multiple benefits, some of which may include redemption, absolution, great relief, and feeling better. Let's explore each of these aspects in detail: 1. Redemption: Forgiving someone helps them experience a sense of redemption, which involves the process of making amends, repairing relationships, and restoring trust. This can lead to personal growth and better understanding of mistakes made by the person, empowering them to overcome those flaws and establish healthier connections with others. 2. Absolution: Absolution refers to the act of setting someone free from guilt, blame, or sin. By forgiving the person, you are effectively releasing them from the burden of guilt associated with their actions. This allows them to move forward in life without constantly being weighed down by feelings of remorse or self-condemnation. 3. Great Relief: Forgiving someone results in great relief not only for the person receiving forgiveness but also for the one forgiving. For the person being forgiven, it can bring a sense of peace and tranquility, removing the anxiety and unease that were previously present due to unresolved conflicts or unaddressed misdeeds. On the other hand, it also brings relief to the one who forgives, as they no longer need to bear grudges or hold on to negative emotions, allowing them to focus on more positive aspects of their life. 4. Feeling Better: Forgiveness can genuinely make people feel better – both emotionally and physically. Studies have shown that individuals who forgive tend to experience lower levels of stress, depression, and anger, leading to improved mental health and overall well-being. Moreover, it can also have positive effects on physical health, as chronic stress and unresolved conflicts may contribute to the development of various health issues, including heart conditions and weakened immune systems. It is important to note that forgiveness is not solely about the person who has committed a wrongdoing; it is also about the one granting forgiveness. When you hold on to grudges and resentments, it takes a toll on your emotional well-being and may even affect your physical health. Therefore, adopting a forgiving attitude is beneficial for both parties involved, creating an atmosphere of understanding, empathy, and healing. In conclusion, while redemption is indeed an essential aspect of forgiveness, it is crucial to acknowledge that several other factors play a role in creating a complete picture of the benefits received by someone when you adopt a forgiving attitude. These benefits include redemption, absolution, great relief, and overall emotional well-being. In the end, the act of forgiveness fosters healthier relationships and emotional growth that can lead to personal transformation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Just like the heart-shaped copper wire, this homopolar motor uses a simple AA battery sitting atop a neodymium magnet in a vertical position with its positive pole oriented above the negative pole. Loop some copper wire around the magnet. You need not make the whole loop touch the base; an ovular loop which touches the battery at just two points is as acceptable as a circular loop which grips the whole magnet. Once the loop around the base is complete, bend the wire up and away from the loop around the magnet. The corkscrew’s diameter should be just a few millimeters wider than that of the battery. Stop the corkscrew about halfway up the length of the battery. At a point about three millimeters above the highest point on the battery, press the wire inwards at a ninety degree angle toward the center of the positive pole. Once the wire is over the positive pole’s central divot, bend it down so that it touches the divot, then races back up and away from the divot in a hairpin turn. Instead of a heart shape, bend the copper wire into the shape of a ballerina, arms outstretched. Begin by turning the wire, now pointing straight up, in a ninety degree bend about one and a half inches above the positive pole of the battery. Approximately one centimeter along this length, pull the wire into a hairpin turn, angling it back toward the ninety degree turn you just made. This will be the dancer’s head. Once on the other side of the dancer’s “neck,” bring the wire back down on the other side of the dancer, mirroring the bends you just made. You should end up with a “T” shape with a circle above the central junction. You cannot end where you began, though (touching the central divot on the positive pole of the battery), and so will need to clip the wire at a point about half a centimeter above the positive pole of the battery. It may help to use a template or outline you’ve drawn or printed from the internet when shaping the wire into the ballerina form.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\". - Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel (December 8, 1815February 9, 1905) was a German Realist artist noted for drawings, etchings, and paintings. Along with Caspar David Friedrich, he is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, and was the most successful artist of his era in Germany. First known as Adolph Menzel, he was knighted in 1898 and changed his name to Adolph von Menzel. - Studio Wall ( 1872 ) is an oil painting by the German artist Adolph Menzel , now in the collection of the Hamburger Kunsthalle . It is considered one of the \`\` masterpieces of Menzel 's maturity '' , and the artist deemed it his best painting . The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist 's studio at night , upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below . The casts include portrait busts , death masks and life masks of friends of the artist , children , classical personae such as Dante , Schiller , and possibly Goethe or Wagner , a dog , and male and female torsos ; art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \`\` the dividing line between fame and anonymity . '' Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \`\` convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness . '' Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852 , an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin . That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand , the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed . Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel 's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill ( 1872 -- 1875 ) , for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting , yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise , and may have functioned as a kind of memorial : the central death mask is that of the artist 's friend Friedrich Eggers , the first critic sympathetic to Menzel 's work . Eggers died in August 1872 , and the painting is dated from October of that year . A contemplation on the transience of life , Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting . Interpretations of the work vary greatly . For art historian Julius Meier - Graefe , Studio Wall was a harmonious example of pictorial unity ; to the contrary , Hofmann saw the painting as a \`\` coded manifesto '' , a rejection by Menzel of academic canons in favor of an aesthetic that...

Context: Moving can either be out of necessity or an act of desire. Whatever the case, moving rarely comes at a convenient time and involves so many variables that it is difficult to exhale until all of the documents are signed. Even then, that point in the process instantaneously starts a whole new chapter in the book of moving. No matter how long it takes to sell (or not sell) your previous home, whether you’re able to find your dream kitchen or settle for less, if you’re moving down the street, across the country, or around the world, the act of moving can be completely overwhelming. Long story short: Moving is a process. In the midst of all the uncertainties, there are a few ways to stay organized while moving. This short list is meant to guide you through steps to keep you on track during a stressful time. The largest piece of advice I can give you is to start by decluttering your current living space. Having less to deal with will help you feel more in control of the situation. Finding a realtor that you trust and feel comfortable working with will put your mind at ease (most of the time) about the process of listing your house and finding a buyer. Let your realtor do the work for you so you can concentrate on keeping your home “show ready” and begin to look at options on the other side of the move, like where you’ll be working, spending your time, and researching schools or neighborhoods. Make a list of people you’ll need to update contact information with once you leave. This should include any and all businesses you frequent or subscribe to, like pest control services, lawn maintenance, even all of your neighborhood loyal buyer programs you participate in. Do not overlook your banks, investment companies, retirement funds, healthcare providers for you and your family members, and even you pets. And, of course, family and friends.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that wrote I know that my Redeemer liveth? The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\" The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\" should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and...

Article: Across continental Europe, but in France especially, booksellers and publishers had to negotiate censorship laws of varying strictness. The Encyclopédie, for example, narrowly escaped seizure and had to be saved by Malesherbes, the man in charge of the French censure. Indeed, many publishing companies were conveniently located outside France so as to avoid overzealous French censors. They would smuggle their merchandise across the border, where it would then be transported to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers. The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice. In one case, political books were the most popular category, primarily libels and pamphlets. Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself. The second most popular category, \\"general works\\" (those books \\"that did not have a dominant motif and that contained something to offend almost everyone in authority\\") demonstrated a high demand for generally low-brow subversive literature.

Please answer the following question: Background: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

The declining and small population size, combined with the geographic isolation, would lead to a reduced gene pool and increased chances of genetic drift, inbreeding depression, and the accumulation of deleterious mutations.

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars.

Wants to keep working until 70 or 75 like Sir Alex Ferguson.","completion":"Title: Jose Mourinho's Journey to a 'Normal' Life: From Taunting to Longevity and Returning to England Introduction The world of football has seen its fair share of ups and downs, but Jose Mourinho, a renowned Portuguese coach, has managed to stay relevant and successful throughout his career. Despite facing challenges on and off the pitch, Mourinho has plans to lead a more \\"normal\\" life and is inspired by Sir Alex Ferguson to keep working till the age of 70 or 75. With his return to England at the end of his spell in Madrid, we take a closer look at the highlights of Mourinho's journey and what the future holds for the esteemed football coach. Jose Mourinho's Son Taunted While Playing Football Like any other dedicated father, Jose Mourinho is protective of his son, who also shares a passion for football. Unfortunately, there have been incidents where Mourinho's son has faced taunts and ridicule while playing the sport that he enjoys. Life in the public eye can be difficult, and Mourinho is fully aware of the challenges his family has faced due to his career. But his love for football and his determination to keep pushing forward is a testament to his resilience and commitment to the game. Portuguese Coach Wants to Live a 'Normal' Life As his career progresses and Mourinho contemplates the path ahead, he is increasingly drawn to the idea of living a more \\"normal\\" life. In recent interviews, the coach has expressed his desire to step back from the limelight and enjoy the simpler aspects of life with his family. After years of being in the public eye and the constant scrutiny that accompanies fame, it's perfectly understandable that Mourinho would want to find a balance between his professional and personal life. Return to England at the End of His Spell in Madrid Throughout his career, Jose Mourinho has taken on various challenges and has managed to leave a lasting impact wherever he goes. From Porto to Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, and eventually Manchester United, Mourinho has demonstrated his skill and adaptability as a football coach. With his current spell in Madrid coming to an end, Mourinho is making plans to return to England – the country where he has achieved significant success and also faced certain disappointments. Fans and football experts alike will be eager to see what Mourinho does next upon his return to England. Inspired to Work Until 70 or 75 Like Sir Alex Ferguson One of the most significant influences in Mourinho's life is the legendary former Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson. Not only does Mourinho admire and respect Sir Alex for his career successes, but he is also incredibly inspired by the longevity of the legendary manager's career. Currently in his 50s, Mourinho has already set lofty goals for himself, stating that he wishes to work until the age of 70 or 75 – just like Sir Alex Ferguson. Conclusion Jose Mourinho's journey so far has been nothing short of remarkable. As he plans to continue making an impact on the world of football for years to come, it's clear that the Portuguese coach has ambitions beyond the pitch. From overcoming personal challenges to drawing inspiration from the greats, Mourinho's unique combination of resilience, passion, and determination has set him on a path to achieve greatness in his own right. Now, with an eye on a more \\"normal\\" life and a return to England on the horizon, fans eagerly await the next chapter in the illustrious career of this iconic football coach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"As music grew more expressive, the standard orchestral palette just wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers.\\"\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers?\\" Pick from: + yes + no","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"As music grew more expressive, the standard orchestral palette just wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"What wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers?\\" The sentence explicitly states that the standard orchestral palette was not rich enough for many composers in the Romantic era. This period is known for valuing subjective emotion and individuality, translating into musical works with more personal expression and experimentation in sound and tonality. As a result, the need for more diverse instrumentation and expanded tonal color became increasingly evident. These Romantic composers sought to create a more diverse and expressive sound by pushing the boundaries of the standard orchestral palette, which predominantly consisted of strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion. In an effort to evoke intense emotions, breathtaking scenes, and powerful narratives within their compositions, many composers began to add novel instruments to their orchestrations or explore innovative techniques for established instrumentation. For example, the music of Richard Wagner required larger orchestras, featuring new instruments like the bass clarinet and Wagner tuba. Similarly, Hector Berlioz's seminal work, Symphonie Fantastique, showcased the extended capabilities of standard orchestral instruments by incorporating colorful effects like col legno (striking strings with the wooden part of the bow), and featuring the obscure Ophicleide as a bass instrument. While some composers chose to create new instruments or fully reinvent the role of existing instruments in their orchestrations, others approached the challenge by innovating the way they composed for standard orchestral instruments, employing advanced techniques to produce a richer texture or timbre, such as extended string techniques, multiphonics in the woodwinds, or dramatic brass swells. In conclusion, the sentence provides a succinct and direct answer to the question. As music during the Romantic period underscored the need for greater emotional depth and expressive qualities, traditional orchestral instrumentation proved insufficient for many composers, leading to a surge in experimentation and expansion of the orchestral palette to accommodate the new era's innovative demands."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Decent Email Client with Room for Improvement Review: I recently downloaded and started using the email client app 'com.fsck.k9' on my Android device, and I feel that it deserves a 3-star rating. While this app offers a few commendable features that make it a decent option for managing my emails, it certainly has some shortcomings that I believe the developers should address to improve the overall user experience. Pros: 1. Open-source: One clear advantage that 'com.fsck.k9' has is its open-source nature. This provides me with a degree of transparency and contributes to my trust in the app, knowing that its code is accessible for inspection, modification, and even redistribution. 2. Support for multiple accounts: The app easily handles multiple email accounts, allowing me to manage both my personal and work emails from within the same interface. The set-up process for adding accounts was simple and stress-free. 3. Customizable interface: It offers a considerable degree of customization options, such as changing the theme, account colors, and notification settings. This allows me to tailor the app to my preferences and achieve a more pleasant experience. Cons: 1. Outdated user interface: Visually, 'com.fsck.k9' has an outdated aesthetic compared to other email apps on the market, with an interface that lacks a modern touch. This includes an unpolished design for buttons, menus, and icons, as well as the overall layout. With the visual experience being essential for user engagement, I would appreciate seeing a more seamless and contemporary layout. 2. Limited search functionality: When it comes to searching for specific emails, I find the app's search functionality quite limited. The basic search option often does not yield accurate results, and the app could certainly benefit from an advanced search mechanism, with filters to narrow down results by date, sender, keywords, or folders. 3. Occasional slow performance: There have been a few instances where I experienced some lagging and slow response times within the app, particularly when scrolling through emails or switching between accounts. This tends to disrupt the smooth flow of managing my daily emails and can be quite frustrating. Conclusion: Overall, the 'com.fsck.k9' email client is a decent app that fulfills its basic purpose of managing multiple email accounts. Its open-source nature, customization options, and easy set-up for multiple accounts are commendable features. However, its outdated user interface, limited search functionality, and occasional slow performance prevent it from being a top contender in the list of email clients available. I believe that addressing these issues and implementing further refinements could certainly elevate the app's rating and enhance the experience for its users."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to give the bigclock a good name, people held a meeting. Someone wanted to call it the Queen of Bells, and someone thought Victoria was good. At last, a man named Benjamin Hall stood up. He was a big man. Before he started to speak, someone shouted, \\"Why not call it Big Ben? \\"Everybody laughed and agreed with him. From then on, Big Ben became its name.

The other option, bailing twine, is not the best choice because it's not as comfortable as paracord.

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. I am facing a new situation today: Two rivers, The Minninnippi and The Cedar, flow into the same ocean. The Minninnippi is surrounded almost entirely by farm lands due its location in a flat area of the country that sees regular rainfall.

Article: In many romantic movies or TV shows one scene always appears. It involves a handsome man standing outside a young woman's window, singing a love song to her to win her over. However, trying to woo a female with songs is not just something that humans do. A few animals sing love songs as well. Birds and elephants are romantic but the latest animal to _ a female might surprise you--it is the humble mouse. You may find it odd to find out that mice sing. We do not hear them because the frequency of their voice is so high. In fact, scientists have known for some time that male mice make special sounds to females, but it has always been assumed that the sounds are produced instinctively and randomly, with little thought going into the process. But new research suggests otherwise. When male mice with different voices were put in a cage together, scientists found that they would gradually change their pitches to sound like one another. But when a female mouse was put in the cage with two males, one male would change his pitch to match the other. \\"It was usually the smaller animal changing the pitch to match the larger animal,\\" professor Erich Jarvis, leader of the study, from Duke University, US, told BBC News. This ability, known as vocal learning, is rare in the natural world. It had been thought to be limited to some birds, such as parrots--as well as whales and dolphins. The latest findings challenge the long-held opinion that mice cannot learn to adapt their voices. Scientists also found the part of the brain that controls the mice's singing ability. In the experiment, they damaged the cells in this part of the mice's brain and found that the animals couldn't keep their songs in pitch or repeat them any more. This also happened when the mice became deaf. Jarvis said that this finding had changed his understanding of the way mice make sound. \\"In mice we find that the pathways that are at least modulating these vocalizations are in the forebrain, in places where you actually find them in humans,\\"... Question: What do parrots, whales and dolphins have in common according to the passage? Options: A: They are all animals well-known for their smart appearances.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please answer a question about the following article about Race (human categorization): Over a dozen racial categories would be recognized in conformity with all the possible combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and not one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race referred preferentially to appearance, not heredity, and appearance is a poor indication of ancestry, because only a few genes are responsible for someone's skin color and traits: a person who is considered white may have more African ancestry than a person who is considered black, and the reverse can be also true about European ancestry. The complexity of racial classifications in Brazil reflects the extent of miscegenation in Brazilian society, a society that remains highly, but not strictly, stratified along color lines. These socioeconomic factors are also significant to the limits of racial lines, because a minority of pardos, or brown people, are likely to start declaring themselves white or black if socially upward, and being seen as relatively \\"whiter\\" as their perceived social status increases (much as in other regions of Latin America).

Article: Fast and accurate throwing is essential for every softball player, but the exact motions of a good throw may seem foreign to someone just starting to learn the game. Good throwers throw with a lot of backspin, which helps the ball fly farther, use their whole body instead of just their arm to get power, and align their legs and shoulders with the target for accuracy. Make sure you throw with your dominant hand. This is whatever hand feels the most comfortable. Always practice with a glove in your opposite hand -- this is how you will have to throw in a game. Turn the ball so that the laces form a \\"C,\\" then place your four fingers along the top lace. Your thumb should comfortably rest on another lace along the side of the softball. The laces provide a surface to grip onto, and you will \\"pull\\" on the laces as you throw to give the ball backspin (the top of the ball spins back towards the bottom), which helps the throw's speed and stability. Your back foot is the foot on the same side as your throwing arm. You want the instep, or inside, of your foot to face your target so that your toes point diagonally to the right (right-handed throwers) or left (left-handed throwers) of your target. To be precise, point your toes roughly 45 degrees away from the spot you throw towards. You should be able to draw a straight line from your back instep through your front foot and to your target. In other words, you will be perpendicular to your target. You should point your front toes however you feel comfortable. Usually this is sideways. This insures accuracy, but it also opens up your shoulders to allow a more natural throwing motion. As you get more experienced, you may begin pointing your glove elbow, not the glove, towards your target. This makes your throwing motion more compact and efficient. Your arm should form an \\"L\\" shape with the ball held high. Dropping the elbow is the most common mistake many young softball players make when throwing, so pay close attention to your arm position. With your arm high in the air behind you, point your palm and the ball up and behind you. This will allow you to snap your wrist with more power later in the throw. This is your throwing motion, and you will feel your arm extending as you \\"whip\\" past your head. Remember to keep your elbow near shoulder-height as you begin your throw. The ball will be at the highest point of your arm. Try to keep your elbow loose and relaxed -- don't try to keep the \\"L\\" shape as you throw. As the ball passes you head, throw the ball by simultaneously letting go of the ball and \\"pulling\\" the laces of the ball down to create backspin. You can test your backspin by placing black electrical tape perpendicular to the laces of the ball. If you release the ball properly, you should see a solid black \\"line\\" of the tape as the ball spins. Though not necessary when you are first learning, practice pulling your glove back towards your chest as you begin your throw -- it gives you more room for a powerful follow-through. Bend your arm towards your chest at the elbow, then pull your elbow back towards your ribs. Once the ball is released, let your arm keep swinging down and across your body, ending with your hand near your opposite thigh. Your fingers and wrist should be down from spinning the ball. As you throw, you will feel your body weight shifting to your front foot. Don't resist it, and feel free to pick you your back foot to keep your balance as you lean forward after the throw. If you decide to try everything at once, every time, you are bound to pick up bad habits. Instead, break the throw down into smaller parts and practice these before bringing it all together: Grip: Toss the ball up and catch it in your glove. As soon as you catch it, grab the ball and turn it in your hands to quickly place all four fingers on the laces. Repeat. Feet: Pick 3-4 different targets in the distance. Toss the ball up to yourself. As soon as you catch it, grab the ball, turn, and set you feet up towards one of the targets, cocking your arm back like you are about to throw. Stop here and note your foot position -- are you in a straight line towards your chosen target? Wrist Flick: Hold your arm in front of your body with the ball high and your elbow at shoulder height. Practice throwing the ball with just your upper arm, snapping down from the elbow and pulling back the laces with your fingers and wrist. Your goal is to practice good, consistent backspin. You should work on throwing with a good, fluid arc. Your final throwing motion should be consistent, smooth, and comfortable. Grip the ball along the laces. As you bring the ball out of your glove, align your feet with the target. Cock you arm backwards at a 90 degree angle while pointing your glove at the target. Rapidly swing the ball past your head and release. Snap your fingers and wrist down and towards your target. Follow through by bringing your weight and arm forward and down. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is: To throw accurately and effectively in softball, use your dominant hand and grip the ball with the laces forming a \\"C.\\" Position your feet and align your body with the target.

According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\").

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Steven Delano Smith (born March 31, 1969) is an American retired basketball player who is currently a basketball analyst for Turner Sports. After a collegiate career with Michigan State, he played with several teams in his 14-season National Basketball Association career, including the Miami Heat, the Portland Trail Blazers and the San Antonio Spurs, but is perhaps best known for his five-year stint with the Atlanta Hawks which included an All-Star Game appearance in 1998. He won a championship with the Spurs in 2003. Smith was widely regarded as an excellent three-point shooter, and is one of three players to make seven 3 pointers in a quarter. Smith started in 59 of 78 games for Atlanta and averaged 16 points during the regular season and 19 points in the playoffs, as the Hawks lost in a first round sweep to the Indiana Pacers. He would go on to average a then career high 18.1 points a game in 80 starts in the 1995-96 season, forming a formidable backcourt one-two punch with Mookie Blaylock. The team under head coach Lenny Wilkens would win 46 games and defeat Indiana in the first round in 5 games before falling to the Orlando Magic in the conference semifinals in 6 games. Smith averaged 21.7 points in 10 playoff games, including a 35-point performance in a game 4 win against the Magic. The following season would feature another career high scoring average (20.1) for Smith, as he continued to serve as the Hawks' main option on offense. The team also featured players such as Christian Laettner and Dikembe Mutombo, and would go on to win 56 games before meeting and defeating the Detroit Pistons in a 5-game first round series. Smith played well against Detroit and held his own against Michael Jordan and the defending champion Chicago Bulls, who defeated the Hawks in 5 games in the semifinals. The following season would be similar to Smith as he once again averaged 20.1 points a game, but this time managed to be named an NBA All-Star as he scored 14 points in 16 minutes of action in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game. The Hawks would disappoint in the playoffs yet again however, this time losing to the Charlotte Hornets 3 games to 1 in the conference semifinals despite a 24.8 ppg scoring average by Smith for the series. The 1998-99 season would be limited to 50 games as a result of a league wide lockout, and in 36 games Smith averaged 18.7 points a game and led the Hawks to another 5 game first round victory over Detroit. The Hawks had no answer, however, for the New York Knicks, and again the Hawks were eliminated in the semifinals. Smith averaged 17.3 points a game in the 1999 playoffs. In the offseason, the Hawks traded Smith in a 4 player trade to the Portland Trail Blazers which included Isaiah Rider, who had served as Portland's starting shooting guard and who Smith would now replace.

Question: Given the following context: Though it reached No. 130 on the Billboard chart, Freak Out! was neither a major commercial nor critical success when it was first released in the United States. Many listeners were convinced that the album was drug-inspired, and interpreted the album's title as slang for a bad LSD trip. The album made the Mothers of Invention immediate underground darlings with a strong counter-cultural following. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa quotes a negative review of the album by Pete Johnson of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote: I guess you might call it surrealistic paintings set to music. Not content to record just two sides of musical gibberish, the MOI devote four full sides to their type of \\"artistry\\". If anyone owns this album, perhaps he can tell me what in hell is going on ... The Mothers of Invention, a talented but warped quintet, have fathered an album poetically entitled Freak Out, which could be the greatest stimulus to the aspirin industry since the income tax. The album developed a major cult following in the United States by the time MGM/Verve had been merged into a division of PolyGram in 1972. At that time many MGM/Verve releases including Freak Out! were prematurely deleted in an attempt to keep the struggling company financially solvent. Zappa had already moved on to his own companies Bizarre Records and Straight Records which were distributed by Warner Bros. Records. Freak Out! was initially more successful in Europe and quickly influenced many English rock musicians. According to David Fricke, the album was a major influence on the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Paul McCartney regarded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as The Beatles' Freak Out! Zappa criticized the Beatles, as he felt they were \\"only in it for the money\\".Freak Out! was honored with the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999, ranked at number 243 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" in 2003, and featured in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

Answer the following question: What is the full name of the person that is overjoyed that Beatrix Potter is a spinster? Answer the above question based on the context below: The story begins with Beatrix Potter nervously packing her portfolio and narrating that she is a London spinster, and that her ambition to become a children's author meets with wide disapproval. She and her chaperone, Miss Wiggin, visit the publishing house of Harold and Fruing Warne, who decide to publish her book. Beatrix is thrilled and returns home, taking a drive through the parks to celebrate first. However, it is revealed the Warne brothers think her book is ridiculous and will no doubt be a failure. The only reason they agreed to publish it is because they promised their younger brother, Norman, a project. When Norman Warne visits Beatrix, they make decisions about her book regarding size, colour and price. Norman admits he has never done anything like this before but has given her book a great deal of thought. Beatrix realises what Norman's brothers have done regarding him and her, but they become determined to prove them wrong. Norman takes Beatrix to the printer, and she has her drawings reproduced and copies of her book sold. Thrilled, Beatrix and Norman visit the Warne family, where Beatrix meets the wheelchair-bound but lovely Mrs. Warne, and Norman's sister, Amelia, nicknamed \\"Millie\\". Millie has decided that she and Beatrix are going to be friends and is overjoyed that Beatrix is a spinster, as is Millie, who believes men to be nothing but bores. The family befriends Beatrix, yet Helen Potter, Beatrix's social-climbing mother, is unhappy about her daughter spending time in the company of 'tradesmen'.

Question: Information: - Ten Foot Pole is an American punk rock band, formerly on Epitaph Records. - Rev is the second album by Ten Foot Pole , and the last to feature Scott Radinsky . - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Epitaph Records is a Hollywood-based independent record label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. The label was originally \\"just a logo and a P.O. box\\" created in the 1980s for the purpose of selling Bad Religion records, but has evolved into a large independent record label. Gurewitz took the name from a King Crimson song of the same name. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most of the bands on Epitaph were punk and pop punk groups, while there are many post-hardcore and bands signed to the label as well. A large portion of the record label, known as Hellcat Records, is owned by Tim Armstrong, frontman of the punk rock band Rancid. Several sister-labels also exist, such as ANTI-, Burning Heart Records, Fat Possum Records, Hellcat Records and Heart & Skull Records that have signed other types of bands. - Scott David Radinsky (born March 3, 1968) is a left-handed former relief pitcher in Major League Baseball, who had an 11-year career from and . Radinsky is also the lead singer of the punk rock band Pulley, former lead singer of the bands Scared Straight and Ten Foot Pole and co-owner of the skate park which houses the Skateboarding Hall of Fame. What is the relationship between 'rev ' and 'epitaph records'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between 'Rev' and 'Epitaph Records' is that 'Rev' is the second album by the American punk rock band Ten Foot Pole, and it was released under the label Epitaph Records. Epitaph Records is an independent record label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz, which primarily focuses on punk and punk-related music genres."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Given the question: Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena. Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes. Mark was visiting southern Africa as an exchange student. He was amazed by the beauty of Namib Desert, which is located mostly in Namibia. He kind of enjoyed the hot surface of the desert. Next to Namib desert is the grasslands of Botswana.

Decide what you want to achieve before you get started in the program. If you’ll be working sixty hours a week while also attending school, it might be a bad idea to aim for being #1 in your class. Don’t use your undergrad experience as a barometer. As an undergrad you were likely able to devote your full attention to school. Don’t expect to get the same grades (at least right away) in your MBA program while working full time. Pay attention to the competition but don’t let it get to you. Everyone else in your part-time MBA program likely has similar goals: they want to move up in their careers as well. This is a self-selected group of high achievers so you should expect the competition to be tough. Try to remember that you’re there to learn skills and develop a network, not necessarily to be the best in the class. Pursuing an MBA while working full-time is an ambitious challenge. You’ll need to juggle work, school, and family responsibilities. You should understand how much time you’ll be devoting to each before you jump in. Use a planner. Whether digital or paper, a planner is essential to navigating through an MBA while working. Use the planner to write in test days, due dates for both school and work assignments, and other important dates. Use a “to do” list with specific tasks. It feels good to scratch things off your “to do” list, and doing so will help keep you on track. If your list says something like “study,” it’s hard to know when you’ve completed the task. Instead, write something like, “study Chapter Two of the Business Skills 101 text and make flash cards.” Schedule big study blocks. As a part-time MBA student working full time, you’ll need to use whatever time you have to study. However, you should also schedule study blocks into your planner every week. If you’re a morning person, plan to wake up early and study; if you’re a night owl, schedule your study blocks for nighttime. Figure out what you can cut out. You may need to cut back on time at the gym, social activities, or other things in your life. It’s easy to get burned out while pursuing an MBA and working full-time. You should schedule days off ahead of time. That way, you can look forward to your planned days off and not feel guilty when you take them. Studying hard is important for success in your MBA. Studying smart means using the best strategies to study effectively and efficiently. Instead of heading to a restaurant for lunch, pack one and study in your office during your lunch hour. Keep your study materials with you whenever you can. If you have unexpected downtime, you’ll always be prepared to hit the books. Many schools have tutors that can help you with your work. If you’re having trouble understanding a concept you should reach out to a tutor. Remember that you’re getting an MBA to improve your marketability. If you start slacking off at work or missing days, the negative impression of your boss could offset any gains from having an MBA. If you start to feel overwhelmed, talk to your school first. They have resources to help you manage your time and your stress. If worst comes to worst and you feel like you’re going to miss a work deadline, talk to your boss. It’s better to let your employer know beforehand that you’ll be late with a project than to have to explain yourself later. Summary:","completion":"When pursuing an MBA while working full-time, it's essential to manage your time effectively and set realistic expectations. Understand that your competition will be fierce, and focus on learning skills and developing a network instead of being at the top of your class. To stay organized, use a planner and to-do lists with specific tasks. Schedule regular study blocks and consider cutting back on other activities to make time for your studies. Study smart by using efficient strategies and taking advantage of resources like tutors. It's vital to maintain a strong work-life balance and not let your job performance suffer as a result of your academic commitments. Communicate with your school and employer if you start feeling overwhelmed and take advantage of the resources they can offer to help you cope with stress and manage your responsibilities. Overall, be prepared to make sacrifices and adjustments in your schedule, but remember that the ultimate goal is to improve your career prospects and personal growth."},{"prompt":"What are the first names of the people who hear a scream?

The question implies that the satellite has already moved past the moon. 2. Therefore, the option \\"moon\\" can be excluded as the target location of the satellite since that would contradict the given information. 3. Similarly, the option \\"air\\" would be counterintuitive as \\"air\\" refers usually to Earth's atmosphere and the situation described in the question clearly states that the satellite is beyond that point. 4. The option \\"night sky\\" can also be discarded because it typically refers to the visible space seen from Earth during the night time. Given the satellite is beyond the moon, it is too far to be merely in the \\"night sky\\". 5. Now we're left with \\"outer space\\" and \\"universe\\". While \\"outer space\\" does represent a valid option, the term usually refers to the space immediately outside the Earth's atmosphere. 6. The \\"universe\\", on the other hand, encompasses everything that exists, including all physical space, time, energy, matter, galaxies, stars, planets, etc. Given this context, \\"universe\\" is a broader term that accurately includes the areas beyond the moon.

How can I use Google spreadsheets as the backend for a simple mobile app?","completion":"No, the two questions provided are referring to different technologies and use cases: 1. How can I use FreeBSD as a backend for my app on AWS? This question refers to using FreeBSD—an open-source Unix-like operating system—as the backend for an application that will be hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS)—a widely-used cloud computing platform. A backend typically consists of a server, application, and a database that manage and store the app's data and perform any necessary computing, while AWS provides the infrastructure to host and run these components. Here's a detailed guide on using FreeBSD as the backend for your app on AWS: - Create an AWS account: If you don't have one already, sign up for an AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com/. - Choose the appropriate service: For deploying FreeBSD on AWS, one of the popular choices is Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), which provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can sign in to the AWS Management Console to access EC2 Dashboard. - Launch FreeBSD Instance: In the EC2 Dashboard, choose \\"Launch Instance\\" and search the AWS Marketplace for \\"FreeBSD\\". Several FreeBSD images will be available; select the one that best suits your needs. Make sure to read the documentation provided for any specific instructions relating to the image. - Configure your instance: Select your desired instance type (based on your CPU, memory, storage, and network requirements), and configure instance details such as the number of instances, network, and security group settings. - Create and manage SSH keys: To connect remotely to your FreeBSD instance on EC2, you'll need to create a key pair (public and private keys) or use an existing one. Store your private key in a secure location. - Launch your instance: Review your settings and confirm the instance creation. AWS will then initialize and launch your FreeBSD instance. - Connect to your instance: After the instance is launched and running, you can connect to it using an SSH client and the key pair you created earlier. Use the public DNS name or IP address provided by AWS to establish the connection. - Set up your backend components: Once connected to your FreeBSD instance, you can install the necessary software for your application, which may include a web server, your application runtime environment, and a database server. Configure these components as needed for your app. - Deploy your application: Once the backend components are set up, you can deploy your application code to the FreeBSD instance and configure the web server, application server, and database as needed. - Test and monitor: After deploying your app, test it to ensure it's working correctly, and monitor your FreeBSD instance and app using AWS tools and services. 2.

This question is about using Google Sheets—a web-based spreadsheet application—as the backend for a simple mobile app. Google Sheets can serve as a basic backend for storing data in a structured format and provides a simple interface for managing the data. Here's a detailed guide on using Google Sheets as the backend for a simple mobile app: - Create a Google Sheet: Sign in to your Google account and create a new Google Sheet. Structure your data in a meaningful and logical manner to suit your app's requirements (rows and columns for storing elements, labels, etc.). - Make the sheet public or limited access: If you are fine with your data being public, you can make the sheet public, so it's accessible to everyone. Alternatively, you can choose to restrict access by sharing the sheet only with specific people or your team. - Create a Google Sheets API key: Sign in to Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project for your mobile app. Navigate to the \\"APIs & Services\\" dashboard, search for \\"Google Sheets API,\\" and enable it. Create an API key under the \\"Credentials\\" tab by selecting \\"Create credentials\\" and choosing \\"API key.\\" Store this key securely. - Connect your mobile app to the Google Sheets API: Depending on the programming language and platform you are using for your mobile app, you'll need to configure it to call the Google Sheets API. You can find documentation and client libraries for various programming languages at https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts. - Read, write and update data: With the API key and connections in place, your mobile app can now read data from the Google Sheet, write new data, or update existing data. Implement this functionality in your app as needed, based on your use case and data management requirements. - Handle authentication and authorization: If your Google Sheet is shared only with specific people or requires authentication, you'll need to implement OAuth 2.0 in your mobile app to handle user authentication and authorization. You can find more information in the Google Sheets API documentation. - Test the integration: After implementing the necessary functionality in your app, test and ensure that your mobile app is successfully interacting with the Google Sheet. - Monitor and maintain: Continuously monitor and maintain your mobile app and its connection to Google Sheets, carefully managing your API keys and application data. In summary, the two questions are not the same; the first question is about using FreeBSD on AWS as the backend for an app, while the second question is about using Google Sheets as the backend for a simple mobile app. The technologies, infrastructure, and steps involved in each are different, catering to distinct requirements and use cases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What kills people in the mountain? Title: Without Warning Movie plot: A father and son go hunting in the mountains. Before they can begin hunting, which the son does not want to do anyway, they are killed by flying jellyfish-like creatures, which penetrate their skin with needle-tipped tentacles. Some time later, four teenagers, Tom, Greg, Beth and Sandy, hike in the same area, ignoring the warnings of local truck stop owner Joe Taylor (Jack Palance). A group of Cub Scouts is also in the area; their leader (Larry Storch) is also killed by the alien creatures, while his troop runs into an unidentified humanoid and flee. The teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the starfish which tries to get through the car's windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred 'Sarge' Dobbs (Martin Landau), who is a mentally ill veteran. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg. While they discuss the situation, the sheriff arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader.

What may happen next in speaker 's story ?","completion":"In the speaker's story, the moment after the character kisses his nose, eyelids, and cheekbones, a flood of emotions may envelop both characters involved. The atmosphere is likely charged with romantic tension and the air thick with vulnerability as their connection deepens. There are several ways the story could unfold from this point: 1. The male character may finally find the courage to express his feelings to her, the color behind his eyes and the flutter in his stomach. He could explain that he has fallen in love or feels a deep emotional connection with her. His vulnerability in this moment could leave them both feeling exposed and reliant on one another's honesty. This could lead to a stronger bond between them, opening doors for a new chapter in their relationship, from being friends to becoming lovers. 2. The male character might still struggle to find the words to express his emotions, prompting the female character to coax him gently, assuring him that she is there for him and that he can trust her with his heart. This dialogue may create an opportunity for an open and meaningful exchange of thoughts and emotions between the two characters. As they share their truths and insecurities, their emotional connection may grow stronger, and this newfound level of understanding could shape their relationship moving forward. 3. Alternatively, the male character could become overwhelmed with emotions and, fearing his own vulnerability, may choose not to reveal his feelings. Despite the female character's tender gestures, he could pull away, leaving her uncertain of his intentions and confused about his reaction. This could lead to a rift in their relationship, sparking misunderstandings and heartache, with the possibility of reconciliation or moving apart in the future. 4. Another possible development could be the female character herself confessing her feelings first, assuming that his hesitation stems not from fear but from uncertainty about her feelings towards him. She may make herself emotionally vulnerable, laying out her feelings and her hopes for a romantic relationship between them. This confession might act as a catalyst for him to share his own emotions and solidify their deepened connection. 5. Their emotional experience in this moment could be interrupted by an external event or a third character, putting their romantic development on hold. This interruption might force them to temporarily set aside their emotions, only to resurface later in the story. This unexpected circumstance could add complexity, suspense, and tension to their narrative, keeping readers intrigued and invested in the outcome of their relationship.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing? Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.

'Pathetic': Labour leader Ed Miliband has come under fire for his bid to shift blame over the Paul Flowers scandal. Ed Miliband was described as ‘pathetic’ yesterday after he accused David Cameron of smear tactics and plotting to run the ‘dirtiest election campaign’ in decades. The Labour leader said the Prime Minister was ‘demeaning his office’ with a political strategy to ‘sling as much mud as possible in the hope that some of it sticks’. His outburst follows weeks of negative headlines for the Labour Party, from the vote-rigging scandal in Falkirk to last week’s revelations about former Co-op chairman Paul Flowers, a former Labour councillor who was arrested as part of a drugs inquiry. Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, said Mr Miliband’s complaints showed the party could not take scrutiny and tended to ‘clam up’ when facing difficult questions. The Labour leader said in an article for the Independent on Sunday: ‘David Cameron used to claim he wanted to change his party and lead it back to the middle ground. ‘That project has now entirely disappeared. This is a Conservative Party preparing to fight the dirtiest general election campaign that we have seen in this country for over 20 years.’ Accusing the Tories of employing tactics of ‘smear and character assassination’, he wrote that at last Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron had ‘hit a new low by trying to use the gross errors and misconduct of one man, Paul Flowers, to impugn the integrity of the entire Labour movement’. Conservative chairman Grant Shapps expressed his surprise that Labour, whose spin doctor Damian McBride was forced to resign in 2009 after he sent emails discussing plans to smear senior Tories, was accusing anyone of dirty politics. ‘This is a pathetic attempt to evade the serious issues. Labour have big questions to answer, and when they are asked, they simply try to avoid them by claiming they are smears,’ he said. ‘It is an obvious tactic from the party that brought you the most disgraceful smear operation of modern times, fronted by Damian McBride, and known about, encouraged and tolerated by Ed Balls and Ed Miliband. And McBride was simply the latest in a long line of bullying Labour spin doctors, including Alastair Campbell and Charlie Whelan. Movie night: Disgraced Paul Flowers goes to the cinema in Liverpool with Ian Hu on Thursday night. ‘Incredibly, Labour’s new campaign chief Michael Dugher used to be McBride’s right-hand man – it’s the same old Labour. We suggest they explain how the corruption at Falkirk happened, and how the Rev Flowers was allowed to become and remain an adviser, rather than dismiss legitimate questions as smears.’ Mr Gove criticised the Labour leader for his ‘coquettish reticence’ in dealing with the scandals. He said it was hypocritical of Labour not to expect to have to answer questions about Paul Flowers, but he insisted there was no Tory plan to fight a dirty campaign. ‘We need to have lots of questions: that’s why the Chancellor of the Exchequer took the advice of independent people to set up an inquiry, which will ask searching questions about what went on right up to the moment that we discovered everything we discovered about Paul Flowers,’ he said. ‘The difficulty Labour has is they were the people responsible for appointing, or allowing Flowers to be appointed, on their watch.’ Mr Gove told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that when it came to questions over the Unite official at the centre of the Falkirk vote-rigging probe, Labour ‘tend to clam up’. Shameless Paul Flowers allegedly tried to acquire cocaine last week – after he was exposed on camera trying to buy drugs and after promising to seek professional help. He phoned a dealer on Tuesday and asked for drugs. He reportedly invited the dealer to stay with him in Liverpool and said ‘turn up and if you want to bring the boy Charlie, that’s fine too’. Charlie is Flowers’s habitual name for cocaine. Keeping a clean nose: Rev Paul Flowers last week. ‘I had absolutely no doubt Paul was referring to coke,’ the dealer told The Mail on Sunday. ‘He always used that word for it.’ After the publication of a video showing him handing over £300 to buy cocaine and other illegal drugs, former Co-op Bank chairman Flowers apologised for his ‘stupid and wrong’ actions in a statement made through the Methodist church last Sunday. He also vowed to seek help for his problem. The convicted dealer claimed Flowers had admitted using drugs since 2010 – which covers most of his time at the Co-op Bank – and the former Methodist minister allegedly admitted he didn’t believe in God. ‘Paul’s been a really heavy user of coke and ketamine for a long time,’ the dealer added. ‘I laughed when I saw his statement saying he was getting professional help. The only professional help he was seeking was from a professional drug fixer – me.’ The dealer said Flowers ‘sniffed a line of coke’ on Remembrance Sunday morning before going to a service in Bradford. Flowers has not been home since the scandal broke eight days ago and has been reportedly staying with fellow Methodist minister Ian Hu, 51, in Liverpool. They went to the cinema on Thursday. Further details of his debauched lifestyle are revealed in a string of texts he sent in recent weeks to his drug dealer. On the day he was due to appear before a Commons committee about the Co-op’s performance, he texted to say he has taken drugs and plans a night touring the gay bars of Bradford looking for ‘lots of likely lads’. In the days before his exposure in The Mail on Sunday, Flowers texted about watching porn and taking drugs. He also texted his dealer about a 17-year-old straight student he likes and suggests the teenager watches him having sex. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article, published in 2013, primarily discusses several scandals that have negatively affected the Labour Party.

Premise: \\"When the United States runs a trade deficit, foreigners buy less than a dollar's worth of U.S. goods and services with every dollar they earn on their exports sold to the United States.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"When the United State runs a trade deficit, foreigners buy less U.S. goods than they earn on exports to the U.S.\\"?","completion":"If the premise states that \\"when the United States runs a trade deficit, foreigners buy less than a dollar's worth of U.S. goods and services with every dollar they earn on their exports sold to the United States,\\" it offers insight into the relationship between trade deficits, U.S. goods and services, and foreign exports. To analyze this premise and the hypothesis \\"when the United States runs a trade deficit, foreigners buy less U.S. goods than they earn on exports to the U.S.,\\" it's important to examine the underlying economic concepts and their implications. Firstly, let's explain the concept of a trade deficit. A trade deficit occurs when the value of a country's imports exceeds the value of its exports during a specific time period. In the case of the United States, this means that the costs of goods and services that are imported from foreign nations are greater than the income generated from goods and services exported to these countries. When we dissect the given premise, we see that it refers to the exchange of goods and services between foreigners and the U.S. during a trade deficit. As the U.S. is importing more than it's exporting, it implies that foreigners are selling more goods and services to the U.S. (generating more export income) than they spend on importing American products. In other words, with every dollar they earn from their exports, they spend less than a dollar on U.S. goods and services, indicating that they have a surplus of income that they are not spending on American products. Considering the economic implications of the premise, we can deduce that it entails the hypothesis \\"When the United States runs a trade deficit, foreigners buy less U.S. goods than they earn on exports to the U.S.\\" By stating that foreigners spend less than a dollar on U.S. goods and services with every dollar earned in export income, the premise suggests that foreigners are not fully investing the money they earn from U.S. trade back into purchasing American goods and services. Thus, the hypothesis can be considered a plausible and logical extension of the given premise. When the United States runs a trade deficit, it is indicative of a reduced demand for U.S. goods and services from foreigners, who are spending less on American products than they are earning from their exports to the American market.

Write a summary based on this article: A 22-year-old former college swimmer drowned during lifeguard tryouts near Cape Cod, Massachusetts, Saturday night, according to authorities. A graduate of the State University of New York-Cortland, Jack Jakubek was participating in a fitness test for lifeguards at Pilgrim Lake in Orleans, Massachusetts, when he went missing just before 9 a.m., according to the Orleans Fire-Rescue Department. He went under water while trying to swim to a buoy, ABC News Boston affiliate WCVB-TV reported. Several rescue teams responded to the scene, including a dive team, Massachusetts State Police and the United States Coast Guard. Jakubet was found off shore by divers at 9:23 a.m., and efforts to resuscitate him failed as he was brought back to shore by boat, the fire department said. Jakubek was pronounced dead at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis. The Cape and Islands District Attorney's Office is investigating his death, according to the fire department. He had just graduated from SUNY Cortland two weeks before his death, WCVB reported. ABC Jakubek was formally the captain of the swim team at SUNY Cortland, WCVB reported. Jakubek's swim team coach at SUNY Cortland, Brian Tobin, praised his swimming skills and called him a \\"great teammate\\" who \\"everyone could rely on.\\" \\"He was a very good high school swimmer, and over the course of his four years here at Cortland, he continued to improve, progress. He had a tremendous work ethic,\\" Tobin told WCVB. After graduation, Jakubek had hoped to return to Cape Cod to work as a lifeguard, as he did last summer, WCVB reported. ||||| A record-setting college swimmer and recent graduate died Saturday during lifeguard tryouts off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. State University of New York-Cortland 2016 graduate Jack Jakubek was participating in a fitness test for potential lifeguards at Pilgrim Lake in Orleans, Massachusetts, according to statements from the Orleans Fire Department and the University. “At approximately 8:49 a.m. a swimmer went missing,” the fire department said. A multiagency search and rescue operation was immediately launched, including emergency teams from Orleans, Barnstable County, State Police and the U.S. Coast Guard. “A male victim in his 20s was located by divers at 9:23 a.m. off-shore. He was transported by fire to Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, where he was pronounced dead,” the fire department said. Jakubek graduated in May with an outdoor recreation degree, according to SUNY. He was a school record-holder in the 100-yard breaststroke and the 200-yard breaststroke. “Jack was an outstanding athlete, but he was even more remarkable as a person,” said head coach Brian Tobin in a statement. “His loss is devastating to the Red Dragon swimming and diving family, the SUNY Cortland community and beyond.” Tobin said Jakubek planned to return to Cortland in the fall to pursue a master’s degree and work as a graduate assistant coach. “I knew I could depend on him for anything at any time. Jack visited with me the day after graduation, and we talked about his plans for the summer, the next year and life in general. As he walked to the car, I remember being impressed by how he had everything planned out and put together for himself. It makes an unfathomable event like this even harder to comprehend,” said Tobin. Jakubek graduated from Monroe-Woodbury High School in Monroe, New York, in 2012. “Jack is perhaps best remembered for being a star member of the high school swim team,” said Superintendent Elsie Rodriguez in a statement. “Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to Jack’s family and friends at this difficult time.” Jakubek’s death is being investigated by the Cape and Islands District Attorney. #Orleans drowning victim mourned; Jack Jakubek was competitive swimmer, recent college grad https://t.co/0yqgs2rILR pic.twitter.com/mVwTmd2nWl — Cape Cod Times (@capecodtimes) May 30, 2016 ||||| Jack Jakubek was a star swimmer, a passionate young man who knew exactly what he wanted out of life. But his dreams of sharing his love of the outdoors with children were cut tragically short Saturday when he drowned at Pilgrim Lake in Orleans while trying out for a lifeguard position. Jakubek, 22, of Newburgh, New York, slipped beneath the lake's surface during the trials and was later found by an Orleans Fire Department diver in 10 to 15 feet of water, officials said. Jakubek had been a lifeguard in Orleans for at least one other year before this summer, according to town records. Jakubek graduated from the State University of New York at Cortland two weeks ago and was planning to return to the school in the Finger Lakes region of New York this fall for graduate school, said Brian Tobin, the school's head swimming and diving coach. Jakubek was planning to serve as Tobin's graduate assistant and help him coach the swim team in the upcoming year. \\"He was the kind of person who figured out what he wanted out of life and went to get it,\\" Tobin said. \\"You don't see a lot of guys in their early 20s who just know what they want so clearly.\\" Jakubek was a strong competitive swimmer dating back to his high school years in Monroe, New York, according to a profile of him in the SUNY-Cortland swimming and diving team guide. He was a two-time team captain both in high school and in college, where he held several records. \\"He was the teammate everyone wanted to have as a teammate,\\" Tobin said. \\"He made others better, not just his teammates but the coaching staff and pretty much everyone around him. He was an exceptional individual and, in a lot of respects, was very humble about his successes as a swimmer and who he was.\\" Since news of the tragedy reached Tobin, he said he's been on the phone talking with current and former members of the swim team. The overwhelming reaction has been shock, he said, and disbelief that something like this could happen. \\"He is the best guy I know,\\" said Luke Strothenke, a former teammate at SUNY-Cortland. \\"It's a true tragedy.\\" The incident is under investigation by the Orleans police and Massachusetts State Police. Tara Miltimore, spokeswoman for Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe, said Sunday via email there was no new information to release. Jakubek is survived by his parents, Jill Legg and Mark Jakubek, and siblings, Kramer and Anna, according to the school. — Follow Sean F.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I have a new situation: In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. But I can use this background: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. What is an answer for this question: In battle day one would group A have less openings or more openings in their nest thatch? The answer is:","completion":"On battle day one, group A would likely have less openings in their nest thatch. Based on the background information provided, Acromyrmex heyeri ants adjust the number of openings in their nest thatch in response to the temperature and air humidity around their nest. The optimal temperature range for these ants is 20-30°C. On battle day one, the temperature in group A's territory was 5°C, which is significantly lower than the optimal range. As a result, the ants would likely have fewer openings in their nest thatch in an attempt to conserve heat and maintain a stable internal nest temperature. Additionally, the ants close the openings in their nest thatch when the air humidity surrounding their nest decreases. While there is no information about the air humidity on battle day one, it is worth considering that a lower temperature could potentially coincide with lower humidity. If this were the case, it would further support the idea that group A would have fewer openings in their nest thatch to reduce water loss. In conclusion, based on the temperature on battle day one and the ants' behavior in response to changing temperatures and air humidity, it is reasonable to assume that group A would have less openings in their nest thatch on that day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided product review, it appears that the reviewer does not have a favorable opinion of the product, which seems to be related to DC's Batman franchise. The review can be considered unflattering for various reasons, as outlined below: 1. Use of negative language: The title of the review itself, \\"BORING,\\" indicates a strong dissatisfaction with the product. Additionally, the reviewer emphasizes their disinterest by stating they almost fell asleep while watching it. This negative language portrays the product as unexciting and unengaging. 2. Repetitive content: The reviewer explicitly mentions that DC needs to stop with the Batman franchise, as they feel it has been overdone. They argue that the content is repetitive, having seen similar iterations \\"twice\\" before. This criticism implies that the product lacks originality and freshness. 3. Lack of utilization of other DC characters: The reviewer expresses frustration that DC continually relies on Batman and Superman, while they possess a wealth of other characters. This point emphasizes the reviewer's belief that DC's focus on Batman has become tedious, potentially alienating fans of other characters who may seek more diverse stories and protagonists. 4. Unfavorable comparison to Superman: The review makes a comparison between Batman and Superman products, indicating that at least the latter's movies are watchable. This remark unfavorably sets the reviewed product apart from other films within the DC universe, further highlighting its negative portrayal. 5. Critique of the setting: The reviewer also criticizes the setting of Gotham City, describing it as a \\"hole in the ground\\" and suggesting that DC should move on from it. This comment reflects the viewer's dissatisfaction with the recurring themes related to corruption and darkness, which may contribute to their overall negative opinion of the product. In conclusion, the review provided does not depict the product in a flattering light. The reviewer's numerous criticisms and unfavorable comparisons suggest a strong dissatisfaction with the Batman franchise, as well as a desire to see DC explore different characters and storylines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Out of boredom, two scientists from the New Contagious Diseases Research Centre devised themselves a new game. One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system.

How do you do this: How do I make my bed?","completion":"Making your bed is a simple yet important daily task that contributes to maintaining a clean and tidy bedroom atmosphere. By making your bed each morning, you can establish a positive routine, improve your focus and productivity, and cultivate a sense of accomplishment. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to make a bed: 1. Remove pillows and decorative items: Begin by removing all pillows, stuffed animals, and decorative throws from your bed. This will clear the space and make it easier to work. 2. Straighten the fitted sheet: Start with the bottom-most linens, called the fitted sheet, which wraps around the mattress. Pull the elasticized corners snugly over each corner of the mattress, ensuring the fabric is taut and wrinkle-free. If the fitted sheet has come undone during the night, reposition the corners and smooth the fabric across the surface of the mattress. 3. Lay the top sheet: Spread the top sheet (also called the flat sheet) over the fitted sheet evenly, making sure the sheet is aligned with the head, foot, and sides of the bed. The top edge should be at the head of the bed, with the sheet's finished side facing down. This will ensure that when you fold it back, the finished side will be visible. Allow the excess fabric to hang evenly on both sides of the bed. 4. Add a blanket or comforter: Drape your blanket or comforter over the top sheet, ensuring its edges line up neatly with the edges of the top sheet. Smooth the blanket or comforter across the entire surface of the bed, removing any wrinkles or folds. 5. Fold the top sheet: At the head of the bed, fold the top edge of the flat sheet and blanket or comforter back by approximately 12 inches (30 centimeters). This creates a neat and tidy appearance and exposes the sheet's finished side. Optionally, you can also fold the sheet and blanket or comforter down further (about halfway), creating a larger fold. This gives you more space to arrange your pillows. 6. Tuck in the sides: Move to one side of the bed, grasp the edge of the flat sheet and blanket or comforter together, and tuck them neatly under the mattress. To create a hospital corner, lift the hanging edge of the linens about 12 inches (30 centimeters) from the foot of the bed, then tuck the bottom section under the mattress. Now, fold the hanging edge down over the previously tucked section, ensuring it creates a 45-degree angle, and tuck this neatly underneath the mattress. Repeat the process on the other side of the bed. 7. Position your pillows: Place your sleeping pillows back on the bed, arranging them against the headboard or wall. Ensure the pillowcases are free of wrinkles, and the open ends are facing away from the center of the bed. If you have decorative pillows or shams, place these in front of your sleeping pillows. 8. Add finishing touches: Position any decorative throw pillows or blankets that you may have, arranging them to your personal preference. Make any final adjustments to ensure that the bed looks tidy and polished. By following these steps, you can successfully make your bed each day, instilling a sense of routine and organization into your daily life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A primary school teacher hit a boy of six over the head with a ruler so hard it snapped in half, a court heard yesterday. Rina Khan, 41, is accused of calling the child a 'muppet' and hitting him for getting a question wrong. A teaching assistant said part of the ruler 'flew across the room' after the incident on March 20, which left the boy 'sad and scared'. Khan, a full-time teacher for two-and-a-half years who has also worked with the disabled, denies child cruelty and common assault. Prosecutor Peter Arnold said she had been teaching Year Two maths with assistant Joanna Fleary. He said: 'She was having problems with him. Khan was standing behind the youngster when he got a question wrong. The defendant was upset about that and the long and short of it is that she had a plastic ruler in her hand and she hit the boy on the top of his head and the ruler broke. 'What she did was unlawful.' When asked about the incident, the boy said that it had hurt and made him 'sad and scared'. Miss Fleary said she heard Khan, from Smethwick, West Midlands, shouting increasingly loudly. She added: 'I looked up again and a piece of ruler flew across the room.' She said she put a compress on the boy's head, and added that Khan later admitted she had not meant to hit so hard. Khan wept as she told Birmingham Crown Court she loved her pupils at the school, which cannot be named for legal reasons, and denied mistreating them. She said: 'The boy was being really quite disruptive with the pupils next to him. He kept poking a sharp pencil into their arms and he was really reluctant to do his own work. 'He kept doing the same thing. He poked the girl next to him in the arm with the pencil and was pulling faces at her.' Khan claimed she repeatedly told him to stop, but he persisted. 'I turned around. I had to stop him. I have a duty of care to all my pupils. I had a ruler in my hand at that time because I was drawing lines for a pupil and I turned around and simply tapped him on the head.' She said that she was 'really really shocked' that it broke. 'I don't think I used any force. It was just a tap. Those rulers at the school have been known to break.' Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) heard the teacher denies the charges of child cruelty and assault. Khan said she asked the boy if he was hurt and he said no. 'I checked his head for any bruises or bumps. There weren't any. I offered to get medical assistance, but he was OK. 'I did not hit him. If I had hit him, the children would have been frightened. They were not.' She added: 'I did call him a muppet but [not] on that day. I used that word with my children sometimes but as a term of affection, just like The Muppet Show.' Tom Walkling, defending, asked the court: 'Is tapping a naughty boy on the head with a ruler really a criminal assault? Do we want to live in a world where teachers are so afraid of being prosecuted in a criminal court that they are wary of any contact with the children in their care?' The trial continues.

Article:","completion":"Title: Cléon Daniel's Bizarre Gaming Table: Turning Heads and Making Gamers Scratch Their Heads Introduction: In the world of artistic expression, creativity knows no bounds, and British artist Cléon Daniel has certainly proved this notion with his latest work – a bizarre, 8.5 feet long yellow gaming table. Breaking the mold of traditional gaming tables, Daniel's creation has not only captured the attention of gamers and art aficionados alike, but has left many scratching their heads over its quirky design. Step 1: Background of Cléon Daniel Before delving into the intricacies of this peculiar creation, it is essential to touch upon the artist responsible for it. Cléon Daniel, a British artist, is no stranger to defying conventions with his work. Known for his playful yet thought-provoking contemporary art, Daniel enjoys pushing boundaries and encouraging others to rethink the familiar, evident in his unique gaming table. Step 2: Inspiration behind the bizarre gaming table The unconventional table was conceived during one of Daniel's train rides, where he found inspiration amid his surroundings. In a world where artists are constantly in search of new mediums and subjects for their creations, Daniel proves that even seemingly mundane environments can spark innovative ideas. His ability to combine elements of pop culture with fine art creates a unique aesthetic that has struck a chord among a diverse audience. Step 3: Features of the table This 8.5 feet-long gaming table commands attention, not just because of its eye-catching yellow hue, but also its peculiar shape. Unlike conventional gaming tables, which are typically rectangular, Daniel's table resembles a curvy, elongated banana. His unconventional approach challenges the conventionalism associated with gaming tables and triggers curiosity among onlookers.

By Liz Szabo, USA TODAY Authors of a new study hope to begin a debate challenging the conventional wisdom about early detection of breast cancer. In an article in today's , they ask: Do breast tumors ever go away on their own? Researchers of this controversial article note that one type of cancer found through screening — a rare childhood tumor, called neuroblastoma — sometimes disappears. In the new article, researchers try to learn if the same phenomenon occurs with invasive breast cancers found with mammograms. While the authors say it's possible that breast cancers can regress, they acknowledge that their study doesn't provide a definitive answer. Finding a solid answer to the question may be impossible, because it's not ethical to leave breast cancers untreated, according to an editorial that accompanied the article. In the study, American and Norwegian researchers compared the number of breast cancers found in more than 100,000 Norwegian women who were screened every two years with a roughly equal number who received only one mammogram after six years. Women with cancer who are screened more frequently could be diagnosed earlier. But the two strategies should find about the same number of cancers, authors say. Yet doctors actually found 22% more breast cancers among the women who got more frequent mammograms. That raises the possibility that mammograms found cancers that eventually went away — and never needed to be treated, says co-author H. Gilbert Welch of the VA Outcomes Group in White River Junction, Vt. Other experts disputed the study's findings and note that mammograms are proven to save lives. The American Cancer Society recommends most women get annual screenings after age 40. There are many reasons why women screened more frequently might be more likely to be diagnosed with cancer, says the cancer society's Robert Smith. Although a single scan may miss small tumors, doctors may more easily find cancers on repeat mammograms, especially if they compare new results with previous images. With more than 180,000 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in the USA every year, Smith says that doctors would surely have noticed if these tumors were really disappearing. \\"It's important that people not wonder if women lost their breasts for no reason,\\" Smith says. \\"That's a reprehensible conjecture.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of the news article can be summed up as follows: 1. The researchers proposed a controversial theory that breast tumors might sometimes go away on their own, akin to the rare childhood tumor, the neuroblastoma. 2. However, they acknowledged that it is impossible to conclusively prove if the same effect happens in breast cancer cases due to the ethical concerns of leaving such cancers untreated. 3. The research involved comparing data from over 100,000 Norwegian women who were screened every two years, and an equivalent number who had only one mammogram after six years. 4. The findings showed 22% more breast cancer cases among women who had mammograms more frequently, leading to a conjecture that some detected cancers might have regressed on their own without treatment. 5.

Toyota Deals Quickly With GX 460 Problem The company had gotten advance notice from Consumer Reports magazine that it would warn buyers not to buy the vehicle. The magazine said its safety tests had determined the GX 460 had a dangerous handling problem that caused its rear end to swerve and had a risk of rollover. After absorbing the predawn news, a Lexus spokesman said, the Japanese engineer immediately promised to get on it. Later on Tuesday, Toyota announced it was temporarily halting sales of the 52,000 luxury S.U.V., demonstrating that it had learned the lessons of dawdling during a safety crisis — and also reflecting the influence Consumer Reports exerts. While Toyota’s step might have seemed an overreaction under other circumstances, it had no choice given the current climate, auto analysts said Wednesday. “Safety problems and Toyota seem to be lumped together in the zeitgeist right now,” said James Bell, an executive market analyst at Kelley Blue Book, which tracks vehicle trends. Through the years, Consumer Reports’ positive recommendations of Toyota vehicles — the company makes Toyota and Lexus brands — were a factor in the Japanese automaker’s rise to second place in the American car market, behind General Motors. Many car buyers walk into the company’s showrooms carrying the magazine’s car-buying issue. But in late January, Consumer Reports suspended some of its positive recommendations when Toyota temporarily stopped building and selling eight models involved in a recall for sticking accelerator pedals. The company has since resumed production and sales of those vehicles, but the magazine’s positive recommendations have not returned. Ever since, Toyota has been working closely with the magazine’s editors, and Toyota executives said last month that they hoped the return of the positive, or recommended, ratings on those vehicles was imminent. That might help explain why Toyota moved only hours after hearing the magazine’s recommendation on the GX without being prodded by federal safety regulators. On Wednesday, as Lexus dealers provided loaner cars to owners who felt uncomfortable driving their GX models, Toyota engineers were focused on fixing the problem. The engineers were going over the Consumer Reports’ data, video footage and other information about the tests the vehicle had failed. Consumer Reports provided Toyota with the materials, said Ken Weine, a spokesman for the magazine’s parent, Consumers Union. The handling problem arises if the driver of a GX eases off the gas pedal while driving quickly through a sharp turn, the magazine said. That causes the rear end of the vehicle to slide toward the outside of the turn, a condition called “trailing throttle oversteer.” David Champion, the senior director of Consumer Reports auto testing, has theorized the control system was at fault, but Toyota had reached no conclusion on Wednesday. “Our engineering teams are vigorously testing the GX using Consumer Reports’ specific parameters to identify how we can make the GX’s performance even better,” Mark Templin, the general manager of Lexus, said in a statement posted on the division’s Web site. Consumer Reports said it would not let the company use its testing track because of a longstanding policy of barring manufacturers from its test facilities. “We test for consumers. They are our constituency,” Mr. Weine said. “We don’t test for manufacturers or the government.” That means the automaker must try to reproduce the turn and surface at a test facility in Japan, in part relying on satellite photos from Google, said the Lexus spokesman, Bill Kwong. “We are going to try and duplicate it as much as possible,” he said. If they can do so, Mr. Kwong said Toyota engineers would check tires and the vehicle’s suspension as well as the responsiveness of the electronic stability control system, which is meant to stabilize the car. The company’s fast response to the problem, analysts said, showed that the lessons of the last half year, in which Toyota was criticized by federal officials, members of Congress and lawyers for taking too long to deal with safety issues that led to the recall of six million vehicles in the United States and eight million worldwide. Lexus had largely escaped the taint of the recalls even though the highest-profile accident involving a stuck accelerator, involving a former California state trooper and his family, took place in a Lexus ES 350 sedan. Over all, Lexus sales were up in 2010, even before Toyota initiated generous incentives in response to the recalls that caused its sales to soar in March. And it had high hopes for the latest version of the GX, introduced in December and built at a high-tech plant in Tahara, Japan. Lexus has sold 4,787 GX models so far this year, up 180 percent from 2009, when the previous version was phased out. Based on the same frame as the Toyota 4Runner sport utility, the GX starts at 52,800 with destination charges and features a 4.6-liter V-8 engine. Before Consumer Reports “don’t buy” designation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s defects database showed only one consumer complaint about a sliding problem with the vehicle, dated March 10. That complaint had not appeared on the database until Wednesday. A second customer also wrote to the agency on Tuesday, asking for information about the newly publicized problem, the database showed.

The two questions are indeed checking the same fundamental understanding about how solar power operates, specifically with regards to artificial light sources. The underlying principle for both cases involves photovoltaic cells (used in solar panels), which convert light into electricity. While these cells are designed to harness energy from the sun, they can also convert other types of light into electricity, albeit usually at a less efficient rate than sunlight. This means that if a solar-powered calculator or a solar-powered LED light receives enough light from an artificial source, like a compact fluorescent lamp (CFL), a tubelight, or an LED light, it could potentially continue functioning. The first question about the solar-powered calculator is wondering whether artificial light from devices like CFLs and tubelights can be utilized the same way sunlight is used - to generate power. These calculators typically need only a low light level to operate, hence it is possible for them to use artificial light sources. In the second question, it is asking whether a solar-powered LED light could be powered by another LED light. It's essentially wondering if artificial light from an LED could power another solar device, similar to the first question. The key point is whether the light from the first LED is bright enough to be captured by the photovoltaic cells in the second LED's solar panel. However, it’s important to note that while in theory, artificial indoor lights can charge solar panels, in practicality the process would be extremely inefficient and ineffective compared to natural sunlight. They may not produce enough power to effectively charge the device as the intensity of the light does influence the charging efficiency, especially when considering larger devices. The light produced by artificial sources is less intense than sunlight, and generally covers a narrower spectrum of light, which makes them less effective at charging solar devices. Furthermore, solar panels are designed to make use of the full spectrum of light from the sun, so indoor lighting often falls short in offering the ideal light spectrum range. Therefore, while the two questions are essentially asking about the same principle, it's worth taking into account the practical implications of trying to use artificial light as a consistent source of power for solar devices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask your doctor any questions you might have. Have a friend or loved one with you for support, if possible. Get an injection of methotrexate to dissolve the ectopic pregnancy. Consent to surgical treatment, if necessary.","completion":"Title: Dealing with an Ectopic Pregnancy: Guidance, Support, and Treatment Options Introduction Ectopic pregnancies occur when a fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. Unfortunately, these pregnancies are not viable and can be life-threatening if untreated. Navigating an ectopic pregnancy can be emotionally challenging and physically draining. This article will provide guidance for individuals coping with this rare but serious condition, highlighting the importance of support from loved ones, asking questions, and understanding medical treatments such as methotrexate injections and surgical procedures. Acknowledging a Non-Viable Pregnancy Coming to terms with the fact that an ectopic pregnancy is not viable can be incredibly challenging and emotional. It's essential to remember that women experiencing this have done nothing wrong; such pregnancies usually occur due to factors beyond their control. Recognizing the reality of the situation is crucial for making the best decisions moving forward. Feeling grief, anger, or fear is natural, and seeking support from a therapist or support group may help ease these emotions. Asking Questions and Seeking Support from Loved Ones During this challenging time, it's essential to talk to your doctor and ask questions. Understanding the causes and implications of an ectopic pregnancy will help you feel more in control and allow you to make more informed decisions about your treatment. Topics to discuss could include risk factors, potential impacts on future fertility, and ways to additional emotional support, such as counseling or support groups. Having a friend or loved one by your side during this time can provide invaluable emotional support and another person to help listen and ask questions during medical appointments. Do not hesitate to reach out to your support network and lean on them during this time. Methotrexate Injection for Ectopic Pregnancy Once an ectopic pregnancy has been diagnosed, treatment must be initiated to protect your health. Methotrexate is a medication that can be used to dissolve the pregnancy when caught early. It's a chemotherapy drug that works by stopping cell growth, effectively halting the development of the ectopic pregnancy. The injection is given at a hospital or clinic, and patients must be monitored closely with blood tests to ensure the medication is working effectively. Methotrexate injections are a non-surgical option and may be recommended based on factors such as the size and location of the pregnancy, the patient's overall health, and the absence of symptoms like extreme pain or bleeding. Consenting to Surgical Treatment In some cases, methotrexate may not be a suitable option or may not adequately dissolve the ectopic pregnancy. In these instances, surgical intervention becomes necessary. The most commonly performed surgery for an ectopic pregnancy is a laparoscopic procedure, which involves making small incisions in the abdomen and using a camera to guide the surgeon to the affected area. During this surgery, the ectopic pregnancy is removed, and the fallopian tube may be repaired or, in some cases, removed. This procedure has a shorter recovery time compared to open surgery and can usually be performed as an outpatient procedure. Conclusion Coping with an ectopic pregnancy requires emotional and physical resilience. Acknowledging the non-viability of the pregnancy is crucial for decision-making. Seeking medical advice, understanding available treatment options, and having a stable support system can aid in navigating this difficult time. Methotrexate injections and surgical treatments are standard interventions, and your doctor will help determine the best course of action for your individual needs. Remember, you are not alone in this journey, and resources and support are available to help guide you through this challenging experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One day when he was a teenager, Eisenheim (played as young man by Aaron Johnson) meets a traveling magician (David Forest) along a road. The magician performs several tricks for him and then, according to various accounts, both the magician and the tree he was sitting under vanish. Eisenheim becomes obsessed with magic tricks after this.He also falls in love with Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen (Biel, played as a young lady by Eleanor Tomlinson ), a noblewoman well above his social class; her parents have hired Eisenheim's father as a cabinetmaker. Young Eisenheim makes Young Sophie a unique marquetry puzzle locket, which if twisted correctly reveals a small, hidden photograph of Eisenheim. Although the two are forbidden to see each other, they meet in a secret hideout chamber in the woods, where Eisenheim tells of his plans to go to China to learn more magic and Sophie promises to go with him.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person that conducted the December 1900 performance where the man who was called up for military service in 1896 played solo viola?, using the article: Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor., what would be the answer ?

Information: - Sub Pop is a record label founded in 1986 by Bruce Pavitt. In 1988, Sub Pop Records LLC was formed by Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman in Seattle, Washington. Sub Pop achieved fame in the late 1980s for first signing Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and many other bands from the Seattle alternative rock scene. They are often credited with taking the first steps toward popularizing grunge music, and have continued to achieve critical and commercial success in the new millennium, with bands such as Fleet Foxes, Foals, Beach House, The Postal Service, Flight of the Conchords, Sleater-Kinney, Blitzen Trapper, No Age, Wolf Parade and The Shins on their roster. In 1995 the owners of Sub Pop sold a 49% stake of the label to the Warner Music Group. - Jack Endino (born 1964) is an American producer and musician based in Seattle, United States. Long associated with Seattle label Sub Pop and the grunge movement, Endino worked on seminal albums from bands such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, and Nirvana. Endino was also the guitarist for the Seattle band Skin Yard which was active between 1985 and 1992. Endino has maintained a down-to-earth and humorous website since 1997, and currently manages a studio in Seattle called Soundhouse Recording. - Skin Yard was an American grunge band from Seattle, Washington, who were active from 1985 to 1993. The group never gained a mainstream audience, but were an influence on several of their grunge contemporaries, including Soundgarden, Screaming Trees, The Melvins, and Green River. - Blues rock is a fusion genre combining elements of blues and rock. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock. From its beginnings in the early- to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way inspired hard rock, Southern rock, and heavy metal. Blues rock continues to be an influence, with performances and recordings by several popular artists. - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Highlights and Lowlives is the eighth studio album by American rock band Blue Cheer , released in 1990 and produced by Jack Endino . - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals. - \\"Summertime Blues\\" is a song co-written and recorded by American rockabilly artist Eddie Cochran. It was written by Cochran and his manager Jerry Capehart. Originally a single B-side, it was released in August 1958 and peaked at number 8 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 on September 29, 1958 and number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. It has been covered by many artists, including being a number-one hit for country music artist Alan Jackson, and scoring notable hits in versions by The Who and Blue Cheer. Jimi Hendrix performed it in concert. - Stoner rock or stoner metal is a musical subgenre which combines elements of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, acid rock, doom metal, and blues rock. The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \\"stoner rock\\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \\"desert rock.\\" Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \\"retro\\" production. The genre emerged during the early-1990s and was pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. - Soundgarden is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984 by singer and rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell, lead guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. Matt Cameron became the band's full-time drummer in 1986, while bassist Ben Shepherd became a permanent replacement for Yamamoto in 1990. - Blue Cheer was an American rock band that initially performed and recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was sporadically active until 2009. Based in San Francisco, Blue Cheer played in a psychedelic blues rock style, and are also credited as being some of the earliest pioneers of heavy metal, with their cover of \\"Summertime Blues\\" sometimes cited as the first in the genre. They have also been noted as influential in the development of genres as disparate as punk rock, stoner rock, doom metal, experimental rock, and grunge. - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented.

She learns that her talent is to be one of the tinkers, the fairies who make and fix things. Two other tinker fairies, Bobble (Rob Paulsen) and Clank (Jeff Bennett), teach her their craft, and tell her about the fairies who visit the mainland to bring each season. Tinker Bell is thrilled and cannot wait to go to the mainland for spring. While out working, she meets Silvermist (Lucy Liu), a water fairy; Rosetta (Kristin Chenoweth), a garden fairy; Iridessa (Raven-SymonÃ©), a light fairy; and Fawn (America Ferrera), an animal fairy. After meeting them, she notices Vidia (Pamela Adlon), a fast-flying fairy who immediately dislikes her because of her unusually strong talent. Vidia challenges her to prove she will be able to go to the mainland, and Tinker Bell creates several inventions, which she shows to the Minister of Spring (Steve Valentine). But Tinker Bell soon learns from Queen Clarion (Anjelica Huston) that only nature-talent fairies visit the mainland. She tries her hand at nature skills; making dewdrops with Silvermist, lighting fireflies with Iridessa, and trying with Fawn to teach baby birds to fly, but she fails miserably at all of these. Meanwhile, Bobble and Clank cover for Tinker Bell when questioned by Fairy Mary (Jane Horrocks), the tinker fairy overseer. When Tinker Bell returns, she tries to explain, but Mary simply responds that she knows, and expresses her disappointment with Tinker Bell's actions. On the beach, Tinker Bell finds parts of a music box and figures out how to put them together.

This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. and the situation: Jeff and Jeremy were neighbors and best friends since kindergarten. They always enjoyed the same hobbies and did everything together. When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer. Answer the following question: Which sport would Jeff play better do to his size, basketball or soccer? Answer:","completion":"Given Jeff's increased height due to his adolescent growth spurt, he would likely excel better at basketball compared to soccer. Jeff's taller stature would give him an advantage in basketball, as height plays a significant role in this sport, allowing him to more easily reach the basket, win rebounds, and block shots. While height can also provide certain benefits in soccer, such as in aerial challenges and headers, it is not as crucial to success as it is in basketball. Therefore, based on Jeff's size and growth, basketball would be the sport where he may perform better due to his height advantage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The digital portfolio Parker used for modeling was working much better than his print headshot, because the","completion":"digital portfolio could encompass a wider variety of images and interactive content, showcase his work in a more dynamic format, and be constantly updated, making it a more suitable tool for the digital age. First and foremost, the digital modeling portfolio offered flexibility and the capacity to include a greater variety of images and multimedia content such as videos, GIFs, and 3D renders. This was crucial for Parker as it gave him the opportunity to demonstrate a wider range of his modeling abilities and styles. Unlike his print headshot, which was static and captured only one aspect of his personality and appearance, his digital portfolio allowed him to showcase the dynamic aspect of his performances. Modeling is not only about appearance, but about conveying emotions, attitudes and different moods. A digital portfolio enabled Parker to exhibit all these dimensions. Secondly, having his portfolio in a digital format empowered Parker to better express and market himself. Everyone who uses the internet is accustomed to moving images, as they are more engaging than static ones. His potential employers could, with just a click or swipe, get an immediate sense of his movement and modeling prowess, since they weren't just looking at a snapshot but instead could view an entire performance. This interactivity was particularly impactful when applied to video content, especially in our current digital-centric era where video content often takes precedence over static images. Additionally, a digital portfolio could be updated, edited, and curated in real time, constantly evolving and improving to meet industry trends and standards. This meant Parker could include images from his most recent jobs or take out older works as he accumulated newer content. He could also refine and adapt his portfolio with each job application, tailoring his showcased work to better suit the needs and preferences of prospective clients or agencies. On the contrary, a print headshot, once printed, became fixed and uneditable, which could potentially result in a dated representation of his modeling skills over time. Furthermore, the digital portfolio had a much broader reach compared to the print headshot. It could be shared instantly via email, posted to a variety of social media platforms, or linked to a personal website. This ability of easy sharing could potentially reach numerous agencies, photographers, designers, and potential clients, irrespective of geographical boundaries. This greatly increased his chances of being noticed and hired. Lastly, the use of a digital portfolio manifested Parker's ability to keep up with the technological times and proved to potential employers that he was sophisticated, adaptable, and ready to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving industry. His technological savviness was a valuable asset in an industry that is becoming increasingly digital. In conclusion, the transition from traditional, printed headshots to more versatile, dynamic, and accessible digital portfolios provided significant advantages for modern models like Parker. In the fast-paced digital age, adapting to new technological advancements is not just an option but a necessity to stay relevant and competitive in the modeling industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Felicia was a lot more awake and healthier.; 2). Jessica was a lot more awake and healthier.;","completion":"Felicia had a lot more energy than Jessica because Felicia was a lot more awake and healthier. This was due to a variety of factors, such as her lifestyle choices, her diet, and her sleeping patterns. Felicia's dedication to maintaining a balanced life helped her to feel more energetic and focused throughout the day, while Jessica's lifestyle left her feeling lethargic and exhausted. One of the primary reasons Felicia felt more energetic than Jessica was her commitment to engaging in regular physical activity. Felicia made exercise a priority in her life, consistently incorporating activities such as running, swimming, and yoga into her daily routine. This regular exercise not only helped to improve Felicia's overall physical health, but it also allowed her to expel energy in a healthy way and to sleep more soundly at night, both contributing factors to her heightened energy levels during the day. In contrast, Jessica struggled to make time for physical activity, often opting to spend her free time watching television or browsing the internet on her phone. This sedentary lifestyle resulted in lower energy levels, as her body and mind were not stimulated in the same way that Felicia's were through exercise. Additionally, Jessica's lack of regular exercise left her more susceptible to feelings of fatigue and exhaustion during the day. Another important factor contributing to the difference in energy levels between Felicia and Jessica was their diet. Felicia was very mindful of the foods she consumed, paying close attention to the nutrients she was putting into her body. She regularly ate a well-balanced diet of lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, all of which provided her with sustained energy throughout the day. Furthermore, Felicia made it a point to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, which ensured that her body was functioning optimally and preventing any symptoms of dehydration that can cause sluggishness. On the other hand, Jessica's dietary choices were less than ideal. She often opted for convenience and ease, frequently consuming processed foods that were high in sugar, fat, and empty calories. These unhealthy choices left Jessica feeling sluggish and lethargic, as the lack of essential nutrients in her diet did not provide her body with the sustained energy it needed to function properly. Moreover, Jessica's sporadic hydration habits left her prone to dehydration, exacerbating her feelings of fatigue and low energy. Felicia's consistent sleep schedule also played a crucial role in her increased energy levels. She made it a point to get seven to eight hours of sleep each night, ensuring that her body had ample time to recover and repair itself after a long day. This regular sleep pattern allowed Felicia to wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, ready to take on the day ahead. Jessica's inconsistent sleep patterns, in contrast, often left her feeling groggy and tired. She would frequently stay up late at night, either working or browsing on her phone, and then struggle to wake up early the next morning. This irregular sleep schedule greatly impacted her energy levels during the day, leaving her feeling drained and fatigued. In conclusion, the difference in energy levels between Felicia and Jessica can be attributed to their lifestyle choices, dietary habits, and sleeping patterns. Felicia's commitment to living a healthy, balanced life allowed her to maintain consistent energy levels and overall wellbeing, while Jessica's less than ideal choices led to feelings of exhaustion and fatigue. By taking the time to prioritize their own health and well-being, individuals like Felicia can significantly improve their quality of life and daily energy levels, ensuring that they are prepared to tackle whatever challenges their day may hold."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

More Women in Latin America Are Seeking Abortion Pills In countries hit hard by the ongoing Zika outbreak, more women are seeking abortion options, a new report shows. Abortion is illegal in many of the Latin American countries where Zika is spreading. But in the new report published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers analyzed data from the nonprofit Women on Web (WoW), an organization that connects women with restricted abortion access to doctors who can provide abortion medication. Researchers looked at the number of women from 19 Latin American countries who contacted WoW to request abortion medications—the pills mifepristone and misoprostol, which are typically in combination—from January 2010 until March 2016. Their goal was to see if the number of requests changed once Zika became an issue and the link between Zika and birth defects like microcephaly emerged. They did see a change. During that time, the researchers found that the orders spiked between 36% to 108%, depending on the country, in countries with ongoing Zika transmission where abortion is illegal, including Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ecuador, Honduras and Venezuela. Small increases in orders were also seen in Argentina and Peru, where abortion is also illegal but where there is not ongoing Zika transmission. While the researchers say they can’t confirm that Zika is definitely the cause of the uptick for the countries, the number of women who said that Zika was the reason they were seeking abortion also increased. Government warnings may also play a role in the rise. Requests for abortion increased significantly in Latin American countries where the governments issued warnings to pregnant women regarding Zika-related complications, though the researchers say that increase could be even larger in reality. “Our approach may underestimate the effect of the advisories on demand for abortion, since many women may have used an unsafe method, accessed misoprostol from local pharmacies or the black market, or visited local underground providers,” the study authors write. “But accurate data on these choices are difficult to obtain.” A large number of pregnant women are infected with Zika worldwide. A report on the situation in Colombia recently revealed that around 12,000 pregnant women have been infected, and well over 200 pregnant women in the U.S. have gotten Zika. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. There is an increasing trend of women in Latin American countries seeking abortion options due to the ongoing Zika outbreak. 2. Abortion is illegal in many Latin American countries, which are also experiencing the spread of Zika. 3. Researchers analyzed data from the nonprofit organization Women on Web (WoW), which connects women with restricted abortion access to doctors providing abortion medication, to determine if there was a link between a rise in abortion requests and the spread of Zika. 4. Orders for abortion medication in countries with ongoing Zika transmission where abortion is illegal saw an increase of 36% to 108%. 5. Government warnings regarding Zika-related complications may have played a role in the increase in abortion requests. 6. The researchers suggest that the actual increase in demand for abortion could be higher than their findings, as accurate data regarding other methods used by women is difficult to obtain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The weathering of rocks and minerals can be mechanical or chemical. Mechanical weathering changes the size of a mineral or rock. Mechanical weathering does not change the chemical composition of that material. Chemical weathering changes the composition of a mineral or rock. Different types of weathering can alter the same material. Soil forms on top of rock. The type of soil that forms depends on the environment of the region. For example, warm and wet climates form different soils than cold and dry climates. A profile through the soil shows different horizons. Topsoil is the most important layer for crops. Water, ice, wind, and gravity create or modify landforms on Earth's surface. These agents can erode or deposit features that indicate their presence. Erosion by water and ice lowered and rounded the Appalachians. These old mountains no longer look like the Himalaya. Someday the Himalaya may look like the Appalachians do now. Q: What kind of weathering changes the size of a mineral or rock but does not change its chemical composition? Choices: - molecular weathering - chemical reaction - radiation - mechanical weathering A: The answer is:","completion":"mechanical weathering. Mechanical weathering is the type of weathering that changes the size of a mineral or rock without altering its chemical composition. This process occurs through various means, such as freeze-thaw cycles, the growth of plant roots, abrasion by water or wind, and thermal expansion and contraction caused by temperature fluctuations. These different mechanisms break down rocks and minerals into smaller fragments, preserving their original chemical makeup. On the other hand, chemical weathering alters the composition of minerals or rocks through processes like dissolution, oxidation, and hydrolysis, which lead to the formation of new minerals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In general, people talk about two groups of colours warm colours and cool colours. Researchers in psychology think that there are also two groups of people people who prefer warm colours and people who prefer cool colours. The warm colours are red, orange and yellow. Where there are warm colours and a lot of light, people usually want to be active. People think that red, for example, is exciting. Sociable people, those who like to be with others, like red. The cool colours are green, blue and violet. These colours, unlike warm colours , are relaxing. Where there are cool colours, people are usually quiet. People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue. Red may be exciting, but one researcher says that time seems to pass more slowly in a room with warm colours than in a room with cool colours. He suggests that a warm colour, such as red or orange is a good colour for a living room or restaurant. People who are relaxing or eating do not want time to pass quickly. Cool colours are better for offices or factories if the people who are working there want time to pass quickly. Researchers do not know why people think some colours are warm and other colours are cool. However, almost everyone agrees that red, orange, and yellow are warm and that green, blue and violet are cool. Perhaps warm colours remind people of warm days and the cool colours remind them of cool days. Because in the north the sun is higher during summer, the hot summer sunlight appears yellow. Question: Which of the following statements is not true? Yes or no, is the answer \\"People who like to be with others don't like red.\\"?

He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. - Historical regions (or historical countries) are delimitations of geographic areas for studying and analysing social development of period-specific cultures without any reference to contemporary political, economic or social organisations. The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period. - Basileus is a Greek term and title that has signified various types of monarchs in history. In the English-speaking world it is perhaps most widely understood to mean \\"king\\" or \\"emperor\\".

It is directly to the south of the countries of Bactria , Arachosia and Drangiana , to the east of the country of Carmania and due west of the Indus River which formed a natural boundary between it and Western India . The native name of Gedrosia might have been Gwadar as there are two towns by that name and a bay ( Gwadar Bay ) in central Makran . The Gedrosians are known to have successfully defeated the Indian Mauryans capturing the western-most parts of their state . Following his army 's refusal to continue marching east at the Hyphasis River in 326 BC , Alexander the Great crossed the area after sailing south to the coast of the Indian Ocean on his way back to Babylon . Upon reaching the Ocean , Alexander the Great divided his forces in half , sending half back by sea to Susa under the command of Nearchus . The other half of his army was to accompany him on a march through the Gedrosian desert , inland from the ocean . Throughout the 60 day march through the desert , Alexander lost at least 12,000 soldiers , in addition to countless livestock , camp followers , and most of his baggage train . Some historians say he lost three - quarters of his army to the harsh desert conditions along the way . However , this figure was likely based on exaggerated numbers in his forces prior to the march , which were likely in the range of no fewer than 30,000 soldiers . There are two competing theories for the purpose of Alexander the Great 's decision to march through the desert rather than along the more hospitable coast . The first argues that this was an attempt to punish his men for their refusal to continue eastward at the Hyphasis River . The other argues that Alexander was attempting to imitate and succeed in the... - Ariana, the Latinized form of the Ancient Greek \\"Ar(e)ian\\" (inhabitants: \\"\\"; \\"Ar(e)ianoi\\"), was a general geographical term used by some Greek and Roman authors of the ancient period for a district of wide extent between Central Asia and the Indus River, comprehending the eastern provinces of the Achaemenid Empire that covered the whole country of modern day Afghanistan, and a few parts of Pakistan, Tajikistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. - Gwadar Bay is located in the Gulf of Oman on the maritime border of Pakistan and Iran.

In its lower course it is much used for irrigation, under the control of the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority, and the valley is cultivated and populous; yet the water is said to be somewhat brackish. It is doubtful whether the ancient Arachotus is to be identified with the Arghandab or with its chief confluent the Tarnak, which joins it on the left out SW of Kandahar. The Tarnak, which flows south of Kandahar, is much shorter (length about 320 km or 200 miles) and less copious. The ruins at Ulan Robat, supposed to represent the city Arachosia, are in its basin; and the lake known as Ab-i-Istada, the most probable representative of Lake Arachotus, is near the head of the Tarnak, though not communicating with it.

A:","completion":"No, you should not validate the suggested answer, as it does not directly address the question of where the island of New Guinea is located. Instead, a more appropriate and detailed response would be: New Guinea is a large island located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It is the world's second-largest island, covering an area of approximately 785,753 square kilometers (303,381 square miles). It is situated just north of the Australian continent, specifically the Cape York Peninsula, and is separated by the narrow Torres Strait. The island lies between the equator and 10 degrees south latitude and stretches from 130 degrees to 150 degrees east longitude. Administratively, New Guinea is divided into two regions: the western half belongs to Indonesia as the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while the eastern half constitutes the independent country of Papua New Guinea. The island is characterized by its densely forested, mountainous terrain, with the highest peak, Puncak Jaya at 4,884 meters (16,024 feet) above sea level. The island of New Guinea is home to diverse indigenous ethnic and linguistic groups. In fact, it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse regions in the world. Austronesian languages are indeed spoken on parts of the coast and on offshore islands, as the suggested answer mentions. However, the island is also home to hundreds of other non-Austronesian languages belonging to the Papuan language family, spoken by various indigenous peoples across the island. In summary, an appropriate answer to the question of where the island of New Guinea is located should focus on its position in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, the division between the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua and the nation of Papua New Guinea, as well as its geographical characteristics. While the linguistic diversity of the island is noteworthy, it should not be the primary focus of the answer to this specific question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The sentence \\"Atrag atenția asupra ratei mari a abandonului școlar\\" is Romanian. Translated into English, it means \\"I draw attention to the high rate of school dropout\\". The phrase denotes a concern for the significant percentage of students who abandon their education prior to completion. This matter is seen globally and is a focal point for educational institutions, policymakers, and social workers alike as it broadly impacts society. A high school dropout rate can indicate several potential issues within a society, including deficiencies in the education system, socio-economic problems, such as poverty and unemployment, and personal issues faced by students, including academic difficulty, lack of family support or behavioral problems. Tackling high dropout rates requires a comprehensive approach. This begins with understanding the root causes, which could include factors such as school policies, school climate, academic achievement, socio-economic status, or personal choices. Then, relevant interventions can be designed to address these issues. To outline a few examples, these interventions could entail modifying school policies to make them more supportive of students who are struggling, adjusting the learning environment to make it more inclusive and safe, providing additional academic support to students who are having trouble with their studies, offering financial aid to students from low-income families, or providing counseling to students who may be dealing with personal issues that are affecting their ability to focus on school. A part of the solution would also invlove societal reform such as creating stable jobs, tackling poverty, increasing living standards, and elevating the perceived value of education within the community. The goal would be to construct an environment where dropping out of school is not seen as an acceptable or necessary option. Data tracking is another important tool that can support addressing the dropout issue. Data can provide insight into dropout patterns (e.g., which grades account for the most dropouts, which types of schools are most susceptible to high dropout rates, etc.) and can help to design interventions that are targeted to specific needs. Innovative teaching methods, early intervention programs, after-school programs, mentorship programs, and positive behavioral intervention strategies are other strategies that have proven effective in combating dropping out. In summary, drawing attention to the high rate of school dropout is an issue of great significance. It is essential to approach these rates not merely as numbers, but as indicative of wider societal issues and a call to action for systemic changes in education, societal support structures, policies, and community values."},{"prompt":"Build a movie plot around this: William points out that the murders are tied to a book written in what language?

The authorities are doing their best in utilizing available resources, but without any credible evidence or tangible leads, the case appears to be stuck in limbo. Despite the obstacles they face, the 10 investigators dedicated to William's case remain committed to finding answers for the distraught family. They firmly believe that someone, somewhere, must know something about the baffling events that led to William's disappearance. William's loved ones and the community pin their hopes on these investigators to unravel the mystery and reunite them with the vivacious little boy they so fondly remember. Throughout this ordeal, the local community has rallied around the family, offering support and assistance in any way possible. Candlelight vigils and fundraisers have been organized to raise awareness about William's case and remind everyone to keep an eye out for any information that may lead to his whereabouts. As every new day passes, the concern for William continues to grow, but so does the determination to find him. The police and investigators tirelessly working on the case urge the public to come forward with any information that could aid in the search, no matter how insignificant it may seem. The collective effort of the entire community, law enforcement, and the public at large is integral to cracking this enigmatic case. We must continue to work together to bring light to the truth – and, most importantly, to bring little William Tyrell back to his family where he belongs. In the meantime, the family and the entire nation hold onto hope and pray that the investigators' combined efforts will eventually yield a breakthrough.

Here is an article: ROELAND PARK, Kan. – Touched by the plight of a homeless man forced to walk several hours a day to his job, a Kansas police officer stepped up with a gesture that brought the man to tears. Roeland Park officer Zack Stamper says he was just doing his job last week when he gave Samuel Meixueiro a bicycle to ride to and from the man's work as a liquor store cashier. Stamper threw in a duffel bag to replace Meixuero's suitcase, which had a broken zipper. The kindness drew tears from Meixueiro, who says he's been staying in a church while trying to save money for an apartment. Stamper's gesture came after he was dispatched to investigate a report of a suspicious person in a park. That person turned out to be Meixueiro, who explained to Stamper his situation — and the foot-pounding treks to the job Meixueiro said he couldn't afford to lose. So Stamper drove the man to work that day. The officer retrieved a duffel bag from his basement and a bicycle from the department's assortment of surrendered or abandoned ones. Stamper spiffed up the bike and inflated its tires, ultimately surprising Meixueiro with the cycle and the duffel bag at his workplace.

The store is located in a fictional city in Delaware, and, like its employees, is eclectic and unique. The staff is very much a surrogate family, with Joe as the reluctant and perpetually exasperated but loveable father figure. When his young staff experience problems in their personal lives, he routinely reminds them they can seek him out for advice. The film opens with store manager Joe allowing employee Lucas (Rory Cochrane) his first opportunity to close the store, an opportunity Lucas regards as an honour. While counting the day's receipts in Joe's office, Lucas snoops and discovers that Empire Records is about to be bought and converted into a branch of Music Town, a large national music store with many franchises. In an effort to keep the store independent, Lucas takes the day's cash receipts totaling 9,000 to a casino in Atlantic City in an attempt to quadruple it via gambling. Lucas believes this act will create enough money to allow Joe to save Empire Records. Though initially doubling the money, Lucas soon loses the entire amount in one bet on a dice table. Instead of going home he sleeps on his motorcycle outside the store, where he is found the following morning by opening manager A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) and fellow employee Mark (Ethan Embry).

Movie title: The Tingler Movie plot: A pathologist, Dr. Warren Chapin (Price), discovers that the tingling of the spine in states of extreme fear is due to the growth of a creature that every human being seems to have, called a \\"Tingler\\", a parasite attached to the human spine. It curls up, feeds and grows stronger when its host is afraid, effectively crushing the person's spine if curled up long enough. The host can weaken the creature and stop its curling by screaming. Movie theater owner Oliver Higgins (Coolidge), who shows exclusively silent films, is an acquaintance of Dr. Chapin. Higgins's wife Martha (Evelyn), who is deaf and mute, dies of fright after weird, apparently supernatural events have occurred in her room. During her autopsy, Chapin removes the Tingler from her spine. After they have contained the Tingler and return to Higgins' house, it is revealed that Higgins is the murderer; he frightened his wife to death knowing that she could not scream because she was mute. The centipede-like creature eventually breaks free from the container that held it in and is released into the theater where the deaf mute woman ran before she died. Chapin wishes not to tell anyone, knowing it would start a panic. The Tingler latches onto a woman's leg, and she screams until it releases its grip. Chapin controls the situation by shutting off the lights and telling everyone in the theater to scream. When the Tingler has left the showing room, they resume the movie and go to the projection room where they find the Tingler and capture it. Guessing that the only way to neutralize the Tingler is to reinsert it inside Martha's body, Chapin does so. After he leaves, Higgins, who has admitted his guilt to Chapin, is alone in the room. As if by supernatural forces, the door slams shut and locks itself and the window closes, echoing what happened just before Martha was frightened to death.

Answer:","completion":"The event with a long history in reference to the timing you mentioned is the celebration of Carnival, also known as Fastelavn, Shrove Tuesday, and Maslenitsa. These festivities have been held in various countries and regions around the world, with their origins and practices often connected to the religious and cultural backgrounds of the local people. Carnival is a period of festivities that precedes the Christian liturgical season of Lent, a time of fasting and penitence in preparation for Easter. Throughout history, it has been celebrated in regions with strong Roman Catholic connections, such as Latin America, Europe, and some parts of the United States. The Carnival season typically involves public celebrations, masquerade balls, parades, and other lively events, often characterized by indulgence in food, drink, and merrymaking before the more austere time of Lent. In countries with a predominantly Lutheran Church, such as Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, the celebration goes by the name Fastelavn. It usually involves children dressing up in costumes, participating in community events, and enjoying traditional treats. Similarly, in areas with Anglican and Methodist congregations, pre-Lenten celebrations take place on Shrove Tuesday, also known as Pancake Day, Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday. These events often involve the consumption of rich and indulgent foods, most notably pancakes, before the fasting period begins. The Eastern Orthodox Church also has a unique way of observing the pre-Lenten period through the celebration of Maslenitsa, also called Butter Week, Pancake Week, or Cheesefare Week. This is the last week before the start of Great Lent, and it is marked by feasting on pancakes, bliny, or crepes, which symbolize the sun and the coming of the warmer spring months. These celebrations often involve family gatherings, public events, and farewell parties for the beloved. In German-speaking countries and the Netherlands, the Carnival season has a unique opening date: the 11th of November, precisely at 11:11 a.m. The tradition of celebrating at this time can be traced back to Advent celebrations or to harvest festivities associated with St. Martin's Day. In conclusion, the event with a long and varied history of celebration is the Carnival season, with its diverse names and customs across different cultures and religious traditions. The core theme of these festivities is the indulgence and enjoyment of life before the subsequent period of fasting and penitence during Lent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The equation has -21550*w and 21587*w as the terms with the variable w. Combine these terms to simplify the equation: 518 = (-21550 + 21587) * w Step 2: Calculate the combined coefficient for w. The combined coefficient is the sum of -21550 and 21587: -21550 + 21587 = 37 So now the equation is: 518 = 37 * w Step3: Isolate the variable w by dividing both sides of the equation by 37. 518 / 37 = 37 * w / 37 Step 4: Calculate the value of w. 518 / 37 = 14 So w = 14.

Choices: - call the police - doing drugs - new contacts - making new friends - plan The rationale to choose \\"doing drugs\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the question and the given choices The question asks about the likely activities to occur at a party in an alley. We have to choose one of the following choices: calling the police, doing drugs, making new contacts, making new friends, or planning something. Step 2: Assess the context Alley parties are not typically conventional party locations and may be associated with some form of underground or illicit activities. It's important to consider the context and setting while exploring the possible answer. Step 3: Evaluate each choice - Calling the police: While it may be possible for someone to call the police due to potential illegal activities, it is unlikely to be the most common event that occurs at an alley party, as people attending would most likely be aware of the potential risks involved. - Doing drugs: Alley parties, due to their unconventional nature, may attract individuals engaged in illegal activities such as drug use or distribution. - Making new contacts: While attendees may meet new people at the party, this option isn't as specific as others to the context of an alley party. - Making new friends: Similar to making new contacts, making new friends is a possibility at any party but doesn't carry unique significance given the scenario. - Planning something: It is difficult to determine the specificity of \\"planning something\\" as it pertains to the alley party, so we cannot conclude that this is the most likely outcome. Step 4: Choose the most likely option Based on the context of an alley party, which implies a potentially unconventional or underground gathering, the most likely activity to occur at the party is \\"doing drugs.\\" This is because the underground nature of such an event could attract individuals who are more prone to engage in illicit activities like drug use or distribution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

All the Korean ambassadors have died, leaving the inexperienced general to take charge. The soldiers arm themselves and quickly discover that the Mongols have kidnapped the Ming Emperor's daughter. They ambush the Mongols and rescue the princess. Yeo-sol, the former slave of an ambassador, defeats the injured Mongolian general Rambulwha in single combat, but allows him to live and escape.The Koreans flee with the Princess, determined to return her safely to the Ming Emperor to atone for their diplomatic failure. The Mongols pursue, hoping to recover the Princess and marry her to the Yuan Emperor so that he may legitimize his claim over all China. Koreans head for a seaside fortress that the Princess tells them about, where they expect to find safe haven. Along the way, the Koreans pick up a group of Chinese peasants who are also fleeing from the Mongols.Fighting their way through Mongol search parties, the group experiences many internal conflicts stemming from social class, love, and honor.

Write an article based on this \\"A survey by BBC Radio 5 live has suggested a large majority (83%) of women think that men and women are not always equal in the workplace.\\"","completion":"Title: The Workplace Equality Gap: Are Men and Women Always Treated Equally? Introduction A recent survey conducted by BBC Radio 5 Live has reignited discussions about the continuing disparity in the workplace for men and women. The survey found that a staggering 83% of women believe that men and women are not always treated equally in their work environment. This article aims to delve deeper into the issue of workplace equality and investigate the possible reasons, consequences, and potential ways to close the gap. Step 1: Examining the reasons for workplace inequality The existence of workplace inequality can be attributed to various factors, ranging from cultural and social norms to organizational policies and individual biases. Let's examine a few common reasons that underlie the unequal treatment of men and women at work: 1. Stereotyping and unconscious bias: Preconceived notions of gender roles can influence hiring practices, promotion decisions, and task allocation, leading to unequal opportunities for women in the workplace. 2. Pay gap: Women continue to face discrepancies in their pay compared to their male counterparts, earning on average 80 cents on the dollar compared to men, according to recent data from the Institute for Women's Policy Research. 3. Glass ceiling: The difficulty faced by women in breaking through the upper echelons of leadership can further exacerbate workplace inequality. Step 2: Consequences of workplace inequality The unequal treatment of men and women in the workplace has repercussions not just for the employees themselves but also for companies and society as a whole. Some potential consequences of workplace inequality include: 1. Retention issues: Unequal treatment can lead to increased attrition rates, as women may not feel valued and well-supported in their roles, resulting in higher turnover costs for businesses. 2. Lower morale and productivity: A lack of fairness in the workplace can lead to poor employee morale and can negatively impact the overall productivity of the company. 3. Missed opportunities for innovation and growth: A diverse workforce promotes creativity and innovation, and companies that do not foster an equitable environment may miss out on the unique perspectives and contributions that women bring to the decision-making table. Step 3: Implementing solutions to promote workplace equality To address the issue of workplace inequality, there is a need for concerted efforts by both employers and employees to bring about change. Here are a few steps that can be taken to promote a more equitable work environment: 1. Education and awareness: Encourage conversations about workplace equality, provide training on recognizing unconscious biases, and foster an environment in which employees feel comfortable discussing their concerns. 2. Transparent hiring and promotion practices: Implementing an unbiased recruitment process that emphasizes objective performance criteria, rather than personal characteristics, can mitigate gender gaps in hiring, pay, and promotions. 3. Flexible work policies: Adopting family-friendly policies, such as providing robust maternity leave options and flexible working arrangements, can enable women who have taken time off for family reasons to return to the workforce and continue to progress in their careers. 4. Mentorship and leadership development programs: Encourage the development of women by providing mentorship opportunities and supporting leadership development programs that are specifically tailored to women. Conclusion It is clear that workplace inequality remains a significant challenge, given the large percentage of women who believe that men and women are not always treated equally at work. To close the equality gap, employers and employees must actively strive to foster a culture in which women's contributions are recognized and rewarded equally to those of their male counterparts. By doing so, companies can not only create a fairer environment for all employees but also benefit from the increased diversity within the organization, thereby paving the way for more innovative and successful businesses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At times last week it seemed some were ready to award Chelsea the Premier League title on the back on a 3-1 win at Burnley. And though in the end they did re-discover some of that momentum on Saturday, the over-riding lesson of their victory over Leicester was the stark reminder that Chelsea’s season will be a degree tougher in the long run and that they still struggle against well-organised teams. True, they won comfortably enough in the end with goals from Diego Costa and Eden Hazard. And they could even afford a carnival moment towards the end, with Didier Drogba coming on, a hero returning to his natural home, on 79 minutes. Joy: Diego Costa runs off in celebration after breaking the deadlock for Chelsea against OPTIONS: - Blues on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Burnley on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Chelsea on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - David Nugent on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Didier Drogba on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Diego Costa on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Eden Hazard on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Goalscorer Costa on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Jose Mourinho on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Leicester on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Leicester City on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Nigel Pearson on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Premier League on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win - Thibaut Courtois on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win","completion":"Based on the context provided in the paragraph, the sentence is likely to end as: \\"Joy: Diego Costa runs off in celebration after breaking the deadlock for Chelsea against Chelsea on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win.\\" The main focus of the paragraph is Chelsea's performance in the Premier League, and in particular, the contribution of Diego Costa in their victory over Burnley. The sentence preceding the incomplete one talks about Costa's role, so it would make sense for him to be the subject of the celebratory moment described. The mention of his 'home Premier League debut' and the '2-0 win' are cues that suggest this option. Other options mentioning different individuals or teams, don't align well with the paragraph's discussion about Diego Costa's instrumental role in Chelsea's performance. However, alternatively, the correct context could be: \\"Joy: Diego Costa runs off in celebration after breaking the deadlock for Chelsea against Leicester on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win.\\" The mention of Chelsea's victory over Leicester in the paragraph could be closely associated with Diego Costa's celebration, as he was one of the main contributors with his goal in the match. These key points in the context of the paragraph make the option a possible fit to complete the sentence. So, considering the direction of the narrative, either of these options could plausibly complete the sentence depending on the exact match and moment being referred to. It would be more concrete if the exact match in which Diego Costa broke the deadlock on his home Premier League debut was explicitly mentioned."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The observation might help explain how all whales hear. The work might also help scientists understand how animals are affected by underwater sonar . This sonar, used by some ships, sends out sound waves to locate underwater objects. The Cuvier's beaked whale is a so-called toothed whale. Toothed whales dive deep into the ocean in search of food. As the whales hunt, they produce sounds that reach objects and then return to the whales. This allows the animals to \\"see\\" the shape, size, and location of objects, even when they're 1,000 meters under the sea, where it is totally dark. To better understand how the whale hears, researchers from San Diego State University in California took X-rays of two Cuvier's beaked whales. The whales had died and washed up on the beach. Ted Cranford and his colleagues used the images to make a computer model of a Cuvier's beaked whale's head. Then, they modeled the process of sound traveling through the head. The researchers knew that some sounds get to the ears of a toothed whale through a structure called \\"the window for sound\\". Found on the lower jaw, this structure is very thin on the outside and has a large pad of fat on the inside. When the researchers used their computer model to work out how sound waves travel in the whale's head, they were surprised to find that sounds coming from right in front of the whale actually travel under the animal's jaw. From there, sound waves move through the throat, into a hole in the back of the jaw, and finally to the pad of fat near the animal's ears. Cranford guesses that other types of whales may hear through their throats. Further testing is needed to be sure. Eventually, the insight into how whales hear might explain whether sonar testing by military ships is causing the animals to wind up on beaches. Researchers took X-rays of two Cuvier's beaked whales in order to _ .

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the person that conducted the Tchaikovsky symphony? , can you please find it? Between the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, \\"I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday\\". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, \\"Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?\\"In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior. Jacobs describes it as \\"a marriage of perfect professional and private harmony\\". As a singer, with Wood as her accompanist, she won praise from the critics.

Let's analyze both sentences in more detail to understand the logical connection. In the first sentence, \\"However, it began life with a totally different purpose.\\", the statement informs that an object, idea, or concept began or was created with an entirely different purpose or intention than the one it is currently associated with or known for. This suggests that there has been at least one alteration or shift in its purpose throughout its existence. The second sentence, \\"It changed purposes throughout its life.\\", further emphasizes that the object, idea, or concept experienced changes in its purposes or functions during its existence or time in use. Essentially, this sentence reinforces the idea that the original purpose was altered or evolved in some way, which had already been implied by the first sentence. In conclusion, when the first sentence is true, which states that something began its life with an entirely different purpose, it implies the occurrence of a change in its purpose.

Article: You may notice that the other person always has to decide when you do something together and what you do. If they are a commitment phobe, this may be because they want to see you when they want to see you and don’t want to commit to taking time out of their schedule otherwise. If you make plans, they may cancel, be late, or not show at all. The more time you spend with someone, the more serious the relationship starts to become. If you are with a commitment phobe, when things start to get more serious, they may distance themselves or break it off completely. Commitment phobes love the excitement of starting to date and then the passion at the beginning of a relationship. After that is over, they lose interest. Commitment phobes only show interest when things are exciting, romantic, or fun. If you try to come to them with problems, they are not interested or understanding. People who are commitment phobic tend to have many short relationships. Casually ask about their relationships. If they divert the topic away, or they have only had short casual flings, the person may be a commitment phobe. Some people have limited dating experience. This does not mean they are a commitment phobe. There are many factors that lead to someone not dating often. Some commitment phobes have been in long relationships. These usually end with no visible signs of commitment. If you are involved with a commitment phobe, you may have no clue what your relationship actually is. You don’t know if you’re dating, if you’re a couple, or something more. You probably haven’t talked about your relationship or the future. If you bring up what your relationship is, they change the subject, get defensive, or wonder why you want to label what you have. Commitment phobic people have trouble labeling the relationship or their feelings. They may feel uncomfortable with those words because they are too confining or they point to a commitment. If you say the words, they may be uncomfortable or try to explain away why they won’t say the same thing. For example, these people won’t use terms like girlfriend or boyfriend. They also won’t say that they love you. Try calling the other person your \\"boyfriend\\" or \\"girlfriend\\" or say, \\"I love you.\\" See how they react. However, only do this if you really feel this way about the person. Don’t say “I love you” or put a label on your relationship as a test. People who are commitment phobic may respond in a more sexual way than an emotional way. They are interested in passion and equate intimacy with sex, but not the connection and emotions that can accompany sex. Think about if they only want to be around if you’re going to be sexual. If you want to go out, do something with friends, or mention you’re not interested in having sex on this date, they may not be interested.

Many studies on happiness give negative answers. Here are some points in being happy. Basic Human Needs Must Be Met People whose basic needs for shelter, clothing and food are not met will find it very difficult to feel happy. Of course, there are exceptions, but for most of us, we can only be happy once our basic needs are met. The Joneses Cannot Be Escaped People's happiness is not determined by how much they have, but by how much people around them have. So, we tend to feel happy once our basic needs are met and we have more than the people surrounding us. This means that while keeping up with _ could be destructive if we let it go too far. It is also part of humana nature to want to feel at least on the same level, financially, as those surrounding us. You Should Escape The Rat Race We should know the importance of staying out of the rat race. So yes, you need to work hard, get the education you need to land a good job and work long enough and hard enough to get to a place where you can easily meet your basic needs. What are basic needs? For most middle or upper middle class Americans, basic needs are not very basic anymore. For most of us, once our basic needs have been met, happiness is achieved when we engage in activities we like, spend time with friends and family and stay active. Making money for the sake of making money does not make people happy. Ideally, these questions should be answered when you're still young and just starting out. Don't wait until your midlife crisis to realize that half your life has passed you by and you're still unhappy. Question: In the view of the author, we know that _ .

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who left the atelier after a week? , can you please find it? Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that \\"I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy\\" and complaining of \\"the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth\\" which he considered \\"such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it\\". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student. Etty was disqualified from the competition, but the high quality of his...

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Hippos have always attracted people's interest. Modern hippos in Walt Disney movies can dance lightly. A stone hippo in a 13th-century church in France has wings. And in ancient Egyptian fairy tales, the hippo was a goddess that guided the dead to the afterworld. Despite their popular appeal, hippos, as well as other animals, have difficulty when their needs conflict with those of humans. The early Egyptians liked to hunt hippos for their teeth and because they were dangerous animals. Amulets to protect babies from demons were made from hippo bones. About 4,000 years ago, there were so many hippos in Egypt that they caused serious crop damage. Egyptian farmers killed them routinely, and by the beginning of the 19th century, all the hippos in Africa had been killed. People used to see hippos fight in the arenas of ancient Rome. After the fall of the Roman Empire, hippos weren't seen in Europe again until a few zoos began to exhibit them in the mid 1800s. All the various uses and abuses of hippos through the centuries have made their population fall greatly. Where they do occur, mostly in national parks, they live in such high density that they make the grasslands bare. This causes other grass-eating animals to go farther for food, and hippos, which can't live far from water, destroy their own feeding grounds. Question: Apart from protecting crops, what's the main reason for people to kill hippos? - To save other animals. - To satisfy personal demands. - To look for guidance after death. - To follow the routine established by the Egyptians. Answer:","completion":"The main reason people killed hippos, apart from protecting crops, was to satisfy personal demands. According to the article, the early Egyptians hunted hippos for their teeth and because they were considered dangerous animals. Also, hippo bones were used to make amulets to protect babies from demons. Therefore, their killing was not primarily for ecological reasons such as saving other animals, but rather to fulfill human wants and fears."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: He was ageless, neither young nor old. Hypothesis: He was 15 years old. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise \\"He was ageless, neither young nor old\\" describes a situation where the age of the person cannot be determined or simply does not apply. The term 'ageless' implies that the individual does not exhibit characteristics or features that can be associated with any specific age group, be it young, middle-aged, or old. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"He was 15 years old\\" asserts that the individual in question is indeed 15 years of age, which places them in the category of being young. As a result, the hypothesis clearly contradicts the premise, as it attempts to assign a specific age to a supposedly ageless person. To further analyze the compatibility between the premise and the hypothesis, let us consider the definition of entailment. In logic, one statement entails another statement if the truth of the first statement (the premise) guarantees the truth of the second statement (the hypothesis). In other words, if the premise is true, the hypothesis must be true as well, and if the premise is false, the entailment does not hold. In this particular case, the premise \\"He was ageless, neither young nor old\\" cannot guarantee the truth of the hypothesis \\"He was 15 years old.\\" In fact, the premise negates the hypothesis, as an ageless individual cannot be assigned a specific age, let alone be categorized as young or old. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. To conclude, the premise \\"He was ageless, neither young nor old\\" does not entail the hypothesis \\"He was 15 years old.\\" The two statements are incompatible, as the premise suggests the absence of a specific age while the hypothesis attempts to assign the individual a precise age and place them within a particular age group."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gym class and programmes at school can also be a way to try new sports with a mix of kids. Another way to learn about a sport is to watch instructional videos or DVDs or check out library books that explain the rules and offer advice for kids to learn to play them. If you have an older friend or family member who's good at a sport, you might ask him or her to help you practice.

Possible A: carton, light fire, burn down forest, ashtray, hand Why is \\"carton\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Carton\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it refers to the packaging in which cigarettes are stored. Cartons are specifically designed to protect the cigarettes from damage, moisture and external contaminants to an extent, and maintain their freshness for a period of time. Human common sense is a set of knowledge and understanding that is shared and understood by most people. This common sense allows humans to appropriately interpret information, make reasonable decisions and choose suitable actions based on the context. In the context of the given question, human common sense would eliminate the other options because they do not effectively address the aspect of keeping a cigarette fresh. Let us analyze the alternative answers and their relation to human common sense: 1. Light fire: Lighting a fire is not relevant to keeping a cigarette fresh. In fact, it is the opposite action, as lighting a cigarette consumes it. Human common sense would eliminate this option due to its irrelevance to preserving freshness. 2. Burn down forest: This answer is not only unrelated to the given question but is also an extreme, destructive and dangerous option. Human common sense would strongly disapprove of this option, as it does not address the topic of keeping a cigarette fresh and runs counter to responsible behavior, environmental protection, and human safety. 3. Ashtray: An ashtray is typically employed to collect ashes and cigarette butts after the cigarettes have been smoked and hence lost their freshness. Therefore, it is not associated with keeping cigarettes fresh and would be discarded by human common sense. 4. Hand: While a person's hand might be used to hold an individual cigarette, it is not a practical or effective solution for keeping cigarettes fresh. Human hands cannot provide an adequate seal to protect them from moisture, contaminants, or damage, and therefore, this option would also be rejected by human common sense. In conclusion, \\"carton\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense as it effectively preserves the freshness of cigarettes by providing an appropriate storage environment and protection. The other options either do not contribute to maintaining freshness or represent undesirable and unrelated actions that contradict the principles of human common sense."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Spring 1922, Poeymirau and Freydenberg launched attacks into the headwaters of the Moulouya in the western Middle Atlas and managed to defeat Said, the last surviving member of the Berber triumvirate, at El Ksiba in April 1922. Said was forced to flee, with much of the Aït Ichkern tribe, to the highest mountains of the Middle Atlas and then into the High Atlas. Lyautey then secured the submission of several more tribes, constructed new military posts and improved his supply roads; by June 1922, he had brought the entire Moulouya Valley under control and pacified much of the Middle Atlas. Limited in numbers by rapid post-war demobilisation and commitments to garrisons in Germany, he determined not to march through the difficult terrain of the High Atlas but to wait for the tribes to tire of the guerrilla war and submit. Said never did so, dying in action against a groupe mobile in March 1924, though his followers continued to cause problems for the French into the next decade. Pacification of the remaining tribal areas in French Morocco was completed in 1934, though small armed gangs of bandits continued to attack French troops in the mountains until 1936. Moroccan opposition to French rule continued, a plan for reform and return to indirect rule was published by the nationalist Comité d'Action Marocaine in 1934, with significant riots and demonstrations occurring in 1934, 1937, 1944 and 1951. France, having failed to quell the nationalists by deposing the popular Sultan Mohammed V and already fighting a bloody war of independence in Algeria, recognised Moroccan independence in 1956. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many years after Said was defeated at ElKsiba did he die?","completion":"Said was defeated at El Ksiba in April 1922 and he died in action in March 1924.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Washington: NASA has announced evidence that Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, has a saltwater ocean under its icy surface. The ocean seems to have more water than all the water on Earth's surface, according to new Hubble observation. New Hubble observations of Ganymede's magnetic field strongly suggest that the moon, which is the largest in our whole solar system, is home to a subsurface ocean. Scientists estimate the ocean is 95 kilometres thick, which is about 10 times deeper than Earth's oceans. But unlike our salty waters, Ganymede's ocean is buried under 150 kilometres of ice. While scientists have speculated since 1970s about the presence of an ocean on Ganymede------the largest moon in our solar system------ until now the only observational evidence came from a brief flyby by the Galileo spacecraft, which didn't observe the moon long enough to confirm a liquid ocean. This discovery marks an important milestone, highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish. In its 25 years in orbit, Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy surface of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth. Scientists have already confirmed the existence of an ocean on Europa, another moon orbiting Jupiter, and NASA has announced plans to send an unmanned mission there searching for the life that might come with liquid water. Hubble is a telescope that orbits Earth, but because of its impressive gravitational analyses it can be used to study the inside of far distant planets. Using these same principles, scientists could theoretically detect oceans on distant planets as well.

To do this, we subtract 49 * v from both sides of the equation. 59 * v - 49 * v = 49 * v - 49 * v + 30 Step 3: Simplify the equation On the left-hand side of the equation, we have the subtraction of two terms with the same variable. (59 - 49) * v = 10 * v So the equation is simplified to: 10 * v = 30 Step 4: Solve for 'v' Now that we have only one 'v' term in the equation and it's properly isolated, we can solve for 'v' by dividing both sides of the equation by 10.

Answer:","completion":"The story of someone kissing a frog and it turning into a prince is a widely known fairy tale called \\"The Frog Prince\\" or \\"The Frog King.\\" The narrative features a princess who kisses a frog, which then transforms into a handsome prince. This tale has been popularized and adapted in various forms of literature, stage performances, and film productions throughout history. The origins of \\"The Frog Prince\\" can be traced back to European folklore, with the first known written version coming from the Brothers Grimm in their 1812 compilation, \\"Grimm's Fairy Tales.\\" The story goes as follows: In a faraway kingdom, there lived a beautiful, yet spoiled princess. She was very fond of playing with a golden ball, one of her most prized possessions. One day, while playing near a pond in the forest, the princess accidentally dropped her golden ball into the water. Distressed about losing her beloved toy, she started to cry. At that moment, a frog appeared and offered to retrieve the ball from the pond in exchange for a promise: that the princess would befriend him, allowing the frog to eat from her plate, drink from her cup, and sleep on her pillow. Desperate to recover her ball, the princess agreed to the frog's terms without any intention of fulfilling her promise. But as soon as her ball was returned, she left and forgot about the frog. From that moment on, the frog waited patiently near the castle. Later, during a royal banquet, the frog appeared, reminding the princess of her promise. Seeing that everything was unfolding in front of her guests, the king insisted that she fulfill her agreement. Forced by her father, the princess begrudgingly let the frog eat from her plate, drink from her cup, and led him to her room. When the time came for the frog to sleep on her pillow, the princess became frustrated and threw the frog against the wall in anger. Instead of being killed, the frog was magically transformed into a handsome prince. The prince then revealed that he had been cursed by a wicked witch and could only be released by a princess’s actions. In some versions of the story, the transformation occurs when the princess kisses the frog. In any case, the princess and the prince eventually fall in love, and they live happily ever after. The tale of \\"The Frog Prince\\" has undergone numerous adaptations in literature and other media forms, often carrying the moral lesson of keeping one’s word and looking beyond appearances in relationships. The story has also been analyzed and interpreted in various ways, as an allegory of chivalric romance or personal transformation and redemption. Whichever way one chooses to read it, \\"The Frog Prince\\" remains a classic fairy tale that has fascinated and entertained people for centuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I found the following answer on Google: From the point of view of a buyer, an invoice is a purchase invoice. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"Sales invoices, also known as bills or sales receipts, hold significant importance in the world of business, as they serve as records of transactions between sellers and buyers. In the given statement, it indicates that a sales invoice from the buyer's perspective can be called a purchase invoice. Yes, this is correct because the document essentially serves as evidence of a purchase transaction for the buyer. The use of a sales invoice covers various aspects, helping businesses maintain their financial records, track sales, and manage tax obligations. Here are some key uses and benefits in further detail: 1. Legal proof of sale: A sales invoice functions as a legally binding document that confirms a sale between the buyer and the seller. It includes essential information such as the date of the transaction, the products or services sold, the quantities and prices, the taxes charged, and the payment terms. In case of disputes or discrepancies, these invoices can be valuable evidence to resolve conflicts or confirm compliance with business regulations. 2. Financial record keeping: Sales invoices play a vital role in maintaining accurate financial records. Businesses routinely use sales invoices to record the sale of goods or services in their accounting system, ensuring they have information on incoming revenue and outstanding payments. These records form the basis of a company's financial statements, such as profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and cash flow analysis. 3. Tracking payments and managing cash flow: Sales invoices help businesses monitor outstanding payments from clients and keep track of when those payments are due. Properly documenting and organizing invoices enable businesses to manage cash flow effectively, ensuring that they have sufficient funds to cover expenses and invest in growth. 4. Tax obligations and reporting: Accurate invoicing is crucial for complying with tax regulations and reporting obligations. Sales invoices contain essential information on the taxes charged, such as VAT or GST, and provide businesses with the necessary data to file their tax returns and avoid penalties for non-compliance. 5. Customer relations: Providing customers with well-prepared, clear, and detailed invoices fosters a positive relationship between a business and its clientele. Sales invoices help clients understand the products and services they purchased, the associated costs, and payment terms. In addition, invoices create transparency and trust between both parties, essential for a successful long-term business relationship. In conclusion, sales invoices serve multiple purposes, from being legal proof of a sale to maintaining financial records and managing tax obligations.

That's the finding of an extensive study of Dutch men in which deaths from heart disease were more than 50 percent lower among those who consumed at least an ounce of salt water fish per day than those who never ate fish. The Dutch research is one of three human studies that give strong scientific backing to the long-held belief that eating fish can provide health benefits, particularly to the heart. Heart disease is the number-one killer in the United States , with more than 550, 000 deaths occurring from heart attacks each year . But researchers previously have noticed that the incidence of heart disease is lower in cultures that consume more fish than Americans do. There are fewer heart disease deaths, for example, among the Eskimos of Greenland, who consume about 14 ounces of fish a day, and among the Japanese, whose daily fish consumption averages more than 3 ounces. During the next two decades, 78 of the men died from heart disease. The fewest deaths were among the group who regularly ate fish, even at levels far lower than those of the Japanese or Eskimos. This relationship was true regardless of other factors such as age , high blood pressure , or blood cholesterol levels . Question: How many lives could probably be saved each year in the United States by eating fish according to the Dutch study? Answer: Pick from: A). 550, 000.; B). 110,000.; C). 275,000.; D). 852.; A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's first look at the key points mentioned in the article. 1. Deaths from heart disease were more than 50% lower among those who consumed at least an ounce of saltwater fish per day. 2. Heart disease is the number-one killer in the United States, with more than 550,000 deaths occurring from heart attacks each year. Now, let's calculate how many lives could potentially be saved each year in the United States by eating fish according to the Dutch study. Since the study shows that deaths from heart disease were more than 50% lower among those who consumed fish, we can estimate the number of lives that could be saved. Lives potentially saved = Total number of heart disease deaths per year * Reduction in deaths due to fish consumption Lives potentially saved = 550,000 * 50% Therefore, the answer is: C). 275,000."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He promises the public a 3-day workweek with 8 days pay and other ludicrous things, and looks like a shoe-in. But for years he's kept a diary in which he's recorded all sorts of crooked deals and scandalous stuff, and the night before the convention it gets stolen. When it's published, half of Washington is seen leaving for places unknown. The political satire is pretty well laid on here (it should have even been stronger), and why it's not shown more on TV is hard to figure. It's not at all a bitter brand of satire either, which is an indication of the innocence of the times (in terms of what was revealed about politicians, not that politicians were more innocent).

Answer:","completion":"The given product review for \\"For Flation\\" seems to be a mix of both positive and negative remarks, although it leans more towards the positive side. The title \\"For Flation\\" is not directly commented on, so it's difficult to determine if the reviewer views it negatively or positively.

The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind.

They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the world and to judge the quick and the dead. And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them. Christ seemed to have left the world. The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while. Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory. And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church. Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days. And they did fast, and weep, and lament; and their religion became a very sad and melancholy one--most sad in those who were most holy, and loved their Lord best, and longed most for His coming in glory. Question: \\"Did Christ seem to leave the world?\\" Response: \\"No\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question based on the information provided in the text.

It explores genres similar to Jackson's previous album, Off the Wall (1979), including pop, post-disco, rock and funk. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, with a production budget of 750,000. In just over a year, Thriller became the world's best-selling album, having sold an estimated 66 million copies. It is the second-best-selling album in the United States, behind the Eagles' album Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975), and was the first to reach 30x platinum, with 33 million shipped album-equivalent units certified in the US. The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards in 1984, including Album of the Year.

Pick your answer from: (i) World. (ii) Sports. (iii) Business. (iv) Science/Tech.","completion":"This topic mainly falls under the category of (iv) Science/Tech. The information discussed involves Microsoft's Sender ID framework, which is a technology concept designed to combat spam emails. Spam emails have been a significant issue in the digital world, causing various security concerns, identity thefts, and inconvenience to the recipients. As a leading technology company, Microsoft has been working on different solutions to handle spam emails, such as developing the Sender ID framework. Sender ID is an email authentication method that aims to verify an email sender's authenticity, ensuring that the email comes from a legitimate source. This technology helps protect users from phishing attacks and other malicious activities that could involve spam emails. Microsoft, being one of the pioneers in tech innovation, has been attempting to make its Sender ID framework a standard solution for spam problems around the world by promoting its adoption globally. However, it is mentioned in the text that the company has encountered some failure in implementing Sender ID as a widespread solution. This is particularly relevant to the Science/Tech category because it demonstrates the ongoing challenges within the technology industry, specifically dealing with internet security concerns like spam. Additionally, the text refers to Microsoft filing over 100 lawsuits against spammers, which is another aspect of combating spam emails from a legal perspective. This shows the company's determination in implementing a comprehensive strategy beyond just technical solutions to stop spammers and control the undesirable spread of spam emails.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: There are three audience levels you need to concern yourself with here: The interviewer: Usually, a specific journalist will be assigned to your interview. Make sure you know who will be conducting the interview and read his or her past pieces to find out what that interviewer's slant or focus generally is. The media outlet: The tone of an interview usually varies depending on the medium used to deliver it. A blog is one of the most casual, followed by phone interviews, newspaper interviews, and radio interviews. Professional journal interviews and broadcast television interviews tend to be the most formal. The primary audience: The company the reporter works for will have a specific audience. A local news or radio station will ask questions that will concern local viewers, while a national station will ask questions that pertain to a wider audience. A specialized source, like a blog or journal, will focus on issues that affect their readership. If the interview is scheduled in advance, gather all possible information about it as you set up the time and date. Find out what material the interviewer plans on asking about as well as the expected length of the interview. Depending on the content of the interview, the journalist may even be willing to provide you with a list of questions he or she plans to ask. The list may not be comprehensive, but it could at least give you a place to start. If there is information you cannot disclose about a given topic, make sure the reporter knows this ahead of time. He or she may still try to ask about it anyway, but if you firmly explain that you will not answer those questions before the interview, the reporter is less likely to push you for an answer. Since press interviews can be about nearly any topic, it is impossible to generalize about the questions you will be asked during the interview. If the reporter does not provide you with a list in advance, prepare yourself by noting the most important aspects of whatever the subject matter is. Anticipate what others might be curious about and prepare your answers based on that. Conducting a mock interview is often a good way to calm your anxieties about the real interview. Set aside time in advance for a test run. Ask a trusted associate to practice interviewing with you. Have the associate ask questions you have been informed about or ones that you anticipate and deliver your answers as though you were conducting the actual interview. You can wear anything you want during a phone or email interview, of course, but if you are meeting with the reporter in person, you should wear clean clothes that are suited to your position. This is true regardless of whether you will appear in photographs or video.","completion":"The article essentially provides crucial advice on effectively preparing for media interviews. It presents a comprehensive guide emphasizing the significance of understanding the target audience, categorized into three critical sectors: the interviewer, the media outlet, and the primary audience. The author strongly suggests researching the interviewer and their narrative styles, understanding the tone of different mediums – namely, blogs, phone, newspaper, radio, professional journal, and broadcast television interviews – and adjusting one's approach accordingly. Additionally, catering to the company or platform's specific audience, be it local, national, or specialized, is advised. The author also underlines the importance of proactive preparation, including acquiring information about the interview's format, content, and length, and potentially even securing the interview questions in advance, if possible. If there are any topics that the interviewee can't discuss, this needs to be communicated to the reporter in advance to avoid awkward situations during the interview. As the nature of questions can vary based on the topic of the interview, the author recommends preparing based on the subject's key aspects and what the public might be curious about. A recommended strategy for allaying anxieties about the actual interview is conducting a mock interview with a trusted associate. This practice interview should emulate all aspects of the actual interview, with the associate asking both known and anticipated questions. Finally, the article serves as a reminder that physical appearance plays a role in face-to-face interviews, regardless of whether photographs or video will be involved. Presenting oneself in clean, position-appropriate attire is strongly advised to create a positive impression. While the attire does not matter in a phone or email interview, it can contribute significantly to the overall impression made during in-person meetings. Thus, the article essentially emphasizes that thorough preparation, understanding the intended audience, and presenting oneself suitably can significantly enhance the effectiveness of media interviews."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He does not look for faults in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me. Another quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me.

They include new entrants Belgium, Denmark and Britain, which will all send fighter jets to Iraq to assist that nation's government and the United States in the anti-ISIS military campaign. Even the foreign minister of Russia -- which has butted heads repeatedly with Washington, including over whether the President of neighboring war-torn Syria needs to go -- signaled Friday his country is ready to back Iraq in fighting terrorists, \\"above all the Islamic State,\\" which is what ISIS calls itself. Still, even as more countries agree to take part in airstrikes and helping","completion":"train ground forces, some critics argue that the coalition lacks unity and a clear strategy. While ISIS continues to gain ground and propagate violence, there are concerns about the effectiveness of the combined efforts. The issue is further complicated by the ongoing civil war in Syria and the political turmoil in Iraq. Despite these difficulties, proponents believe that the continued expansion of the coalition signifies a global recognition of the threat posed by ISIS and displays a robust willingness to combat it. The U.S., alongside its allies, pledges to continue its strategic efforts and ramps up its operations against the terrorist group. In the coming weeks, it will be crucial to see how these combined international efforts affect the progress of ISIS and whether the coalition's strategy can effectively suppress the group's influence and expansion. Any substantial success or failure will likely prompt a reassessment of the current strategy and potentially reshape the international response to this global issue. Leading figures have stressed the importance of the political solution rather than solely relying on military force. It will take an integrated approach which involves resolving the political instability in the region, alongside a strong military response, to neutralize the threat from ISIS.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Daniel Barenboim (born 15 November 1942) is an Argentine-Israeli pianist and conductor who is a citizen of Argentina, Israel, Palestine, and Spain. He is the general music director of the Berlin State Opera, and the Staatskapelle Berlin; he previously served as Music Director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestre de Paris and La Scala in Milan. Barenboim is known for his work with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, a Seville-based orchestra of young Arab and Israeli musicians, and as a resolute critic of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. Barenboim has received many awards and prizes, including an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, France's Legion d'honneur both as a Commander and Grand Officier, and the German Grosses Bundesverdienstkreuz and Willy Brandt Award. Barenboim has performed several times in the West Bank: at Bir Zeit University in 1999 and several times in Ramallah. In December 2007, Barenboim and 20 musicians from England, the United States, France and Germany, and one Palestinian were scheduled to play a baroque music concert in Gaza. Although they had received authorization from Israeli authorities, the Palestinian was stopped at the Israel-Gaza border and told that he needed individual permission to enter. The group waited seven hours at the border, and then canceled the concert in solidarity. Barenboim commented: \\"A baroque music concert in a Roman Catholic church in Gaza - as we all know - has nothing to do with security and would bring so much joy to people who live there in great difficulty.\\" In January 2008, after performing in Ramallah, Barenboim accepted honorary Palestinian citizenship, becoming the first Jewish Israeli citizen to be offered the status. Barenboim said he hoped it would serve as a public gesture of peace. Some Israelis criticized Barenboim's decision to accept Palestinian citizenship. The parliamentary faction chairman of the Shas party demanded that Barenboim be stripped of his Israeli citizenship, but the Interior Minister told the media that \\"the matter is not even up for discussion\\". In January 2009, Barenboim cancelled two concerts of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in Qatar and Cairo \\"due to the escalating violence in Gaza and the resulting concerns for the musicians' safety.\\" In May 2011, Barenboim conducted the \\"Orchestra for Gaza\\" composed of volunteers from the Berlin Philharmonic, the Berlin Staatskapelle, the Orchestra of La Scala in Milan, the Vienna Philharmonic and the Orchestre de Paris--at al-Mathaf Cultural House. The concert, held in Gaza City, was co-ordinated in secret with the United Nations. The orchestra flew from Berlin to Vienna and from there to El Arish on a plane chartered by Barenboim, entering the Gaza Strip at the Egyptian Rafah Border Crossing. The musicians were escorted by a convoy of United Nations vehicles. The concert, the first performance by an international classical ensemble in the Strip, was attended by an invited audience of several hundred schoolchildren and NGO workers, who greeted Barenboim with applause. The orchestra played Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik and Symphony No. 40, also familiar to an Arab audience as the basis of one of the songs of the famous Arab singer Fairuz. In his speech, Barenboim said: \\"Everyone has to understand that the Palestinian cause is a just cause therefore it can be only given justice if it is achieved without violence. Violence can only weaken the righteousness of the Palestinian cause\\". Can you tell me anything else about the Orchestra for Gaza?","completion":"The \\"Orchestra for Gaza\\" was a unique ensemble composed of volunteers from prestigious orchestras such as the Berlin Philharmonic, the Berlin Staatskapelle, the Orchestra of La Scala in Milan, the Vienna Philharmonic, and the Orchestre de Paris.

The book is famous for its themes of aestheticism, morality, and the interplay between the soul and appearance. The characters, particularly Dorian Gray, are recognized for their struggles with their identities and moral senses. As such, the Russian language, like any other, has enriched its literature by illuminating such universal human experiences. On the other side, learning Russian can have its challenges due to complexity in grammar rules including case system and verb conjugation. However, many people find it rewarding due to its rich literature, extensive history, and the possibilities it opens up in fields like literature, history, politics, and more.

Despite its flaws, I enjoyed \\"Cigarette Burns\\", John Carpenter's Season One episode in the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story seemed like a cheap cross between IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS and 8MM, but it was still quite good for the budget and time constraints given to it.

Both the violin and viola are played under the jaw. The viola, being the larger of the two instruments, has a playing range that reaches a perfect fifth below the violin's. The cello is played sitting down with the instrument between the knees, and its playing range reaches an octave below the viola's. The double bass is played standing or sitting on a stool, with a range that typically reaches a minor sixth, an octave or a ninth below the cello's. Is the following statement correct based on the text is a cello and a bass the same thing","completion":"No, the statement is not correct based on the text. A cello and a double bass are not the same thing. Although both are string instruments and share some similarities, there are some distinctive characteristics between them. The cello, also known as the violoncello, is played while sitting down, with the instrument placed between the knees. The cello's playing range reaches an octave below the viola's. The cello is known for its rich, deep sound, and is often used to play middle and bass register parts in orchestra music, though it can also play higher parts; it is quite versatile. The double bass, also known as the upright bass, can be played either standing up or sitting down on a stool. It generally has a range that reaches a minor sixth, an octave or even a ninth below the cello's range. The double bass is the largest and lowest-pitched instrument in the standard string orchestra, providing the bass lines and underpinning the harmonic structure in many different types of music, from classical to jazz. In addition to these differences in size, range, and playing position, there are also significant differences in technique and notation between the two instruments. For example, the double bass is traditionally played with the side of the bow (known as \\"French bow style\\") rather than with the bow hair flat against the strings (known as \\"German bow style\\"), although some bassists will use the German bow style. On the other hand, cellists only use the bow hair flat against the strings. Also, while both instruments use the bass clef for most of their range, the cello often uses the tenor and even the treble clef for its higher notes, whereas the double bass generally only uses the bass clef. Lastly, although the cello and the double bass share the same four strings (A, D, G, C), the double bass is tuned in fourths, unlike the cello, which is tuned in fifths. This factor considerably influences the technique and fingering employed by cellists and double bass players. In conclusion, although the cello and the double bass are both part of the string family and share some family likeness, they are different in many aspects including size, pitch range, playing positions, tuning and techniques. Therefore, the cello and the double bass are not the same thing."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity.

Passage: During the latter half of 2002, Sasha collaborated with big beat artist Junkie XL on the single \\"Breezer\\". Junkie XL, along with Charlie May, also assisted Sasha on his second album of original material, Airdrawndagger. Airdrawndagger took several years to produce due to Sasha's desire for the album to be \\"as near to perfection as possible.\\" That March, Sasha suffered a perforated eardrum in a traffic accident, further delaying the album's production. Though the accident temporarily impaired his hearing, he drew inspiration for the album from his ordeal. Airdrawndagger was finally released, in August 2002, to much fanfare. However, the album was \\"received with a lot of head scratching\\", according to Sasha, which he attributed to its unexpected mix of genres. The album did not feature the heavier \\"club sound\\" of Sasha's previous mix albums, bearing a closer resemblance to ambient music. Airdrawndagger generally received favorable reviews, though critics noted that it was not as consistent and well produced as his DJ mixes. Sasha himself described it as \\"a selfish, slightly self-indulgent record\\", though he maintains that he is \\"happy with it to this day\\". Some critics, however, called it \\"sleepy\\"; E!Online described it as being \\"more in league with Yanni than Moby\\". To encourage listeners' interest, Sasha held an amateur remix contest for the album's single, \\"Wavy Gravy\\". Due to the contest's success, Sasha released all the tracks from Airdrawndagger on his website, so that fans could download and create their own versions.After the release of Airdrawndagger, Sasha took the young DJ James Zabiela \\"under his wing\\". He introduced Zabiela to the CDJ1000 turntable, and signed Zabiela to the Excession talent agency. The two toured the United States together, which extended Sasha's influence to already-popular American DJs such as Kimball Collins. In 2004, Sasha signed with Global Underground to produce another mix album. However, he found the process of creating a standard mix album unrewarding, and decided to apply his production and DJing skills to a mix compilation that resembled a \\"real\\" album—that is, one featuring original material. Sasha's next studio album, Involver, was \\"a fusion of mix album and production record\\", consisting entirely of Sasha's reworkings of tracks by other artists. \\"I tried to take all the separate sounds to all the tracks [and recombine them]\\", he later explained, \\"and it allowed me to mix the tracks together on a much deeper level.\\" He accomplished this by sequencing the album using Ableton Live and Logic Pro. Ableton Live is a music loop-based software package that Sasha uses to engineer tracks in real-time, whereas he used Logic Pro primarily for premeditated edits to audio tracks.

Trump's political base seems pleased with his first year in office, touting his efforts to cut Obama-era regulations, install Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and roll back Islamic State forces in the Middle East. \\"We were kind of thinking we were going to relax and put Trump behind us and just watch all the great promises that he gave us, and watch him make America great again,\\" said Michigan Trump supporter Meshawn Maddock. \\"But what happened immediately is that we felt he was under attack from day one.\\" The president's biggest legislative victory came just last month, a sweeping tax cut bill that had been a Republican priority for years. \\"We are very proud of it,\\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed it. \\"It is going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It is going to be fantastic for the economy.\\" In fact, there are plenty of signs of a surging economy, and public opinion polls show growing support for Trump's handling of it and even a bump up in support for the tax bill, which many voters saw initially as too favorable to the wealthy. The tax victory also seems to be helping Trump galvanize the Republican Party behind him, even those who in the past have been cool to his leadership. \\"This president hasn't even been in office for a year, and look at all the things he has been able to get done, by sheer will in many ways,\\" said Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who also announced recently he would not run for re-election this year.

As a result, there are key aspects to consider when assessing the validity and effectiveness of these indicators in comparison to those that exclusively rely on waste volume measurements. Firstly, it is important to understand the overall goal of the indicators. Environmental indicators aim to measure the impacts of human activity on the environment, providing crucial information to policymakers, businesses, and the general public. The effectiveness of an indicator depends on its ability to accurately represent the reality of environmental disturbances and provide meaningful data that can drive sustainable decision-making. Secondly, the method employed in the development of the indicators should be scrutinized. The method utilized in formulating the indicators, as well as the statistical base used for comparison, should be subjected to a comprehensive review process. This process includes evaluating the sources of data, the methodologies used to compile and analyze the data, and the statistical measures taken to ensure the indicators are accurate and relevant. Thirdly, it is essential to identify the key differences between the reviewed indicators and other existing indicators based solely on waste volumes. Indicators that focus solely on waste volumes may not necessarily provide a comprehensive representation of the environmental impacts. These measurements may overlook crucial factors such as toxicity levels, the energy consumption required for waste management, and the broader ecological implications of waste production and disposal. Conversely, the reviewed indicators take into account multiple factors beyond waste volumes, such as the environmental impact of waste generation, the efficiency of recycling and disposal processes, and the potential risks posed to ecosystems and human health. By incorporating a broader range of variables, these indicators create a more holistic picture of the real environmental impacts associated with waste production and management. Lastly, the comparative analysis of the indicators should be conducted to validate the superiority of the reviewed indicators in terms of accuracy and effectiveness. This can be achieved through various methods, such as comparing the correlations between indicators and real-world environmental impacts, assessing the ability of the indicators to predict future trends, and examining the responsiveness and sensitivity of the indicators to changes in policy and technology. In conclusion, the reviewed indicators, which consider various aspects beyond waste volumes, undoubtedly provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the real environmental impacts of waste production and management. They serve as valuable tools for guiding sustainable decision-making and formulating effective strategies to mitigate the negative consequences on the environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
