The problem is in both the cases. Couples who want a proper advice don't have good parents. Good parents are capable to give proper advice to their children but they are not willing. Thatswhy counselling centers are trending today. Let us discuss about the failure of both love and arranged marriage. Young boys and girls will be attracted to each other naturally . Everyone will have some goal. But a very few will have determination, self control and reach their target.After reaching a high and respectable position they think about love or marriage. They will lead successful marital life either it is love or arranged marriage. But most of the youngsters will have weak mind.They learn about life mostly from movies. In most of the love stories hero will marry a heroine by opposing the parents. Without planning for future without a proper job he will marry. Hero and heroine will win finally by facing some troubles.Either it is a love story or a family entertainer most of the directors highlight the love and affection between the hero and heroine but don't highlight the difficulties faced by them. So our youngsters imagine that life is full of love and happiness. Both the boy and girl will have high expectations from the life partner. But they forget about the difficulties faced by the hero and heroine in the movies. It seems to be very easy to lead the life for them. They marry without proper settlement. But movie is different from life. Movie is theoretical but life is practical. Now let us assume Mr. A, Ms.B and Mr. X, Ms. Y both got married without settling in the job properly. AB get arranged marriage.XY get love cum arranged marriage. Mostly parents say no to love marriage but finally obeys when their children are stubborn. They knew the future. They keep silent untill the time comes. One or two years will go smoothly after marriage for both AB and XY. Afterwards situations will change.Most of the couples after marriage face difficulties due to misunderstandings between them or finance or anything else. Let us suppose both AB and XY are facing troubles. The parents of XY uses this opportunity.They don't support or guide XY as they did love marriage without their willingness.Even they will try to add fuel to the current situation sothat the couple should get divorced. So in most cases it leads to divorce. Now let us see what happens to AB. This couple is also facing trouble.But their parents will support them at every phase of life. If the couple have misunderstandings then the parents of both the girl and boy will ask,discuss,teach their respective children about how to behave a husband and wife with each other in marital life. They help the couple financially. At every phase of life the parents will support the couple,put the maximum efforts in joining the hearts sothat the relation last forever. So mostly arranged marriages are successful. These days arranged marriages are also not successful.Because the parents are not concentrating on the character of the bride or groom. They are giving more importance to external beauty, profession,financial position,status in the society etc. But in 30 years of marital life anything may happen.The groom may loss job or may experience financial crisis. The bride may fell ill. But if both have good character they won't leave each others hand.They will face any type of difficulties together and will succeed. The parents are misguiding the couples in arranged marriage.They tell their children to leave the life partner as the partner is in trouble. So both love and arranged marriages are unstable in this generation. Either it is love or arranged marriage if the wife and husband knows how to support each other in any type of situation and if have respect towards marriage system then both will be successful."},{"prompt":"Who represents the GOP in 2021?","completion":"Trump, DeSantis, Abbott, and Cruz (not eligible) until someone else grows a Pair."},{"prompt":"Should I register in CA foundation course without getting 12th result?","completion":"If you have appeared for 12th Standard Examination in Academic Year 2017–18, then you need not wait for 12th Standard results to come.

Think of chips like Intel Core CPUs and NVIDIA GeForce GPUs. These are general-purpose processing units that run on millions of computers everywhere. They can pretty much solve all of our computing needs. The cloud has accentuated this development further, because the cloud giants buy up standardized hardware in huge bulks. What we end up with are a few big players that totally dominate the hardware market. Software is very different. Unless we develop some utopical artificial general intelligence, it’s impossible for one computer program to satisfy all of our computing needs. In fact, we need a plethora of them on a daily basis. When we think of software, we tend to think of a few big tech giants and their consumer software, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Custom enterprise software alone is a trillion dollar market.

Whenever I look at a problem where Node is a viable answer, I know that Java, Kotlin, Go, C# will also be viable answers. It is against that competition that I struggle to see why Node would win. The other languages have more features aimed at making large applications easier to navigate and safer to change. The other runtimes - JVM, CLR, native executables - are robust and offer excellent features, some of which make better use of computing hardware. The only reason I can see to choose Node is developer preference, and that doesn’t seem like it should win over those with a preference for any other server-side language. I can’t for the life of me see a reason to pick Node over Go, for example. Not one. Node over Java is equally puzzling - that can literally only be “I dislike Java”. If C# is an option, then almost certainly Node has no place - the Microsoft stack goes from keyboard to cloud, tightly integrated."},{"prompt":"What is Digital Wealth Management?","completion":"The following are some of the business sectors where digital technology has the potential to change wealth management across all industry segments: Automation and self-service Clients who have simple queries regarding their accounts frequently prefer to get answers promptly via the phone or the Internet.

But It is often compared to opiates, as it can produce similar effects, such as getting high, pain relief and sedation. However, there are some key differences between the effects of kratom and opiates. Main Differences One of the main differences is the duration of the effects. Kratom tends to have a shorter duration of action than most opiates, with effects lasting anywhere from a few hours to a full day. In contrast, the effects of opiates can last for several hours or more.Another difference is the intensity of the effects. Kratom tends to produce milder effects than opiates, with most users reporting a sense of calm and relaxation rather than the intense euphoria and sedation often associated with opiate use. Kratom is also less likely to cause respiratory depression and other serious side effects, such as overdose, compared to opiates.Finally, the potential for dependence and withdrawal is another key difference between kratom and opiates. While some users of kratom report experiencing mild withdrawal symptoms when they stop using the substance, these symptoms are generally less severe and shorter-lasting than those associated with opiate withdrawal. Overall, while kratom and opiates may produce similar effects, there are important differences in the duration, intensity, and potential for dependence and withdrawal associated with these substances. So, it is important to be aware of these differences and to use caution when using either substance."},{"prompt":"Why is there so little trash on the streets of Vancouver, British Columbia, relative to any other city, such as San Francisco?","completion":"Is this a serious question? Everywhere is different. San Francisco and the Bay Area as a whole are in crisis. Vancouver, BC didn’t have thousands upon thousands of people descend upon it in a short period of time during the tech boom and cause havoc both financially and ecologically. The homeless population in San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose skyrocketed when the cost of living became impossible. I do not believe Vancouver has that problem. With high levels of homelessness comes high level of trash. The city simply cannot keep up with the demand. They say they’re trying. But I will believe it when I see it, honestly.

But how will people know about your lemonade stand? That's where lead generation and marketing come in! Lead generation and marketing are important for many different industries. Let's think about some examples: 1. Toys: Companies that make toys need to let people know about their cool toys. They use lead generation and marketing to find people who might want to buy their toys, like parents and kids. 2. Restaurants: Imagine you have a favorite restaurant that makes yummy pizza. The restaurant wants more people to come and eat their pizza, so they use lead generation and marketing to tell people about their delicious food. 3. Clothing: Companies that make clothes want to sell their trendy outfits to people. They use lead generation and marketing to find people who like their style and might want to buy their clothes. 4. Technology: Have you ever seen cool gadgets like phones or tablets? The companies that make these gadgets need to find people who want to buy them. They use lead generation and marketing to show people how awesome their gadgets are. So, lead generation and marketing are important for many industries because they help businesses find people who might want to buy their products or services.

This reminds me of my trip to Death Valley. We hiked over miles of sand First of all let me get something very clear: I love the ocean. In fact I love anything to do with water give me a lake or river a pool I’m in! Who loves the ocean? These guys! So I’ve been swimming since I was a little kid and I scuba dive I surf anything to do to be in the ocean because I love it I guess it’s because I’m a water sign. But if there’s one thing that I cannot stand in this world is sand! do you think I like it because you associate it with beaches I love the ocean but sand is like the opposite of the ocean. Sand is irritating. It gets into EVERYTHING. It’s a pain in the Butt to clean it off at the bathrooms you always end up with 200 pounds of it in your car and still on your clothes. Sand the Bane of my existence! And if you are trying to suntan sand gets all over you when someone near you kicks up their a towel or if someone runs by you. Or when there’s strong wind coming off of the ocean and then bam sand all over your tanned body. Argh!! All three of these people ( I’m the one in the middle) are terrified surrounded by sand! And when you have to pick up your towel that’s all wet and when you have to clean up your stuff getting all the sand off is impossible! If you forget to bring flip-flops you will regret it either having to wear your shoes in the sand which is awful and hard to walk or to have to walk barefoot in the sand which will burn your feet. One last thing, when I’m done scuba diving, and I have to wear a 50 pound weight around my waist, walking through sand is one of the most exhausting horrible things to do ever! Walking through sand after scuba diving is the opposite of going scuba diving LOL! so in conclusion yes for all the above reasons and probably many more that I can’t think of because I dont like sand!

The astral body is free from gravity just like a fire flame is free from gravity if you light a candle and put it upside down candle flame will still try to go upward. Basically, the astral body is made up of light and once you leave your astral body you can go as far as you want. But you are still connected via your navel from the Astral body to physical body with a shiny silver cord like substance. You can see your own physical body sitting in the same position when you started the AP but now your own self is flying because you have progressed the physical to the astral or light body. You can come back immediately if you think about coming back to your physical body there is no lapse. It is instant just like a thought. The astral body is weightless just like fire or light has no weight. For people who want to discover how to experience the full spectrum of the wonders and pleasures that astral projection will give you, you [LINKED_TEXT: should check this tutorial] [URL: https://starlidy.com/MJAMH9H]. I knew I wasn't getting as far in life as I wanted to. Throughout it, I had many ups and downs. Whenever I had these \\"downs,\\" it seemed to me that I should flee to somewhere else and be away from the realities I needed to confront. I didn’t know so much back then until I found that guide. It’s done me the favor of helping me be somewhere I want to be. I never imagined that I would be able to experience this for the first time in my life. When I started using all I'd learned from this, I found a whole new side to life, and anytime I had time to sleep, my dreams were a terrific time to discover, explore, and have a good time. It's no longer simply a pipe dream. It counts as a different world for me. A different way of living. Lucid dreaming is still inside the mind but also inside the body too. If you want to move in a lucid dream you can move your arm or leg and you can feel the sensation of movement but nowhere near AP. You have less control in lucid dreaming and there is no silver cord. You are attached fully to your own body’s each cell and if someone tries to wake you up you will lose the lucid dream state but in AP your body will completely be numb even a needle prick will not move you at all as your consciousness is completely out of your body. In AP your body’s all processes halt to its minimum even your breathing cannot be sensed & you can still be out of body for few days and body will not decay because needed nourishment is coming via silver cord but brain waves, if measured during AP, will come up at Delta level or lower or may not come up at all in certain cases because we do not have the machine or technology to catch or monitor beyond Delta. It is beyond human perception. Our bodies have very limited perception and limits. Our body only revolves around 20 degrees plus or minus. Our bodily temperature can only be between 90 degrees C or 110 degree C. That is too extreme on both ends so we can see our entire life is constricted within very limited degrees. Fire can go up to 1,500 °C or more a dazzling white kind of fire not red or yellow that are too soft. You can see here physical body is only limited to 10 -20 °C but fire can go beyond 1500°C and astral body is all made up of white bright light that is why when in cinema or movies they show out of the body, they always show very bright white simmering light without knowing why? Now you can imagine the power of Astral body what it is capable of doing with such power & light and Lucid dreaming still in the range of human body heat of 90 to 110 °C.

But driving from the Netherlands to Spain, as directly as possible, I normally allow about 11 hours, from the Belgian border to the Spanish border. That's assuming a short break every couple of hours, but no extended meal break. Google says I can do it in 9 hours, but for that I'd need a co-driver, or more Red Bull than I'm comfortable with. It also assumes that I time my journey, to avoid reaching major cities at peak times. Traffic can add several hours to those times. Not being keen on long-distance driving, I normally include an overnight break. I find it convenient to stop in a hotel just before Lyon, which can be a major bottleneck, and drive through it early in the morning when traffic is light, especially if it is a weekend. The same applies to Paris, if I go that way. But I did once drive from Andorra to Calais in one hit, due to a family emergency in England. That took me about 12 hours, with rest breaks. You can't avoid traffic everywhere, unless you drive at night, which I didn't. Even more preferred than either of those ideas is taking a few days and stopping somewhere nice in France.

As one of the most powerful demons in the series, the Upper Moon demon from Demon Slayer is incredibly strong, quick, and regenerative. The outcome of a fight between Yajirobe and an Upper Moon demon would ultimately depend on a number of variables, including the particular skills and strategies each fighter uses, as well as the context and location of the conflict. It's also important to keep in mind that in these series, power levels and abilities aren't always consistent, making it challenging to make firm predictions."},{"prompt":"'m facing with this awkward situation where my 400 watt incandescent bulbs burn out at a crazy rate. Why is that and what's the best solution? Will controlling the voltage via a fan dimmer make things better?","completion":"Higher wattage bulbs generally run hotter than lower wattage bulbs. I am not sure, but I think this is done to keep the bulb from getting too large. The hotter they run, the faster the tungsten evaporates from the filament. They are also more efficient in that more of the radiation is in the visible band, so you get more lumens per watt. If you effectively lower the voltage (a fan dimmer might work depending on how it is designed) you make it run cooler. It will definitely last longer. A 10% drop in voltage could make it last ten times longer, but it will also consume 20% less electricity and lose 30–40% of its brightness. If this is ok, then why not use 250 watt bulbs in place of the 400 watt bulbs? The inrush current is only a problem after most of the tungsten has already evaporated, so controlling inrush current on average only has a small effect on the life of the bulb. The main factor is how hot it operates. On average, that is the dominant factor in the life of the bulb. And if 250 watt bulbs are ok, LEDs can easily be used in place of incandescent bulbs. I use LEDs in this case and have had very long life from quality bulbs."},{"prompt":"w fast could the US Air Force SR71 Blackbird fly if it pushed its engines to the point of destruction as some MiG25 Foxbats did chasing the Blackbird?","completion":"I watched one cross back and forth horizon to horizon near Fairchild AFB. it took a few seconds. they are really fast. and I have seen fighters operating up close"},{"prompt":"What is the difference between Angular and AngularJS?","completion":"Angular Js Supported MVC design model.Recommended language: JavaScript.Specific ng Directive is required for Image/Property and an event.Doesn’t provide any mobile Support.routeprovider.when() is used for Routing config.Doesn’t support the concept of Dependency injection.less manageable.With Two-way data binding effort and time is reduced.No support or new updates are provided anymore.

The child’s grandmother asks what happened and why I abandoned my biological child. Turns out she never told her parents the child wasn’t mine, and let them think I was a horrible person.

Saw some answers & they were low balling him like hell. Let's see who wins. Itachi is healthy here. Now itachi has studied a lot about previous hokages & the history of the village. He knows that tobirama invented Edo tensei , he told pain & sasori after sasori failed to kill orochimaru so I'm sure he knows about flying raijin as well considering minato uses it too & itachi & minato are contemporary. Even Sasuke knows about the flying raijin as shown in one of those Shippuden episodes. Now Tobirama will know he's an uchiha the moment itachi activates his sharigan. Now to counter fire style he has his water style jutsu. To counter sharigan he has two ways 1 is to not look directly into his eyes & rely on his sensory abilities. 2nd uses darkness manipulation genjutsu but the problem is itachi can escape it bcz there will be plenty of space around to reach out of that darkness. When he used against sarutobi they were confined in a barrier so it was useful but here it's not. So we'll go with 1st option that is he'll close his eyes & uses sensory abilities. Just bcz a ninja has sensory doesn't mean he can see what attack his opponent is about to launch at him. Like Tobi won't be able to predict if itachi is using ametrasu or not. Even Kabuto in sage mode couldn't tell what attack itachi & Sasuke were about to do. Jiraya while being in sage mode couldn't sense out where Pains hiding inside the summoning it was granny toad who had to use her toungue in order to find out. Jiraya could not even sense when 3 other pains arrived there. Even SM Naruto couldn't tell where nagato was hiding or Deva pain is about to do universal pull & almighty push. Multiple evidences are there that supports my claims. Now since itachi already know about flying raijin he can easily counter it via shuriken jutsu. Remember Tobirama needs to mark people in order to use that jutsu or throw a kunai in their direction & itachi is a specialist in shuriken jutsu he was able to block every shuriken thrown at him by Saskue during their fight while he was partially blind so it's not a problem at all. Other than that raw speed wise we don't have any feats for Tobi but itachi was keeping up with kcm Naruto who was holding his own against 4 & 3rd Raikage. Now what itachi has is his IZANAMI , he can cast that genjutsu on tobirama & then kill him I know it takes time to set that jutsu up & itachi here is healthy so he can easily hold his own against tobirama for a while since he had already neutralize his flying raijin. Itachi also has the susnoo which can protect him if Tobi wants to use paper bomb barrage for a suicide attempt plus Itachi can only use susanoo arms as well in order to attack tobirama. So there is literally nothing in tobis arsenal that can put itachi down. Most important thing here is tobirama lacks feats while itachi doesn't. Tobi might win based hype scaling etc but feat wise itachi just out classes him."},{"prompt":"w much salary CMA's get per month?","completion":"Thanks for the A2A.

Case in point: Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. Don’t get me wrong - I love this game. I didn’t touch another game for several weeks, and played this game any moment I had the opportunity to. Odyssey combines a lot of common Ubisoft features and RPG elements in such a way that is simply beautiful. I really enjoyed the open world in Ghost Recon Wildlands, but they kicked it up several notches in Odyssey. The map is freaking huge, though. I don’t mind, except that the nature of the game requires for X amount of stuff to be in every mile or so of the game. It’s not like MMOs like WoW and Everquest where the travel time adds to the immersion and realism of the game. Many MMOs have huge open spaces for this purpose, and it’s a system that works. In Odyssey there really needs to be stuff scattered all about in relatively tight areas. I get it - it’s a good plan. The problem is that the writers can only add so much variety, and we end up with really repetitive strongholds and tasks. The first 30 times I stealth-cleared a fortress was great, but I’m kind of over that now. I was actually talking to a co-worker tonight, and I remarked that it would be great if I had a switch to magically clear a fortress for me, because I really feel like I’ve done enough work to deserve that shortcut. Open worlds are great, but open worlds require devs to add more material. Not only is it a lot of work to add more variety, but too much variety can be just as dangerous as too little (too much variety may show a lack of focus, and make the game feel disjointed). I personally believe this issue is just a phase, a growing pain, and big devs like Ubisoft will figure out a better way to keep worlds huge & interesting. Depending on the game type there has to be a sweet spot where map size and activities mesh. How to get there is another question altogether, one which I’m not entirely sure about."},{"prompt":"w can I learn a dance? I have been trying, but I can't learn any dance. I mainly want to learn hip hop and Kpop dances.","completion":"The good way to get started with dancing is to start dancing! There is no rules on how you should start dancing. It would be as if asking how to start walking or speaking. The art of dancing should come as natural as the basic humane activities like walking, talking, sleeping, etc. Just look at a kid while it listens to a jingly music. Without any prior training, it starts dancing. It should as spontaneous! But, yes! Training definitely helps you refine your talent. It gets you focused and takes in much commitment and hard work from your end. If dancing is your passion and you are ready to get trained and mentored, then you can fulfill your dreams of becoming a dancer. So, if you want to think of dancing as a profession, then it is much better that you get trained! This way, not only can you improve yourself, you will also become capable of making your own compositions and concerts, and if you get students later, you can also be a good mentor to them by inculcating and passing the values and knowledge that you got from your Gurus. Also, if you are planning to get trained, you should start at the earliest as it will be more effective if you start getting training early in your life. There are so many online classes going on, especially in these tough COVID-19 times. You can Google them. Or you may find ads of dance classes on platforms like Facebook.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also regulate N95 respirators. It is important to recognize that the optimal way to prevent airborne transmission is to use a combination of interventions from across the hierarchy of controls, not just PPE alone. The N95 cover is exceptionally efficient because it channels air pollutants without any problems. While 95% of air toxins can be easily isolated through these veils as indicated by experts, people suffering from respiratory illnesses should not use these covers because they need to face the real consequences. The N95 screen here and there makes it hard to relax. Kids should not use the N95 veil. These covers do not provide complete protection against coronaviruses. You may find it hard to take the N95 cover and full protection is not guaranteed in the same way. My strongest suggestion is to use the covers carefully as they are sufficient to repel 100% of the coronavirus toxins. They can do a lot without this spread of infection.

First, by most modern theories of stellar nucleosynthesis (the process by which heavier elements are formed), there will be mostly hydrogen and helium in the universe, with the former being fused into the latter. Thereafter, stars that \\"go off the main sequence\\" (that is, cease fusing hydrogen into helium) will start to form carbon, oxygen, neon, and other elements, all the way up until (like most stars, such as our sun) they either die out, or until (for bigger stars) they start to form iron. Iron is a problem for stars. The other elements could be squeezed (\\"squoze\\", as a delighful colleague of mine likes to put it) to form heavier atoms, at which point they give off more energy. Heats the star's core up, and keeps it from collapsing farther. Atoms much heavier than iron (like uranium) will split up, and give off some energy. But iron is \\"the end of the road\\" for this process. If you try to fuse it together, it will take up energy. If you try to split it apart, it'll take up energy. Hence, a star that is making iron in its core is dying. Well, then how do elements heavier than iron get made? Because when a bigger star runs out of fuel, it begins to collapse again and... whoa.... there is no place for all of the outer layers of the star to go. When the gigantic mass of the star collapses, the internal pressures skyrocket, and... KA-BLOOEEY!!! It blows up. The force of this explosion is such that many atoms... including iron atoms, and all of the other lighter ones that had been formed... get smashed together and make a whole smorgasbord of atoms from cobalt and nickel, all the way up to uranium. Gold, like the other precious metals, gets formed in this process. It can happen when a large star dies... or, in some cases, when material from another star gets sucked down onto an already-dead star that is orbiting it. Different theories exist as to which heavy elements get formed more by one process or another. In any event, gold (like silver, platinum, iridium, tungsten, palladium... all of that glittery lotsa-money-per-troy-ounce stuff) is always going to be \\"rare\\" when compared to dull, boring, humdrum stuff like carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. The stuff that \\"we\\" are made of. Now add to the story, this... when the Earth was formed, it was probably molten for quite a few million years, until it cooled enough to crust over. During this period, heavier materials would tend to sink through the molten rock and descend to the core. Gold is very, very dense. Most of the heavier atoms... transition and precious metals, like gold, silver, copper, nickel, etc.... are all as dense, or denser, than iron. Therefore, our Earth's core, though mainly iron and nickel, is probably also richer in gold and other precious metals than the crust is. What gold we do have on or near the surface is that which volcanic and seismic activity has burped up to the surface from time to time... plus some from the occasional asteroid impact that was scattered across the surface after it solidified. (There's a huge deposit of nickel near Sudbury in Canada, that has been mined for nickel for decades, that geologists believe to be the remains of a big iron-nickel asteroid that impacted there many millions of years ago.) Upswing is, everywhere in the Universe, the really heavier atoms... the ones bigger than iron, cobalt and nickel... are going to be very rare. Only the very biggest stars produce those elements... either themselves when they blow up, or when they are feeding huge amounts of gas down onto a \\"white dwarf\\" star that is orbiting them. These are all pretty rare conditions, so the heavier elements are bound to be fairly rare. Add to this their tendency to get concentrated in planetary cores, and it really is kind of miraculous that we have as much gold, silver and copper available to us as we do. A little more quite and placid of a history for the Earth, and virtually all of the metals from iron onward in the periodic table might be buried forever, thousands of miles beneath our feet. Think about it. Except for an early planetary body striking the Earth, making our Moon, and churning up a lot of heavy metals from the core in the process.... and except for occasional asteroid impacts... we could have been stuck in the Stone Age... forever!!"},{"prompt":"Why did JFK have affairs?","completion":"Really?

Why do folks in Europe, Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand think that they are entitled to free healthcare?","completion":"Canadian here. Speaking for myself. The first difference between us is that, in my view, all people are entitled to health care at public expense because we're all living, breathing human beings, and our lives are of equal worth regardless of whether we have no money or a few billion dollars. The much-ballyhooed US “right to life” can only sensibly mean one thing, in my view: the right of every person to adequate nutritious food, clean water, medical care, modest shelter, and education to grade 12 — in other words, the things a human being needs in order to not die preventably. (I’m anticipating the response “well, why then isn't everybody entitled to a mansion / a Ferrari / a 60-inch TV / a diamond-encrusted iPhone at public expense?” Simple: because nobody requires those things in order to not die preventably.) The second difference is that, frankly, I don't give a damn about shareholders and companies maximizing profits from health care. How much profit they make is very far down the list of factors that make one health care system better than another. The primary, overriding purpose of a health care system is to benefit the health of as many people as possible. And the obvious problem with a health care system that prioritizes profit for companies and shareholders is that it incentivizes the denial of financial outlays wherever possible - leading to the notorious problem in the US system of health insurers denying payment to people they supposedly insure. Hopefully the above is food for thought."},{"prompt":"What do you think of the 3/21/22 CBC report that the NDP has agreed to keep Trudeau's Liberal Party in power until 2025?","completion":"It's a very old tradition for minority Liberal governments to seek support from the NDP holding the balance of power, exchanging support against confidence votes for action on NDP policy objectives. It's how we got universal health care, for one thing. It's not surprising in the least. It's a good way for a party that has a lot of seats but essentially no feasible way to form a government to get some of its bucket list done by the party that is likely to continue to hold power (unpopular as Trudeau is, he's just the leader of the party with the most seats, and the party's approval rating is actually pretty good, all things considered). Historically in arrangements like this the Liberals even get to actually claim responsibility for some legitimately good progressive policy they would otherwise never have considered enacting. You should hear Chretien go on about how it was Pearson's Liberals who were responsible for the Canada Health Act… If the Conservatives weren't so busy imploding with QAnon nonsense and oppositional defiant disorder they could do something like this. They've always been way better at tearing down than building up, though, so they'll probably just keep doing like the Republicans and oppose everything, even the stuff they would normally do themselves, just because the Liberals are doing it.

Many people DO think the USA’s healthcare quality is among the best in the world. The US typically has the latest, greatest diagnostic equipment, the most innovative medical procedures, and some of the best trained physicians and staff in the world. All you have to do is go to any of the major medical centers in the US like Birmingham, NYC, and even Johnson City TN (world class thoracic surgery) for evidence of that. What most people think though, is that the US system is not as easy as single payer. And that’s true. We don’t have single payer, but there are other countries as well that don’t. But funding is not the same as quality. Personally, I’ve traveled all over the world and find our healthcare system to be just fine.

I was at Mary Arden’s with a group of 50 French schoolkids. We were drenched and cold, and because we had a bit of money in the kitty I asked what they could do to warm us up. The answer was 50 hot milks. An American tourist who was in the same room came up to me and expressed his admiration at how they all were drinking hot milk, saying that in the States it would have been impossible, with soda drinks being inevitable.

Then it’s my duty to protect her because she can’t.Is she a timid or fearful person, particularly in the face of possible danger? Many women are. In that case someone has to be brave and if she can’t then I guess it has to be me.Is she considerably smaller and frailer than I am? Then it only makes sense for me to be the one to investigate. The point I’m trying to make is, there are all sorts of perfectly legitimate reasons why I would be the one expected to protect her. But I get the point you’re driving at as well. No, it should not be expected for me to put myself in danger just because I’m a man. If I were disabled and unable to protect myself, then obviously she would have to do it. I shouldn’t be expected to haul my crippled self into a wheelchair to protect her just because my genitals dangle. Let’s be real.

Anyways, regarding my looks, there isn’t anything drastic that people notice - the only thing is that I lost a lot of weight but besides that, in these 5 years I did change but not drastically. When it comes to me and my personality, I haven’t changed that much either - I am still my old self but I am much more mature than I was before. 5 years for many isn’t a long period to notice any changes but I have - I think differently and I learned to not take for granted the things I have and my family. My mother had cancer 2 years ago and that period really affected me in a way that I finally realized that life is really unpredictable and that there are many things that I should do and change because I don’t know what waits me tomorrow. Just the thought of someone who I love getting sick in that way was a wake up call. It really woke up a change in me as I finally realized that I was wasting my time on people who didn’t accept me in the way I am - with all my flaws and good sides. I was bullied for much of my childhood and when I was 13 my bullying was on the worst level possible - I was aware of the darker sides of life even then but I thought that I can ignore them and try to enjoy life as much as I can. Thankfully, everything with my mother’s cancer ended up well - her tests are exellent and the doctors are really happy to see her living her life normally - not only did the cancer wake up something in me, it woke up something in her as well. I was like a stranger to my own parents because of the bullying. I was completely closed and it took me years to finally say that what happened in the past should stay there but I will never forget that period no matter how much I try. To cut the story short - I changed in a better way and decided to live life to the fullest and do things that make me and my family happy - as my happiness affects my parents in the same way as their happiness affect me.

Then a bit of study or completing assignments and lab journals or preparing for class tests and it goes on from 21.00–23.00 and talking to parents for sometime in between.

Police and ambulance workers would literally have next to no jobs. Everyone would be home, smoking up, thinking about something or nothing having an enjoyable time. Opening our minds. Broadening our horizons. I’ve been a weed smoker for many years, I’ve tried alcohol and don’t like the effect it has, I’ve tried citalopram, sertraline & one other I can’t remember the name of.

Imagine there’s something called a \\"Basketball Quotient\\" or BQ. Give this to a high schooler and you can tell pretty well how well they'll do in high school or university basketball. It measures a bunch of stuff: stamina, dexterity, passing, etc. We set score up so half of people score above 100, and half score below. It's definitely associated with innate trait, like height, which is caused by a mix of genetic (my family is quite tall) and environment (well fed populations are taller). My Dad liked basketball a lot and there was a hoop in our driveway, so I got every advantage. I'm also quite dreadful terrible so lets say I have a GQ of 80. My brother is well above average, so let's put him at a GQ of 120. Definitely gifted, and has quite a bit of natural talent. Put him in a group of random people his age and he's likely to stand out. There's more to it than just innate abilities though. Let's say \\"Alice\\" grew up in a place with no hard surfaces to dribble on where they play Soccer instead. Bob grew up in a huge basketball family. We test them both and Alice scores 80 and Bob scores 100. She can run well and is tall, but she doesn't know how to dribble and hasn't seen a backboard before. Alice might have more innate ability even though Bob scores better. Test her again in a couple months, and she'll probably do much better. Bringing this to the real world, IQ is a measurement of how well someone does at academics. It's decent at predicting academic performance. It doesn't tell the whole picture though. Attempts to measure IQ will produce claims like \\"Africa has an average IQ below 70\\". The problem is that comes from measuring basketball skills in soccer players. Or we're applying our house rules to a place with different ones and surprised when they don't follow them naturally. The interesting thing is that if we want we can rapidly raise IQ. Think of it like giving people a crash course in dribbling and telling them tricks for scoring baskets. We might want to rethink how we're measuring GQ (or IQ) too so we're not imposing our norms where they might make sense. In short, IQ is kind of a thing and has some predictive value. It has some relationship to innate ability but training and environment have huge effects."},{"prompt":"Why do waitresses ask if Coke is okay instead of Pepsi?

What does a typical day look like? What are their responsibilities? What do they do to grow their company every day?","completion":"As a startup specialist and CEO of number of companies, let me answer this question in a different way. We already have several points on the daily responsibilities. Here I would briefly try to explain what is a ‘Must-do’ and ‘Must-have’ for every CEO in a startup scenario. Let me define the attitude and personality of the CEO here. Without these qualities, it would be impossible for a startup CEO to be successful. Willingness to Fail One of the simplest qualities any startup CEO needs is the willingness to fail. This might seem counterintuitive, but it’s necessary. A person who is afraid of failure is afraid of risk, and there can be no large scale success without risk. Failure isn’t desirable, but to be afraid of it isn’t acceptable. You need to confront the possibility that things might not go as planned and then you need to keep going anyway. You have to move forward with low certainty at times and you must do so with no fear. You need to confront the possibility that things might not go as planned and then you need to keep going anyway. You have to move forward with low certainty at times and you must do so with no fear. It’s the ‘never-die’ and ‘can-do’ attitude which is most important in a CEO’s daily life of survival. Long Work Hours In addition to this, startup CEOs need to be willing to work long hours. Some people glamorize the idea of being a CEO as an easy position with a lot of perks, but that idea isn’t always true. Sure, some CEOs are passive within their jobs, but you can’t afford to act that way when you’re working at a startup. Everyone needs to be giving their job their all, and that includes the CEO. It is important to give 100% efforts and 18hrs a day if required. Make Sacrifices As the CEO you also have to be prepared to make sacrifices. If you need to take a salary cut to hire more staff members then you do it. If you need to give up your big office to save space on rent then you manage. If you need to pay out of pocket for some office or work supplies then don’t complain about it. It’s especially important that you don’t complain about any of that. And do you know why? Because the CEO is seen as a leader. A leader to lead from the front and able to take failures in his stride to rise up again. Outward Confidence You need to be confident on the outside, even if you’re terrified on the inside, because your tone and the way you carry yourself will influence every worker under you. If your staff sees you panicked then they’ll soon be panicked too. No matter what happens you need to act as though it’s just a minor setback. Freak out when you’re alone if you need to, but avoid public displays of stress at all costs. Decision Making Above all else, you need to be a decision maker. You can’t spend a week sitting on your hands and contemplating each move you make. A startup CEO has to take charge of situations and make quick decisions that serve their business well. Quick decisions that end in disaster won’t due, and neither will delayed decisions of any sort, even if they’re good ones. They need to be good, they need to be made quickly, and you need to be the one to make them. Think on your feet.

Most of you may remember this image. It is a grisly, iconic, Pulitzer Prize-winning photo from the Vietnam War that shocked the world. My eyes were always strangely drawn to the Executioner, General Nguyen Ngoc Loan. The blend of his menacing face, the nonchalance in shooting the man, one must wonder, what leads a person down this path to villainy? How could one so quickly kill a bound, unarmed prisoner? Upon my further investigation - this might be one of the most misunderstood photos in history. The plainly dressed victim might resemble a normal pedestrian - but he was no ordinary prisoner. He was the leader of a Vietcong death squad, that had infiltrated Saigon with the express purpose of assassinating a long list of people. He had personally executed several military officers and their entire families. He was found standing over a grave with 34 bodies in it, that included women and children that had been killed execution style. Following this famous photo, Loan continued fighting in the war for several years. He was later injured, losing one leg. Loan and his wife eventually escaped to the US. Where he had 5 children and owned a restaurant in Virginia. But his life was haunted by the photo that was taken of him as he was held up as a standard bearer for the evils of war. Loan's property was frequently vandalized and he was targeted by various outlets over the years. The photographer, Eddie Adams, was deeply regretful of ever having taken the picture. He knew Loan well and stated that he was a good man and misrepresented. Adams felt he captured two deaths in that photo: that of the victim and that of Loan. And - to be clear - this answer is not an attempt to absolve this man of all blame. This is dark stuff. However, what Loan did was not far beyond the bounds of what other soldiers were doing. War is and has always been hell. To pretend it is anything less is to pretend fire isn't hot.

People getting into FAANG, cracking difficult coding interviews and at the base of all of this is what we are going to learn about. Competitive Programming skill is one of those few skills that set you apart from the crowd, add more value to your resume, and subsequently provide you with an edge over others during placements or other career opportunities. You need to know that many renowned tech giants including Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. significantly consider the competitive programming skills of the candidates and even recruit the candidates through various competitive programming contests. What is Competitive Programming? Competitive Programming is an exercise to level up your Programming and Data Structures & Algorithms skills via solving numerous real-world programming problems under certain crucial constraints including time limit, memory constraints, time & space complexity, etc. You need to come up with an optimized solution within the time limit for the given programming problem in your preferred language and your code must pass all the required test cases. Roadmap To Start Competitive Programming Interested enough to move forward with how to start? Let’s put forward few points step by step – 1. Learn the Preferred Programming Language Learn a language and go to the depth, understanding the bits & bytes of that language. (p.s. also don’t go for a PhD in that language either). You can start with any language Java, Python, C++ anything that suits you but also looks for the code lengths and memory usages of each before moving forward with a particular language as it hugely affects your performance time in contests. 2. Learn Data Structures & Algorithms Then, here comes the core aspect of Competitive Programming i.e., Data Structures & Algorithms. Indeed, learning the DSA fundamentals is a must to start your journey of becoming a Competitive Programmer. I recommended you to at least cover the DSA fundamentals like Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Searching, Sorting, Time and Space Complexity, etc. before starting to solve problems and doing competitive problems as it’ll help you to feel confident and solve a majority of the problems. Without knowing Data Structures & Algorithms well, you won’t be able to come up with an optimized, efficient, and ideal solution for the given programming problem. To learn and master Data Structures and Algorithms, you all are strongly recommended to visit GeeksforGeeks, Expertifie, Scaler, Algoexpert as there you’ll find adequate quality resources such as free tutorials, most affordable online courses, live classes, and much more. Expertifie’s Data Structures & Algorithms online training course is curated and mentored by industry veterans to bring the best to you. To excel and master competitive programming, do check out Expertifie’s DSA course, where you get features like:- • Live Online Interactive Classes. • Live Doubt Clearance and Support. • Access to our Weekly Masterclasses on all Software Development topics. • 24X7 Access to Industry Experts for all your questions. • 100% Referral Guarantee. • 1000+ Coding Questions from Leetcode / Codeforces. • Career Support through Mock Interviews and Job Referral. • Coding Sessions and Assignments for each topic. • Upto 4 Mock Interviews. • 60+ hours of Live Content. • Lifetime Access – Re-join a batch again anytime for free. • Sessions by Industry Experts from MAANG 3. Start Practicing and Solving Problems Start getting comfortable with a coding site with a good interface like Hackerrank, and solve quite a few numbers of problems from them. Why choose Hackerrank? Its recommendation system takes you slowly and gradually with increasing difficulty and building up your confidence. Solve at least 40-50 questions from Hackerrank and make yourself comfortable with the IDE. 4. Start Participating in Coding Challenges or Contests • By now you should have gained much confidence and you are ready for moving into contests in sites such as Codechef, Codeforces etc. Start with long challenges in Codechef, where you will get 10 days’ time to solve 8-10 number of questions, particularly this is best suited for beginners as it gives ample time to research about a problem and come up with a solution. • Maintain Consistency, be patient and try to push yourself out of your comfort zone by revisiting the questions which you were not able to solve after every contest. Do them yourself again. Watch editorials, other’s solutions after the contests if you are not able to understand it. Although as a beginner do not engage more than 30 mins for a question if you are not able to find an answer. • If possible, find someone with the same aim of competitive programming for pair programming. This helps to learn by other’s mistakes and also improve one’s ability to think out of the box. There are various platforms that organize these programming challenges regularly such as Codeforces, Expertifie, GeeksforGeeks, CodeChef, HackerRank, etc. These platforms conduct numerous coding challenges on a weekly or monthly basis and here you’re required to compete with numerous other competitive programmers sitting all across the world. You need to solve the given problem with an optimal solution and that too, in the specified time duration. Also, one of the best strategies that you must remember is that once the challenge gets over, try to solve those problems again (or go through the editorials/solutions) that you were failed to solve during the challenge. 5. Stay Consistent with the Process – LEARN, PRACTICE, PARTICIPATE! • Start learning Algorithms along with the contests, algorithms can help you clear your confusions, there are few algorithms which are difficult to visualize when starting as beginners. Algorithms will help you to optimize your program and is one of the most vital factors in ranking in contests as it hugely affects your execution time. • By now you will be familiar and confident with most of the contests, now its time to move up to higher levels. Start by participating in international competitions like Google CodeJam, TopCoder contests, ACM ICPC etc. If the right amount of hard work and patience is given you can definitely find yourself among the top participants in these contests. • Very importantly do not lose confidence if your ratings drop, do not give up. Initially, it will be challenging to maintain the consistency but it’s very fine and quite everyone goes through this phase. So, these above-mentioned steps can help all the newbies and students (who’re having zero experience of CP) to get started with competitive programming quite smoothly and efficiently. Also, do remember the following points in the journey of getting started with competitive programming: • Build connections with fellow competitive programmers • Do not directly jump to solve the complex problems instead start with solving easy problems first and then gradually move towards advanced ones. • Before start solving the problem, read the problem statement thoroughly for getting the right interpretation of the problem and thus coming up with the right solution. • Always keep in mind the Time and Space Complexity factor while solving a problem. • Don’t get discouraged or demotivated due to initial failures, instead take them as learnings to improve yourself constantly. Again, along with programming and DSA skills, Competitive Programming is much more about dedication, patience, and consistency. Competitive programming will never disappoint you. You will always find something to learn every time. The best thing that you will get from this is various kinds of optimising algorithms which you can use to scale and optimise real-world projects."},{"prompt":"What excites you about the future?","completion":"The first thing that excites me with the AI ​​of the future is its mental omnipresence for each of us, an Internet linked to us by the thought that connects us all, always ready to discuss with us, to solve our problems, to distract us, to learn, to offer us the most extraordinary services, those we imagine and those that AI imagines itself for our well-being : the \\"Noosphere\\" of Teilhard de Chardin (1922!). The second thing that excites me is the omnipresence of robots Asimov type, connected to the Noosphère, the hands of AI always smarter because they learn constantly without ever forgetting, more and more helpful and exciting companions who understand their masters better and better, immortal, multiplying by 1,000 our mental and physical faculties, exploring the universe for us, orbiting spaceships with artificial gravity (by their rotation) to allow man to travel as long in space, Preparing our arrival on Mars or a planet of Alpha Centaurus by building cities and terraforming.

Different extinction events have clearly shown that large predators - which need more food to sustain themselves - do not fare well in times of ecological stress, such as food scarcity. The animals that survive are those that can get by on less. Other posters have pointed out the multiple advantages presented by pack hunting [though not the impact such practices have on the species’ adaptability]; lone predators are limited in how quickly they can adapt to change. This seems to be representative of the crush of evidence available. Lastly, there is the mindset of each animal to consider. Dogs are largely social animals [as are the wolves they evolved from], whereas cats are often seen as solitary, stealth hunters, and not as interested in working within groups. This translates [imo] as the feline having to depend upon itself, whereas the canine has a pack for support. The cat in the wild needs to ‘carry its own equipment’ so to speak, and thus can grow quite large to meet the needs of solitary living and survival."},{"prompt":"Alexandria OcasioCortez said Going by track record, I’d feel safer in a bathroom with a trans woman than a powerful male executive any day of the week.

While humans normaly making an effort to look good, behave well and please other humans the punk rocker does the opposite. They try to be as ugly as possible. (When the first punk rockers came to Sweden the most prestigious thing was to push a safety needle through your cheek and then closing it so that your mouth could not be closed and your faces was deformed) Why? Because they wanted to express their hate. Hate to parents, school, teachers, society, God, nature… Everything is shit except punk. Brutalism is punk architecture. It’s purpose is to express hate. My grandfather, born 1907, was a great fan of modernism. He hated house that looked like this: Hirschska huset In Sundsvall, my grandfather hated it because it was besutiful. Rich people had build such houses to display their wealth, he explained, a wealth that was created by poor people who lived like this: I told my grandfather that the housing areas of the poor people who’s work had created the wealth of the people who lived in the most beautiful houses ever build did themselves live in beautiful houses in beautiful environments. This made my grandfather very angry. I had not understood anything. The problem was not that poor did not live in as beautiful houses as rich people but that poor people were … poor. Not all could afford shoes to their children, a major disadvantage when snow cover the land for 7 month a year. Some where underfed and got deceases like tuberculosis. The work was hard and dangerous. Books were an unachievable luxury. People lived in overcrowded apartments. And I had the bad taste to notice that they lived in a beautiful environment. Grandfather wanted all the beautiful houses from the evil age before the Socialdemocratic take over of the political power to be teared down and replaced with really ugly houses in a brutalist fashion. It would be a proper revenge on the rich people who had build beautiful houses for rich and poor people. So ugly houses was build. It was a protest. People who lived in the new brutalist houses suffered from the inhuman environment they had to live in. This came as a complete surprise. New apartments had hot and cold tap water, central heating and electric owens. How could people not be happy when enjoying such comfort? The problem is that creating an ugly and inhuman environment is a bad idea. The people that the protest is ment to adress are since long dead. If they were alive they would not understand the message. If the problem was apartments without WC, why not just build houses with WC? What is really accomplished by building ugly houses?

They use a SSD for the Windows installation, and a separate mechanical drive, this is your storage. This can normally be upgraded also so don't base your purchase purely on the storage but do check of its upgradability. As already suggested, you do have the option to plug in an external drive. SSD is the faster solution but still too expensive for a decent size so not affordable for most. I would look at the minimal of 2TB, but a 4TB or higher mechanical HHD would be better. Now the external route will need at least a USB 3 interface on both the external HHD caddy and a USB 3 port. I use WD Black HHD myself. Also, seek a decent secondary HHD inside the laptop, these days a 1TB is common, but it may be worth looking into what speed your laptop uses for an internal HHD as opposed to what an external USB3 HHD offers. Being organized This is very important. Every project should have its own folder with subfolders organizing the assets for that project.

Here are some tips that can help you lose weight effectively: Consult a Healthcare Professional: Before making any drastic changes to your diet or exercise routine, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional, such as a doctor or registered dietitian, to ensure that your weight loss plan is safe and appropriate for your individual needs.Balanced Diet: Focus on a balanced and nutritious diet that includes a variety of foods from all the major food groups. This will provide your body with essential nutrients while reducing the likelihood of deficiencies.Control Portion Sizes: Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating. Using smaller plates and bowls can help you naturally eat smaller portions.Increase Vegetable and Protein Intake: Incorporate plenty of vegetables into your meals, as they are low in calories and high in nutrients. Protein-rich foods, such as lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, legumes, and tofu, can help you feel fuller for longer and support muscle maintenance.Limit Processed Foods and Sugars: Reduce your intake of processed foods, sugary snacks, and sugary beverages. These foods are often high in empty calories and can lead to weight gain.Stay Hydrated: Drinking water throughout the day can help control your appetite and prevent overeating. Sometimes, your body may mistake thirst for hunger.Regular Exercise: Engage in regular physical activity, combining both cardiovascular exercises (like walking, jogging, or cycling) and strength training. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days.Get Enough Sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Sleep plays a crucial role in regulating hormones that affect appetite and metabolism.Mindful Eating: Pay attention to what you're eating and savor each bite. This can help you recognize when you're full and prevent overeating.Set Realistic Goals: Aim for a gradual weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week. Rapid weight loss can lead to muscle loss and a decrease in metabolism.Track Your Progress: Keep a journal of your food intake and exercise routine. This can help you identify patterns and make necessary adjustments.Manage Stress: High stress levels can contribute to weight gain. Incorporate stress-relief techniques such as meditation, yoga, deep breathing, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy. Remember, sustainable weight loss is a journey that requires patience and consistency. It's important to focus on creating long-term healthy habits rather than resorting to extreme measures for quick results. If you're struggling, consider seeking support from a registered dietitian, fitness professional, or counselor."},{"prompt":"What would you do if you woke up beside Kamala Harris?","completion":"Try to make it all the way to the bathroom before becoming violently ill."},{"prompt":"Do you believe in karma?

Choosing or preparing an appropriate soil moisture is key to avoiding problems like root rot. Type Of Soil That Jade Plant Use The only major soil requirement that jade plants have is that the soil must drain rapidly. The jade plant, native to South Africa, has adapted to thrive in rocky, sandy soil with low fertility. Jade plants do have a tendency to become top-heavy and their shallow roots make them prone to tipping over. A slightly heavier soil that contains a greater amount of organic matter better anchors the jade plant. Jade plants can grow in acidic or slightly alkaline soils but can suffer from nutrient deficiencies or toxicity in an extremely low or high soil pH. Despite how much aloe vera plants help sunburn, like humans, they don't actually thrive in the sun—and yes, this is the case even thought they bloom in the summertime. (Because that would just be TOO easy.) If you found yourself saying \\"really?\\" to these facts, then you've definitely come to the right place. It isn't actually hard to grow an aloe plant—here are the secrets to successfully getting yours going in time summer. Type Of Soil Aloevera Plant Use Because aloe vera plants are succulents, the type of soil you choose can really make or break your success. suggests a sandy soil with a neutral pH. Potting mix made for cacti and succulents is always a great choice.

It would usually be over something I thought was trivial and it was result in me being told to fuck off and sworn at and screamed at and he would get so angry. An example is I said have a nice day 3 times to him (he was in a bad mood but I didn’t know he was or why and he ignored me the first 2 times I said it). He then told me to fuck off and he couldn’t be arsed with me and slammed the door and text me to leave his house later as he was having his daughter. I had anxiety all day thinking I had done something wrong and he was going to leave me and so I didn’t raise it and carried on as normal but it was getting to me so I brought up the next day that I can’t deal with the way I am spoken to and he said can’t I see that I’m annoying repeating have a nice day when he’s in a bad mood and I put on a voice to annoy him. I’m immature and insecure and he got very angry at me again. Another example is we were going to an important appointment and I wanted to leave with enough time but I knew saying can we go now please would cause him to get angry so I said it’s a 40 min drive instead to try and get him to leave. He screamed and swore at me the whole drive saying he can’t deal with how I am not direct and how sneaky and sly I am and he’s never made me late before so I don’t need to tell him when to leave when he’s the one driving. I had anxiety again all day and felt like I had done something really wrong and so I text and called him to make sure he was okay again. He would often think I phrased things to deliberately be sneaky but I never did. I phrased things less directly to try and avoid conflict but it didn’t stop it sometimes. My point is am I to blame for this? I sometimes think was I that annoying you that it made him get so angry and swear at me because often he made me feel so happy and special but then other times when he would get so angry at me I would question what was wrong with me and why one minute I was everything to him and the next it was like he hated me. Update: he sent me a massive apology text acknowledging he was in the wrong and he didn’t mean anything he said so I thanked him and blocked him. This morning he called me and said he wants all the presents back he bought me for my bday 3 weeks ago as he spent a lot of money on me and I ‘dumped him for no reason’ 3 weeks later. I have said yes to giving it all back because I don’t ever want him to think for a second that money ever mattered to me but I feel shit that he would want to be so spiteful.

I’m guessing from the old paradigm in which democrats dubbed all republicans ‘pro corporate’. Which all began when Reagan lowered corporate taxes. Except that the tax cut was not really meant to help corporations. It was meant to help the middle class. Of course corporations benefitted. But those who demonize and target corporations don’t seem to fathom how destructive it is to the middle class. It’s killing the goose that lays the Golden eggs. Not through greed, but to have a political target as a source for ire. So we demonize corporations at our own peril. They will leave and take their massive economic boom to a friendly or state, or worse, a friendlier nation who recognizes the value corporations bring. The idea that Republicans are advocates for corporations is a false premise perpetuated by the left to infer greed. Anyway, when Obama, a democrat, bailed out GM, he did so against the wishes and advice of the vast majority of republicans. Federal bailout of private corporations is hugely destabilizing. No, republicans are in no way in favor of federal bailouts of private corporations."},{"prompt":"Will any Starfleet captain have a Targ as a pet?","completion":"If Worf ever makes captain then maybe.

The deal is intelligence is fine, education, maturity, personality, and other talents play into things also. We believed our kids would best thrive in a home where they felt safe, loved, and free to explore the world with some limits, and with our approval and guidance. With #1, he had interest, but his attitude from learning was akin to “Show me something I don’t already know or can’t figure out on my own.” He lost interest in the basics easily and went looking for “adventure” elsewhere. #2, was more artistic and extremely social, so for him, school was just one big party where he could socialize with people he enjoyed. #4 (yes I skipped a kid) had a learning disability along with intelligence so every day in public school was absolute torture. He began to excel after he graduated High School. For these 3, public school just wasn’t a good learning environment for them, each of them required different methods and interesting understanding teachers - and in a public school setting they all suffered (but there is no way we could afford private education). Although they all have extreme intelligence all three barely graduated, and all 3 once graduation managed not not only succeed without assistance, they excelled in their chosen fields -with some college for all three, but no degrees. They provide very well for their families and are successful in pretty much they chose to accomplish. Then we have the other 2. #3, learned very well in a public school environment but suffered from expecting too much from herself. She knew what she could do, and felt bad when she didn’t achieve what she wanted. She got excellent grades, but still struggled, mainly because she wanted to be “perfect.” She put herself through college and has a degree and a professional career that provides her with great monetary success. She has travelled and had a very good life - and she no longer worries about being perfect, she has learned that the only person she needs to impress is herself. #5 was made for typical school learning, has an eidetic memory, and earned scholarships throughout college and grad school. She also is a perfectionist who has learned to accept things for what they are, but still expects a lot from herself, and the only thing she judges another person for would be their wasting an opportunity because she knows there are many who never seem to catch a break. As parents of these kids we had to manage ways for them to be engaged and mentally stimulated or yes, they all would go bonkers with boredom. That wasn’t difficult to do, although we had to set rules for safety because some stimulation they sought out was risky. (a 4 yr old taking apart the toaster, curious 5th and 7th graders wanting to dissect a cat, rock climbing, yada yada yada) Luckily I am artistic and crafty so when nothing else worked we created things. There were times when each of them needed to release frustrations, so I would go to thrift stores periodically to purchase fragile items, like porcelain kittens or tea cups, and when things got tense, we’d go out back and I’d have them pick up a piece from the collection and throw it as hard as they could at the back wall along with a good hard loud primal from the gut scream. Lather rinse repeat until the frustration was gone. It soooo worked! Then there were times when I would just take them out of school for a “Medical Appointment.” because yes, if they kept going hard like they were, they would explode; so I would send them off to school and then go pick them up after first period or whatever and we’d head into LA or Santa Monica or wherever to just see something different than what we were living. Jewish neighborhoods, Little Tokyo, Olivera Street, a pier, a market, a museum, a university campus, a donut shop in Hollywood. They needed to learn that not everyone was like us, people were different colours, shapes, religions, they ate food that tasted so unlike what we ate, they dressed dissimilar to us, they smelled spicy or floral or musty because they were so very much older than us. These “Medical Days” were so much fun and we never knew where we’d end up, but they were most definitely necessary to keep us all interested and sane. My kids were allowed to chose their own friends and our house was literally unlocked so often times we would come home to a stranger asleep on our couch, or perhaps we had a kid who’s standards weren’t exactly the same as ours, but they had a completely contrary home life so it was expected. As long as people and a few rules were respected everyone was allowed. I believe this was very important to my kids’ development, they needed to learn that there was more to life than our rules and our house, and our small little town. Not everyone we met would believe as we did and they would need these experiences in order to navigate adulthood on their own. We exposed our kids to many forms and styles of music, art, literature, theatre, religions, and philosophies, pointing out similarities to our beliefs and preferences so they would come to understand that the world is more alike than it is oppositional. Bottom line: We tried to fill our kids with a lot of varied experiences as a family. They did sports occasionally, but mostly we did things together as a family that kept us all busily engaged and interested."},{"prompt":"Why are cookies called biscuits in England?","completion":"Wrong way round.

Or some that grow very tall, or wide, or old. But in my book the prize for uniqueness goes to the Welwitschia. The Welwitschia tree looks like an untidy pile of dirty sheets, but it is a tree. It is probably the shortest tree in the world. I'm not very tall myself (1.55m) and yet I'm taller than these trees. Luckily my circumference isn't close to the 8m or so of the larger Welwitschias. These trees also do not have branches. Not a single branch You get plenty of vegetables (lettuce for one) without branches. But trees? Not so much. It does have a pair of leaves though. And when I say a pair I mean exactly that. It grows 2 leaves and that is it. In Afrikaans it is called a tweeblaarkanniedood ( 2 leaf cannot die) because these 2 leaves will keep growing for hundreds of years, very slowly, and reach lengths of more than 4m. The tips do get eroded otherwise they would be a lot longer aftoer a 1000 or so years. Since they only ever have these 2 leaves they are obviously evergreen trees. They also come in male and female versions. To top it all the Welwitschia lives in the Namib desert where it scarcely ever rains, surviving off the fog that rolls in from the cold Atlantic Ocean and collects on the 2 very long leaves. If there are any trees weirder than this I would love to know. [LINKED_TEXT: Welwitschia - Indigenous Plants - Namibia...Welwitschia Name Welwitschia [Welwitschia mirabilis] Introduction 'It is out of the question the most wonderful plant ever brought to this country, and one of the ugliest.' This was the response of the Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in 1863 when presented with a plant of Welwitschia mirabilis. Welwitschia mirabilis plants are unusual for their large, strap like leaves that grow continuously along the ground. During its entire life, each plant produces only two leaves, which often split into many segments as a result of the leaves being whipped by the wind. Carbon-14 datings of the largest plants have shown that some individuals are over 1500 years old. Description The Welwitschia mirabilis is a dioecious perennial plant with short stem and taproot. Beyond that, the plant is often described as 'bizarre', 'weird', or 'unlike any known plant on earth'. Its short, woody, unbranched stem is surmounted by 2 strap-shaped leaves that grow from a basal meristem throughout the life of the plant, becoming twisted and frayed with the passing centuries. Stomata occur on both leaf surfaces. The woody stem widens with age to become a concave disc up to a meter across, from which grow small ramified branch systems that serve only to bare pollen and seed cones. The branched reproductive shoots arise near the leaf bases. Red pollen cones, resembling those of Ephedra, appear in groups of 2-3 on each branch. Normally, only one seed develops within each cone and is dispersed by wind. Welwitschia Leaf Characteristics Welwitschia leaves are the longest-lived in the plant kingdom, they are evergreen, a single pair and generally broad and flat. The broadest unbroken leaf measures 179 cm. This particular leaf was 6 meters long of which 3.15 meters were living tissue. The surface that this leaf covers helps the plant to survive at a temperature on the soil as high as 65 'C. It keeps the soil under the plant cool and moist. The leaves grow annually an average 13.8 sm. Therefore the plant can produce up to 150 metres of leaf tissue over a growth period of 1000 years. The leaves are on average 1.4 cm thick. The leaves that lay on the sand surface also prevent wind erosion. Even under gale force conditions the broad leaves remain rigid and immobile. Absorption of water through the stomata must be regarded as very interesting; this characteristic of the leaves has ensured the species survival. The stomata remains open until the fog has lifted and although much of the water that has condensed on the leaves runs off the direct intake of a proportion of this water takes place. Unlike other plants the stomata is open under foggy conditions and closes when it is hotter. This ensures that no water is evaporated during the heat of the day.

I think that’s unlawful to even try to do, as mentioned, due to the ‘PEOPLE DIE if you do that’ factor. A hydrant, is a hydrant, is a hydrant. Most places have the curb marked as well. some do not. sometimes the paint is gone. If you say you didn’t see it, and it was clearly obvious, they will become angry at you for ‘lie’ at them. Do not approach this as a person fighting another man or an argumentative by nature person. These are people who want their day to be dull, you to be penitent, sorrowful, and submissive. If you can’t bend your pride enough to be that which they desire, then you will not ‘get out’ of it. Never try to argue. Ever. They see it as ‘back talk.’ You must be respectful, speak only when spoken to, and not make excuses. If you state ‘I thought it was maybe a fake hydrant because it was blue and aren't they supposed to be red’ you will get a firm ‘….no. Full fine.’ and an irritated person who can make your life painful, and may CHOOSE to do so to ‘teach you a lesson.’ Again, you are the one at fault. You violated a rule they stated, which has actual social consequences if a emergency happens…and one thing about United states-ians? THEY THINK ABOUT EMERGENCIES A LOT. They are ANXIOUS. NERVOUS. To them, ANY accident COULD be possibly them having it. If you get combative, angry, or even loud, they expect that you may be suddenly violent. Don’t smile. Don’t be happy to be there. Be afraid, show you are afraid and do not want to ever be there again. Be nervous, but not a wreck. Be serious. you are not there to make friends. Or, go friendly idiot route and state directly ‘I am an idiot, and didn’t get they came in blue as well. I’m so not ever going to make that mistake again. I will pay the full fine if needed, as that’s fair, but is there any chance at (insert lesser penalty here) with the understanding that i won’t ever get out of another ticket again for being an idiot.’ Never demand it, or expect it. the lesser may be a lowered fine, if you are poor, or not having points taken, etc. Be honest. If you are an idiot, and did an idiot thing, own it. You are at fault. There is no escape, any more than if you had gotten caught shoplifting a large obvious object like a piano or something. Ultimately, you construct the story of your life. Just because you are ‘the hero’ in your story, does not mean you are not going to be able to act like that in someone elses. In the story of the judges and staff of the court, you are an idiot who is arrogant and trying to argue/intimidate/etc at them, is literally going into a lions den and tugging tails. They are bigger than you, they do meaner things to meaner people than you, and might very well be bored and wanting to channel some of that irritation at the stupidity of humanity in general at some ‘stupid young driver’. If you are of any minority, you will have less luck than if white. if white, you may be able to more easily pull off the ‘i’m an idiot kid’ mode. if not, or female, submissive is the only route guaranteed to produce any compassion."},{"prompt":"Why are Democrats afraid of Christians?","completion":"Democrats?

So, no, you can't get around the problem. Like Dr Einstein asked, “if you are not looking at the moon, does it exist?”. And the answer is yes, your shadow cast by the moon indirectly makes you an observer of the moon. And as soon as it is observed, aka entangled, the quantum phenomenon disappears. The moon light is the first person, you are the second person, and the ground is the third person. This kind of third person or forth person trick happens all the time.

Similarly, a vegetarian has every right to not consume what they do not wish to consume. Mess is a common place where you cannot scrutinize who touches what. I have seen myself many non vegetarian students touching veg food items if they need a refill. Knowingly or unknowingly, it leads for veg items to get a hint of non veg. So, yeah.

It's a competitive world on Amazon, and one in which any product search will turn up dozens if not hundreds of hits. So how can you make your product stand out? In marketing speak, how can you differentiate your product? First of all, find the gaps and the pain points. Listen out for questions like • Why don't women's clothes ever have pockets in? • Why can't I get pie dishes the right size for one person? Or screams of anguish like • I love jeans but blue is not a choice of color! • My hairdryer is either cold or SCORCHING!!! • I keep losing the wretched little kneading arm on the bread-maker, darn it! Someone, whoever made this comment, has a problem that your product can solve. Make pretty summer dresses with pockets, single-size pie dishes, screaming pink and neon yellow jeans, hairdryers with five different heat settings all of which work, and you have solved the problem. (Okay, you need to work out whether that's just one person's problem, or whether other people are also crying out for a product to solve that problem. We went on Twitter about the pockets issue. Starting a clothes brand called WITHPOCKETSIN is very, very tempting indeed.) Look at competitors' product listings to see what the issues are, too. Sometimes they are just small things that need to be put right, but sometimes you may see a really major gap. Secondly, look for the value added. Can you bundle products that are often sold separately to make something that's more useful? This is how tour operators got started - they realized most people don't want to have to book four plane tickets, two hotel rooms, a load of restaurants and activities … they want to have a simple choice: \\"us and the two kids, for two weeks.\\" (This is also why some tour operators came unstuck when websites like Kayak and Lastminute started making it so much easier for people to make up DIY holidays.) Taking the bread-maker example, I wonder how many people would prefer to buy a bread-maker with two or three extra paddles? That saves them having a useless bread-maker. (Buying replacement paddles is expensive and often difficult.) So that's value added, or at least, it avoids the subtraction of value! Adding a recipe book to kitchen equipment or a guide to three simple projects with a craft tool also adds value. And thirdly, look for a niche. It might be as simple as focusing on black women's beauty products (most cosmetics assume you have pale skin), or on products for people with RSI or carpal tunnel syndrome (eating implements with large, easy to hold handles, specially laid out computer keyboards). It might be a style niche (luggage for Goths and Emos, perhaps?) or a special interest niche (quilting, scrap-booking, home brewing). Most people who inhabit niches get tired of products that are almost, but not quite, right, or have to put together their kit from numerous different places, sometimes making compromises (implements that are usable but ugly, brewing kit that's been adapted from jam making purposes). Offer them a brand that clearly understands their lifestyle/needs/interests/style, and they will come back over and over again. Any one of these ways of differentiating is good. Two would be even better!"},{"prompt":"w has being raised by extremely strict parents affected you as an adult?","completion":"Being raised by extremely strict parents has affected me in a few ways as an adult.

I’ve always done well with the English language. Writing, reading, speaking, spelling, grammar… by whatever means of measurement one chose to apply, I’d fall into the far right of the bell curve. Except when it came to completing assignments. Senior year English was no different. First quarter, things were new and interesting. I managed to earn an A. Second quarter? F. The teacher was quite disappointed, as I had clearly demonstrated aptitude. Her confusion grew when the midterm exams were graded. I scored a 96%. This test and the first quarter A were enough to get me to pass the semester. Third and fourth quarters were solid Fs. Not even close. I simply did not do any of the repetitive work. I showed up every day. I participated. I payed attention. But I did not write out a word several times to learn spelling, or write the definition several times to learn meaning. I went into the final exam, knowing there was no way I could pass the class. When the scores came back, I had achieved the highest mark in the school. 99%. I was fully prepared to retake the semester in summer school, or night school. I was expecting it, in fact, as I had had to take similar action in the previous two years. But my teacher did something that stuck with me for far longer than any of the other lessons. She found me on the last day of school (attendance optional, but I was there), and said “James, you clearly learned all I had to teach this year, so I’m going to give you a chance to pass.” It wasn’t easy. There was a large writing project that we had been working on for the past 12 or so weeks. If I could produce the final product, she’d give me the lowest possible passing grade on the fourth quarter. With my final exam and one passing quarter, I’d pass the class. I got it done. One must ask, what is the purpose of education? Are we in school to learn, or to do repetitive tasks? Was my mastery of the concepts greater or less than that of the student who passed with a C? Or a B? Measuring aptitude and mastery is far more difficult than grading a structured assignment. But the system is not designed around this. In an ideal system, a teacher would be able to employ many different learning strategies, in order to find what works best for the students in their reasonably sized classes. But large classes and poorly designed standard tests severely restrict them. The system can be improved, but we seemingly hate to spend money on education. We can cut taxes and bail out banks, but we don’t want to invest in our children. A choice that will extract a toll over decades."},{"prompt":"w many gun owners have actually stopped a crime from being committed by using a gun?","completion":"The Dobermans ~ circa 1981 This story only took a few heartbeats to play out, but it quickly turned into a life changing possibility. Jan and I had been staying with our friends Mike and Linda in an upscale community of Ojai California, called Oakview. This was a nice neighborhood with well kept homes, clean streets, in a rural setting, many with citrus and avocado orchards in their front yards. The street out front dead-ended just past our friends' home. Beyond was undeveloped land used by my friends and the community as a place to ride horses and hike the trails with their children. It was a great place for our friends to raise their children. No one expected a violent criminal element in that Rockwellian neighborhood. We were staying with our friends while purchasing a new truck, a 1600 International Loadstar, to turn into a firefighting vehicle to lease to the U.S. Forest Service and the California Department of Forestry (now Cal Fire), during fire season. But that's another story. I was thirty years old and had been living in the wilderness for 6 years, I was not going to take shit from an armed assailant. To this end Jan and I had valid state licenses to pack concealed weapons, something I truly enjoyed. It gave me the ability to protect my wife and family from any lethal threat. I was licensed to carry a Colt .44 Special, Single Action Army, model 1871, “The Peacemaker” and a small hold out gun, a .25 caliber Junior Colt auto pistol, that I kept in my pocket. I carried these guns because it is a very dangerous world out there, filled with violent criminals. But not in Oakview California, not at my friend's home, yeah, right. But what we did not know and were probably in denial of, is you can be touched by crime and violence anywhere, even at my friend's home, where his children played in innocence, unaware of killer dogs only a yard away. One day I was outside getting ready to go someplace, our dog Lucky happily hanging out in the back of my pick-up truck, when a person who was living in a house behind my friend's and his neighbor's home suddenly appeared with two Dobermans. All of a sudden these unleashed Dobermans went for my dog, jumping into the back of my pick-up truck and grabbing Lucky, a 30 lb. shepherd mix, dragging him to the ground and then began killing him. I quickly realized the seriousness of the situation. The only option facing these two vicious 80 lb. dogs was one of my Colts. Fortunately I had my Colt .25 auto in my pocket. I retrieved it as the Dobermans began to rip my dog apart. As I got ready to dispatch these marauders, the owner jumped in and pulled his dogs off my now severely bleeding loved one. He only did so because he saw I was only a heartbeat away from dispatching his vicious animals. The only reason the dogs were not already dead, was because I could not get a clear shot. The dogs' owner was viciously bitten several times by his own dogs. This all happened in a flash of violence. I don't remember all that might have been said, but I made it very clear I was going to kill his dogs before my dog was dead. The man took his dogs back to his yard. I began trying to save my dog's life. A minute or two later, the dogs' owner, a man later identified by the police as a violent criminal, returned to the scene with a two foot long screwdriver, a lance of sorts, a bayonet. He came at me with the obvious intent to impale me with that screwdriver, he said he was going to kill me, “run me through”. I said, “Take your best shot.” I still do not understand his actions, he must have been on meth. After all, he knew I was armed with a gun and yet he was about to attack me with a sword of sorts. When I noticed his return he was within 20 feet of me and closing in real fast. At that point, it was quite obvious that this man intended to kill me. But he brought a screwdriver to a gunfight, not so smart. I reached into my pocket, grabbed my Colt .25, cocked it and pointed it at my would be assailant's face, almost touching his nose with the barrel of my gun by the time he stopped his assault. I still see the look on his face, eyes crossed looking down the barrel of my gun. He realized the error of his actions. He dropped his weapon, turned and ran away, with no shots fired. Jan gathered our friends' children and got them into their house to safety. Our dog Lucky lived up to his name and although he was ripped open requiring many stitches, he lived to love another day. The criminal and his partners in crime were later arrested for other crimes. We found out afterward that these Doberman dogs were responsible for killing many of the neighborhood cats and other pets as well. Without my Junior Colt the story would have had a very different ending, possibly a tragic one with both my dog and me perhaps killed in my friend's driveway in Oakview California, in a place not far from paradise. © 2016 Bill Rogers"},{"prompt":"Are bank tellers allowed to ask why you are withdrawing a lot of cash from your account?","completion":"In 2007 I withdrew 6000 in cash.

Others fear what might happen if they leave, such as violence or the loss of financial stability. Still others stay because abusive behaviors create an emotional addiction and a connection between abuser and victim. It's important for those in this position to understand that healthy relationships involve mutual respect and compromise, which can be difficult to establish without help from a therapist or counsellor. Having someone who understands the dynamics of abuse and abandonment can make breaking free much easier by giving sound advice on setting boundaries and making clear arrangements with family members so children are not harmed by parents getting divorced or separating from each other. Once you take control of your own life, you will feel empowered and ready to move on. Many survivors of relationship abuse experience a myriad of physical injuries from the mistreatment they have received from those closest to them, including broken bones, scars from burns or cuts and bruises all over their bodies. In these cases it is important that medical professionals are aware of how the injuries occurred so you can receive treatment and care. You can also speak to a local counsellor about the emotional side of abuse, as depression and anxiety are common consequences of abandonment and emotions may become unmanageable after you've left an abusive relationship. The journey from victim to survivor is a difficult one, but sharing your experiences can help others on the same path and give you some closure as well."},{"prompt":"ving at 62, I have no pension.

Why or why not?","completion":"I cannot provide real-time information or access the specific details of the alleged sale of counterfeit Patagonia products by Nordstrom. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the incident was intentional or accidental. The intent behind such actions would require a thorough investigation and examination of the evidence and circumstances surrounding the case. In general, the sale of counterfeit products can occur due to various factors, including intentional actions by individuals or organizations seeking to deceive consumers for financial gain, or it may be the result of unintentional mistakes or oversights in the supply chain. It is essential to conduct a comprehensive investigation to determine the intentions and responsibilities of all parties involved. If there are allegations or suspicions of counterfeit sales, it is important for the affected parties, such as Patagonia and Nordstrom, to investigate the matter and take appropriate actions to address the issue. This may involve legal proceedings, collaborations with law enforcement, and implementing stricter quality control measures to prevent the circulation of counterfeit products. It is worth noting that this response is based on a general understanding of situations involving the sale of counterfeit products and should not be considered a judgment or opinion on the specific case involving Nordstrom and Patagonia. For accurate and up-to-date information on this matter, it is recommended to refer to official statements, news reports, or legal proceedings associated with the case."},{"prompt":"What are some arguments I can make to fight a fire hydrant ticket? The hydrant was blue and I thought it was a paranoid homeowner who installed a private fire hydrant for his own use. There were no red lines or signs saying no parking.","completion":"There is one possiblity​, and it's slim. Where I grew up, the city was always nearly broke, and couldn't afford to fix all the broken hydrants. Instead, they painted the top red, so the firemen would know not to use it. They also repaired hydrants if more than two in a row were broken. If that city followed the same practice, and if that picture was of your car, and the silver top indicated a broken hydrant, and you knew that ahead of time, you might be able to get out of the ticket. In my town, the practice was not well known, so few people would be able to use that excuse. One other tip for you - Texas is the only place which paints so many curbs red. Don't depends on that marking elsewhere."},{"prompt":"Should recordkeeping be required on all ammunition sales in the USA?","completion":"A number of years ago, some politicians got the bright idea that they needed to have a spent cartridge case from every gun sold in their state, so it could be used to match cases recovered at crime scenes to a particular firearm. iirc, this was a rule passed in a New York and Maryland. This grand scheme solved a total of zero crimes. Yes, zero. As in none. Indeed, in Maryland all those spent cases sent to the state police were promptly thrown into a barrel. And that was it. Turns out, it doesn’t work that way. Too many politicians watch CSI and think it’s real life. But you can’t take a spent case fired from day one at the factory and compare it to some round fired sometime later… along with thousands of others, and get a “hit”. This sort of proposal is the same thing. How, exactly, will record keeping of ammunition actually help solve crimes??? Unless it’s some very unusual cartridge used that you could really limit your suspect pool with, all you are talking about is a flood of data that’s all going to be basically useless. Proposals like this are, at their heart, usually just a case of a politician screaming “stop liking what I don’t like”.

Apparently I put the rest of it back into the Tupperware container and put it in my desk. At the end of the year we were cleaning out our desks and I found the Tupperware container. I opened it - and the smell was so bad it felt like I instantly got punched in the face with odor!!!! I immediately closed it!

The United and Federation parts are easy. It covers all of Earth and those aligned with it, such as colonies. Citizen is a little harder. Only citizens can vote or have any say. You aren’t born a citizen, though. You earn it, such as through military service. You could say it’s a Republic. A veteran led parliamentary system of government where only citizens have any say. Citizens have rights, such as voting and serving in office, but also have advantages such as being able to have children easier, since it requires a permit, and education is cheaper. In a way, it’s a caste system that has eliminated racism and sexism. Homosexuality wasn’t mentioned, but I hope it has been dropped also. In many ways, it seems like a utopia. The first movie shows some problems here and has been described as Fascist. I can’t argue here. The Nazi-style uniforms are a nice touch. But, as you watch, you also notice that there is still a form of racism. If you’re not a citizen, you’re worthless. The bugs, which can be seen as a derogatory term, are to be exterminated at all costs, not simply defeated. The end result is rather scary. It really doesn’t matter what you call a political system when compared to what it is. The People’s Republic of China is communist and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was another.

While the journey may seem challenging, adopting the right strategies can make it both achievable and enjoyable. Here are seven of the best ways to lose weight effectively and sustainably. Mindful Eating: Start by paying close attention to what and how much you eat. Mindful eating involves savoring each bite, recognizing hunger cues, and stopping when you feel full. Avoid distractions while eating, such as watching TV or using your smartphone, as they can lead to overeating. Balanced Diet: Embrace a balanced diet that includes a wide variety of nutrient-rich foods. Focus on incorporating plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your meals. Avoid processed foods and added sugars, as they can contribute to weight gain and other health issues. Portion Control: Even healthy foods can add up to excess calories if portion sizes are not controlled. Invest in smaller plates to trick your mind into feeling satisfied with smaller servings. Additionally, avoid eating straight from the package, as it becomes challenging to keep track of portions. Regular Exercise: Physical activity is crucial for weight loss and overall well-being. Incorporate a mix of cardiovascular exercises (like running, cycling, or swimming) and strength training to help build muscle mass, which in turn boosts metabolism. Stay Hydrated: Drinking enough water is often overlooked but plays a significant role in weight loss. Water helps control appetite, aids digestion, and ensures proper functioning of the body. Aim to drink at least 8 cups (64 ounces) of water per day. Get Sufficient Sleep: Quality sleep is essential for weight management. Lack of sleep can disrupt hormones related to appetite, leading to increased cravings for unhealthy foods. Strive for 7-9 hours of restful sleep each night. Stay Consistent and Patient: Weight loss is a gradual process, and it's essential to stay consistent with your healthy habits. Set realistic goals and celebrate each milestone, no matter how small. Avoid crash diets or extreme measures, as they often lead to short-term results and can be harmful in the long run. Conclusion: Losing weight is achievable through a combination of mindful eating, a balanced diet, regular exercise, proper hydration, adequate sleep, and patience. Remember, weight loss is not just about reaching a number on the scale; it's about adopting a healthier lifestyle that will benefit your overall well-being. By making sustainable changes and staying committed to your goals, you can embark on a successful weight loss journey that brings long-lasting results. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any weight loss plan to ensure it is suitable for your individual needs and health conditions. if yo want to learn more about the ways to lose weight easily click here: [LINKED_TEXT: The Ultimate Keto MealEasy way to lose weight !https://vocal.media/education/the-ultimate-keto-meal-rvxs07lo] [URL: https://vocal.media/education/the-ultimate-keto-meal-rvxs07lo]"},{"prompt":"What is the difference between granite and marble?","completion":"We know that both marble and granite are known for their wide range of colours and textures. Moreover, both have been in use since time immemorial. When looking through history we can appreciate different buildings, palaces and temples made from both materials. Firstly, if we think marble places such as the Colosseum in Italy, The Taj Mahal in India and the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt come to mind. If we think granite, monuments such as the Mount Rushmore in the USA, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain for Diana in the UK and the Ayukana Statue in Sri-Lanka are just some to mention. This goes to show both materials are incredibly durable and have tested the passage of time. When it comes to contemporary decoration, the use one gives these materials would be different to that of a building or statue. In addition, you must consider which type of application you will be using the stone for. Firstly, it is probably useful for you to know that both marble and granite can be used outdoors and indoors. You may need to consider than the look and finish of natural stone in exteriors will be somewhat affected by the weather over time. Having said this, over time the marks will become part of the material providing unique charm and grace to the surfaces. The most frequently asked question is what to choose if it comes between the two? It will depend on your needs. The best answer will be to look at their individual attributes and decide which will be best suited. In general lines, both materials are effective for use in any areas of a house, although you would have to be a little bit more careful with marble certain places.[LINKED_TEXT: Kitchen worktops] [URL: https://www.mkwsurfaces.co.uk/stone/applications/kitchen/], countertops and other areas where cooking and food preparation take place may stain certain marbles if not wiped off quickly.

This is essential because water will naturally dilute the excess sugar in your blood and will remove it through the kidneys via urine. 2 - Good quality, CONSISTENT exercise. I find that doing 30 minutes a day can significantly improve my blood sugars. You need to make sure you are consistent because just doing exercise for one day and then giving up will not give you the results you are looking for. Exercise helps to reduce your insulin resistance and allows the cells to absorb more of the sugar in your blood for energy. 3 - If you are on an insulin shot or pill, MAKE SURE YOU ARE TAKING THE RIGHT DOSE. A lot of times if you are under-bolusing, you are not getting body enough insulin to absorb the sugar. Make sure you are checking with your endocrinologist or health care provider to see if you need to make some adjustments to your medication dose. 4 - There are a lot of products on the market that are designed to help you lower your resistance to insulin and keep your blood sugars steadier throughout the day. You can speak to your health care provider if this is something that may be recommended for you. I’ll leave an article for anyone interested in learning more tips about managing your diabetes.

Isn’t that what investors want?” I’ve been where you’ve been, so I get how hard it is to meet with investors. And you need to think about it from the investor’s point of view. Every business optimizes, or should optimize, around the most leveraged asset they have. For example, in the analog IC business that I spent the bulk of my career in, the most precious asset is the time of design engineers. Partner time is the most precious asset an investor has. After all, the only way an investment can happen is if an investor has time to meet with CEOs. I could tell when Jim approached Gill that the last thing Gill wanted was someone interrupting him during lunch. He just wanted to have his meeting with me and go back to work. Jim would have been much better served finding someone who knew Gill to introduce him. That’s how I met Gill. We have a mutual friend, Lew, who Gill has worked with for years.

Joe: Okay. Who else will be there? Me: Nobody. You’re a master, you don’t need anyone to supervise you. Joe: No, I mean who will be there to chaperone? I can’t be alone with a woman who isn’t my wife. Me: What now? Joe: It’s immoral for a married man to be alone with any woman who isn’t his wife. Me: Under any circumstances? Joe: Under any circumstances. Me: I see. Well Joe, I wish you’d mentioned this in your initial interview. Joe: What? Why? Me: Because it means you misrepresented yourself, Joe. You are not in fact able to perform all the duties required of the position you were hired for. Joe: What?! Of course I can! Me: No Joe, you can’t. One of the duties of a master is to meet with clients. Sometimes those meetings will be just the master and the client. If you are unable to be alone with any woman but your wife, then you are unable to meet with some of our clients, and therefore unable to perform one of your primary duties. Joe: Look, it’s fine, I’ll just bring an apprentice along. Me: Joe, it isn’t fine. No other master needs an apprentice to babysit him. And don’t even try bringing up “reasonable accommodation”, this isn’t a disability. I’m sorry Joe, but you can’t work here. Joe: That’s ridiculous! You can’t fire me, that’s discrimination! Me: It’s not, I can, and not in the legal sense of the term, no. Joe: So you admit it’s discrimination! Me: Technically, yes. When I hire people for a particular position, I discriminate against anybody who cannot do the job required. And you’ve just told me that you cannot do the job required. Joe: I can’t believe you’re firing me because of my religion! That’s so bigoted! I’ll have you in court! Me: That’s not…you know what, have fun with that. So, are you going to leave politely, or do I need to get the goon squad to show you out? Hey, I’m not going to make someone violate their morals to work for me. But if they want to work for me, I do expect them to do the work required. For all those in the comments who keep bringing up “allegations of impropriety” and #metoo, please note that the question specified that the employee believed being alone with a woman not his wife was immoral. It has nothing to do with CYA.

Looking at it, I am very sure that you really want to work hard to be great at it. That is a good start on itself. I personally feel that you are finding an issue in being better as a singer since you do not have a personal guide that can give you the correct fundamentals in singing and accordingly assist you in your journey. This needs to be fixed because you cannot be in the cycle of messing up over and over expecting different results; it is just pure madness. You really need to get yourself a private vocal teacher or coach if you want to pursue singing a lot more seriously. Even the professionals and musicians who have worked in the industry all have vocal coaches because they might not realize their own vocal problems to fix when they have one. Internet vocal coaches are certainly helpful, but they mostly tackle the general problems and not necessarily one's individual problems when it comes to singing, which is why a private offline one-on-one vocal coach is preferred. Also ensure that you get a qualified one that really instils discipline because without it your development will not as steady or rapid, and you will develop unnecessary bad habits that can hinder your musical growth too. At the same time, vocal exercises will only develop your singing if you are doing them correctly and immediately apply them to learning songs. There is no point singing scales smoothly if you do not know how to apply it in real performances, since technique is only a part of the whole thing when it comes to singing. I wish you all the best and do not give up! I am sure you will be great at it with correct effort and perseverance."},{"prompt":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

In effect, multiple pipes may sound by pressing a single key. The pedalboard requires both feet to articulate the pedal part, in conjunction with both hands. It can be busy—up to six distinct parts played simultaneously. The articulation of the piano (actual name: pianoforte, Latin for “soft/loud”) involves striking a string with a hammer with variable force. The resulting sound can vary dramatically in volume. Pedal actions allow notes to continue sounding while other notes are played. Modern electronic-action pipe organs sound notes once a key is depressed enough to open a valve allowing air into the pipe (like blowing a whistle), and sound only as long as the key is held down. Older, “tracker”-action organ used a mechanical connection between the keys and the pressurized wind chest on which pipes were positioned. Fingers rested on the keys met a resistance to motion, until sufficient pressure was applied to overcome the force of the wind chest and allow air into the pipe. As a result, a gentle but firm keypress produced a noticeably different sound than a hammerlike strike. The playing technique was similar to the contemporary harpsichord, in which strings are sounded by plucking (forcing a plectrum across the string)—initial resistance, followed by sudden “give-way” and note sounding, with characteristics of the sound dependent on the player’s technique."},{"prompt":"f Martian soil is toxic, can't be terraformed, and there is no way to retain an atmosphere, why is Elon Musk so determined to plant a colony there?","completion":"When I look at all of Musk’s technological projects I see that they form the basis for asteroid mining.

Brutalism defines assimilation. All flats look the same. It lacks outstanding features, making it bland and makes you look small because it gives you the feeling that you are stepping out of line. It is meant to force you into place. There is no you. It is the reason why communist countries built flats this way. Communism heavily relies on collectivism. A collective relies on individuals with no sense of individualism. If everything looks the same, it gives the feeling of collectivism. 2. It’s also a political statement. The lack of creativity, standing out, and lack of other architectural styles cause people to get on with their job, and cause people to lack opinions. It makes people know there is one ruler, who can not be questioned and will not be questioned. Because it defines authority, many government buildings were built this way. 3.

Now I would like to shed some light on M.O.M and M.A.V.E.N Lets start with some basic details. So the surprising thing is MAVEN was launched about 13 days later and arrived 2 days early. How? For the untrained, the first guess would be, \\"may be MAVEN was faster\\" or \\"Used more fuel\\" Well let me tell you, it would take the same amount of fuel more or less to send something to the mars as it would take to the moon. YES! LITERALLY. How? Because this is not like how an airplane travels from one place on earth to another. These missions are more or less like, taking an aim and throwing the payload and making sure it falls on moon or mars. That is literally how it works. So we just have to make sure it has enough fuel to escape earth's gravity (get the famous 11.2km/sec) and then it will go out of earth's orbit. But going out of earth's orbit is not drifting in outer space, we would be now in the sun's orbit (or the heliocentric orbit, so it would be a free fall around towards the sun (towards as in not literally heading for the sun lol). So if planned properly we could make sure that its trajectory intersects with mar's orbit. This can happen when both Mars and Earth are on the same side of the sun (which occurs about once in two years). Depicted in the pic below The white line is the trajectory of the orbiters. And throughout that 600Mkm, it was in free fall, and used no fuel (maybe little to just correct its trajectory, but not for the flight per say, the flight is a very carefully planned free fall around the sun, hats off to these rocket scientists who plan these things ;-) )Once it reaches mars, the orbiters slow down, and then get enough speed to start orbiting the red planet. OK but, why did M.O.M reach late? So we need to get 11.2 km/s escape speed right, how to get this. Lets start with MAVEN. First the primary rocket puts it in a LEO (low earth orbit) with orbital speed of 7.5 km/s. Then the primary rockets are detached, and secondary ones come into picture (I dunno the technical terms for them, so don't kill me if we don't really call it primary and secondary :P)The secondary stage was Centaur. Which is a beast. It has a thrust ability of 100,000 N. The total mass of Centaur and the orbiter is about 8000 kg. So we could now calculate for how long do we have to fire the rockets so as to raise that speed from 7.5km/s to 11.2 (In reality F=ma, don't work, but since I wanted my students to get a feel of these things without having to work with rocket equations I used them anyways, so our calculations maybe a little off, but you will definitely understand why we reached late ;-))so here is the calculations. Pretty straight forward, so it needed a 5 mins burn, and so in one shot, it was able to get that required 11.2 and into the heliocentric orbit. Now lets look at M.O.M :DIt is little so it weight about 1200kgIt was put into an extremely high elliptical orbit (details in the next pic) giving maximum speed at the perigee at 9.8km/s (oh goodie, so only a little more push at the perigee and we are off to mars.. yea?..)BUT WE HAD NO CENTAUR Our rocket was a baby rocket of 440N thrust. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT!!!??? Now imagine getting that 9.8km/s to 11.2.. with that 440N thrust. See the math. 1 FREAKEN HOUR!!!!!!!!YOu cannot fire a rocket for 1 hour. The simplest reason is, you need to fire it when we are perigee (near earth) because that is when we have the max speed of 9.8, and we wont be at perigee for 1 hour. so what to do? This is where we thought, there is no need to get that 11.2 in one shot. Lets do it little by little, called as orbit raising maneuvers. So the rockets would be fired (at perigee of ofcourse) for small time like 5 mins or so, which gives an increment, and raises the orbit, and after several such orbit raising, it would get that required 1 hour boost (which is spread out over several days) and ultimately it gets the escape speed. Here is the orbit raising pic I made (and the distances are TO SCALE!) The yellow circular orbit is a geocentric orbit for reference. Take another look (I worked very hard, so I might as well flaunt a little ;-)). To compare it with moon's orbit in blue, again to scale model. And finally on December 1st, it got the required escape speed and went into helio centric orbit. So from november 5th to december 1st, MOM was orbiting earth to get that 1 hour boost at the perigee ;-) Small note before I close, some people (who think they know stuff) claim that we used what is called as sling shot technique to get the required speed. They actually mistook the orbit raising maneuvers for sling shot. You cannot sling shot the planet that you are orbiting. Sling shot is like taking a ball and throwing at an incoming train, so that when it bounces, it does so with a huge boost. But if you are inside that same train, do you think you can now bounce a ball off the walls from inside an get a boost? No right? Hope you understood most of it. (Sorry if it was a bit too long, I told you, it was a 1 hour presentation :D)"},{"prompt":"Every year, the top 5 mutual funds changes. How can we select in a particular fund for a longer period of 15+ years?","completion":"We cannot. It is impossible to do so, because the top mutual funds are decided basis past performance, which is not an indicator of future performance. The possibility is very likely that today's topper could be tomorrow's laggard. Hence the approach should never be to select finds basis past performance alone, but using a combination of *consistency* in performance across various market cycles, the track record of the fund manager (important) and the fund house, aa well as a bunch of other ratios including Sharpe ratio, sortino ratio etc. A review of this needs to be done atleast once every year, and funds need to be changed basis their record on the above parameter. In case you are looking for a solution where you want to select funds once and forget about it for the next 15 years, the safest option is to choose index funds, which will give you average performance but eliminate the need for an annual review.

Unfortunately it sometimes jades the medical workers to the point where we doubt even legitimate complaints. It takes a lot of practice to detect the fakers.

The men we saw passing a bottle of Malibu rum around the theater as we approached it caught our attention. Several men drank straight liquor from the trunk of someone's modest midsize sedan. We laughed off their absurdity. As we waited to buy tickets, I noticed other people chatting in the lobby. I made our way to the auditorium first to take advantage of everyone's chit-chat. In the end, we got the best seats in the house. There was no doubt that people entered the theater in waves, all together. As if this weren't enough, other moviegoers greeted each new group, and screams and greetings welcomed each group's arrival. Our group of friends wasn't the only ones not knowing each other. There were nearly a dozen instances of this. Everything began to deteriorate immediately following the film's intro. It's hard to recall what happened when Tucker was off-screen, and Chan appeared on stage. Since I wasn't paying attention, I only assumed that Jackie Chan met someone important, and then they blew up. A group near the talkers argued with them because the volume of one such conversation amplified so much. After discussing for a few minutes, shouting took place, and eventually, a brawl broke out among everyone in the bottom section. A large cloud of smoke appeared to ooze on arms and legs like in a Looney Tunes cartoon. To match the lower section's fun, all of the patrons in the upper area, seated next to us, decided to join in. They started throwing Fizzy Molotov cocktails into the brawl with sodas swollen. Our rescue bottle hit our back seat person's head with a poorly thrown plate of nachos with cheese. We were terrified to come out of the theatre at the earliest."},{"prompt":"the greatest design classic the Fender Stratocaster?","completion":"Extremely subjective and I'm biased having played one for 30 years. With the contours, it provided an 'improvement' over the Telecaster and the fact that it's still as popular and copied as ever 60+ years later means it is one of I'd suggest the 3 best shapes, which in my opinion also include the Tele and single cutaway Les Paul shapes, simply because of the versatility.

Be aware that permanent data destruction requires a multi-stage process which may include physical destruction of the storage media. Secure permanent data deletion can be achieved through the use of software programs such as Eraser, or through the use of services provided by specialized companies. These software and services employ various techniques to ensure that data is irreversibly destroyed, including multiple overwrites and physical destruction of the storage media. Other examples of software programs that offer the ability to securely erase an entire drive include DBAN (Darik's Boot and Nuke), and CCleaner. These programs offer a range of destruction levels, from single-overwrite to multiple-overwrite to physical destruction. Additionally, some programs allow you to create an encrypted container to securely store sensitive data."},{"prompt":"What is the reason for the 4 seasons?","completion":"why 4 seasons? I think it has to do with how animals respond to nature. Another reason is farming."},{"prompt":"w do I talk like a native English speaker?","completion":"Learning a new language is complicated and difficult. Make it easy for yourself by watching a lot of good television and movie shows and learning songs. Consider that a baby learns to talk by hearing how adults speak. Your brain will work things out sub-consciously. You should note that there will be differences between the way Americans, British and Australian people speak. Their accents are distinctive. The way they emphasise words is different. For example, the Australian greeting - “Good Day” can sound like: “Gud Die” to many non-Australians. Leading to some confusion. Is he telling me to go die? I remember one true story where a foreign patient nearly had a heart attack because his Australian nurse told him he was going home today - which sounded like “You are going home to die.” So when you say you want to speak like a “native” speaker, you might want to learn the way people talk in that particular country. And yes, by all means, memorise as many dictionary and technical books as possible. But watching media shows is a much more fun way to learn."},{"prompt":"Why is it bad to have bubbles in a cuvette when using a spectrophotometer?","completion":"A spectrophotometer is a device that uses the absorption of light by a solution to estimate the concentration. The principle that the spectrophotometer uses to make this calculation is the Beer-Lambert Law. This law states that a parameter called absorbance - which is the logarithm of the ratio between two light intensities, a measured intensity and a reference intensity (don’t worry about the logarithm part, just remember that it’s a comparison between a control sample and a test sample) - is proportional to the length of the light path through the solution and the concentration of the solution. Notice there are two variables there. If you want to be able to measure one of them - i.e. concentration - you must keep the other variable constant. If a bubble in the cuvette get’s in the way of the beam, the length of the light path through the two samples will necessarily be different (since some fraction of one will be the air in the bubble), so you will not be able to estimate a concentration difference between the two samples. On top of this, the angled surfaces of bubbles could also act as prisms, bending the beam away from the detector and artificially reducing the intensity reading; spectrophotometer cuvettes are designed to have perpendicular walls."},{"prompt":"w do I cut a halfcircle in wood? I want to make a marble track from my wood.","completion":"As many have answered a cove bit on a router is the answer to cut your marble track. Get a cove bit the same size or larger than your marble. Cutting the half circle is easy with a router, just use a circle cutting jig: This one is about 34 on Amazon. All you do is remove the base plate on your router and attach the circle jig. You would need to place a center pin in the long slot adjusted to the radius of the circle you want and then use it to guide the router around the circle (or stop at a half). I usually make one out of 1/4″ plywood. Cut it in the same shape as the one above, and make it as long as you think you might need. There is no need for a slot, just drill a center point hole you need for the radius you need and drive a screw in at the center point. Mine is 36″ long, so I can cut up to a 6′ diameter circle. By the way, a router is also a great way to cut out a perfect circle using a straight cutting bit and the circle jig. Good luck!"},{"prompt":"What exercise can lose face fat?","completion":"Here are the top 10 possible ways to help reduce face fat: Caloric deficit: Create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn.

Weren’t they supposed to be taken down after the war?","completion":"There are still statues of Confederate generals because they’re still important to millions of us. We’re proud of the courage these men showed, and they also represent our ancestors’ sacrifices. The statues actually didn’t go up until years after the war. The usual silly narrative about this is that the monuments only went up for racial reasons. This is a comically unsound idea, because it overlooks a glaring, visible-from-space fact: the south was devastated economically by the war. The first few decades were about survival. Statues going up years later are more a reflection of an economy rebuilding. The garbage modern interpretation emphasizes race, because we’re obsessed with race in 2020.

Munich decided to go back, but, AFAIK, the French police is still on open source. Anyway, open source or propietary, both cost money, the question is (i) do you have the resources, (ii) will it give you a unique selling point/cutting edge and (iii) is there a company maintaining the open source or not? If you do not have the resources, it does not give you a cutting edge and there is no company maintaining the open source, then I vouch for a proprietary system. However, if you have a yes in one or more of these questions, then open source is an option.Footnotes [LINKED_TEXT: [1] ] [URL: #cite-LSQpE][LINKED_TEXT: End of an open source era: Linux pioneer Munich confirms switch to Windows 10] [URL: https://www.techrepublic.com/article/end-of-an-open-source-era-linux-pioneer-munich-confirms-switch-to-windows-10/][LINKED_TEXT: [2] ] [URL: #cite-tTqLH][LINKED_TEXT: Munich Ditches Linux.

You cannot transfer domain if it registered in less than 60 days from current time/date. -> Most of registrars put lock on domain transfers to secure your domain from unauthorized transfers. So you need to remove the lock. -> Get Auth code or EPP code from current registrar. -> While making transfer order from your desired registrar, they will prompt you to enter epp/auth code, you need to enter the Auth/EPP code you obtained. -> Make the Payment and wait for email from current registrar to accept the transfer process, few registrars may not send you a mail to accept the transfer, but they will send you a confirmation mail with a link to cancel transfer process with deadline. -> New registrar will wait for approximately 5 days to get your domain from previous registrar, you will then receive a confirmation mail regarding successful domain transfer.

Most of those who have seen Star Trek II in the theaters will feel liking something is missing, and but not be able to put their finger on it. But there are a few that remember key scenes like the when Scotty with his badly burned nephew and wonder why it is missing from the blu-ray. When Paramount released the blu-ray versions they did editing to all the Star Trek movies. For most of them, the edits are not very noticeable. But Star Trek II it seems like they significant changed the feel of the movie, and not for the better. Like many fans, I have edited my blu-rays to add back in the scenes from the DVD’s.

You would like to see the front page of Reddit. Your browser could ask the Reddit server for it and get it directly. Or if you use a proxy server, then your browser asks the proxy server to get the front page of Reddit, the proxy server then does so, and then gives your browser whatever it got from Reddit's server. Why would you want to do this then? The original reason is that this can make your connection faster. The front page of Reddit is something that a lot of people are going to ask. The idea is to store the front page on the proxy server itself. Then if that was the front page one minute ago when that other guy asked for it, then it probably still is when your computer asks for it. So the proxy server doesn't actually need to communicate with Reddit's server at all when your computer asks for the same page, that reduces the load on Reddit's server. And maybe more importantly, you'll likely be using a proxy server provided by your ISP. Communicating with a local server is almost certainly much faster than with Reddit's server, so your browser will be able to get the page faster than if it was communicating directly with Reddit's server. And that also reduces the bandwidth your ISP needs to use so they have an interest to provide this service. However then you run into problems if people are logged into Reddit and everyone needs to have their own version of the front page. Then the proxy server can't share the pages it gets from Reddit. Or if the content changes fast, it becomes a problem if the proxy server is giving out old copies of the page. Since so many sites these days work like this, the original intent of the proxy server is becoming less and less useful. However there are still many static components in most pages, like images and such, so a proxy server can still be useful even if the textual content changes for every user. Another reason to use a proxy is to circumvent regional restrictions. Let's say that you can't access something like The Pirate Bay from your country.

This resulted in his being afflicted with Cerebral Palsy which left Richard almost completely immobile and required care for the remainder of his life. Against the orders of doctors his father Rick chose to keep him at home and give him the best life he could. When Richard was 15 he asked his dad, Rick, if they could do a race to raise money for charity for an injured athlete from his school. He pushed his son in his chair for the entire race. His son ended up loving it, saying that while they raced he felt like he could walk for once in his life, that he felt alive. That was all that his father needed to hear. This began a long tradition of running races: Which included triathalons, in which Rick would put his son in a raft and pull him: Carrying him to different vehicles for transport. They have formed a legendary partnership that includes hundreds of races and 72 marathons. There is now a statue of the two in Boston: His father’s dedication to raising money and awareness for Cerebral Palsy, and above all, his dedication to bringing happiness to his son's life has always moved me.

The German Luger has a toggle link instead of a slide. The vast majority of semi-auto pistols today use a slide and a tilting barrel. Why? It works better. The Luger’s toggle link is overly complex, and the Nambu pistols were considered pretty bad. The Ruger pistols work because .22LR doesn’t require a locking mechanism."},{"prompt":"the US, is it better to send your kid to a public or private school? Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"It depends. Seriously. A big-name prep school that costs more in tuition than a state university would probably give you a better education than almost any public school. But. I grew up in an area where the public secondary schools ranged in quality from “rough” (like mine) to upscale and elite to the point where their graduates who didn’t go to the Ivy Leagues (or at least the Seven Sisters) were an embarrassment. The private schools came close to having the same range. There were a handful of real prep schools, but when my parents balked at my going to our local high school, they weren’t willing to mortgage my college money. Which was fair, but fortunately I convince them to let try the high school, grit and all — where I got a better education, and certainly a better exposure to reality, than I would have at any of the private schools they were will to pay for. Honestly, they were pretty lame. Some were just dumping grounds for affluent kids who were discipline problems, slackers, or just not very bright. A couple were girl’s schools that were glorified finishing schools. And some were just… lame. No science labs; no AP courses. (If my parents had been willing to try the local diocesan Catholic high school, it might have been different, but they were a bit bigoted that way.) So, if you’re considering public vs. private, do some research. And talk to your kid."},{"prompt":"w did pirate captains earn the respect of their crew?","completion":"Fear and the promise of bounty and wealth.

What would Japan government do in response? I think almost nobody is “upset” about the literal contents of his comment. “Puzzled” might be a better word. Puzzled because China and Korea have always used Japan as their main copying source of “how Asians can sort of westernize”, for more than a century. Unlike Japan, they needed a “outside filter” for their “applications”. Most of us didn’t/don’t care about this “filtering”, but it’s puzzling when they abruptly turn around and tell us that we’ll “never turn into a Westerner”. Or, was is that they were “trying to be Japanese” and they want us to “stay Japanese” ? Wang Yi’s comment doesn’t upset us, not just because it is puzzling.

The quality of the work of the Iron Dome has not been a question for a long time: 98% efficiency. Hamas and Hezbollah cannot \\"manufacture planes\\"... forgive me for a possibly stupid and naive question, but WHAT SHOULD someone NEED to have at their disposal in order to produce modern aircraft? How many years do aircraft designers study? A career in aerospace as a scientist or engineer requires four to seven years of college study following high school. A bachelor's degree requiring four years of study is the minimum necessary to enter this field. How long does it take to design a aircraft? Different versions of aircrafts? Okay, so you have noticed that there are several versions of the Airbus A320 or even Boeing 777. Well, designing an aircraft from scratch is a very long process (15-20 years) and extremely expensive. Hence a solution to this is to modify existing aircraft by upgrading some parts… How many planes are in Israel? (2023). The service currently counts 581 total units in its active aircraft inventory. Among these are the A-4 Skyhawk, F-4 Phantom II, F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-35 Lightning II. Hamas and Hezbollah are just armed gangs of savages, what kind of aircraft manufactory can they have, what are you talking about ?!

In one word. To elaborate… Jayalalitha is one of the most intelligent people Tamil Nadu/Karnataka have produced. She was academically brilliant and could master a lot with her reading and comprehension skills. Most of her film world peers recall that the young Jaya never came to the sets without a book in hand. They say she never made small talk with the other stars and chose to devote her time to reading instead. Her actor mother chose not to burden the elder son to make money for the family but forced the 15 year old school pass out to forget her Stella Maris admit (Stella is one of the most prestigious institutions in India) and do films. Her mother had celluloid plans for her and she had to bury her own dreams. It's a common notion across geographies that women actors are all about skin deep beauty, Botox and the uber-rare acting talent. Their brains are rarely acknowledged. Jayalalitha proved it wrong. She was a rare breed altogether. She's the only popular elected Indian politician (that I am aware of) Dr. Subramaniam Swamy has ever called, 'intelligent'. Now, Dr. Swamy is someone who's called everyone around him, opposite him and just about everyone, a fool. And while Dr. Swamy is an eccentric and totally impractical person, everyone acknowledges his genius and intellect. He’s mostly justified in his assessment of intelligence. The Tamil film industry was (and still is) a patriarchal, sexist, misogynistic place for the child (what else do you call a fifteen year old? ) who wanted to study and become a lawyer. She was a state topper in a few subjects in her school final exams. She was made to bow down to the powerful men who used her, abused her and did not figure out that their doings would come back to bite them in the arse. This is where we see the Cersei in Jaya. On film sets of those days, the entire crew had to rise and greet Sivaji Ganesan when he entered the sets. Jaya took it all in and then, when she became all powerful, adopted an adult son, chose Ganesan's granddaughter as his bride and demanded that she get due respect for a groom's mother in the wedding. An aged Sivaji stood in front of her while she sat in her darbar. She never forgot a slight and exacted her revenger after decades. MGR used Jaya in his movies and his entry into politics. She was his lucky charm who could give much support to his movie superstardom. And, she could speak to woo his political audiences. He sent her all the way to New Delhi to charm Indira Gandhi. She was clever enough to understand economics, administration, numbers and politics and she spoke fluent Tamil, English, Hindi, Kannada, Telugu among other languages. She could quote Keats and Bharathiyaar and the Bard, all in one sentence and make a socio political statement out of it. As a trained actor and danseuse, she had stage presence. She could mesmerise crowds in political rallies. Despite all this, it is said that MGR was also aware of her ambitions which is why he tried to keep her at an arm’s distance. Chandralekha, the IAS officer who brought together Sasikala, Natarajan and MGR says in one of her interviews, ‘MGR told me that Ammu was not to be trusted’. In the early 90s, Chandralekha was assaulted with acid when she went against Jaya in her divestment policies. Chandralekha was probably what Jayalalitha could have easily become, had she been given opportunities to study and write the civil services exams. When Jaya felt sidelined by MGR, she probably used the interview where she claimed she was dating Shoban Babu as bait to bring MGR back to her side. When an ailing MGR was counting his days, she pushed the leader, the party, the people and the PM Rajiv Gandhi to make her the acting CM of the state. Her ambitions were never secret. Like Tyrion Lannister, she learnt to use her flaws and miseries as armour. MGR’s deathbed saw a resilient Jayalalitha firmly standing by his side even though MGR’s wife and family tried shoving her around. No, she stood by the corpse, cementing her position as MGR’s political heir. She enacted a successful coup and gained total control of MGR’s party within a few years. In the infamous assembly incident of 1989 when her saree was pulled and torn (there are different account to this story and noone knows what exactly happened), a disheveled Jayalalitha swore to return to the assembly only when she was Chief Minister of TN. And she did that. She played the vendetta game with Karunanidhi and had him arrested in 2001. DMK did the same with her, of course. She threw Natarajan out when issues arose. She was frenemies with several powerful people in and out of the state. She allied with them when it suited her and threw them under the bus when she could afford to. She probably would have done much better than she did if she had chosen to forgive those who had slighted her. But then perhaps, revenge was THE driving factor for all that she achieved. She played the Game of Thrones. Did she win? Did she lose? I don’t know… We should ask Bran Stark to ‘see’ Jaya’s enigmatic life."},{"prompt":"What would you do if you woke up beside Kamala Harris?","completion":"Go to the doctor and get checked out."},{"prompt":"Do you prefer using urinals or private toilets?","completion":"You mean cubicle toilet bowls?

It was every government since the beginning of time. Man is born in a natural completely free state. Governments take some or all of those rights away. That is the nature of government. They lack the power to grant you any rights that you were not born with. All they can do is take away some of your rights. Ultimately, all governments become corrupt and you are most likely to be murdered by your own government. In the 20th Century, some 260 million people were intentionally murdered by their own governments. The US Constitution is the first effort to recognize the Sovreign Citizen since some of the early Greek city-states. The Declaration of Independence states it beautifully: “Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed…”. So that statement documents that all rights reside with the individual and governments only have the power granted them by the people. It then continues, “…That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it…”. So, to summarize…man is born free, with rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Inherent in the right to life is the right to self defense. And one of the ways it could be necessary to exercise that “self-defense” based on the history of all government since the beginning of time, “…it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government…”. Government rules, laws or otherwise, are ultimately backed today with the power of the gun. Break a rule in the US or any other country, and eventually a man with a gun shows up to force your compliance or to kill you. Your right to self defense is not limited to defense against those labeled as criminals. It exists against governments as well."},{"prompt":"What are the best street foods in India?","completion":"Chhole Bhature, belly Licious Punjabi cuisine In the event that its meat and potatoes in English, we have our own desi form of ‘Chhole bhature’.This [LINKED_TEXT: lip-smacking Punjabi cuisine] [URL: https://bombaydarbar.com/] is a staple breakfast in most of Punjabi Households.

This Myth this is not entirely true. But the research has shown that we can use max 10–20% of our brain. Some researchers have estimated that more than 60 percent of the brain consists of \\"neural dark matter,\\" or neurons that have no apparent purpose and seem unresponsive to common stimuli. If we take human evolution into accounts, our develop this magnificent ability of reasoning merely 70 thousand years ago. Considering nearly 2.5 million years of human evolution 70k is very very small fraction. That means nearly 2.5 million years we were just like other animals with limited brain capacity & thinking ability. Modern humans sport a brain averaging 1,200–1,400 cubic centimetres. brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. That means even if we are using merely 10-20% of our brain, it consumes 25% of body energy at rest, & encompasses 1200–1400 CC area. For using our 100% of our brain it size also need to expand which will make our head very large, which will be not supported by our rest of body due to inappropriate brain to body proportion. That means even if we are using merely 10-20% of our brain, it consumes 25% of body energy at rest, imagine we started to use 100% of brain power, than we have to provide constant food supply to keep it working otherwise it will just absorb all the energy of body and create condition of death oftenly, because we can't feed our body every seconds of time. 100% brain uses will need so much nutrients, blood supply, oxygen etc that it will create deficit in rest of body & start to absorb as much as it can from rest of body which will eventually kill us. So it's neither good nor possible to use 100% of brain. But let's imagine we have started to use 100% without any side effects or death. Than we will be able to create so many things, our Civilization will become too much advance in terms of Science, religion, psychology and so on. We might be able to develop some alien technologies, like one you have seen in movies etc But still we can't create energy because of universal law that energy neither be created nor be destroyed. So we might not be able to create something like entire separate human universe. So even we start to use 100% brain our options will be limited. No matter how much advanced you became you can never overtake universe or nature.

With AI, computers can recognize patterns, make decisions, and even learn from experience.Quantum Computing: Quantum computing is a technology that uses quantum mechanics to process information. It has the potential to solve complex problems that traditional computers cannot, such as weather forecasting and cryptography.Biotechnology: Biotechnology is the use of biological systems, organisms, or cells to develop products or services. It has revolutionized medicine, agriculture, and environmental science.Nanotechnology: Nanotechnology involves manipulating matter on an atomic and molecular scale. It has led to the development of new materials, electronics, and medical treatments.Robotics: Robotics involves the design, construction, and operation of robots. Robots are used in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and space exploration. These technologies have transformed our world, but they also present new challenges and opportunities. For example, AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we work and live, but it also raises questions about privacy, ethics, and the future of employment. Similarly, quantum computing has the potential to solve complex problems, but it also raises concerns about cybersecurity. In conclusion, the most advanced technology man has ever invented is a matter of perspective. However, the technologies mentioned above have undoubtedly transformed our world and will continue to shape our future. As we move forward, it's essential to balance the benefits of these technologies with the potential risks and challenges they present."},{"prompt":"Do people in the United States actually believe that gun reform will cause them to lose their right to own a weapon?","completion":"Democrats have said publicly, including biden, that the end goal, is to remove all firearms from private citizens.

Can anyone do something similar these days?","completion":"Not really, no. I don’t mean that there aren’t people out there who couldn’t learn all that one needs to know to be a lawyer on their own. I mean that it’s not a path to being a lawyer. There are FOUR states in America where you can do a ‘legal apprenticeship’ of a sort, and, using that ‘education,’ take the state’s bar exam. There are a number of problems with this approach. To begin with, they tend to be among the worst-performing cohorts on the bar exam in the state. But, don’t worry; on the off-chance that they manage to pass the bar exam, they’re basically unemployable. No law firm will touch them. Most clients don’t want a lawyer who never went to law school. It basically marks you as the bottom of the barrel. There are ZERO states where you could show up and say ‘I read a bunch of stuff, I’d like to take the bar exam.’ In Kentucky, for example, the rules say “Every applicant for admission to the Kentucky Bar must have completed degree requirements for a J.D. or equivalent professional degree from a lawschool approved by the American Bar Association or by the Association ofAmerican Law Schools.” Other states have similar rules. So, truth is, even if you were the rare kind of mind that is a legitimate autodidact (and they are few and far between), you’re not going to get to be a lawyer. But that’s a kindness; even if you were admitted to the bar, no one would ever take you seriously.

In 1916, the Washington Post interviewed Gregory, the man who claimed to have invented the modern donut in 1847. Gregory was tired of eating greasy, undercooked donuts with raw dough inside. The fact of not having a hole in the center meant that the dough did not fry well in that area, a circumstance that made it taste like raw dough in that part. It was a problem with a difficult solution that many pastry chefs of the time thought about. Turning the matter around, an American sailor named Hanson Gregory had the idea in 1847 to make a hole in the center of some donuts that his mother was frying and the result was extraordinary: the donut was so evenly done that its flavor was greatly improved. . More than two centuries had passed since the donut lacked that hole that is so characteristic today. [LINKED_TEXT: Dona (comida) - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libreDe Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre Donas en un plato. Dónuts en una panadería checa. Dónut gigante rosa erigido el 15 de julio de 2007 en Springfield , Canterbury ( Nueva Zelanda ) para promocionar la película de Los Simpson . Una dona de chocolate. Donut de mochi con sabor a fresa de Mister Donut Una dona , también llamada dónut [ 1 ] ​ [ 2 ] ​ [ 3 ] ​ (del inglés doughnut o donut /ˈdoʊnət/ o /ˈdoʊnʌt/;), rosquilla , rosquita , rosqueta , rosca , berlina o berlín , es una rosca de pan dulce que tradicionalmente está frito en grasa de cerdo . Los orígenes de las donas se disputan. Unos historiadores afirman que sus precursores se pueden encontrar entre la gente medieval del norte de Europa ; pero la forma popular que se asocia hoy en día con el término doughnut se realizó por primera vez en 1847, cuando un marinero llamado Hanson Gregory, hiciera el famoso agujero con la tapa de un pimentero de un barco, [ 4 ] ​ para solucionar el problema de que la masa no se friera bien en el centro. Se considera generalmente que el origen del dónut viene del dulce navideño neerlandés oliebollen (bolas de aceite), que estos trajeron a Nueva Ámsterdam (futura Nueva York ) en el siglo XVI. En los siglos siguientes evolucionó hacia el dónut que hoy en día se conoce. En España, en 1962 el empresario y panadero Andrés Costafreda constituyó la empresa Donut Corporation, tras un viaje a Estados Unidos. [ 5 ] ​ Comenzó a fabricarlos y comercializarlos bajo la marca registrada Donuts, sobre la que mantiene la propiedad exclusiva en España.

Descripción [ editar ] Las donas son un postre consumido mayormente por los jóvenes, gracias a sus sabores y combinaciones dulces y/o saladas. Hay muchos tipos de donas: algunas están glaseadas con varios colores y a veces llevan confites (ocasionalmente también toppings como coco rallado o maní troceado), otros están rellenos de mermelada o natillas . Las tres clases de donuts son el tipo pastel, los leudados (fermentados con levadura) y los tradicionales. Un dónut tiene en promedio aproximadamente 300 calorías y 25 g de grasa . Las donas con forma de anillo se hacen juntando los extremos de un pedazo largo y delgado de masa o usando moldes que cortan simultáneamente los pedazos externos e internos, quitando la masa en el centro. El pedazo restante es cocinado o devuelto a la masa para hacer más unidades. Un dónut en forma de disco puede ser puesto en un molde toroidal para que aparezca el agujero central. Alternativamente, un depositor de donas puede usarse para ubicar un círculo de masa líquida directamente en el horno.

I have been trying, but I can't learn any dance. I mainly want to learn hip hop and Kpop dances.","completion":"The most basic answer is to simply put on some music and “dance” (or move how you feel to the music). You may already have an idea as to what you prefer, whether it’s a Latin dance such as salsa or bachata, ballroom such as the waltz, or freestyle/contemporary. Whether you want partner dances, or solo. You can try the different dances, try copying online tutorials to get an idea of what you like. Then find a local recommended school and take classes. Why do I recommend classes? Because it’s a faster way to learning - you get taught how to do the moves, rather than doing them by trial and error. Without experience, you also often do not recognise what you are doing wrong and do not have the instant feedback from get from an experienced tutor. If you’ve never danced before, you will (unless you’re one in a million natural), struggle. In which case, the most important thing is to have patience and stick with it. We all stumbled when we first started walking; dancing is no different."},{"prompt":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism? My daughter in law is refusing to vaccinate her children based on this belief.","completion":"The question you’ve posed isn’t really the right one to address your concerns, Robin. You want someone else to make their choices based on your beliefs, just as your parents most likely wished that you would make your choices based on theirs. I’m quite familiar with the urge to convince others to act as you would choose, even though it’s clearly their right to make their own choices. My kids also make their own choices that I frequently don’t agree with. My oldest vaccinates his kids, is quite certain at least some of them have been harmed by that choice and continues doing so for reasons I do not understand. Three of my kids practice vaccination as far as I know, and as far as I know all three have permanently damaged their children in so doing. But, it’s not my choice to make. As grandparents we don’t get to say what if any religion our grandchildren are brought up in or how their parents try to care for them. Your problem is not that vaccines (along with a laundry list of other possible culprits) might or might not “cause autism”. Your problem is that you don’t actually know. If you did actually know you’d also know HOW you know and could then teach your daughter in law what you know in such a manner that she’d also know and you’d both be in agreement. When I was young I “knew” that vaccines prevented disease. I was in my twenties, possibly my thirties before I ever questioned that “fact”. But, one day I was prompted to question most everything I “knew” and shortly determined that what I “knew” was almost entirely just claims that I had long believed without ever examining any evidence. After I started systematically choosing a belief to question and looking into the contrary evidence I found very little that survived scrutiny. If you have a situation where you are trying to convince someone they’re wrong who already knows that their position is the minority position, any attempt that even smells like an argument from authority will tend to strengthen their conviction. Any argument that seems “clever” will tend to strengthen their conviction. Any argument that doesn’t directly address their concern will tend to strengthen their conviction. The method of argumentation most commonly emulated is what we see from our “leaders” who aren’t trying to persuade their doubters, but their followers. Regardless of the side or the cause it seems that at least ninety percent of the “discussion” is focused on humiliating the ‘other’ to reinforce the perceived superiority of the followers. The fact that this process fails to persuade is just claimed as further evidence that the ‘other’ will not listen to reason. As individuals we tend to mirror the practices we see around us, generally not realizing how counterproductive these practices are in interpersonal relationships. The upshot of it is that you can’t echo or emulate the practices and opinions of the talking heads, the authorities, the “leaders” in order to change the opinion of someone who’s rejected their opinions as untrustworthy and their methods as manipulative. The only way that you can reliably influence your daughter in law is to know what she knows, better than she knows it. That’s going to require challenging your own beliefs. I could suggest that you stop using google and begin searching for anti-vax websites so you can see the arguments they present, then find the arguments debunking them. But, I think you’d do better to get and read “Dissolving Illusions Disease, Vaccines and the Forgotten History”. I also think you should ask yourself why it’s necessary to sue the various federal agencies to provide the most basic data.

A hard, sharp bullet would simply tear a hole through the flesh and pass through the other side with half or more of the energy wasted and a long thin hole left behind. Think stabbing someone with an icepick. There are ways to do more damage. This usually involves making a bullet that will peel back or mushroom when it impacts flesh. Now after piercing the skin, it is like a sledge hammer imparting maximal amounts of shock that leaves a large internal damaged area. Other bullets are designed to fragment and send a cloud of bullet fragments in a wide cone. This will increase the chance of damaging more organs, causing more bleeding and ensuring all the energy is dumped into the target."},{"prompt":"f evolution were true (it clearly is not), what would observable evidence look like?","completion":"DELIBERATE LIAR Downvoted & REPORTED The OBSERVED EVIDENCE is already here, moron"},{"prompt":"What does duck meat taste like and do people usually enjoy it?","completion":"It’s hard to describe but I love duck meat; it is delicious.

How can I establish a free and stable VPN for my PC?","completion":"Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) can provide increased privacy and security when browsing the internet, and it can also be useful for bypassing geographic restrictions. If you live in a region with limited internet access or censorship, a VPN might help, but remember that using a VPN to bypass censorship or restrictions might be illegal in some jurisdictions. Ensure you're familiar with your local laws and understand the risks before proceeding. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up a free VPN for your PC: 1. Choose a Free VPN Service There are numerous VPN services available, some free and some paid. While paid services typically offer better performance and features, if you're looking for a free solution, here are a few popular options: ProtonVPN: This is a reputable free VPN that does not have data limits, though its free version might have speed limitations.Windscribe: Offers up to 10GB of free data per month, which can be enough for light usage.TunnelBear: A user-friendly option with a limited amount of free data per month. 2. Download and Install Once you've chosen a VPN service: Visit the official website of the VPN provider.Download the application suitable for your operating system.Install the application on your PC. 3. Set Up the VPN Launch the VPN application.Create an account if required.Log in using your credentials.Once logged in, select a server from a country/region that offers the internet freedom you need. It's often recommended to choose a server closer to your actual location for better speeds.Connect to the server. 4. Test the VPN Once connected: Open your web browser.Visit a website like \`[LINKED_TEXT: http://whatismyipaddress.com] [URL: http://whatismyipaddress.com/]\` to confirm that your IP address has changed to reflect the server location you selected.Try accessing websites or services previously unavailable to see if the VPN connection works as expected. Tips & Cautions Performance: Free VPNs often come with limitations such as slower speeds, data caps, or fewer available server locations.Privacy: Not all VPNs are created equal. Some may log your data or activities. It's crucial to read the privacy policy and choose a VPN service that respects user privacy.Reliability: If you rely heavily on VPN access, consider investing in a reputable paid VPN service for better reliability, speed, and security.Legal Considerations: Always ensure that you are abiding by local laws when using a VPN, especially to bypass censorship or access restricted content. Always be cautious when downloading and installing software to ensure you don't accidentally download malware or unwanted programs. Always download VPN applications directly from the official website or a trusted source."},{"prompt":"f you agree with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan that its time to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security because the deficit has skyrocketed, what percentage of cut to each program would you support?","completion":"I don’t agree at all. Cutting Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to people who would apply for them in the future might be feasible, but cutting them to people who currently live on SS, or depend on Medicare or Medicaid, would bankrupt a large portion of the population that does. When you near retirement age, and figure out what and how, you include the payments you’ll receive. 10 years down the line, to suddenly cut them, even by 10%, would be devastating to a lot of people. (If you don’t understand what would happen, look up “Hoovervilles”.) Cut payments for future recipients, who can calculate their retirement based on the reduced payments? Maybe. But not to pay for the “self-financing tax cuts” Congress passed. Let them pay for themselves - as promised. In most jobs, if you promise a certain level of performance, and can’t meet it, you don’t have to wait years to get fired - you’re escorted to the door immediately. I don’t know who said it, but “let’s throw the rascals out”. The actual “solution” to the deficit caused by the elimination of a lot of taxes to the uber-wealthy? Rescind the elimination of those taxes. Then no one will suffer. (The uber-wealthy need SS, Medicare and Medicaid like an elephant needs a second trunk. Do they want them? Sure. But there’s a difference between “I want it because I’m uber-greedy” and “I need them the way they are because I’ll starve to death or die of some easily curable disease without it.”) Maybe just cutting Congressional salaries to 1/year would go a long way to fixing things. I’ve always said, “You broke it, you own it”. (I really, really urge everyone to read Turtledove’s “Joe Steele”. It’s available in most decent libraries. If yours doesn’t have it, ask them to get a copy. It’s fiction, but it’s almost as if Turtledove traveled to 2050 and wrote a history book. Slightly different than our reality, but not much.)"},{"prompt":"Why haven't the Las Vegas casinos been completely destroyed by mathematicians?","completion":"The casinos have their own mathematicians.

Banks, who also writes as the literary novelist Iain Banks, though the distinction between “sci-fi” and “normal” in his work is very blurred, created the Culture as a backstory for the lead character in his novel Use Of Weapons, and ended up building an entire series around the civilisation he envisaged. The Culture of Banks’ creation is a post-scarcity society; that is, it has harnessed the universe to produce unlimited resources, at negligible or no environmental cost, and therefore has eradicated any kind of economic conflict. All Culture citizens (and there are around thirty trillion of them, scattered through the galaxy) can have their every desire met, live in peace and harmony, without want of food or shelter. The Culture works as a kind of democracy, but nothing like any democracy on Earth; when society-wide decisions need to be taken, each citizen has an equal vote, but there is no government, and no formal hierarchical structure. The Culture is overseen by AIs which Banks called Minds; practically omnipotent beings, who nevertheless consider it their calling to take care of the liveware problems of the meat-based, humanoid members of their society. Where much sci-fi deals with the problems of scarce resources and evil computers, Banks turns these tropes on their heads, by making the Culture infinitely resourceful and his AIs (almost) entirely benevolent. A lifelong socialist, Banks used the Culture to demonstrate what a truly equal society could be, where poverty and hunger are unknown, and wealth inequality has been resourced out of existence. Of course, novels thrive on conflict, and since living in a utopia can be somewhat boring to write about, much of the Culture series takes place outside the Culture itself, or involves protagonists from other races or civilisations. A question which Banks repeatedly returns to is: how does a infinitely powerful utopia interact with other, perhaps less enlightened, societies and life forms? When should it use its power to alter the course of another society’s evolution? Is it even ethical, or desirable, to do so? I believe Banks resisted the comparison in his own lifetime, but it’s hard to avoid the thought that the Culture is an allegory for the West in general and the USA in particular, spreading liberal democracy by soft and hard power throughout the rest of the world. It’s possible to read the novels out of order, but for completeness it’s probably best to start at the beginning and work your way through the series."},{"prompt":"Which is the best car brand in the world?","completion":"Benz Motorwagen Created in 1886 and powered by an internal combustion engine, the Motorwagen was essentially the world’s first motor car (previous automobiles were powered by steam or electricity).

Despite its meager speeds, the vehicle paved the way for the future of cars as we know them today.

Look for promotional offers, discounts, or exclusive deals that may help you get a better rate.Be flexible with your travel dates: Prices for hotels can vary significantly depending on the time of year, day of the week, and even the time of day. Consider traveling during off-peak seasons or weekdays when hotels are more likely to offer lower rates.Book in advance: Many hotels offer early booking discounts, so it's beneficial to reserve your room well in advance. This allows you to secure a lower rate and also ensures availability, especially during busy periods.Consider alternative accommodations: Look beyond traditional hotels and consider alternative accommodations such as guesthouses, bed and breakfasts, vacation rentals, or boutique hotels. These options sometimes offer lower prices or unique deals.Sign up for loyalty programs: Joining hotel loyalty programs can provide you with access to member-only rates, discounts, and perks. Accumulating loyalty points can also lead to future savings or free nights.Negotiate directly with the hotel: While it may not always work, contacting the hotel directly and inquiring about their best available rate or any ongoing promotions can sometimes result in a better deal. This approach is particularly effective for independent or smaller hotels.Stay for longer durations: Some hotels offer discounted rates for longer stays, such as staying for a week or more. If your travel plans allow, consider extending your stay to take advantage of such offers.Consider package deals: Look for package deals that combine hotel stays with other services like flights, car rentals, or activities. These bundled deals can often provide overall cost savings compared to booking each component separately.Be open to last-minute bookings: If you're flexible and spontaneous, you can sometimes find significant discounts on last-minute bookings. Hotels may offer lower rates to fill up their remaining rooms.Use hotel reward points or credit card benefits: If you have accumulated hotel reward points or have a credit card that offers hotel benefits, such as discounted rates or complimentary nights, make sure to utilize them to lower your hotel expenses. Remember, while seeking lower prices is important, it's also crucial to consider the overall value and quality of the hotel to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable stay."},{"prompt":"What is the weirdest object you've ever found?","completion":"Ok so this is a story that not many believe, not even my friends believe me eventhough I have showed pictures….

I gave it to my dad which suspected it was some sort of rock or pottery price so put it in his pocket, if was about as tall as a shorter that average book, so it was quite big it also had prices of crushed shell stuck on with hard sand. we walked up out of the beach and to an old war shelter to explore, then we went back to the apartment, we showed my mum who phoned my grandad who knows a lot about strange beach finds (well… I think he does ) we showed him it on FaceTime and he said it was a small aircraft bomb or something from WW2. we called the bomb squad and because Gibraltar has rare crimes it goes full out on services, several ambulances turned up, fire engines, police, two bomb squad trucks with men in full out plastic suits, they evacuated the whole apartment block and took the bomb away. we later got a letter saying that it was active and they managed to dispose (explode) of it in the sea. so yeah that’s a once in a lifetime find and will always remember it, I hope you enjoyed xx"},{"prompt":"f Republicans are supposedly fiscally responsible, why does the deficit increase every time they are in power?","completion":"This thread is an example of why the deficit keeps increasing: people can’t agree on the cause.

Here are a few articles you could read if you were really interested: [LINKED_TEXT: Origins and Early Evolution of the tRNA Molecule] [URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4695843/] [LINKED_TEXT: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8113/42/34/345101/meta] [URL: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8113/42/34/345101/meta] (Computer simulation of tRNA evolution) [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21541264.2017.1318811] [URL: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21541264.2017.1318811] (tRNA structure and evolution and standardization to the three nucleotide genetic code) [LINKED_TEXT: Evolution of the genetic code through progressive symmetry breaking] [URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519314000113] A simpler discussion on the subject: [LINKED_TEXT: The Probability of Life] [URL: http://evolutionfaq.com/articles/probability-life] If I wanted to split hairs with you, I would point out that evolution starts only after life exists so by strictest definition, it does not include discussions of origin of life. On the other hand, I do think that life began without the assistance of a Creator so it is something I should be concerned with. Although I would like to know how life started, here are some reasons why I am not entirely frustrated by our lack of knowledge on the subject. “I don’t know how that happened” only means, “I don’t know”. It can mean, “So there might have been a deity involved” but that word ‘might’ must be there for it to be true.I would like to know how life started, but I don’t know the names of all eight of my great-grandparents. One of my grandparents came to Canada as an orphan before WWII and I have some reason to believe no records exist on the subject. So if I can’t know about events that occurred 150 or less years ago, I have to accept that I won’t know everything about events billions of years ago.Using statistics and large numbers is messy. Get a deck of cards and shuffle them thoroughly. Even if everyone who ever existed kept guessing for billions of years, we would not successfully guess the order of those cards. And yet there are many decks of shuffled cards - each deck unique and unpredictable. If you take a deck of cards that you have shuffled and write down its order, what are the odds of it happening? 1. It already happened so the odds are one out of one. Hugely unpredictable but still happening. Go back a few hundred years and try to predict that my ancestors would meet and the correct sperms and eggs would meet to eventually produce me is also statistically impossible (the same is true for you).Linnaeus created a classification system for all life, putting types of life called ‘species’ into groups called ‘families’ and those groups into ‘orders’…. The system has changed a little since his time but he would recognize it. These nested hierarchies all point to a common ancestor. Even if it is unclear how this ancestor formed, it is pretty clear that it existed."},{"prompt":"What do you wear, if anything, under your spandex, yoga pants, leggings, and/or tights?","completion":"Honestly?

Certainly try if you want but don’t reach out to touch them, let them come to you. Mine have been trapped and spayed and neutered plus got rabies shot. If you know nothing about cat you refer to, don’t touch it. It may carry disease. You can always trap it using a proper trap, take it to Vet.

It's just abused. The grading system is supposed to indicate incremental progress on the way to mastery of a subject. Instead it is used to reward and stigmatize. That is not the fault of the grading system. Our education system is based on lumping a bunch of people together, usually based on age and/or socio-economic status, and then moving them all through the system, rather like a lump moving through a snake. The system emphasizes keeping up rather than learning because people learn different subjects at different rates. D-level work in some schools will be A-level work in others because the standard by which the system is judged is, did the cohort remain together. That is why in Arizona the math required to graduate from high school is at a 6-grade level—maybe. If the grading system were used properly almost EVERY student would get As in almost EVERY topic because they would continue to get help until they achieved mastery. There is certainly enough money in the system for it to work that way, but that would break the cohort up. One way to solve the problem is with money. All education should be funded with student-specific vouchers. All vouchers are for the same amount, and every student gets to go as far as they can in twelve years. That would include college if they can demonstrate mastery in enough topics. Dump the system. Dump the cohort. Pump the student."},{"prompt":"Who represents the GOP in 2021?","completion":"Ron De Santis"},{"prompt":"f the children are willing to work, is that still considered child labor?","completion":"Yes"},{"prompt":"Why do cats abandon their owners?","completion":"I am just this week asking myself that.

It can be used to improve performance, increase security, or enable access to restricted resources. Here's how a proxy server works: A client device sends a request to the proxy server, instead of sending it directly to the server hosting the requested resource.The proxy server receives the request and checks its cache to see if the requested resource is available.If the resource is available in the cache, the proxy server sends the cached resource to the client.If the resource is not available in the cache, the proxy server sends the request to the actual server hosting the resource.The actual server sends the resource back to the proxy server, which caches it and sends it to the client. In this way, the proxy server acts as an intermediary between the client and the actual server, and can improve performance by caching resources and reduce the load on the actual server. Additionally, a proxy server can provide anonymity for the client and enhance security by filtering incoming traffic and blocking malicious requests.

We currently have lasers that can cut through metals in seconds or less. However they require far more energy than we can fit into a battery that would fit inside a pistol or rifle. If we could somehow make a high energy battery or energy cell, laser rifles could become a reality. Similarly for flying suits. We already have plenty of suits that can levitate a person. But they invariably don’t last long - in the order of minutes. So again, work out how to store energy more densely and more of us will be flying around like Iron Man. Of course, that then leads us to the second problem… Heat Dissipation If you are going to put out kilowatts of power as part of your weapons/flight/fabrication/whatever system, then you also will have to dissipate (likely) kilowatts of heat as well. No device or process is 100% efficient, and the wasted energy invariably ends up as heat. So maybe you can carry around a multi-kilowatt energy cell, but how are you going to dissipate kilowatts of heat? You’d need a massive cooling system attached to your weapon/suit/whatever, which makes it a whole lot less practical. Or maybe you’d only be using your device for short periods, with lengthy cool-down periods in the between. Again, it really hampers its usefulness. Summary So there you go. If you can solve the problem of stored energy density and heat dissipation (i.e. by creating an incredibly efficient multi-killowatt energy cell that produced hardly any heat) then a huge number of inventions would (literally in some cases) take off using existing technology. Nuclear power seems to be the only real candidate. Here are some energy densities for comparison. (Note that for batteries its the amount of electrical energy, for fuels it’s the heat energy that can be released during burning, and for nuclear it’s the energy that can be released during nuclear reactions.) Lead-acid battery: 0.17 MJ/kgLithium Ion Battery: 0.36–0.875 MJ/kgNickel Metal Hydride Battery: 0.41 MJ/kgMethanol: 19.7 MJ/kgJet fuel: 43 MJ/kgDiesel fuel: 45.6 MJ/kgLPG Propane: 49.6 MJ/kgHydrogen Gas: 141 MJ/kgUranium: 80,620,000 MJ/kg Or, put another way ([LINKED_TEXT: Log Scale] [URL: https://xkcd.com/1162/] by XKCD): Unfortunately, even if we could make a portable nuclear fuel cell, there are then major issues with people using them for evil rather than good.

The tone of the school really changed when two cruisers showed up and took the kids. They later photographed my son's injuries. One kid pled guilty and the other’s parents hired a lawyer because he had been in trouble before. Before court I told my son to be truthful and say what happened. During the cross examination, the lawyer who was trying to trip him up asked how does know who kicked him. My son replied the boot was connected to a leg on his body. He was beginning to show frustration after an hour of questions. The lawyer was also trying to get my son to speak louder by standing away from and holding his ear saying he had a bad ear.

There are a few reasons: Turbulence is caused by changes in air pressure and temperature, and it is most common in the lower atmosphere, where the air is more turbulent. By flying above the clouds, planes can avoid turbulence and provide a smoother ride for passengers. Clouds can obscure the view of the ground, which can make it difficult for pilots to navigate. By flying above the clouds, pilots have a better view of the ground and can more easily navigate their aircraft. The air is thinner at higher altitudes, which means that there is less drag on the aircraft. This allows planes to fly faster and more efficiently. By flying above the clouds, planes can take advantage of the jet stream, which is a band of strong winds that flows at high altitudes. This can help planes to reach their destination faster. In addition to these reasons, there are also a few safety considerations that come into play when flying above the clouds. For example, if an aircraft were to experience a loss of engine power, it would be more difficult to recover if it were flying at lower altitudes, where the air is denser.

Body: I’m 6’8, slender and have thicker legs. My boobs are c cup on an incredibly skinny body, so it looked like I stuffed half filled balloons in my bra. Face: I have puffy, shiny pink lips. I have three nose piercings, 2 lip piercings, and both ears are pierced to the top. I have long eyelashes, and smaller eyes. One eye is a hazel/blue and the other is green. My nose is just a regular nose. I also have bug rounded glasses Hair: I have black hair that’s way too puffy. It’s wavy, short, and puffy. That’s the perfect way to describe it. I usually have butterfly clips in it. Clothes: I wear mostly edgy stuff. I have a lot of combat boots and platforms. Anywho, I was chillin, when a woman comes in the store. She’s yelling at my coworker, but all I can hear is muffled noise through the walls dividing the store from the break room. This is what I could hear clearly: The first line of this answer “I NEED A WORKER” “TALL, DARK SHORT HAIR, SKINNY-“ Then, what I could hear was a raspy young male voice yell “SHE HAD BIG BOOOOOBS” The noise stopped for a little, then more muffled screams. “YEAH, THAT ONE!” The last thing I heard was “HER NAME WAS CAMILLA OR SOMETHING!” Then, My coworker who had been talking to the 42 year old woman who was screaming at him pulled me from the break room into the store. He asked her if I was who she had been “asking” (more like screaming war cries) for. She said yes in a tone that was two percent calmer. Through he gritted teeth, she asked if he could leave for a little. He finally gave up in reasoning with her and just left.

Either it were words missing or emotions got disappeared when I wanted to pen down something. Even words and emotions were at a place still my hands was a hindrance.

I’ve also seen a lot of people in truly horrific pain. My favorite faking story was this one: A 21-year-old woman came to the emergency room complaining that she was having a miscarriage. When I examined her, there was blood on her clothes and all over the sheets. But there was no blood inside her vagina. When we tested her urine, it showed a shocking amount of sugar but was negative for blood despite being quite red. We then tested her blood sugar, which was normal, so the significant amount of sugar in her urine did not make sense. Her serum pregnancy test was also negative. I went back to speak to the patient and asked the entire family to leave the room. I calmly asked her what was really going on and she maintained her story that she was having a miscarriage. I explained to her that her pregnancy test would not yet be negative if she was having a miscarriage, and that the red stuff all over her clothes and sheets was not blood. I asked her again to tell me the truth. Thankfully I did this with a great deal of compassion. She looked me in the eyes, started crying, and told me the truth. She was a graduate student in theater arts and had accidentally become pregnant by her fiancé. Both of their families were devout Catholics, so pregnancy termination was completely out of the question; if she had an abortion, she would have been disowned by both families. So basically, she faked her own miscarriage complete with theatrical blood. Because she was desperate to finish graduate school before she got pregnant, she went to Planned Parenthood and had a medical abortion two weeks before presenting to the emergency room. She then faked the miscarriage to hide the abortion. She begged me not to give her away, which of course I did not. I also did not lie to her fiancé or family. I simply said that she was no longer pregnant and that some women after miscarriage want to talk about it extensively and spend time at home but other women want to not discuss it and continue with their school or work. I’m grateful that I suspended judgement and learned the truth."},{"prompt":"Why do people vape?","completion":"I vape mostly because of the flavor and because it helps me to be less anxious.

It was his birthday, so I decided to make him a cake. I was looking for a pan to cook in and, expecting to find a little drawer under the oven, I gave the front a little tug. It wasn’t a drawer at all, but a face plate that easily popped off in my hand, with a space behind it. I could tell there was something inside, so I bent down to investigate. Halfway down, I thought, “What is that? It looks like…boobs?’ I got on my knees to peer into the darkness of the little space, discovering that it was…a very lifelike rubber ass! The anatomically-correct (and partially melted) novelty sex toy was accompanied by four large dildos (some of which looked like a dog had chewed on them!), a lacy white thong, and a grimy little bottle of lube! I knew by how dirty it was under there (and because they were not under the bed) that Fanny and Friends did not belong to my ex-boyfriend. Not wanting to touch them with my bare hands, I grabbed a pair of socks to use as gloves and started to remove Ass and Company from the dusty Fetish Treasure Trove under the stove. When I picked up the rubber butt, its squishy consistency startled me - it was made of a very soft kind of whipped foam rubber. When it fell to the floor, the butt cheeks jiggled like a twerking jello mold. By the time he came inside, I had arranged everything on the kitchen floor like a freaky show-and-tell. I ran to the front door, exclaiming “Come see what I found!!!” When he came into the kitchen and saw the Menagerie of Masturbation he jumped up in the air, screaming “IT’S NOT MINE!!!” I should have let him squirm for a few minutes, desperately denying any knowledge of the little orgy under the oven, but I was laughing so hard I had to do an awkward and ungraceful little dance to keep from peeing myself. That pitiful disembodied booty suffered a number of childish indignities that afternoon, including a cigar, ranch dressing, and finally black powder.

However, there are a few key things that can help you stack the odds in your favor. First and foremost, you need to have a sound understanding of the sport you're betting on. This means knowing the ins and outs of the game, the teams, and the players. With this knowledge, you can make informed decisions about which bets to place and which ones to avoid. Another important factor is to shop around for the best lines and odds. Different sports will offer different odds on the same games, so it pays to shop around until you find the best deal. You should also be aware of how different bets work before placing any money down. For example, moneyline bets simply involve picking who you think will win, while point spread bets entail predicting by how much a team will win or lose. Last but not least, don't let your emotions get the best of you. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of a game and bet impulsively, but this is often a recipe for disaster. Stick to your predetermined betting strategy and only place bets that make sense from a rational perspective. If you do all of these things, you'll be well on your way to success in the world of sports betting!"},{"prompt":"Did Artemis ever speak in Greek mythology?","completion":"Yes! I can think of several instances that she gave long speeches! 🗣️ Her most precocious moment was when she was young and her father Zeus put her on his knee and favored her. He asked what she’d like as a gift, just like Santa at Christmas time, and the girl’s list was long! “…beginning with the time when sitting on her father's knees — still a little maid — she spake these words to her sire: \\"Give me to keep my maidenhood, Father, forever: and give me to be of many names, that Phoebus (Apollo) may not vie with me.And give me arrows and a bow — stay, Father, I ask thee not for quiver or for mighty bow: for me the Cyclopes will straightway fashion arrows and fashion for me a well-bent bow.But give me to be Bringer of Lightand give me to gird me in a tunic with embroidered border reaching to the knee, that I may slay wild beasts.And give me sixty daughters of Oceanus for my choir — all nine years old, all maidens yet ungirdled;and give me for handmaidens twenty nymphs of Amnisus who shall tend well my buskins, and, when I shoot no more at lynx or stag, shall tend my swift hounds.And give to me all mountains; and for city, assign me any, even whatsoever thou wilt: for seldom is it that Artemis goes down to the town. On the mountains will I dwell and the cities of men I will visit only when women vexed by the sharp pang of childbirth call me to their aid even in the hour when I was born the Fates ordained that I should be their helper, as my mother suffered no pain either when she gave me birth or when she carried me in her womb, but without travail put me from her body.” So this was quite a lengthy speech for a goddess of a childish size and age! The girl knew what she wanted! Zeus thought this was adorable and replied to the assembly, “When goddesses bear me children like this, little need I heed the wrath of jealous Hera. Take, child, all that thou askest, heartily. Yea, and other things therewith yet greater will thy father give thee.” 🗣️ She makes many interesting speeches in the Iliad as well. Apollo, resisting a fight with his powerful uncle, says, bowing out of a fight, that Poseidon wouldn’t respect him if he were to start an argument about a “pack of miserable mortals” who are like summer leaves to them, here today, gone tomorrow, and the gods should leave the mortals to fight their war on their own. Artemis, ashamed of those words from him, scolds him, “So you would fly, Far-Darter, and hand victory over to Poseidon with a cheap vaunt to boot. Why keep your bow thus idle? Never let me again hear you bragging in my father's house, as you have often done in the presence of the immortals, that you would stand up and fight with Poseidon.\\" Apollo says nothing, but Hera responds to this, getting incensed with Artemis and her cheekiness, and says the girl may be a huntress, but she’s a pathetic fighter when it comes to war and she’s no match for Hera in battle. She says Artemis should stick to her forests and leave war to her betters. Then she takes her bow from her and beats her with it till Artemis starts crying, but summons enough strength to say with resolve, “I shall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any of Zeus’ wives. Therefore boast as you will among the immortals that you worsted me in fair fight.\\" and she then flees to her father to cry on his knees. Zeus laughs and comforts her while she’s in tears and asks who has been treating her cruelly. She replies, “It was your wife Hera, father, who has been beating me; it is always her doing when there is any quarrelling among the immortals.\\" So, she’s quite the tattler. The girl was not a secret keeper! 🗣️ When Actaeon saw her naked, bathing in the forest stream, she said, irate, “Now tell you saw me here naked without my clothes, if you can tell at all!’ This was a taunt because at that moment she turned the man into a stag and he could no longer speak. 🗣️ She also has many, many speeches with Nemesis over several subjects, including: revenge on Niobe (who ridiculed her mother), and the death of Orion. 🗣️ And she has a discourse with Heracles when she catches him chasing down her prize stag and is about to kill him when her brother Apollo intercedes and advises her not to kill him, but to help him. She tells Heracles that, if he can catch her stag, she will let him capture it so long as he agrees not to kill it and to release it after he shows it to his king who sent him on that labor. So yes, she talked a lot for someone who lived in the woods and rarely went into town."},{"prompt":"Theoretically, isn’t it possible for two species which are distantly related to come to appear closer related by the genome converging and mutating to be more alike?","completion":"it’s something that although theoretically possible is never likely to happen."},{"prompt":"Which are the best over ear Bluetooth headphones under ₹5000?","completion":"Skullcandy Sesh Evo True Wireless In-Ear Earbud - True Black Brand Skullcandy Details Model Name: Sesh EvoPrize:48.99Color: True BlackForm Factor :In EarConnectivity Technology: Bluetooth About this item Super long battery life and rapid charge: the Sesh Evo bluetooth earphones with microphone hold up to 5 hours of power and can charge 3 times by putting them back in their case.

[LINKED_TEXT: Homeostasis: The Underappreciated and Far Too Often Ignored Central Organizing Principle of PhysiologyThe grand challenge to physiology, as was first described in an essay published in the inaugural issue of Frontiers in Physiology in 2010, remains to integrate function from molecules to intact organisms. In order to make sense of the vast volume of information derived from, and increasingly dependent upon, reductionist approaches, a greater emphasis must be placed on the traditional integrated and more holistic approaches developed by the scientists who gave birth to physiology as an intellectual discipline. Our understanding of physiological regulation has evolved over time from the Greek idea of body humors, through Claude Bernard’s “milieu intérieur,” to Walter Cannon’s formulation of the concept of “homeostasis” and the application of control theory (feedback and feedforward regulation) to explain how a constant internal environment is achieved. Homeostasis has become the central unifying concept of physiology and is defined as a self-regulating process by which an organism can maintain internal stability while adjusting to changing external conditions. Homeostasis is not static and unvarying; it is a dynamic process that can change internal conditions as required to survive external challenges. It is also important to note that homeostatic regulation is not merely the product of a single negative feedback cycle but reflects the complex interaction of multiple feedback systems that can be modified by higher control centers.

[1] This is the condition of optimal functioning for the organism and includes many variables, such as body temperature and fluid balance , being kept within certain pre-set limits (homeostatic range). Other variables include the pH of extracellular fluid , the concentrations of sodium , potassium , and calcium ions , as well as the blood sugar level , and these need to be regulated despite changes in the environment, diet, or level of activity. Each of these variables is controlled by one or more regulators or homeostatic mechanisms, which together maintain life. Homeostasis is brought about by a natural resistance to change when already in optimal conditions, [2] and equilibrium is maintained by many regulatory mechanisms; it is thought to be the central motivation for all organic action. All homeostatic control mechanisms have at least three interdependent components for the variable being regulated: a receptor, a control center, and an effector. [3] The receptor is the sensing component that monitors and responds to changes in the environment, either external or internal. Receptors include thermoreceptors and mechanoreceptors . Control centers include the respiratory center and the renin-angiotensin system . An effector is the target acted on, to bring about the change back to the normal state. At the cellular level, effectors include nuclear receptors that bring about changes in gene expression through up-regulation or down-regulation and act in negative feedback mechanisms. An example of this is in the control of bile acids in the liver . [4] Some centers, such as the renin–angiotensin system , control more than one variable. When the receptor senses a stimulus, it reacts by sending action potentials to a control center. The control center sets the maintenance range—the acceptable upper and lower limits—for the particular variable, such as temperature. The control center responds to the signal by determining an appropriate response and sending signals to an effector , which can be one or more muscles, an organ, or a gland . When the signal is received and acted on, negative feedback is provided to the receptor that stops the need for further signaling. [5] The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), located at the presynaptic neuron , is a receptor that can stop stressful neurotransmitter release to the postsynaptic neuron; it is activated by endocannabinoids (ECs) such as anandamide ( N -arachidonoylethanolamide; AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) via a retrograde signaling process in which these compounds are synthesized by and released from postsynaptic neurons, and travel back to the presynaptic terminal to bind to the CB1 receptor for modulation of neurotransmitter release to obtain homeostasihttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis]"},{"prompt":"w many rap rhyme schemes are there?","completion":"If you are white, none, because THAT is cultural appropriation.

This is similar to BJP’s Congress Mukt Bharat. If there is no national party left in the central arena, people are constrained to elect BJP only. Similarly, if the other players are forced to withdraw from the market, people wouldn’t be having any alternative players to switch over if they are not happy with Jio's service. Even in the good old days, we had at least two makes of car available in India - Ambassador & Fiat. Would you like to have a unipolar situation where there will be one political party, one telecom player, Reliance & Adani to dominate the Agri product business? It is very important to have alternative parties or platforms available so that the consumers are not cheated or taken for granted. Yes, there are organisations like Microsoft or Google, etc who are practically running monopolies in their own domain, However, they are continuously improving their services and they are not taking the users for a ride. The biggest point is that most of Google’s services are free of cost to the general users, It survives on indirect revenue. So it's imperative for them that the users are happy and satisfied. The survival of Airtel & Vodafone-Idea is very very essential in a holistic manner though they are fighting a tough battle. There is no specific advantage of having only one player in the market. If the day comes when only Jio is operating in the market, the consumer will hugely repent. Because it is the completion that forces the payers to give better services and value for money. If Airtel has been able to gain and JIo has lost 1.9 crores subscribers in September, then Airtel must have improved its services over Jio. Just think if Airtel wouldn’t have been there subscribers would have been forced to continue with Jio even if they are not satisfied. It is important to ponder upon why under the Modi government the other telecom operators are so much inconvenience. And they are not small players. Airtel, Vodafone, and Idea have been there for so long providing satisfactory services. What happened all of a sudden these organizations withered out? But things have become difficult. Jio has captured the market through unfair means. The BSNL employee unions claimed that the government has not allotted a spectrum for 4G services to BSNL in order to prevent it from competing against Reliance Jio. All Unions and Associations of BSNL (AUAB) alleged that with its huge financial muscle, Reliance Jio is offering services at 'below-cost rates. It said that private telecom companies like Aircel, Tata Teleservices, Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Communications, and Telenor have already closed their mobile service businesses. It alleged that Reliance Jio will steeply raise call and data tariffs once the entire competition is wiped out. In fact, people can see how the Jio rate has gone up in the last two years. The unions said that BSNL was in a loss in 2011-12 but due to the combined efforts taken by the employees and the management, the PSU had been able to bounce back and posted an operating profit of Rs 672.57 crore in 2014-15. But we know the current situation. The BSNL has been left to die or forced to die. It also alleged that whosoever tried to act against Reliance Jio had to pay the price, including former telecom secretary J S Deepak. \\"JS Deepak wrote to the Trai demanding action on Reliance Jio, for adopting predatory pricing. As a result, JS Deepak was instantaneously shunted out of the DoT... This was a clear signal given by the Narendra Modi government, as to what would happen to anyone who dares to speak against Reliance Jio,\\" the unions alleged. Edit: Reliance Jio has announced 21% hike in its tariff. The current ₹ 75 plan will cost ₹ 91 from December 1, a hike of more than 20 percent. The ₹ 129 plan will cost ₹ 155, ₹ 399 plan will cost ₹ 479, the ₹ 1,299 plan will become ₹ 1,559 and the ₹ 2,399 plan will cost ₹ 2,879. Jio further mentioned that data top-ups will now cost ₹ 61 for 6 GB (up from ₹ 51), ₹ 121 for 12 GB (up from ₹ 101), and ₹ 301 for 50 GB (up from ₹ 251). Just think at one shot 20–21% hike even when two other players are in the market. What would have been the condition if Jio would have been the single player in the market. The hike could have been anything. This is what monopoly is dangerous. Though this hike by Jio would be beneficial for the other two players Airtel & Vodafone Idea who have already increased the tariff w.e.f. November. Now when there will be a level playing field between all the three players, there will be healthy competition and definitely, the subscribers would choose the better service provider. So switching over operator would be like earlier possibly.

You will get to voicemail, if the targeted user enabled voicemail and if the targeted user does not pick up the call (usually after a few rings). In the case of iOS 13, you can have a setting that only calls from callers listed in contacts should be picked up. Those unknown callers could go to your telco voicemail automatically. I have this set up, so unknown numbers do not ring for me, and I’m not even using voicemail.:-). iMessages serves as an SMS carrier, when the other end is not enable to handle the full iMessage connection. IMessage enables the transferring of files, long videos, documents, voice messages, emojis… to a target or to a group of people. If the target does not handle those messages they will receive an old style SMS only (that is a text only format) or a MMS (that is not much used, also an old style message format). In the iMessages conversations you see such SMS style messages in a green bubble, and the good, full style messages in a blue bubble. iMessages does this automatically, first tries to send the full message, then if that does not go through, in a few minutes it will send the message out as an SMS. This blue turning into a green message happens to me when the target is known to handle iMessages (it is known to be an Apple device), but has network connection problems at that time. In the case if you are not in the target’s contact list, or if your number is listed in the target’s blocked numbers list, you could get into voicemail or you could get the green bubbles, or you could get an error message, that the message could not be delivered. The target might not even be aware of your message or call."},{"prompt":"What are your late growth spurt stories?","completion":"I moved out to Vancouver in the fall of 2011 from Saskatoon, SK.

In a number of places around the world, for example, natives deliberately clear out underbrush, often by burning. This leaves forests with relatively good visibility for travel and hunting and opens room for larger animals to move in. Such people may also end up clearing out forests and transform them into grassy plains. These changes tend to take place gradually, being the cumulative result of people making small, local modifications to the landscape, but what looks wild to newly arrived settlers is actually a landscape which has been significantly modified by the people living there."},{"prompt":"Why do some gun control opponents feel that the second amendment guarantees the right to own any type of gun whatsoever?","completion":"Why do some gun control opponents feel There aren't a lot of feelings involved.

Why, then, do you request my answer? Your contention is that Greek letters are derived from hieroglyphs. I await with baited breath your peer-reviewed paper on that extraordinary claim. Until I've seen your evidence on that, I'll treat it as ‘unproven assertion'. I will also note how unusual it is for a linguist of any credibility to make the basic error of referring to the language as ‘Hieroglyphics'. The language was Hieroglyphic (without the s) and the individual characters were called Hieroglyphs. People who haven't got a clue often think the language is called Hieroglyphics, although I'm sure that in the case of a cutting-edge linguist such as yourself, the error is merely a typo. The Coptic language contains 32 characters, of which the majority were Greek, and 7 were of Egyptian Demotic. Coptic, unlike every previous Egyptian language, was written left-to-right. Hieratic and Demotic were always written right-to-life, while Hieroglyphic was much more free-form and could even be written top-to-bottom as well as both directions horizontally.

However, Coptic pre-dates Christianity."},{"prompt":"What is the biggest problem with the modern education system?","completion":"The state of the US education system has plenty of room for improvement, however, developing an active and effective plan for such improvement may not be as easy as it seems. The major challenge is the identification of existent problems which are keeping students from learning today, and a considerable factor of this challenge is based on who is leveling such, whether the students, the parents, educators, school administrators, or lawmakers in the state. 1. Inequality in the Educational system: The United States Educational system is marred by inequality. As a matter of fact, the United States Educational system is one of the most unequal systems in the industrialized world, as students receive Learning opportunities based on their Social Status or Class. 2. Overcrowding: Schools in the United States are often overcrowded as a result of an increase in the population of students, a shortage of teachers, and a decrease in funding. 3. Decline in school funding: On average, 47% of School revenue comes from State funds, and 43% from Local Government, while the remaining 10% comes from the Federal Government. Over the years, there has been a cut in funding by the State thereby resulting in a deficit in school funding in the United States of America.

That would be having laws prohibiting felons. mental defectives, narcotic addicts, etc., from having firearms. The only party advocating gun control are the Democrats and their ultra left wing members mean something totally different. What they want is to make it more and more difficult for law abiding people to have firearms, the death by 1000 cuts method and eventually make it impossible for civilians to have firearms. As for how can you convince conservatives that gun regulation is a good thing, you might start by defining what you mean by gun regulation. If you start by saying you just want mandatory federal registration of firearms, you’ve already lost the battle about gun regulations being a good thing. I was in law enforcement for more than thirty years. As a police detective in a large city, It was very rare for a crime to be solved or have the suspect identified with gun registration. I found there are only two uses for gun registration. One is if your gun is lost or stolen and found, it might be returned to it’s owner, depending on if the gun has bodies on it and the owner is allowed to have firearms. The second is it becomes a road map to your house. When the left has made the final cut of the 1000 cuts the police are at your door to get your guns."},{"prompt":"Do you have a different opinion on climate change?","completion":"Climate change is a serious issue that we can't afford to ignore.

The announcement's timing was Pfizer's way of disassociating itself with US President Donald Trump and the GOP. In July, the company signed a 1.95 billion contract with Operation Warp Speed, a Trump initiative. Had Trump won, and the announcement been made before November 2, it would have been business as usual. Meanwhile, a Biden victory would have been its death knell. The announcement would have worked in Trump's favor as voters would have seen it as a result of his efforts in the fight against COVID-19. After Biden's inauguration, it wouldn't surprise me if US media took every opportunity to slam Operation Warp Speed, regardless of the vaccine's effectiveness. I also suspect this time next year; a Democrat-approved Chinese vaccine will be chosen to save Americans from the coronavirus. The person who could be losing the most sleep right now is Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner and Trump appointee who resigned from his post in April 2019. Four months after stepping down, Gottlieb joined Pfizer's Board of Directors, where he was given 300,000 shares of Pfizer stock (PFE - 41.20) as part of his signing bonus.

I have worked as a system analyst for a few years now and i would like to answer it from my perspective.Why is india corrupt the answer is simple : SYSTEMS SYSTEMS SYSTEMS.I have visited some companies who call me in to tell me that they want to redesign their system i ask them why and sometimes the answer is to remove corruption.I always tell them they cant eradicate or remove corruption only reduce it.First to understand corruption we need to define it. When we as a society or community organize ourselves we create a SYSTEM. A system will consist of 3 three main components people, data and processes. If you are to define corruption it is basically a deviation of the system from the NORM. This can be for good reasons or for bad reasons too. Eg : someone giving discount for a friend is corruption which affects the organisation.Someone giving someone a paid leave because one of their family members is in hospital even though that is against the policy of the company is also corruption. Only thing is the organisation needs to look in to this case and see if it should be punishable or if it needs to modify its policy to allow this.The 3 components mentioned above can all cause corruption.A data value not entered properly can cause corruption, eg date being formatted(d/m/y, m/d/y) wrongly can cause problems ahead in the system.Processes can lead to corruption. A lot of the time when i sit to review a system i find a few companies especially the old ones to have processes which no one knows why its there. This process could have been put in as a reaction to some incident that happened years ago. This is when the system starts to drag because decisions start taking longer because the processes keep getting added on. People - the weakest link in the whole system, people can be easily corrupted to do something that they should not be doing. How do you fight corruption? When a system is put in place the management should always do 2 things. 1. is Review and the next is Corrective Action.The above 2 things should always be performed continuous. In most developed countries they do this all the time. ReviewA review can be performed in many ways. 1. Audits - perform an audit on the system, check that the people are filling in the forms properly, following the processes properly, look at all the incidents that occurred in a department and see how they were handled. You should have planned audits along with surprise audits. I know a few companies will also do surprise customers which are basically people hired by the organisation to visit a branch office as customers and will interact with the employees there. They will check everything how is the person dressed, how do they react to the customers, cleanliness of the premises. 2. Feedback - take feedback not only from customers, but also from employees time to time and address those issues. This is a crucial part cause this will tell you if your system is working as you wanted it or not. 3. Paper trial - this basically means when an incident occurs in your organisation you should be able to trace it backwards to its source. Every process should produce some kind of trace that tells, who took that decision, why did they take it and when was it taken.4. reducing ambiguity - i have seen a lot of organisations with this problem, ambiguity always breeds corruption. After a review is done and we find something wrong, we need to take corrective action and this is where India fails miserably. Correction action could be firing someone, giving them a warning, changing the forms to make sure the data is being taken and feed properly.It can also mean changing the processes in the system adding, removing, modifying them if necessary. I really dont know how many people are going to pick up on this. My objective was to give you a wholistic view of corruption not things like policeman taking bribes which is a symptom.If you have any questions please do ask away."},{"prompt":"Can you take control of your blood sugar?","completion":"Balanced Diet: Focus on consuming a well-balanced diet consisting of whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Avoid sugary foods and refined carbohydrates, as they can cause spikes in blood sugar. Portion Control: Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating. Spread your meals throughout the day, including healthy snacks, to prevent drastic blood sugar fluctuations. Choose Low Glycemic Index (GI) Foods: Opt for foods with a low GI, such as whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables. These foods are digested more slowly, resulting in a gradual release of glucose into the bloodstream.

If you view, abortion restrictions historically and in different countries they are not connected to increased liberty but to just the opposite. They are connected to restrictions on contraception. They both are attempts for the state to control women's fertility for religious on demographic reasons. For example in Europe the most famous country with abortion restrictions was Ireland. They had still on the 80s ban of contraception. In the US same principle that was used to legalize abortion ha been used to legalize contraception Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) and Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972). The concept of fetal personhood is nonsense. Personhood has always started at birth, even when abortion was illegal. The International Declaration of Human rights says that rights begin at birth.

Users don't need to handle physical SIM cards, making it easier to switch between carriers or plans. This is especially useful when traveling, as users can activate local plans without needing a physical SIM card from a local carrier.Remote Activation: eSIM allows for remote provisioning, meaning users can activate a new plan or switch carriers directly from their device's settings. This eliminates the need to visit a carrier's store or wait for a physical SIM card to arrive.Dual SIM Support: eSIM enables devices to have dual SIM functionality without requiring a physical second SIM card slot. Users can have multiple active plans on a single device, which is particularly helpful for maintaining separate personal and business lines or using local and international plans simultaneously.Space Savings: Devices with eSIM technology can be designed with smaller form factors since they don't need space for a physical SIM card slot. This can lead to more compact and sleek device designs.Environmental Impact: eSIM reduces the production and disposal of physical SIM cards, which can contribute to a more sustainable approach by reducing plastic waste and resource consumption.Security: eSIM technology is more resistant to physical tampering and SIM card cloning since there's no physical card to steal. The secure element in the eSIM chip enhances security for network authentication and encryption.Global Roaming: Travelers can easily switch to a local carrier's plan using eSIM technology, often providing more cost-effective roaming options compared to traditional roaming services.Ease of Activation: Setting up a plan with eSIM is usually simpler than inserting a physical SIM card. Users can scan a QR code or enter activation details provided by the carrier.Future-Proofing: As eSIM technology becomes more widespread, devices equipped with eSIM are better prepared for future changes in the mobile industry, as they won't require physical SIM card slot changes.Remote Management: Mobile network operators can remotely manage eSIM profiles, allowing for faster updates, troubleshooting, and improvements to user experience.Device Versatility: eSIM technology is not limited to smartphones; it can be integrated into a wide range of devices, including tablets, smartwatches, laptops, and IoT devices, expanding connectivity options. However, it's important to note that eSIM adoption varies by region and carrier, and not all devices or carriers support eSIM functionality. Some users might still prefer traditional SIM cards due to factors like limited eSIM support, habit, or concerns about device compatibility."},{"prompt":"w do you use an Xbox One controller without a console?","completion":"Xbox One controller supports Bluetooth which allows you to use the controller on something like a smartphone.

Most students will have written essays and reports during their undergraduate days and while completing postgraduate coursework; some may have given class or conference presentations; fewer may have successfully published a little of their writing in a scholarly journal or collection of essays. Only an extremely unusual student will have written a lengthy text based on a large research project, presented the findings in painstaking detail and developed and sustained a sophisticated scholarly argument over hundreds of pages. Producing a long and successful academic or scientific document is therefore likely to be an entirely new process that places significant demands on a student’s writing skills. Be Innovative You can set yourself up for earning a first by developing an original and innovative research plan from the start. The best dissertations demonstrate creative, independent thinking. Remember that the dissertation is often viewed as a starting point to a more advanced research career, so proving your ability for original thinking is a great way to show your potential to examiners. Be Critical The difference between a 2.1 dissertation and a first class dissertation is often the degree of critical thinking that it demonstrates. You should show an ability to think beyond common knowledge, and deduce conclusions through insightful and analytical applications of theory. Although this may seem challenging, it is a skill that you will naturally develop from wide reading of journal articles in your field. You can also enhance your ability for critical writing by discussing your ideas in seminars and conferences. Create a Complex Argument – One of the best ways to convey your critical thinking abilities is by creating a complex but coherent argument. This involves combining multiple strands of established ideas to develop a highly specific analytical framework. You should be able to clearly define your overarching philosophy and methodology, and consider how this relates to various theoretical trends in your field. You should avoid convoluted arguments that include too many different ideas; instead choose two or three complementary approaches and combine them to create a unique viewpoint on your subject. Use Obscure Source Material A good way to impress examiners and move from a 2.1 to a first class dissertation is to locate and make use of relatively unknown source material. This can take the form of primary sources obtained from historical archives and research laboratories, or lesser-used secondary sources that you might secure through interlibrary loans. Using these materials will demonstrate your dedication to your research and your ability to judge the value of comparatively obscure sources. Include Tables, Figures and Appendices A First Class dissertation will include relevant tables, figures and data sets. These can provide essential information to support your overall argument. It is usually best to include these in an appendix at the end of your dissertation, so that you can refer to the data multiple times throughout the work. Write several drafts of your first class dissertation Finally, be sure to write several drafts of your dissertation so that you can refine it to the level necessary to achieve a First. Often students will receive a 2.1 simply because they overlooked small typographical errors or clumsy written expression. By rewriting the dissertation several times you will be able to eliminate unnecessary phrases and increase its overall clarity. It will also give you more chances to receive feedback from tutors, which is essential if you want to move from a 2.1 to a first class dissertation!"},{"prompt":"What is the best Bollywood song for caller tune?","completion":"दिल की तन्मयियाँ कोवाज़ बना देता है"},{"prompt":"What are the most touristic countries in the world?","completion":"Santorini, Greece2.

If your strategies and level are correct then you will definitely gonna have profit in the end. But for the beginner, I would never suggest intraday trading. Because as a beginner person is not much experienced and knowledgeable that he/she can do it perfectly as it is very risky even experienced persons are facing such a problem in the intraday trading. As the problem is not that it is not profitable, but the volatility and the short time interval concerned to make it difficult to profit from any movement. Also, noise is heavily felt in the short-term. Why the losses happen is not important. There is only one reason for them to happen. Therefore we should not be selling at a price lower than the buying price. This is simple to understand and every trader knows it. Still, it is not easy to practice. It has to be learned and practiced. Few things which you have to keep in mind while trading: Do trade according to your capital onlyUse a proper Stop-lossDo your own research before the market opens.Also, check the situation of the global market so that you can predictDo not trade immediately when the market start observe for sometimes then start trading according to the market conditionDo trade according to your loss bearing capacityBe Patient and disciplinedNever Repeat Your MistakesDon’t do emotional tradingDo read books about investments These are some points that I have learned through trading. Yes, every person has their own experience and capacity for learning. The stock market is like a big ocean you as much as you will start knowing this you will go deeper and deeper. Still, you will not go to 100% of it. Try your best to learn as much as you can. Now we will discuss some points for day trading strategies: 1. Gain Knowledge In day trading proper knowledge is a must without that u will lose everything. So do your homework. Make a wish list of stocks you'd like to trade and keep yourself informed about the selected companies and general markets. Scan business news and visit reliable financial websites. 2. Trade with surplus fund only Assess how much capital you're willing to risk on each trade. Many successful day traders risk less than 1% to 2% of their account per trade. Set aside a surplus amount of funds you can trade with and you're prepared to lose. Remember, it may or may not happen. As many borrow capital from a bank or from someone so if they lose they might not be in the position to repay it. 3. Keep available yourself during market hours Day trading requires your time. That's why it's called day trading. You'll need to give up most of your day, in fact. Don’t consider it if you have limited time to spare. The process requires a trader to track the markets and spot opportunities, which can arise at any time during trading hours. Moving quickly is key. 4. Start Small As a beginner, you need to start small. Don’t do harsh trading as you are not much knowledgeable and experienced. 5. Avoid Penny Stocks You're probably looking for deals and low prices but stay away from penny stocks. As it won’t give you a profit and keep wasting your time so do trade only in blue-chip stocks which is fundamentally strong and gives you profit. 6. Time Those Trades Many orders placed by investors and traders begin to execute as soon as the markets open in the morning, which contributes to price volatility. The middle hours are usually less volatile, and then movement begins to pick up again toward the closing bell. Though the rush hours offer opportunities, it’s safer for beginners to avoid them at first. 7. Cut Losses With Limit Orders It means don’t place a long target keep tracking the potion and take a minimum profit otherwise if the market reverse it will give you loss only instead of getting a minimum profit. “It’s always better to have something than nothing” 8. Avoid greed If you make your day with your targeted profit then don’t go for another one else you wouldn’t have that profit as well which u have made earlier. Avoid multiple trades of different scripts or multiple lots in single trade these will only give you a loss as these techniques are not having more than 1% surety of giving you a profit. 9. Keep patient and disciplined You have to be patient and disciplined while trading. As impatient nature will not give you a profit. 10. Stick to the Plan Successful traders have to move fast, but they don't have to think fast. Why? Because they've developed a trading strategy in advance, along with the discipline to stick to that strategy. It is important to follow your formula closely rather than try to chase profits. Don't let your emotions get the best of you and abandon your strategy.

Indeed, it is the combination of radioactive waste, radioactive containment, and ionizing radiation that has prevented these technologies from being installed in anything besides the largest varieties of surface ships and submarines, where massive amounts of steel does not hamper the operation of the vessels. Even on a train, the necessary shielding to protect the public from the radiation inside of a nuclear locomotive would be far to great to even mount on the rails, much less the necessary cooling apparatus to keep it from melting down in the middle of somebody’s community."},{"prompt":"What do you want to say to Adam D'Angelo, the CEO of Quora?","completion":"I see the QPP has been beaten like a dead horse, so I’ll leave that alone. But I will talk about the strange lack of balance in the way moderation approaches things like bans and edit blocks, and the lack of an ability to actually report an individual, not just particular comments and answers. I’ve seen many of my Quoran compatriots get edit-blocked and banned…hell, I’ve been edit-blocked before as well. In many of the cases, I could understand why the block occurred, many I couldn’t. I’ve often seen somebody get blocked for BNBR violations and when I look at their edit log, I can’t see a single item that would prompt the block. I most certainly don’t understand some of the outright bans that have occurred. I could have understood [LINKED_TEXT: Brooke Schwartz] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Brooke-Schwartz] being edit-blocked as a punishment, but an outright ban was not proportionate to what was happening. Most importantly, I don’t understand why it seems that some people are immune to these edit blocks and bans. I recently had to block an individual who…well…let’s just let his own comments and answers do the talking: Yes, he’s a very pleasant individual. The following items are just from the past two weeks: He seems to really have a hatred for Canadians, as [LINKED_TEXT: Scott Welch] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Scott-Welch] can attest: Oh, and he likes to say things that are just a little bit bigoted, like assuming a Latino can only own one type of business: Amazingly, with all of these examples in just the past 2 weeks (as far back as his edit history goes), and with me knowing that this is just a sampling (I’ve actually seen far, far worse), he has never once been edit blocked. Not one time. I look at his answers and I see that he’s prone to writing joke answers, harassing answers (he frequently insults the question asker for being too stupid to know the answer already), and answers rife with misinformation. And yet, there he is, still writing to this day, with not even a lick of an indication from Quora that what he’s doing is a violation. Now, before anybody says that he’s just not getting reported, I know for a fact he is. I’ve reported him repeatedly. I’ve had other Quorans message me that they’ve reported him. I’ve seen other Quorans tell him that they’re reporting him. I’ve seen people have those comments telling him this get BNBR violations for telling him this. There was another guy who wrote very similar to the above writer, flat-out rude and obnoxious, but with far worse racism and bigotry. He talked down to and insulted women…not individuals, but all of them. He actually wrote that all African-Americans should be forcibly removed from the US and shipped to Africa. There are several answers of his that claim African-Americans have an average IQ below 80. After Trump beat Clinton in the election, he wrote an entire answer about how she should be added to the list of women Trump had screwed. He was edit-blocked. He’ll be back, he'll be fine. There currently is no real mechanism in place to make a specific complaint about a particular person on Quora. I’ve had more success reporting people for fake names than I have for people who are clearly trolls, or racists, or people giving misinformation, and so on. The guy in the above comments/answers really needs to be addressed, and there’s no real way to report that except as “harassment”, which gives us a tiny little text field to explain. I recently wrote an open letter to Quora, [LINKED_TEXT: Garrett Murphy's post in Garrett's Random Idiocy] [URL: https://www.quora.com/q/ojcnbnoestmtzzzb/An-Open-Letter-To-Quora?ch=10&share=0b53bf8a], which highlights a chiropractor who is frequently giving bad medical advice to Quora users. His advice could possibly cause harm or death to people. I wrote this after reporting several of his answers and comments, and even writing an email to Quora support. He’s still writing on a daily basis. I see no way to report somebody for being a troll. There’s absolutely no way to report somebody for false qualifications, which is a REALLY BIG PROBLEM for Quora right now. I’ll get off my soapbox, but it does seem odd that many people here are walking on eggshells, worried they’ll get edit-blocked or banned because of what we’ve seen happen, but so many people write with a seeming immunity to the same punishments. *** EDIT 1/2/2020 *** And then we get stupidity like this: For those of you keeping score at home, I had upvoted [LINKED_TEXT: Roland Temmerman] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Roland-Temmerman-1] 's Answer.

It highlights how as nations progress, its people naturally move up Maslov's hierarchy of needs till a majority of them are engaged in more artistic/creative pursuits as a means of livelihood. There was a time in India when we were too busy surviving for us to do anything else. That was the time when we studied war and politics and practiced basic livelihood jobs like farming.We are now entering the time when Science & Technology are the pressing concerns before us. Those are the things we need to learn in order to get out of poverty and so our system produces lakhs of engineers. Only once we achieve technological parity with more developed nations and reach a higher standard of living for a majority of the population will our children (or some generation in the future) gain the right to study painting and poetry.

Each particular fragrance is categorized under a certain fragrance type and specific criteria mentioned above and more. There are 4 basic kinds of fragrances: 1) Perfume(Parfum)- This is the one that lasts the longest and the strongest in terms of scent projection. Has about 20–30% on average fragrance concentration which is the strongest and the least amount of alcohol. 2) Eau de Parfum- The strongest after Parfum, with a 15–20% fragrance concentration. Not as strong as parfum but still has a very strong projection and one of the more common types of fragrances. 3) Eau de Toilette- Probably the most common type of fragrance you will see. Has usually an average projection and scent strength. 5–15% is the typical fragrance concentration amount found in these kinds of fragrances. 4) Eau de Cologne - Has one of the lowest scent concentration and one that men usually use. Has 2–4% fragrance concentration, lasts about 2 hours usually. Those terms are basically what’s used to describe and identify the fragrance types, scent concentration and how long they will last for. Hopefully this answer was helpful!!"},{"prompt":"What is the difference between perfume, eau de toilette and cologne?","completion":"The primary difference lies in the concentration of essential oils that go into making the perfume. Common essences include patchouli, amber, bergamot, rose, orange, musk (but I digress!). The order of concentration from highest to lowest are as follows … Perfume is the most concentrated and can have up to 40% concentration of perfume extracts. Perfumes have a thicker, oilier consistency and the scent is released over a longer period of time, so much less is needed and is sold in smaller volumes.Usually sold in stopper bottles and never as sprays! Of course, this also means it is the most expensive of the 4.Eau de Parfum contains up to 20% of the perfume essence, with more water and alcohol. It is also lighter than the perfume and doesn’t last long (some may find this preferable).Sold in normal or spray bottles. If it is sold as a spray bottle, doesn’t mean one should drench themselves in it :-).Eau de Toilette (EDT) contains up to 10% perfume concentrates. Since it is lighter than Eau de Parfum, it is usually sold in spray bottles.Spray it liberally, since it doesn’t last long and can be used day to day.Eau de Toilette because of its lower concentration is a lighter, more refreshing scent, and is ideal for warmer climates.Eau de Cologne, has up to 5% perfume concentration. Originates from Cologne, Germany and hence the name (meaning water of Cologne). It is usually a mixture of citrus oils and is refreshing for hotter climates. Eau de Cologne is sold in larger bottles and tends to be the least expensive perfume of the 4.

Tell the hotel the price you found by means of different locales and check whether they can beat it. Remaining in the core of the city commonly costs more.

What happens to a material if its Poisson’s ratio changes from negative to positive value?","completion":"Poisson's ratio is a measure of the relationship between the lateral and axial strain in a material when subjected to uniaxial stress. It is defined as the ratio of the transverse strain (perpendicular to the direction of the applied stress) to the axial strain (parallel to the direction of the applied stress) in a material. If a material has a negative Poisson's ratio, it means that it becomes thicker in one direction and narrower in the other direction when subjected to uniaxial stress. This behavior is known as auxetic behavior. On the other hand, if a material has a positive Poisson's ratio, it means that it becomes narrower in one direction and thicker in the other direction when subjected to uniaxial stress. A change from a negative to a positive Poisson's ratio can indicate a change in the mechanical behavior of a material. For example, this change may be caused by a phase transformation in the material, such as a change from a crystalline to an amorphous structure, or a change in temperature. Understanding the Poisson's ratio of a material can provide valuable information about its behavior under different conditions and can be useful in design and engineering applications."},{"prompt":"Why do Arabs (mainly in Saudi Arabia and Gulf States) prefer to sleep in the morning and do activities or work at night?","completion":"The sun will burn you."},{"prompt":"What oscillator circuit is the best for DIY function generator?

Simply take a piece of paper and pen down your musings. It is smarter to compose something than nothing. Different writers’ brains need different things: Every writer has his/her own unique sense of processing and expressing his viewpoint about circumstances, situations and events. You don’t have to follow any guidelines and fit a specific mold, rather you should write with a free flow of thoughts. Figure out how to deal with a temporarily uncooperative mind: Searching for the ideal spot to compose, planning an extraordinary composing cape, as well as sitting tight for another moon are tarrying not arrangement. Quit faffing, quit fetishising, begin composing. Be reliable: You all should realize that Rome was not implicit a day. So to upgrade your composing abilities, you ought to compose every day. You should deliver words routinely and finish what you began and do it once more. Compose based on prompts: Select a few catchphrases and attempt to compose an organization or a piece of composing dependent on them. Put your characters in unusual places and conditions and go ahead and compose. On the off chance that you need to compose, you should be interested. You need to snoop and be meddling, investigate new streets, and open shut entryways. You must be a jaybird, and fabricate your accounts from the fortunes you find and take.

Babe Ruth was not named on 11 ballots in 1936.Walter Johnson was only on 83% of the ballots of the same first ballot.More than 20 BBWAA voters did not vote for Willie Mays on his first ballotEight voters left Cal Ripken Jr. off their ballots.Tom Seaver? 5 people didn’t vote for him.Koufax himself: not even close to unanimous: 86% of the votes. There were dozens of electees who have gotten higher percentages. The reasons why were usually non-baseball related bunk: some voters would purposely leave off players on their first ballots every time in protest of the legends of the game not themselves being unanimous. Other voters routinely leave off players with whom they’ve had disagreements with in the past. A slew of recent voters have sent in blank ballots in protest of the PED era, which results in a non-vote for which ever player was on that ballot at the time. It wasn’t until the BBWAA roster was revamped in the late 2010s and a spirit of transparency started to become more pervasive in the voter block that we started to get really close to deserved unanimous votes. And that’s when we got the first truly unanimous player in Mariano Rivera, who got 425 out of 425 in 2019."},{"prompt":"w can I lose 10 pounds in 3 weeks without exercising?","completion":"Add protein to your diet. ...Prioritize whole, single-ingredient foods. ...Limit processed foods. ...Stock up on nutritious foods and snacks. ...Limit your intake of added sugar. ...Drink water. ...Drink (unsweetened) coffee. ...Supplement with glucomannan."},{"prompt":"What's the next number in the series: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11?","completion":"Much as I like [LINKED_TEXT: Richard Morris's answer to What's the next number in the series: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-next-number-in-the-series-1-4-5-6-7-9-11/answer/Richard-Morris-34], I prefer to say that the answer is 40, which is the next number without a ‘t’ in it in Danish - fyrre.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the main gases that need to be removed from the air, as it is produced by the respiration of the crew and the combustion of the engines. If CO2 accumulates in the air, it can cause health problems such as headaches, drowsiness, nausea, and even death. Submarines use different methods to remove CO2 from their atmospheres, depending on their type and technology. Here are some of the most common methods: Scrubbers: These are machines that use chemicals such as soda lime (sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide) to trap CO2 in a chemical reaction and remove it from the air. Scrubbers are used by most submarines, especially nuclear-powered ones, as they do not require electricity and can operate continuously. Electrolysis: This is a process that uses electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is used to replenish the air supply, while the hydrogen is either vented or stored for later use. The electrolysis also reduces the CO2 concentration in the water, as CO2 dissolves more easily in water than oxygen. Electrolysis is used by some submarines, especially diesel-electric ones, as it requires less chemicals and space than scrubbers. Amine Swingbed: This is a device that uses a liquid amine solution to absorb CO2 from the air and release it when heated. The amine solution is circulated through a bed of porous material that alternates between absorbing and releasing CO2. The released CO2 is then vented or stored for later use. Amine swing beds are used by some submarines, especially those with fuel cells, as they are more efficient and compact than scrubbers or electrolysis.

Napoleon was militarily successful and the Russians were unable to stop his army. Czarist, Soviet and modern Russia has always been a centralized government with the country ruled the Kremlin. So whoever filled Moscow ruled Russia. Napoleon's objective was Moscow and Napoleon took Moscow. When the Russian leadership realized Moscow could not be saved they determined they would burn it down, destroy all the grain, livestock and anything else Napoleon could use before Napoleon got there which made Moscow useless to Napoleon. By the time Moscow was taken Russian winter set in. The french army had not planned to still be in the field in Russia in winter, they expected to invasion to be over or comfortably stationed in Moscow. Russians denied them either option so they froze to death where they stood and unable to March back to France till spring. In the meantime the Russian military was still roaming the area harrasing the french who had lost the initiative. Napoleon had his useless prize and his starving frozen army was near useless as he waited for spring to return to France. On the March back to France the Russian military decimated the retreating french. When the Germans reached within 20 miles of the Kremlin and driving into Moscow suburbs just as winter rolled in it looked like a replay of the Napoleon episode and Stalin choose the se strategy to deny Hitler his prize. However, the Germans were deep in the grip of victory disease. Felt invincible. So Hitler ordered a suspension of military operations on the Moscow front till he could get to Moscow front and triumphantly enter Moscow with his victorious army. They delay allowed winter to get worse disabling equipment, the soldiers to freeze to death and the survivors to become less effective (Germans had not made plans for winter fighting either) and Stalin's veteran fighters to reach the eastern from asiaafter Japan and Russia reached a non aggression deal.

In the last few years, I have become invisible. I thought it was my imagination at first. But I have come to believe that my assistive devices (cane, walker, or wheelchair depending on how my symptoms are that day) are like an invisibility cloak. There a couple possibilities I can think of for this phenomenon. The first is that people equate disability with diminished intelligence. People don't engage me in conversation the way they used to. Second, people are uncomfortable around me and don't know how to act. Third, I am unable to engage in the same reciprocity as able-bodies. It takes me longer to do things. People look at me and see different, not the same, not like me. Maybe there is even an element of fear, that I was once like you and now I am not. I think it's funny when people ask me, “How did you get MS?” because that's not really what they're asking. They're asking, “How do I keep from getting MS?” Short answer: You don't. Life happens. Everyone gets here. An accident. An illness. Or for the lucky, old age. I am declaring my right to exist. Every. Day. It's no one’s fault. People can't know what they don't know.

Here is the premise of Intelligent Design: An unknown creator (or creators)*, did something or things that we haven’t pinned down, in unknown ways**, at a time or several times in Earth’s history for reasons unknown. .* ID, in its attempt to appear scientific rather than religious, refuses to name or describe this/ these beings. There is excellent evidence that the main ID lobby group means the Christian God when they say ‘Designer’ but they try to not outright admit this. The last point of my definition, “for reasons unknown”, also relates to this point and might be redundant..** Many things that humans do, and birds making nests or beavers making dams, is build things and leave ‘tool marks’. If I see a bit of wood in the water, I can tell if it were chewed by a beaver or not. And I can look at a bunch of logs in a creek and recognize a beaver’s work compared to a flood that piles up wreckage. At work, I was eating Campbell's soup and a coworker was staring at the half-full can on the counter. I quickly stated that I would eat and clean that up but the bowl I used was too small for a full can at once. She responded that she was wondering how I had opened the can; the tool marks were strange. In fact, I couldn’t find a can opener and had used the one on my Swiss Army knife. My point here is that we look for and note tool marks and this is a big part of inferring design. ID does not do this. In the Dover ID trial of 2005, Dr Behe, defending ID, proposed an experiment. He wanted to raise several generations of bacteria lacking flagella in conditions where having a flagellum would be beneficial. He suggested this would test ID and evolution. Here is a paraphrase of Dr Richard Hoppe’s problem with the experiment (original here: [LINKED_TEXT: An Experimental Test of ID? Really?] [URL: https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/11/behes-experimen.html]). At the end of the experiment we either have flagella or not. We have Flagella: 1) they evolved. 2) The designer took pity on the bacteria and gave them flagella. Remember, we can’t describe the motivations or abilities of this Designer. No Flagella: 1) They didn’t evolve. 2) They evolved but the Designer removed them - again, we can’t describe the motivations or abilities of this Designer. With no way to describe or define this Designer, any result is possible. There is no way to test for ID.

Can someone explain it in simple words?","completion":"Think of it as a shortcut on your computer. When a phone joins a network, it presents itself as d8:8n:v8 (example), the DHCP server will then generate a private IP for it, or use one that's been reserved for that MAC (192.168.56.11 for example). So now when you communicate with 192.168.56.11, you're actually just communicating with d8:8n:v8.

Why and how?","completion":"The Easter banquet hosted by Vlad Dracula was a tragic event in history, where hundreds of people were massacred. The massacre took place in 1459 in what is now Romania. The victims were mainly members of the boyar class, which were the ruling elite of Wallachia at the time. Vlad Dracula, also known as Vlad the Impaler, was the prince of Wallachia from 1456 to 1462. He was a cruel and ruthless ruler who was known for his extreme punishments and cruelty. One of his most famous methods of punishment was to impale his enemies on wooden stakes. He was also known for his extreme cruelty to the boyar class, which is what led to the massacre at the Easter banquet.

Firstly luck/chance. This book shows the importance of chance for success: Ultimately, if Bill Gates was born today, there is a good chance he would be \`merely\` a multi-millionaire, not a multi-billionaire. The reason he was given so many chances was that he accumulated the experience at a young age, during a time when few older people had those skills. A 15 year old kid isn’t usually given opportunities when a 30 or 40 year old has the same skills. Likewise, if the Russian Oligarchs were born today or in 1910, I doubt they would be as wealthy. Another thing is scale. In the age of the internet, it is easier to get rich quicker. Not quick per see, but quicker. In traditional business you would build up a reputation in your local community. Now you can do it quicker with scale online. In extreme cases things go viral and the owner gets rich quick. Get rich slow is much more tried and tested though. 100% of people who have visited long-term in low-cost funds for decades have gotten wealthy. With online, it is not only untested, but the goalposts do get moved more easily as you are trading often on \`rented real estate\`. I know various people who have done very well from YouTube, Affiliate marketing and other platforms and then suddenly these platforms have moved the goalposts and terms and conditions, and they aren’t as wealthy anymore. Finally, those who get rich fast tend to lose it quicker as well, as they often get overconfident about their abilities.

They are popular for their ease of use and accessibility, making them relatively easier to repair.Front-Load Washing Machines: Front-load washers have a horizontal drum and are known for their energy efficiency and water-saving capabilities. Repairing them may require more technical expertise, as some components are located behind the front panel.Semi-Automatic Washing Machines: These machines have separate wash and spin tubs and require manual intervention to move the clothes from one tub to another. Repairs on semi-automatic machines are generally straightforward.Fully Automatic Washing Machines: Fully automatic washers handle the washing and spinning processes without manual intervention. They come in both front-load and top-load variants, and repairs can be more complex due to their advanced features and electronic components.High-Efficiency (HE) Washing Machines: HE washers are designed to use less water and energy. They come in various types (front-load or top-load) and may have specialized repair needs.Compact/Portable Washing Machines: These smaller washing machines are often used in apartments, RVs, or small living spaces. They may have unique repair requirements due to their compact design.Commercial/Industrial Washing Machines: These heavy-duty machines are commonly used in laundromats, hotels, and other commercial settings. Repairing commercial washers often requires specialized skills and equipment. It's important to note that repairing washing machines can be complex and requires specific technical knowledge.

As a [LINKED_TEXT: business analyst] [URL: https://www.arsccomlearning.in/business-analysts-certification-course/?sid=1], I can tell you that the role is both exciting and challenging. The main responsibility of a business analyst is to bridge the gap between IT and business by understanding the needs and requirements of the business and then communicating that to the IT team. A business analyst must have a deep understanding of both the business and the technology, so they can accurately articulate the requirements of the business and ensure that the IT solutions meet those requirements. In my experience, one of the biggest challenges faced by business analysts is to gather requirements from various stakeholders who may have different perspectives and priorities. It is important for a business analyst to have excellent communication and interpersonal skills to effectively gather and consolidate these requirements. Additionally, they must also have a strong analytical mindset to be able to identify patterns, trends, and connections that may not be immediately apparent to others. This helps in finding the root cause of a problem and coming up with effective solutions. I remember a time when I was working on a project for a financial institution. The stakeholders had conflicting requirements, and it was my responsibility to find a way to balance the needs of all parties involved. I took the time to understand the needs and goals of each stakeholder, and then used my analytical skills to find a solution that met everyone's requirements. It was a challenging project, but I was able to successfully deliver a solution that everyone was happy with.

It has an interesting back story. It was originally formed in 1888 by a group of explorers, geographers, teachers, and financiers. They came up with the idea at a dinner party and only weeks later it took off. There was a growing interest in the world around us and information didn’t flow as easily as it did today. It started out as The National Geographic Society. They used to send men on expeditions using funds from the magazine. With interest quickly rising in the magazine, and revenue improving, they continued to increase the scope and reach of their magazines, incorporating more photography, to produce a wildly popular brand. The magazine actually raises a ton of money for charities and awareness of various causes. Unfortunately, in recent years, with the digital revolution, like many publishers, they have gone through some major organizational changes as well. They are shifting to a more digital format. And recently, Disney took up a 21% share in Nat Geo. So expect National Geographic to go to shit in the near future."},{"prompt":"Do you think Mark Cuban would make a good POTUS?","completion":"Hard to say.

Being an entrepreneur and running a business is vastly different than governing the still most powerful nation on the planet.

This may be due to a number of factors, including: Ketosis: When the body is in a state of ketosis, it is burning fat for fuel instead of glucose. This can lead to a decrease in hunger and cravings.Increased insulin sensitivity: Eating fewer meals can increase insulin sensitivity, making the body more efficient at using insulin to process glucose. This can lead to improved blood sugar control and a decrease in hunger.Fat adaptation: Over time, the body may become more efficient at using fat for fuel, which can lead to a decrease in hunger and cravings.Eating nutrient-dense foods: Eating foods that are high in nutrients, such as protein, fiber, and healthy fats, can help keep you feeling full and satisfied between meals.Habituation: Some people may simply become accustomed to eating fewer meals and feeling less hungry between meals over time. It's important to note that not everyone can or should adopt an eating pattern of only one or two meals a day. It's important to listen to your body and eat when you are hungry, and to make sure you are consuming enough calories and nutrients to support your health and well-being. If you have any concerns about your eating habits, it's always a good idea to speak with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian."},{"prompt":"What are some cool, lesser known facts about the Indian Railways?","completion":"1.

Not everyone can lease a car! Your credit score is a major factor that plays into whether you can lease a car or not. So, in the end, your financial stability is a factor for leasing a car. Despite this, there are pros and cons of leasing a car: Pros of car leasing: You can change your car every couple of years.The lease payments are low than financing or buying a car.You can drive the latest cars with the latest features (such as safety and automotive) at affordable prices. It is perfect for car enthusiasts.If you like the car, you can purchase it at the end of the leasing period. Cons of car leasing: You have to return the vehicle at the end of the leasing period.You cannot terminate a car lease early without incurring heavy fines.The mileage is fixed, so you must know your annual car mileage. If you exceed the mileage on a leased car, you have to pay 20-30 cents for each exceeded mile.For excess wear and tear, you pay for the maintenance of the car at the end of the lease.

Ed Milliband was keen to make Labour policy more democratic and representative of the opinions held by ordinary party members. There has always been a dichotomy in the Labour Party caused by what ordinary members want and support and what research shows the public will vote for in a General Election. After the Labour Party lost with Neil Kinnock in the 1992 election, it was realized by the National Executive Committee that Labour had to listen to what research into voting behaviour showed. In 1997, Labour ran a slick campaign under Tony Blair, arguing the country needed a more centrist government. Labour won with a landslide and won the two elections after that, but then a change of leader resulted in a change of fortunes with Labour losing again. There is no complicated explanation of why Labour lost - it is just that the National Executive Committee made an elementary mistake that it did not make with Tony Blair as Labour leader. What it did wrong was to ignore what they knew research into voting behaviour showed.

I sent him a note asking a few questions about his company. Now these were pretty basic questions such as: What does your company do?What does success look like for your company 12 months from now? You get the idea. I just wanted a little background information before I spoke with this person. I get a response back from the entrepreneur, we’ll call him Charles, saying: “Hey Brett, would you mind signing this.” The “this” turned about to be a one-way NDA. I groaned and sighed. “Why do some founders do such stupid things?” I asked myself. Your paranoia can kill your chances of getting an investment. I’d seen Charles’ behavior before. In fact, one of my original cofounders, “John,” did something similar in our first diligence meeting by asking the investor to sign an NDA. The investor, Kevin, looked at John and said, “We can stop right there. I’m not signing an NDA.” John backed down and the meeting continued. After the meeting, I said to John, “What the fuck was that all about?” “I don’t want an investor stealing our idea. If they understand what we’re doing, then they can copy it.” My blood pressure was rising and with it went my voice. I loudly said, “John, if that’s all we have, then we’re in deep trouble! Kevin isn’t even an IC designer. He couldn’t replicate what you are doing even if he tried.” “He can give the idea to someone else!” John screamed back. I was exasperated. “No! that’s not how VCs work. My goodness. You’re an elite engineer. He wants to invest in our company, not steal our idea!” How can an investor get to know your company if you don’t explain what your company does? John had a history with investors. And whenever someone says they have a history with investors, it’s usually not a good history. Indeed, this was the case with John. He felt, rightly or wrongly, that he’d been burned by investors before. And he wasn’t going to let it happen again. However, John’s paranoia was going to cost him and us funding. Whether you like it or not, you have to give investors enough information about your company, or they’re not going to invest in your company. That’s just the way it is. Will some of that information leak to your competitors? Probably. However, that’s the cost of doing business. What in your pitch deck is really that confidential after all? “You’re the most paranoid person at Maxim,” Jack Gifford, Maxim’s CEO said to me one day. Then he paused for several seconds and said, “And that’s good!” Gifford’s point was that paranoia can be useful in some business situations. Now truth be told, I was way too paranoid when I was younger. As I grew older, I realized that my overly paranoid style was getting in the way. I was pissing too many people off by hoarding information. By the time I founded my company, I had transformed myself into being transparent. I had an epiphany. I realized our job was to make an investors job as easy as possible. If that meant that information went to a potential competitor, then so be it. After all, when the odds are 100:1 against a VC investing in your company, then you’d better make it easy for them. You should be more concerned about your cofounders stealing your idea than your investors. John quit a few weeks after the incident with Kevin. He started a company with the exact same idea that I had. He stole our business plan right down to the pitch deck we were using. I restarted the company with a new team, and we ended up getting funded. John never did get funded, but I know John received a term sheet from a very well known investor in Silicon Valley. John turned the term sheet down. He was too afraid of giving up control. He decided to bootstrap the company instead. John’s company folded a couple years later.

Becoming a doctor has long been an esteemed honor. As experts in science, biology, wholeness and wellness, doctors remain influential members of society. And they will continue to be the foremost authority on health and wellness for a long time. 2. Doctors invite themselves to experience other’s vulnerability. It’s an honor to be so intimately involved and dedicated to the exploration of creating well-being. 3. A doctor not only experiences the health and wellness of their patients but their sickness and ultimate death. This glimpse at mortality and the fragility of life that hone efforts to sanctify life and progress society. This awareness allows doctors to influence society for the better. 4.

There is some basic information that is needed to even being to “guess” what might be causing this and to give you suggestions about some of the things you need to ask your vet. Here are some of those questions that might help you get more information from your veterinarian. How old are the kittens? Are they still nursing? How much do they weigh now? Are the kittens weaned? What are you feeding them now? How’s their appetite? Are they active?

According to the laws, anyone can perform publicly with acoustic instruments on the subway platforms. And with amplification on the mezzanines, upstairs from the platforms. But NOT on the trains. The key word here is “perform”. As soon as you explicitly ask people for money, you are selling something, which is technically a big no-no in the eyes of the city. However, if you just happen to be “performing” on the platform with your instrument case open next to you, and random people just happen to walk up and voluntarily put their money in the case, those are just donations, and not illegal. There is also an official program, called Music Under New York, that musicians can audition for, that lets them play scheduled, officially MTA-sanctioned sets in the subway stations. But you don’t have to belong to MUNY to play in the subways, and it’s not the same as getting a permit. In actual practice, if the NYPD decides they don’t want you in a subway station (or anywhere else), they are going to find an excuse to kick you out. They can say you are creating an obstruction to passengers or emergency exits. They can say you are too loud, and preventing the public from hearing loudspeaker announcements. (Hilarious, since no one can understand half those announcements anyway.) They can enforce the “no amplification” rule if you’re using an amp on the platform. And if you are openly asking people for money, or have a stack of CDs that are obviously for sale, they can threaten to bust you for selling without a permit. (I don’t know what the official charge would be, but something along those lines.) In general, if the NYPD asks you to leave a place, you need to do some hard math about exactly how much of a personal stand you are willing to make, vs. how much time you want to potentially spend in court and/or a holding cell. It’s not always fair. Welcome to New York. In my personal experience (I busked pretty consistently in the subways for a couple years), if you’re not blatantly getting in the way of anybody or blocking something important, and not being ridiculously obnoxious in terms of volume and/or sales pitch, most cops won’t look twice at you. If they have been assigned to hang out on that platform, they might come over and ask you to stop just because they don’t want to listen to it. And once in a while one will give you shit, just because they can. But for the most part, they have bigger things on their minds."},{"prompt":"Aren’t you upset seeing a tattoo all over Jungkook’s arm?","completion":"Nope, don’t care"},{"prompt":"Who is headless CMS for?","completion":"Simply because there are many benefits of using a Headless CMS :) One of the most significant benefits is that it allows you to manage your content without having to worry about the design or layout of your website.

I believe that open-world games give more freedom to the player to forge their own path as they work through the main storyline of the game. It titles such as GTA V, the Assassins Creed series, and Tom Clancy Ghost Recon Wildlands, the player is able to explore the world and have more choices on how they want to spend their time. However, even though this can be a good thing for gamers, the developers are responsible for placing the right amount of activities within the game for players to feel the sense of freedom. GTA V is a great example of players being able to have these freedoms as most of the missions are unique and the player can also just run around the map for hours with self-made entertainment. Other titles like the Assassins Creed serious games give the open-world concept with restricted gaming. Even though the player can explore the map, there is only a limited variety of tasks the player can accomplish, which can become very repetitive within an open world. I think the idea of open-world is good for the gaming community when executed properly. For most games, the developers need to sit down and figure out how to properly add a better variety of tasks for players without overloading the game. It all comes down to proper balance that lots of studios need to figure out before tackling these types of games."},{"prompt":"the Indian economy going to hit a recession in the coming months?","completion":"Recession 2023, is it coming and how it will impact the jobs and economy?

If we want to use Angular in our project, we have to choose one of its versions – AngularJS or other. AngularJS – or as some may prefer: Angular 1 – was created in 2009. It brings us two‑way data binding and lets us see data changes in JavaScript automatically shown on the UI. Furthermore, AngularJS has directives that let us create more separated and reusable code than ever before. Generally, it allows us, programmers, to write applications in MVC or MVVM architecture (sometimes called MVW architecture (Model-View-Whatever) in a simpler way. It made a step forward in testing front-end applications, because of its dependency injection mechanism which helps mock dependencies. Wondering about a version that will be the best for you? The newer version of Angular is a popular solution. Moreover, mostly it will be a better choice. Anyway, before you choose one of them to your new project, try to answer some questions: What libraries would you like to use? Are they compatible with Angular? What web browsers we want to support? (this one is really important)If you choose only new browsers, then Angular is the best. It’s because it is a forward-looking library, but don’t forget about other browsers. For example, IE8 for which you should definitely use AngularJS from version 1.3 that supports IE8 and higher. Angular is a great framework. It has many improvements in terms of AngularJS. It will become more and more popular and I think that it is well suited to small as also to bigger applications, so it is really worth learning and using. As we talk about Angular, I want to notice that there is also ReactJS which is a little bit opponent to Angular and I will write some more about it in the next article."},{"prompt":"Why is #ISRO trending on Twitter?","completion":"OUR GENERATION IS FULL OF UNHAPPY ACTORS (what I observed is this generation pretends to be the most happening creatures but they are actually broken —-—based on my observation on this platform ) so, Happiness = Reality - Expectations It’s pretty straightforward—when the reality of someone’s life is better than they had expected, they’re happy. When reality turns out to be worse than the expectations, they’re unhappy. what wrong with this generation is we expect more and more and more and we live in false realities. REASONS——→ 1 )WE LACK PATIENCE, (everything is possible at instant like instant food, instant money transfer, instant talk, binge watching TV series(skipping the whole season to binge watch it)…making us impatient. 2 ) SOCIAL MEDIA (SOCIAL MEDIA destroying more than anything.. Destroying our self esteem, and reminding us we're all worthless and lazy pieces(for example we just open social media to get some motivation but ended up demotivating ourself…reason--> people are showing their achievements. Ok it is good we get inspired by the same. But when the same person rants about his achievement on the same platform again and again then it will become demotivating at the same time. People share their best side only .very less are showing their worst (people consider them as motivation in the sense to not to be ended up like them .). 3) MESSED UP :we are extremely messed up. We are stuck in the world which is changing so fast , such that if we get a problem however hard we try to cope up, we are still a step behind. (Those who left behind are given the tag of losers). 4) COMPETITIVE:compared to the previous generations we are more competitive. more than selection we have tests for rejection… So this creates a mentality of not being rejected at any cost otherwise you are not considered. Either you are selected or you don't exist. 5.) WE HAVE BUTS- We have opportunity but we have a lots of distractions We are ambitious, but we have extreme frustration. We move fast from one city to other, but we have to leave behind all prior friendships or relationship to start a fresh. We can travel as far as possible to beautiful places but we do not have enough time to experience it. (So we click pictures not to show to others to come back and enjoy the view on screens. Huh!!) 6) CLUELESS- we are the people who have so much information but this has make us more clueless. We are provided with lots of opportunity but this transition didn't give us the direction to choose. More the choices more the confusion.actual problem is that everyone know what’s the problem but one one knows the actual solution (eg we all know depression exist ,but wait is it actually a depression ,or what is the level of depression one is having or it’s just someone is feeling low because he overthinks after not getting solution or he is just confused after getting so much unnecessary information. we are just getting information we are not getting the solutions. 7) COMPARISON- we can watch the success of others so easily that we end up comparing ourself with others , even if we don't compare ourselves ,the society do the same for us. They make success=good life. 8)LACKING GRATITUDE-One of the biggest reason for feeling unhappy or sad is that we don’t count our blessings when we wake up every day. Rather, we focus on the things we lack and believe that our happiness is solely dependent on achieving the next big thing. 9)OVERTHINK-People either are thinking of their past, because this is something, which they have already seen and certain about. Otherwise, people keep on thinking about their future. They are continuously anxious about what is the next thing going to happen in their lives. How would be their future? 9) NOT ENJOYING JUST LIVING-see we really enjoyed our childhood when we have no phones and that was the actual happiness.we have no unnecessary pressures . Nowadays we are living it just by scrolling through the screens ,lost interest in people ,finding life on media or planning trips not just to enjoy the moment but to get the social validation of enjoying your life ….which is sad.

What are some of the main factors that allowed the Empire to become so vast?","completion":"History, Geography and culture (and luck) combined with adept strategy and innovation. Geography and History because thanks to the Roman Empire and Norman invasions we were part of the landmass (in effect) with one of the two most advanced cultures in the world by the time the Age of Exploration begins (possibly three actually because the Muslims were still advanced). We were also on the north western edge of the continent and by then we were moving from subsistence economies to production of basic goods. The Tudors onward (bar the civil war) also brought reasonable political stability. In short, despite the 400–1000 period looking a little concerning the Norman invasion and subsequent history took us to the 1500’s in a good position. From that point on with the birth of parliament, political stability, exposed coast and a growing domestic union we see that we were in a good position relative to global states to establish colonies. As war with Spain breaks out (and the old French enemy) we see that Western Europe ends up in a position where they are relatively capitalist and in competition with each other forcing innovation. We then make the wise strategic decision to invest in naval defences over sending large armies to the continent. History then puts us behind behind France and Spain until after the Civil War and union at which point we have a large, relatively wealthy population, a large navy and so through the 1700’s we innovate, cement our position and develop the industrial revolution which allows us to fund said navy and win the 7 years war. Victory at Trafalgar and later Waterloo cements our position as the Apex Predator. Our population also exploded due to wealth allowing our people to live rather than starve. In short, until about 1500 we were close enough to Europe that their history was ours and our culture was born of theirs (one of the three most developed areas of the world). War and an early belief in mercantilism (both factors of competition) plus being on the western end of Europe put us in the right place with an advanced enough state to expand. When we get to 1700, we find that our focus on the navy and island status protects us while we cement our position. We form the right alliances and produce the industrial revolution. We come out of the Napoleonic War as the undisputed superpower.

Whether it’s an innovative strategy for gaining market share or a clever way of avoiding costly mistakes, these types of moves can often make the difference between success and failure. One example that stands out in particular is when Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market in 2017. At the time, many people were skeptical about what this move would mean for Amazon’s bottom line—but they quickly discovered that this was one of the smartest maneuvers ever made by any company in history. By using their existing logistics network to deliver fresh groceries directly to customers' homes at competitive prices (and no delivery fees), Amazon was able to change the way people shop for groceries and expand into new markets like organic and health foods. The acquisition has proven incredibly successful for both companies: Whole Foods now enjoys increased exposure through its association with one of the world's most powerful brands; meanwhile, Amazon has been able to offer customers even greater convenience when buying food online—all thanks to their shrewd decision back in 2017! This is just one of many examples of how businesses have used smart strategies to not only stay in business but also grow in the face of tough competition from other players on the market.

Let us see how: When there was rule of king b4 2045Bs, Have you ever heard anyone going to foreign countries for employment???? In those period there were tons of companies which use to provide employment to people. Now more than 95% are all destroyed by these leaders of the political parties. Now the situation is such that more than 8 million people has gone to foreign countries from nepal alone just to get employment. Therefore it wouldn't be wrong to say that, Majority of country economy is supported by remittance only but not by our own country resourcesOnly the one who has political connections were getting benefitted by this system. For eg. Just go and see the situation of relatives of puspa kamal dahal aka prachanda. His own daughter in law is the minister of water department, his own daughter is the mayor of Chitwan …etc. There is no one in his relatives who has not got the top position in any kind of government department. Moreover he has more than 33 Arab of black money deposited in some island ( According to some khufia sutra). This guy has come to power by killing more than 17 thousand Nepali janta during janaaandolan. I think each and every family who were victim of janaaandolan were in trauma. Because they cant get any positive outcomes even by giving such sacrifices. Now in the name of communism, these top leaders favours only those who had power in the form of money.Corruption was in such a high rate which you can never imagine. Even our own current Prime minister was favouring corruption. Just see this: Because of this corruption in Nepal has hit its limit. See, Nepal is in the top of the list for having corruption. Just know that, now there are more than 1000 raja and maharaja in the form of mayor, wodaaadaxya…etc. Whose only work is to do corruption and appoint jhole karyakarta in government positions by the help of power. ( By telling this, I am not saying everyone is bad. Instead majority of them are of no use)Our top political Leaders are totally controlled by foreign countries. Though face are of nepali, they are bideshi dalal. They try to pass MCC which can make the situation of this country as like that riot of siriya. They are trying their best to pass MCC because foreign countries had already fed them with huge money. They are selling their mother because they are fed to do so by some others else. If I elaborate why king is needed, this would take me more than 24 hours to write. But just remember, this system will favour no one. Not you not me unless you had a connection. If you are student, probably you do not have any hope to get employed in your own country. Situation is so harassed that I cannot describe it in words. For the sake of your knowledge, I had Combine some of the news from naya patrika of 10 days. You migh see what was happening in this country if you read just 1 years of news published in this country. See the headings: In the name of development, only destruction were seen. Now the situation is such that less than 17 % of allocated budget is used on actual development where more than 80% is spent just on salary, TDS of government employee . And the fact is that, more than 50% out of this 80% is corrupted. This is because there is no any strong system which would ensure that the released budget is utilized properly. Our own karyakari pramukh (Top position authority) of CIAA (Akthyar durupayog aanusandhan aayog) is so appointed that he come as a jole karyakarta of these political parties who has a background of being a top corrupted person at some time. In the name of loktantra, everywhere is loot-tantra. Back on days the country were run by great leaders where terrorist spread rumours. Now the situation is such that terrorist run the country and we are becoming the victim of their dumb actions. Now we can see vividly that No standard education system, No support on health care to general public, No capacity to give employment, favouring the corrupeted people , No emphasis on industrial sector, Increasing tax rate…etc has engulfed the country. Moreover our leaders are such a lunatic and incapable that they just know to fight for the position in the name of leading our country. Now can you imagine that: You will be able to get health facilities as of developed countries?Your upcoming will have their employment opportunities in this own country??You will get free and quality education someday in this country????

The question suggests that the one posing it has already prejudged the psychology of such person. A conspiracy theory in its unbiased definition isn’t a lazy propagandist meme as the question suggests. It is a term that is either based on a legitimate evidential theory, or purely a self-fulfilling belief which cannot be confused for an actual theory. Your question made no distinction between the two. It suggests that term is a one size fits all meme describing a phenomena based purely on faith. The way you use the term “conspiracy theory” suggests that none can be legitimate. And of course, historically, that’s a false premise.

Do you call the person or persons who exposed pre-existing or ongoing conspiracies that turned out to be factual to be “conspiracy theorists” in the same light that your question suggests? The question assumes that the term points to an individual or individuals with a socio-psychological imbalance that’s addictive; in other words if a person presents evidence of a specific conspiracy at play, such person will be prone to believe that any other conspiracy theory must be true as well; in other word, such person must need to see a shrink; assumption: if someone believes that some UFOs are genuine Unidentified Flying Objects, such person must also be a flat earth believer, a big foot believer, and a fake moon landing believer and any other bad beliefs not worthy of the term theory anchored by beliefs with no evidence. Of course, that assumption is horse manure. The question acts as an attempt to eliminate the actual meaning of the term “conspiracy theory” and turn it into a curse phrase meant to demean and destroy anyone with an opposing position that may be based on genuine evidence. It’s the same lazy use of word in the way many interpret the term “UFO” as aliens as opposed to a genuine phenomena not yet fully answered. In your case the term “CONSPIRACY THEORY” is lazily interpreted as fanatical nutcases who believe in things based on faith alone; Sure these faith based believers exist; but as many genuine conspiracy theories come from people who based them on genuine evidence. And how do you call someone a “conspiracy theorist” as though it were someone locked into an indiscriminate deviant vocation? The suggestion is that such person is obsessed with any and all conspiracy theories whether they’re based on evidence or baseless. The term as used in the context of the question is truly a red herring.

Bailing out large corporations encourages risk-taking and over-expansion since they know that the government will bail them out if they get into trouble. If you go back to the crisis of 2008, you find that the loudest voices against the bailouts were conservatives. Even moderate Mitt Romney called for GM to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy (that’s reorganization rather than going out of business). But some centrist Republicans lead by President Bush joined with then-candidate Barack Obama and decided that allowing huge corporations to fail would be too disruptive to the economy. There was a risk of world-wide economic collapse so they bailed out the corporations. Student loan relief is in no way similar. On average, college students make more than the average worker and their degree is why they make more. Their college loan is an investment in their future. And, unlike the bailouts in 2008, no one is predicting that the economy will fail if we don’t bail out student debt.

But this so called social science is still not natural law based and objective. A real social science must be objective and natural law based, that is the goal for social science development. The modern “rationalism” is the only natural law based ideology by using objective methodology, which given a good start for the scientification of social science, which is much needed for human future on the verge of manmade social system after the WWII that need rational order to order this new social system for human to reach future. More explanations: Human is matter --- living matter, human society is composed of human individuals and groups, it is matter too. The developments, movement, interactions in a society and between societies are all matter movements. So social science is also study matter and its movements just like natural science. Though social science studied the living matter that has the natural laws directing their movements that are different from non-living matter. Living matter is in a higher complexity level existence, therefore the natural laws that directing its movements are also more complex. All matter and matter movements are fundamentally decided by thermodynamic processes and governed by thermodynamic laws. thermodynamic laws rule both living matter and non-living matter movements. For instances, the fundamental thermodynamic law of matter stay at the thermodynamically more stable state decides both non-ling matter existence and living matter existence. Though, for living matter, there is a different term to express this thermodynamically more stable state --- survival. All sciences are objective but no science can be subjective. Subjective “science” can be anything but not science. It is not the case you can subjectively say what you want while to be correct in scientific approach for social science issues. Social science is also governed by natural laws that require objective attitude just like in natural science. So, be prepared to back up every statement in social sciences with natural laws, direct or indirect evidences; just by giving interest arguments or moral arguments is not good enough: moral value is based on interest, but everyone have different interests, and interests intrinsically contradict each other. Therefore, moral arguments cannot solve any problem but add on the problems --- after all, interest only can be distributed according power distribution in peace time but only can be settled by force in war time. Human scientific activities cannot reach perfection but the trend is that natural science and social science are both developing towards objective, natural law abiding approaches. It is just natural science developed earlier and progressed quicker, though the social science is catching up fast due to the present lagged behind social science is causing social system and natural system destruction that is threatening human future. That caused the urgent need for us to upgrade our present social science to a new level to match the development level of the natural science. The unbalanced development is also caused by the interest concerns of people: natural science facilitates the exploitation of resources that give people the material power for their competition, therefore much advocated. But due to social science affects people’s interest in another direction --- tend to restrict it (for individual present material value consumption), people tend to suppress its development --- they don’t want that to change in their life time regardless what. Keeps following the old natural process, the rapidly progressing productivity just serving the total economic growth that will just destroy the social system and the natural supporting system in range and seal off human future. because that efficiency is just the material to material transformation efficiency that convert real value into use value, which is just the input section of the real efficiency that lead human into far future: real value – effective information efficiency which can be expressed as efficiency = real value --- use value --- effective information conversion. Real value --- use value conversion efficiency is needed but that section is still the input to produce the effective information to be a meaningful process otherwise it is just the material to material transformation closed cycle that doesn’t produce result but irreversibly consume real value for nothing. To achieve the real efficiency, real value --- use value conversion section have to be minimized while effective information output maximized. The subjective attitude towards social science plays a negative role in this process. It has to be changed; especially in economics, politics. Though socio-biology, sociology had made great progress under the leadership of great scientists in that fields, but the applications of these achievements into other social science disciplines are far too slow.

In reality, the world is a complex and interconnected system, and there is no single entity or group that completely controls it. Instead, power and influence are distributed across various actors and institutions. Some of the key players include: Governments: Nation-states exercise significant political power and influence over their citizens and global affairs through policies, diplomacy, and military capabilities.International Organizations: Organizations like the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Trade Organization (WTO) play essential roles in addressing global issues and coordinating international cooperation.Multinational Corporations: Large corporations wield considerable economic power and influence over global trade, finance, and industry.Financial Institutions: Central banks and private financial institutions have significant influence over global monetary and financial policies.Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): NGOs and non-profit organizations advocate for various causes, such as human rights, environmental protection, and humanitarian aid.Media and Technology Companies: Media conglomerates and technology giants influence public opinion and information dissemination on a global scale.Military Powers: Countries with strong military capabilities can impact global security and geopolitics.Supranational Bodies: Regional organizations like the European Union (EU) and regional alliances play crucial roles in shaping regional policies and international relations. It's important to note that power dynamics can be fluid and subject to change over time due to political, economic, technological, and social developments. Additionally, various global challenges, such as climate change, pandemics, and economic disparities, require cooperation and coordination among multiple stakeholders.

Even if the alien did pop up over dinner and skitter away, Star Trek ships have sophisticated internal sensors. The crew is not going to be picked off from the shadows while searching the ship by ones and twos. Hell, they have transporters - they could transport themselves out of danger or transport the alien directly into space. The fact that Star Trek races tend to use teleporters with bio-filters also means that ship-to-ship transmission of aliens is unlikely. I think Klingon Nostromo wins with considerably fewer casualties. What about the situation from Aliens? I can believe that the Xenomorphs could infest and overrun a Klingon colony. I also think that when the Klingon Colonial Marines show up, the technology gap is once again decisive. Disruptors, sensors, transporters - in the event that the Marines are overrun then they can be teleported out and the Bird of Prey in orbit sterilizes the site with photon torpedoes. And then they go looking for any other Xenomorphs. We do in fact have historical precedent for a genocidal Klingon campaign against another invasive species:"},{"prompt":"have breast cancer what is the best diet for me?","completion":"Keto diet no fruit or anything containing fructose including no sugar"},{"prompt":"What song has the lyrics someone left the cake out in the rain?","completion":"MacArthur Park, written and composed by Jimmy Webb.

In layman’s terms, a business analyst is the person who is an expert in analyzing the business growth activities. Business analysts have a clear understanding of the business requirements and their outcomes. Before implementing any condition or diving into the right decision, analysts do thorough research of the market condition. Now, let’s have a brief idea about the responsibilities business analysts possess:- Strategic management: This is the degree of analysis when a business analyst assesses and determines a company's strategic position. This is one of the most important levels because none of the subsequent phases will work properly until the evaluation is completed correctly. Analysis of business model: This level involves assessing the company's existing policies. This allows us to not just implement what's new, but also to double-check what's already been done. Designing the process: Business analysts, like artists, use their expertise to develop their imaginations. Modeling business processes is part of the stage, which is also known as designing and modeling. What does a business need:- As a business analyst, it is his primary role to determine what stakeholders demand and communicate these needs to developers, as well as to inform stakeholders of the developer's expectations. The ability to communicate effectively is a key quality for a business analyst in this position. Decision-making and problem-solving: The job of a business analyst entails everything from Decision-making to making choices in the most difficult of situations."},{"prompt":"it true that Vlad the Impaler is a national hero in Romania and, if so, why is that the case?","completion":"I’m not a Romanian national neither do I live in Romania, but I can tell you he was one of the most effective protectors of the Christian world at his age.

Here are a few ideas: 1. Exercise regularly: Lower back and core muscles can be strengthened to help with pain management and fight future recurrences. 2. Maintain good posture: Poor posture may make your lower back muscles painful. Straighten your lower back and keep your shoulders back, whether sitting or standing. 3. Use proper lifting techniques: When lifting something heavy, bend your knees and lift with your legs rather than your back. 4. Apply heat or cold: Your lower back can benefit from applying an ice pack or heating pad to reduce pain and inflammation. 5. Take over-the-counter pain relievers: Ibuprofen or acetaminophen are two painkillers that can assist. 6. See a healthcare professional: Consult a medical professional for a diagnosis and treatment plan if the pain is severe or lasts more than a few weeks. Remember that every person's experience with back pain is particular, and what helps one person may not help another. Finding what works best for you is crucial, and if your pain persists, you should consult a medical professional."},{"prompt":"Why does everyone hate Captain Marvel for squeezing that guy’s hand?

How can you simultaneously retain possession of Universalism heresy while also teaching the exact opposite in Vatican II and China?","completion":"It’s not just Catholic priests who can’t keep their BS straight … Protestant pastors have the same problem. Christian theology is a hopeless muddle, because it’s like trying to persuade people that the earth is flat. The facts just don’t add up and the “logic” makes no sense… God is “perfect in love” … except that he punishes human beings eternally for guessing wrong about which irrational earthly religion to believe. Such a God would, of course, be perfectly and infinitely evil.There was a perfect Garden of Eden which human beings ruined by eating the forbidden fruit … except that we now know trillions of animals suffered and died before human beings existed. Thus if anyone is responsible for suffering and death, it can only be the Creator, if such a being exists. And the Creator would understand this and would not blame his/her/its victims, if said being had a shred of decency.We know that adultery and homosexuality are sins because the Bible says so … except the Bible says it’s groovy to own slaves, for fathers to sell their daughters as sex slaves, etc. Who can rely on such an evil book for morals?And so on. The simple, obvious truth is that Christian priests and pastors of all stripes have been lying their asses off for 2,000 years about the Bible. The hole-y Bible was obviously written by primitive witch doctors who were clueless about how we got here, and whose concept of “godliness” was so far removed from actual love, mercy, compassion and justice that one blanches to read many Bible passages. Can a true religion be based on lies? As the writer of most of the New Testament, St. Paul, used to say, “Heaven forbid!” To correct the errors of Christianity would require junking the ludicrous Garden of Eden myth, “original sin,” the requirement to spill innocent blood for forgiveness, the need for a blood-drenched Savior, the nonsense about homosexuality being a “sin,” and the loopy nonsense about Satan, demons and “hell.” What would be left?

So many people around the world want to know “What is the net worth of Ratan Tata”? TATA Group is running 96 businesses and out of which 28 Companies are publicly listed on the various stock exchanges. Tata Group is world’s top 50 Group according to Market capitalization and Reputation.Have you ever thought of why Ratan Tata’s name is not in the list of billionaire’s club? Why Ratan Tata is not a billionaire on the Forbes magazine list of billionaire people of the world? The reason is that, TATA Group’s 96 companies are held by its main Company “TATA Sons” and the main owner of this TATA Sons is not Ratan Tata but various charitable organizations developed and run by TATA Group Out of which JRD TATA Trust & Sir Ratan Tata Trust are the main groups 65% ownership of TATA Sons which is the key holding company of the other 96 TATA Group Company is held by various charitable organizations So this 65% ownership of Tata Sons Limited is not reflected on Ratan Tata’s personal Financial Statement but on the various charitable organizations and this is the reason why Ratan Tata is not in the list of Billionaire club.

I understand in some cases Assembly beats even compiled code in c and c++, what happen under the hood that makes Assembly code run faster in certain situations?","completion":"If you have enough time, you can always find a way to write assembler code that is faster than what a compiler would have produced. But consider When was the last time your boss gave you enough time to write propper code (in whatever high-level language you were using)?Does it realy matter whether your code runs in 1.00 or 0.98 seconds? If you have enough time and that last few % matters, coding is assembly might make sense. But probably only for that small part of your code that is so very time-critical. And even then you should try all other options (better algorithm, faster high-level language, peephole-optimizing your HLL code, cache-friendliness) first. Note that on desktop hardware it rarely matters how fast your code is; it is the data access that slows your CPU down. Cache optimization is much more important than executable code optimization. And to finally answer the question: assembly offers you all the options the CPU offers. A compiler is designed to make a good choice in a relatively short time. If you know more and/or have a lot of time, maybe you can do better. But note the ‘maybe’. Just writing in assembly won’t magically make your code run faster. You’ll have to write very clever assembly to outsmart a modern compiler. And that is EXPENSIVE. But what does make sense is to keep an eye on the assembly the compiler produces. Even if you can’t read asembler, the general rule is ‘less insstructions is probably faster’.

Are they actually trained to take down threats? What weapons do they have?","completion":"Those are fully trained soldiers from crack regiments of the British Army. While some of the time they are wearing their ceremonial uniforms, the same soldiers will also be acting, in normal military khaki, as the regular guards on the same buildings. That is, when they are not duty overseas, including in war zones. One of the problems with an army is what to do with them when you are not fighting an existential war. If you are fighting something like WW2, of course everybody is headed towards the conflict. But even when you are, say, fighting in Afghanistan, you don’t expect troops to stay on duty indefinitely. They get rotates in, do a tour, then get rotated out. When they get back, they get some leave, of course. But then what to do with them? Training, of course. But training is expensive (and tiring), and you cannot expect to do it all the time. You can do sports, of course, and recruiting, and other diversions, but even these have some costs. So every military force needs some bullshit duties which will keep them working together, to keep the unit in place, but not to wear them out. And guard duty is quite a reasonable one. Both the pretty uniformed guard duty, and the behind the scenes guarding which they also do. Again, they don’t want to do too much of it, so they get rotated into and out of that. But it gives variety, an opportunity to wear a traditional and highly respected uniform. So those are real, fighting soldiers doing a light duty between real overseas tours, training etc."},{"prompt":"What is the procedure of all possible regression model selection techniques using Rsquare and MSE criteria? What are the advantages of one over the other?","completion":"They are both related with the same measure (the sum of squared errors). MSE is used to compare nested linear models through F tests. The determination coefficient should also be only used to compare nested linear models although some ignorant persons do compare non-nested models using it… The advantage of using MSE over the determination coeficient is that, if the model assumptions are verified the model selection is based on a statistical test that is analizing if adding a given variable to your model results in a significant reduction of the MSE. For this reason, comparing MSE through F tests tends to give you a more parsimonious model than a determination coeficient comparison procedure, which will tend to give you an over parametrized model. A model selection routine is an algorithm that can use any test or criteria based rule to compare and select nested models. Non-nested model comparisons are usually done recurring to criteria related with the likelihood of the sample given each model. One of the most commonly used is the Akaike criteria."},{"prompt":"Do I have to look directly into a laser pointer for it to hurt my eyes, or does it hurt my eye when I look where the laser is pointing?","completion":"The beam of the laser pointer is not spreading out, zero angle of spread, it's the same amount of power over the same tiny area, maybe 1sq mm, as when it left the pointer.

[math]E(x,y)[/math], or [math]xEy[/math], is interpreted as saying that there’s an edge between [math]x[/math] and [math]y[/math]. The first-order theory of graphs is the theory with no axioms using this language. (No axioms because graphs don’t need to satisfy anything. There may or may not be an edge between any two vertices, completely independently of any other edges.) A model of this theory is a graph. It can be finite, infinite, connected, disconnected, whatever. Now, suppose that [math]C[/math] is a sentence in this language asserting that the graph (model) is connected. Let’s add two constant symbols to our language, [math]u[/math] and [math]v[/math], which we will use to denote any two specific vertices in the graph. We can then construct a simple sentence [math]P_n[/math] asserting that there’s no path of length [math]n[/math] connecting [math]u[/math] and [math]v[/math]. For example, the sentence [math]P_0[/math] simply asserts that [math]une v[/math], while [math]P_3[/math] is the sentence [math]displaystyle lnot left(exists w_1 exists w_2, uEw_1land w_1Ew_2land w_2Evright)[/math] A model of a theory which includes this [math]P_3[/math] as an axiom must have two vertices whose distance is not [math]3[/math]. Such a model will interpret the constant symbols [math]u,v[/math] to be two such vertices, and the sentence [math]P_3[/math] will then be true in that interpretation, so indeed we have a model of the theory. Now consider the theory [math]T_infty[/math] with infinitely many axioms: [math]C,P_1,P_2,P_3,ldots[/math]. Is that theory consistent? Does it have a model? A model of this theory is a connected graph that needs to have two specific vertices which are distinct and have between them no path of length [math]1[/math], no path of length [math]2[/math], no path of length [math]3[/math] and so on – in fact they cannot have between them any path of any length. This can’t happen: in a connected graph, any two vertices have some path of some finite length connecting them. Without the axiom [math]C[/math] our theory would be fine: just pick a graph with some vertices and no edges. But since we included the “connectivity axiom” [math]C[/math], the theory [math]T_infty[/math] became inconsistent and has no models. Ok, so what? The thing is, this contradicts the [LINKED_TEXT: compactness theorem] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactness_theorem?wprov=sfti1]. Any finite set of axioms of [math]T_infty[/math] does have a model, simply taking a graph with two vertices that are sufficiently far apart (the shortest path between them is longer than the highest [math]P_n[/math] axiom included in the theory). A simple path graph of sufficient length would do fine. So [math]T_infty[/math] is an inconsistent theory whose finite subtheories are all consistent. This is a contradiction, showing that the axiom [math]C[/math] cannot exist.

In this answer, we will explore the factors that should be considered when evaluating whether or not it is worth it to invest in cryptocurrencies, including potential returns, risks, and alternative investment options. Section 1: Potential Returns One of the main reasons that investors consider cryptocurrencies is the potential for high returns. While past performance does not guarantee future results, some cryptocurrencies have experienced significant growth in value in recent years. Bitcoin, for example, has seen its value increase from just a few cents to over 60,000 per coin at its peak. Other cryptocurrencies have also experienced similar growth, although the volatility of the market means that there is no guarantee of continued growth. Section 2: Risks Investing in cryptocurrencies also carries significant risks that should be carefully considered. Some of the key risks include: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price volatility, which can result in significant losses as well as gains.Security: Cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets can be vulnerable to hacking and theft, which can result in the loss of investments.Regulation: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and changes in regulations could impact the value of investments.Lack of intrinsic value: Unlike traditional investments such as stocks and bonds, cryptocurrencies do not have intrinsic value and their value is based solely on market demand. Section 3: Alternative Investment Options Investors should also consider alternative investment options when evaluating whether or not it is worth it to invest in cryptocurrencies. Some potential alternative investments include: Traditional stocks and bonds: Traditional investments such as stocks and bonds can offer more stable returns and lower volatility compared to cryptocurrencies.Real estate: Real estate investments can offer both potential capital appreciation and rental income.Precious metals: Precious metals such as gold and silver can serve as a store of value and potential hedge against inflation. Section 4: Conclusion In conclusion, whether or not it is worth it to invest in cryptocurrencies depends on individual circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance. While cryptocurrencies have the potential for high returns, they also carry significant risks and should be carefully evaluated alongside alternative investment options. Investors should conduct thorough research and seek professional advice before making any investment decisions.

Here are some factors that may contribute to this trend: Social media and technology: Social media and technology have become ubiquitous in the lives of younger generations. While they can provide many benefits, such as connection and information sharing, they can also contribute to feelings of isolation, comparison, and pressure to maintain a certain image or lifestyle.Economic uncertainty: Many younger people face economic uncertainty and instability, with high levels of student debt, a challenging job market, and increasing costs of living. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and depression.Cultural values: There may be cultural values or expectations that contribute to stress and pressure, such as a focus on achievement, perfectionism, or the pressure to constantly be productive and successful.Trauma and adverse experiences: Younger generations may have experienced more trauma or adverse experiences, such as bullying, discrimination, or violence, which can contribute to mental health issues.Stigma around mental health: While there has been progress in reducing stigma around mental health issues, there is still a significant amount of shame and stigma associated with seeking help for mental health issues. This can prevent individuals from seeking treatment or support, exacerbating their symptoms. It is important to note that depression and mental health issues are complex and multifaceted, and there is no single cause or solution.

Marble commonly has veining while granite has more bit like, granular appearance yet it can't be expressed when in doubt. In light of its arrangement, common stone has two general classifications: Siliceous stone is made basically out of silica, or quartz-like particles. It has a tendency to be exceptionally solid and simple to clean. Stones in this classification are granite, slate and sandstone. Calcareous stone is made of primarily calcium carbonate. It's delicate to acids, including cleaning items and sustenances like citrus natural products, vinegar, wine, tomatoes, and so forth. It requires distinctive cleaning methods than siliceous stone. These kinds of stones incorporate marble, travertine, limestone, and onyx. Granite is a volcanic shake, which implies it was once liquid and framed as it cooled profound inside the earth. The minerals contained in granite typically show up as little specks all through the stone. Marble, then again, was once limestone that changed because of extreme warmth and weight. This procedure adjusted its crystalline structure and presented different minerals, which create its trademark veining. Both marble and granite are hard, overwhelming, generally warmth and singe verification, and arrive in a wide cluster of hues and examples. Since both are made in nature, there can be intense varieties in shading and example. In the two cases, a showcase test you find in-store may not be a precise portrayal of your real buy. (So make sure to see your chunks face to face, regardless of which material you select.) Both stones can be recolored by slick or seriously shaded nourishments, so both require fixing now and again (ordinarily once every year.)

Right to freedom of religionThe article 25 of Indian Constitution grants freedom to every Indian citizen to profess, practice and propagate his own religion. Just like every other Indian citizen, Mr.Modi has the right to practice his religion. So unless the Indian Army has a problem with Mr.Modi celebrating Diwali with them, I don’t think there’s any valid reason he should refrain from celebrating it with the Army. Now talking about secularism, India is a secular country. Secularism as defined by Donald Eugene Smith,“The secular state is a state which guarantees individual and corporate freedom of religion, deals with the individual as a citizen irrespective of his religion, is not constitutionally connected to a particular, nor does it seek either to promote or interfere with religion.” Celebrating a festival of a religion that a Prime Minister of a country practices, in no way affects the secularism of the nation. Even if tomorrow, a Christian or a Muslim or a person from some other religion becomes a Prime Minister and celebrates a festival with the Indian Army, will it affect the secular definition of India? Absolutely not."},{"prompt":"Does it save in heating costs to have the central furnace fan blowing all the time to circulate heated air, even during periods when the furnace has cycledoff?","completion":"Depends.

It involves various factors and elements that can be controlled and modified within the website itself.

I understand the historical reasons for an electoral college but communication systems are now much better!","completion":"If you read all the existing answers to this question, I think the pattern very clear: Conservatives tend to like the Electoral College the way it is now. Why? Because it gives them more power. Twice in the last 20 years, which is 2 out of 5 elections, a Republican who lost the popular vote became president anyway. Electoral College supporters will come up with lots of arguments about the historical purpose of the electoral system and how it protects the interests of the “minority,” rural voters. Mind you conservatives normally have deep destain for “special” protections for minorities, and for collectivist assessments of interests. That is, they hate those sorts of assessments, except in this one case where “minority” refers to them and collectivism refers to their people vs the people of New York and California, who would be “too powerful” if voting was the right and duty of individuals, the way that most in Earth understand democracy to be. In this one special case, disregarding individual agency to subtract power from a majority group (“Californians”) to give to a minority interest (them) is totally ok. More Americans dislike the way the electoral college is now and want to change it. Why do most Americans dislike the electoral college? Well, first of all, most Americans live in places that are hurt by it, although most people use different assessments for forming their opinion. It seems intuitively unfair to have the minority control the government regardless of their performance: in a democracy we’re supposed to be able to remove leaders who are disregarding the interests of the majority or doing a bad job. It seems counter-democratic to allow one party to entrench their power on so many levels even when the majority of citizens have turned against them. Support for the Electoral College ticked up notably in late 2016 Leading up to the 2016 election, polls showed that about 75 percent of Americans wanted to abolish the Electoral College because it just doesn’t seem fair or right anymore. A few months after the election, when Donald Trump became president despite losing the popular vote, about 46 percent of Americans decided they wanted to keep the Electoral College after all—close to the same amount that voted for Trump. And lots of brand new defenses of the Electoral College started circulating. Coincidence? If you’re willing to believe it is, I have a wall to sell you."},{"prompt":"Should I eat McDonald's or Burger King?","completion":"Neither their rubbish is highly comparible…… rubbish blatantly disguised as food ."},{"prompt":"VS Code better than VIM or Emacs?","completion":"I'm designing the universal [LINKED_TEXT: framework.as] [URL: http://framework.as/] it develops I'll keep you up to date."},{"prompt":"As a police officer, have you ever responded to a call and once you got there said to yourself, “Nope, not worth it” and just left?","completion":"As a police officer I cannot just decide that I’m not going to respond to a call, it’s called dereliction of duty.

Though an individual ageing between 25-35 years will obtain the maximum points under age factor. Nonetheless, it never outlines that an older applicant cannot apply and get selected. With relevant years of skilled work experience, high language skills (English or French) and higher education level, you as an aspiring immigrant may grab more points. With better points on other factors, you can also compensate for the points you lose under age factor for economic immigration. At the age of 45, your chances of successfully moving to Canada via any Express Entry program largely depends on your overall Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score. This score is awarded on the basis of key factors which includes age as well. If you successfully meet the minimum CRS score requirement as per individual Express Entry draws, you will get an invitation to apply for Canada PR. But, there is no one who can guarantee you about receiving an ITA and a PR approval either via the Express Entry system, PNP or any economic immigration program. The Canadian PR application process is highly competitive, and a regular updation happens with regards to the application process, protocols and requirements. Thus, the final decision is at the discretion of the Federal Government of Canada. However, there are a lot of options through which you may boost your overall CRS score. To know about such options, go through the points listed below. Improving language Score A language proficiency score is among key factors in any immigration file under economic immigration categories. It is imperative for you to score minimum required points. But, when we talk about compensating for your age factor points, then you must aim to score CLB 9-10 in all four sections and score maximum points. For this, you may opt for an online IELTS coaching, because an improvement of a few points can get you closer to the cut off requirement and obtain an ITA for Canada PR. To add further, if you are bilingual, then you can also appear for French exam and claim up to 30 points. Education Assessment Education is a high valued factor under Canada's CRS. If you are inside the Express Entry pool with an ECA (Education Assessment Report) report, then your score will improve drastically. You can gain up to 200 points for your ECA report, including 150 under core human capital and 50 in combination with Canadian work experience or language ability. Additionally, if you obtain an additional education like, a degree, certificate, PhD, etc. which is assessed, then you can gain more points. PN nomination If you apply for and successfully obtain a provincial nomination, then you will get additional 600 points for your nomination. These points will be eventually added to your overall CRS score and will virtually guarantees you to obtain an invitation to apply in upcoming Express Entry draw. There are a lot of Provincial Nominee Programs that run Express Entry-aligned \\"Enhanced\\" PNP streams. Through such streams, the provinces select and invite eligible candidates for provincial nomination even with a CRS score of as low as 300-400 points. Considering Spouse Factors You can score points under Spouse or common-law factors on the basis of their education level, age, language skills and work experience. Thus, you must include your skilled spouse (if any) in your application. For your partner's language proficiency, you can claim up to 20 points, up to 10 points for Canadian work experience and up to 10 points for education level. Before working upon these factors, you must find out the right pathway for Canada immigration. For this, you may book a free profile assessment, [LINKED_TEXT: today] [URL: https://www.visasavenue.com/application-form/]."},{"prompt":"Why did Talaat Pasha order the Armenian genocide?

Consider that Clinton won nearly 3 million more popular votes than Trump, suggesting that nationally she was well positioned to win a major victory. Yet the small but significant shift away from her in states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida handed the election to her opponent. We have to remember that this wasn’t because Trump became more popular, but that Clinton encountered some real road blocks in the last weeks of the campaign which hurt her with voters. People who decry polling now have a point in that the commentators talking about the polling made it seem like there was no way Trump could win, but the actual polling didn’t say he couldn’t win. That’s the mistake they are making by saying polls are “fake.” It wasn’t really that the analysis was completely off, but that they were a snapshot of various points in the campaign when, if held at that moment with the scenario playing out, Clinton would have become president. I think pollsters and pundits will be a bit more careful this time around to let people know, as not enough did last time, that a 30% chance is still a possible path to victory under the right circumstances. It means that 30% of the time in all scenarios, winning is possible.

If there is not failure, then the degrees of those who pass mean next to nothing. The Army taught me this. Getting through basic training was an achievement because not all could do it. “No Child Left Behind” has tuned into no adult left behind and now the typical college degree in 2022 is not worth much. A second stupid notion is that it is the responsibility of the institution to pass the students even when they are not competent. The tail end of the self-esteem movement, coupled with the Woke culture’s focus on systemic institutional unfairness, has crippled public education. And finally, the business model has also contributed to the shit show. If you have a tough academic standard at a college, the students bitch and moan and they threaten to go somewhere else.

What's your story?","completion":"My journey to the San Francisco Bay Area began with the early days of Oracle in 1988. That’s Larry Ellison above celebrating Oracle’s anniversary some years earlier. Somewhere around 1986, Oracle founder Larry Ellison determined to tap into the burgeoning financial application software business and began development of Oracle Financials on top of the Oracle Relational Database (RDBMS). The launch strategy was to recruit the most productive sales talent from the entrenched competitors with attractive compensation plans. As was Larry’s modus operandi; you hire capable people and just plunge ahead, because capable people can figure it out. So when I arrived for my first day at the Oracle San Francisco office on Spear Street, there was no human resources representative to assist in my orientation - just a receptionist that instructed me to find an empty cubicle and call corporate for credentials to use my DEC VT100 “green screen” character mode terminal. Now this was a sobering experience for me; as in my prior financial application software sales role, I had a private office with administrative support (secretarial). I also had access to the Dun & Bradstreet fleet of Gulfstream and Falcon jets for high ticket prospective customer sales activities like customer site visits. I was reeling: What had I done? No amount of warm sourdough bread, clanging of cable car bells or foghorns in the evening mists could possibly compensate for this mistake in judgment. I had somehow landed in the corporate equivalent of [LINKED_TEXT: The Island of Dr. Moreau] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Island_of_Dr._Moreau_(1996_film)].

Out of despair, I asked the regional vice president if I couldn’t get a more stable office situation. The VP responded rather dryly that I should sell some of the brand new Oracle Financials and then they would work on a more permanent solution. Should I fail to land any sales, there was simply no need for an office.

Optimal blood sugar levels are essential for sustained energy, stable mood, and prevention of chronic conditions like diabetes. However, in today's fast-paced world, maintaining balanced blood sugar levels has become increasingly challenging. This article aims to expose effective strategies for blood sugar optimization that can lead to improved health outcomes and a higher quality of life. 1. The Impact of Imbalanced Blood Sugar Imbalanced blood sugar levels can have far-reaching consequences for our health. Elevated blood sugar, commonly associated with diabetes, can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, and nerve damage. On the other hand, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can cause symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, confusion, and, in severe cases, loss of consciousness. Achieving optimal blood sugar levels is crucial for maintaining a healthy body and mind. 2. Nourishing Diet for Blood Sugar Balance One of the primary factors influencing blood sugar levels is the food we consume. A nourishing diet that promotes blood sugar balance includes: a. Complex Carbohydrates: Emphasize whole grains, legumes, and vegetables that release glucose slowly, preventing sudden spikes in blood sugar. b. Healthy Fats: Incorporate sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, as they aid in slowing down digestion and preventing blood sugar fluctuations. c. Lean Proteins: Include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, and plant-based protein sources like tofu and tempeh, as they promote satiety and stabilize blood sugar levels. d. Fiber-Rich Foods: Opt for fiber-rich options like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans, as they slow down the absorption of glucose and contribute to sustained blood sugar levels. e. Balanced Meals: Focus on well-rounded meals that combine carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in appropriate proportions, providing a steady release of energy and preventing blood sugar spikes. 3. Mindful Eating Practices Practicing mindfulness during meals can significantly impact blood sugar optimization. By eating slowly, chewing thoroughly, and savoring each bite, we give our bodies ample time to register feelings of fullness, preventing overeating and excessive blood sugar elevation. Additionally, mindful eating can reduce stress, which is known to affect blood sugar levels negatively. 4. Regular Physical Activity Engaging in regular physical activity is crucial for blood sugar optimization. Exercise helps to lower blood sugar levels by increasing insulin sensitivity, allowing cells to better absorb glucose for energy. Both aerobic exercises (such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling) and resistance training have shown positive effects on blood sugar control. Incorporating at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week is recommended for optimal results. 5. Stress Management and Sleep Chronic stress and inadequate sleep can disrupt blood sugar regulation. High-stress levels trigger the release of stress hormones, such as cortisol, which can elevate blood sugar. Implementing stress management techniques like meditation, yoga, deep breathing exercises, and adequate sleep hygiene can promote blood sugar balance and overall well-being. 6. Regular Blood Sugar Monitoring Monitoring blood sugar levels regularly is essential for understanding how our bodies respond to various foods, activities, and lifestyle choices. Blood glucose meters and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) allow individuals to track their blood sugar levels throughout the day, empowering them to make informed decisions about their diet and lifestyle. Conclusion Achieving and maintaining optimal blood sugar levels is vital for overall health and well-being. By following a nourishing diet, practicing mindful eating, engaging in regular physical activity, managing stress, and monitoring blood sugar levels, individuals can take proactive steps towards blood sugar optimization. By implementing these strategies, individuals can experience improved energy levels, stable moods, and a reduced risk of developing chronic conditions like diabetes.

Differently from Victorian style, whom has been contextualised, romanticised, and its still popular and the aesthetic was and is still popular and favoured.Usually, to reform/fix such buildings, you’d have to get an architect specialised on vast openings and halls, which might make the price of such repairs skyrocket. That was my personal opinion and views about it, an heretic in the matter of architecture, defending why I don’t like it."},{"prompt":"What is the most compelling evidence for the existence of the Loch Ness Monster?","completion":"The most compelling evidence is the testimony of Alex Campbell, the water bailiff (i.e. a sort of gamekeeper) who was of course familiar with both the loch and its wildlife. This is much more believable than the perceptions of visitors unfamiliar with both. He said he had seen the creature on several occasions. This was supported by local residents near the water who agreed they had seen similar, which they believed to be a large creature. [LINKED_TEXT: AlexCampbell] [URL: http://lochnessinvestigation.com/alexcampbell.htm] He actually is the person who said it reminded him of a plesiosaur, which the media (early on newspapers, later TV interviews) widely reported. There is no other evidence for a plesiosaur other than his comparison. However, he also made money by writing in the press in a somewhat sensational way, and enjoyed his fame for decades. If you doubt his word or perception, then most other reports from apparently less capable people also come into doubt.

My mom tried every single thing but no, little me just didn't really think that brushing one's teeth was of any importance (I know, I know. GROSS!) I used to lie every morning that I brushed my teeth whenever my mom asked about it. One look at my teeth could tell anyone that I do not brush my teeth. You could not make me brush my teeth even on gun point. (CRINGE) So a few years back, we were going to attend a family wedding. Most of our relatives were at our house and we were all getting ready to go to the Marriage spot from our home together. So imagine me getting all dolled up. Wearing a fancy dress that I made my parents buy for me. I was literally glowing in joy. But to my misfortune, my teeth weren't glowing - nope, not at all. Imagine me in a room full of my relatives all chatting away. I smile up at my dad and you know what he says? “Your teeth look gross. Why don't you brush them like your mother tells you to??” he said all of this with such non chalance like he didn't even notice that he said all that in a room full of my adult cousins and elderly aunts and uncles. I literally cried so much and didn't not speak to my father after that for 3 days. (I am such a brat) He eventually apologized that he shouldn't have said that in front of all the guests but he still says that he doesn't regret it. You know why he doesn't regret it? Because I have never skipped brushing my teeth ever since. I even bought a mouth wash with my own money. Alway keep some mints along with me to freshen up my breath after a meal. And always make sure that nothing is stuck between my teeth. My dad is so smug about this event. My God, I WAS SO EMBARRASSED!!!

This is a timeline I have created of the greatest fastball pitchers, starting from the very beginning. After the timeline there are two rankings of the all-time greatest fastballers. Fans of the fastest fastballs will want to keep an eye out for the account of an umpire who thought he was losing his mind when he saw a legendary fireballer’s fastballs “exploding” … until an opthamologist explained the physics involved. Can you guess the pitcher? And please be sure to check out the 1927 entry for the legendary Satchel Paige, who was the fastest pitcher of them all according to renowned experts like Bob Feller, Dizzy Dean, Joe DiMaggio and Hack Wilson. HIGH HEAT: A FASTBALL TIMELINEby Michael R. Burch The figures in parens are the pitchers’ career strikeouts per nine innings, abbreviated K/9. I have bolded the leaps in K/9 to make them easier to spot. 1859: Jim Creighton of the Niagara Club throws his rising speed pitch against the Star Club of Brooklyn. There are no official stats yet, but Creighton is the first professional baseball superstar, both on the mound and at the plate. His pitches are so much faster than anyone else’s that he’s accused of cheating! Creighton is said to have an \\"unhittable delivery\\" and money is passed under the table to acquire his services. 1860: Jim Creighton throws baseball’s first recorded shutout on November 8, 1860. The “need for speed” to counter opponents’ hitting can be traced back to 1859-1860 and this revolutionary pitcher. And speaking of “revolutions,” to my knowledge Creighton was the first pitcher known to put spin on the ball to make it harder to hit. Was this because he was an accomplished cricket bowler as well? In any case, Creighton also started the first recorded triple play, on September 22, 1860. 1861: Jim Creighton’s team, the Brooklyn Excelsiors, sit out the season due to the Civil War! 1862: Jim Creighton dies at age 21 after a game in which he pitched and hit four doubles and a home run. He allegedly told a teammate that he heard something “snap” when he hit the homer, then died from abdominal hemorrhaging, perhaps due to a ruptured inguinal hernia. However, there are other accounts and we may never know exactly what happened. We do know that Creighton began hemorrhaging shortly after a baseball game and died a few days later. He was baseball’s first superstar. 1867: Candy Cummings throws the first curveball. He would need it, since he weighed only 120 pounds! 1867: The birth of Cy Young, baseball's all-time winningest pitcher. 1871: Official pitching statistics are recorded for the first time. 1871: Asa Brainard (.3) may be the source of our term “ace” for top-flight pitchers. He was called “Acey,” presumably due to the near-rhyme with his first name. Over time the “y” was dropped. Or so the story goes. But the term “ace” outside baseball goes back to Old French and Middle English, circa 1300, and has to do with the #1 on dice and cards, I believe. So perhaps not. 1871: George Zettlein (.6) is said to have thrown 80 mph, although I’m not sure how that was determined back then. He was the MLB leader with a 2.73 ERA and 161 ERA+ in 1871. 1871: The major league debut of Al Spalding (.8), who would later found the famous sporting goods company. Spalding would average nearly 42 wins for six seasons with a 2.13 ERA, and often outscored the other team himself (he averaged 164 runs scored per 162 games), but seldom struck anyone out (unless the records are incomplete). 1875: Al Spalding has baseball's greatest pitching season to date: 54-5 with a 1.59 ERA and 14.2 WAR. 1875: William Fisher, a black “professional pitcher” for the Chicago Unique, is hired by the white Winona, Minn. club. However, the early superstar Cap Anson will refuse to take the field with colored players and MLB’s notorious color barrier will soon be erected, robbing fans of the right to see Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth hit against the best black pitchers. 1875: The debut of Jim Devlin, whose 150 ERA+ is the seventh-best of all time. Devlin has been credited with inventing the “drop pitch” or sinker. However, Devlin was banned for life after his age 25 season due to game-fixing charges, which he admitted. 1876: Al Spalding retires in his prime, opens a sporting goods store, and creates the first \\"official\\" baseball. To show how long ago this was, in 1876 the flamboyant George Armstrong Custer was defeated and killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. 1879: John Ward (3.4) is MLB’s first official strikeout leader for a single season with 239 in 587 innings. 1883: Old Hoss Radbourn (3.6) registers 315 strikeouts in a single season, but it takes him 632 innings to do it! 1883: Jim Whitney (4.0) cracks the 300 strikeout barrier in 1883 and has successive K/9 seasons of 6.0 and 7.2, which are “crazy high” for his day. Until… 1884: Hugh Daily (5.4) has 483 strikeouts in 500 innings and is the new strikeout king with an 8.7 K/9 for two successive seasons. This would be the single-season high K/9 for 71 years, until Herb Score in 1955. However, there was a crazy upswing in strikeouts in 1883-1884, so I believe there was some factor other than pitchers throwing 100 mph for two years, then suddenly all losing their heaters at the same time! Yes, call me a skeptic here. And it turns out that I was correct, because up until 1882 pitchers were forced to throw underhanded. William Doyle in the comments explained: “To add some insight into the increase in SO in 1883-84, in 1882 the rule was changed to allow pitchers to deliver the ball from above the waist. Seems it took hitters a couple years to catch up. Relative, too, is the fact that the pitching distance remained at 50 feet. The change in pitches from UH to OH at 50 feet had to be overwhelming, no matter what the actual speed was. 1884: Moses Fleetwood Walker becomes the first “official” African-American player in the majors on May 1, 1884. He would be joined by his brother Weldy Wilberforce Walker, but their stay in the majors would be brief, due to racism. 1885: Toad Ramsey (6.5) has the highest career K/9 for his era, as far as I can tell, but he didn’t have as high a K/9 peak as Hugh Daily. 1886: Matt Kilroy (4.3) has 513 strikeouts in 583 innings. Kilroy was here! Toad Ramsey has 499 strikeouts in 588 innings. 1887: The first strike zone definition. Three strikes and you're out, even if you don't swing! 1887: Mighty Dan Casey struck out in a game with the Giants, perhaps inspiring the famous poem \\"Casey at the Bat\\"? The poem was published in 1888, so perhaps so. 1888: Silver King (3.5) wins 45 games with a 1.64 ERA. 1890: The major league debut of Cy Young, with “Cy” being short for “Cyclone” because his fastball sounded like an approaching twister. 1891: Amos Rusie (4.6) has his highest single-season K/9 with 6.1. 1893: Amos Rusie’s fastball was the reason the pitcher’s mound was moved back in 1893, as explained by David Siglin in the comments: “Which pitcher had the most effective fastball in MLB history?” There is only one such pitcher — the one whose fastball was the direct cause of changing the course of professional baseball forever. Just as Babe Ruth changed baseball, so did Amos Rusie. To quote my book, Baseball’s Best — Comparing Over 1000 Players In Their Primes, 1893–2019: “Amos Rusie, known as the Hoosier Thunderbolt, was scaring the bejeezus out of batters with his blazing fastball, and not without cause. His fastball put John McGraw into a coma for three days, and pleas from the players forced baseball to move the pitcher back from 50′ [the line his front foot could not cross] to 60′6” [the rubber from which he strode] in 1893. This was the beginning of the modern game of baseball as we know it.” It effectively moved the pitcher back about 6 feet, depending on the length of his stride. You can’t get more effective than that. Lovers of baseball arcana will be interested to know that the mound was supposed to be moved back to 60′0″ but the last zero looked like a six! 1904: Ed Walsh (5.3) is a rookie in 1904. He will finish his career with an MLB record 1.82 ERA for qualified pitchers. 1904: Doc White (4.1 with a high of 5.4) pitches five consecutive shutouts, which remains the record more than a century later and is a mortal lock never to be broken. 1904: Rube Waddell (7.0) has 349 strikeouts, still a record for an AL left-hander. His career 7.0 K/9 will be the highwater mark for an MLB pitcher for more than half a century. 1910: Walter Johnson (5.3) has his best K/9 rate (7.6) at age 22. \\"He throws so fast you can't see 'em,\\" according to the scout who discovered the Big Train in 1907, \\"and he knows where he’s throwing, because if he didn't there would be dead bodies strewn all over Idaho.\\" However, as I create this timeline the great Walter Johnson is about to drop out of the top 500 in the K/9 rankings! How fast did he throw? In 1917 his fastball was tested at 95.4 mph, which sounds about right to me. If he was throwing 100+ mph, the Big Train would have had a higher K/9 rate. Also, as Steve Foman noted, in the Netflix documentary Fastball, modern researchers determined that Johnson did not throw above the low to mid 90s. 1911: Rube Marquard (4.3) has his best K/9 rate (7.7) at age 24. 1912: Smoky Joe Wood (6.2) goes 34-5 at age 22. His peak season (7.6) for K/9 would be the following year and tie Walter Johnson’s. But the Big Train said himself that no one threw faster than Smoky Joe, who was given his nickname because his heater made the air sizzle like it had been set on fire! Smoky Joe still has the fifth-best ERA of all time. At this point, I think we’re seeing a trend develop. Apparently the young fireballers threw so many innings that they peaked around age 22 to 24. 1920: Joe “Bullet” Rogan (5.5) debuts with the legendary Homestead Grays. Rogan’s fastball was incredibly effective: his 161 ERA+ is the third-best of all time. Rogan was also a great hitter with a .338 career batting average. Casey Stengel called Rogan \\"one of the best—if not the best—pitcher that ever lived.\\" Rogan’s teammate George Carr said: “Rogan was the greatest pitcher that ever threw a ball. … Don't think Rogan was nicknamed ‘Bullet’ for nothing. That guy had a ball that was almost too fast to catch. He would really burn 'em in there.” Estimated fastball speeds 1871-1920: Christy Mathewson (90 mph), Ed Walsh (92 mph), Walter Johnson (95 mph), Bullet Rogan, Rube Waddell and Smoky Joe Wood (95+ mph). 1923: Bill Foster (5.5) debuts with the Chicago American Giants of the Negro Leagues. His 164 ERA+ is the second-highest of all time. In addition to a great fastball, Foster threw a slider, changeup, overhand curve and sidearm curve. 1924: Dazzy Vance (6.2) leads the league in strikeouts with 262 with his best K/9 rate (7.6) in his third full season. 1926: Lefty Grove (5.2) has his best K/9 season (6.8) in his second year, continuing the trend. 1927: Satchel Paige (7.7) begins pitching in the Negro Leagues. Despite not pitching in the majors until age 41, he would still have a K/9 around 6-7 for three years. Satchel Paige may have been the greatest baseball pitcher of all time. He pitched in the Negro Leagues for most of his career, then was a major league baseball All-Star at ages 45 and 46! Joe Posnanski pronounced Paige the hardest thrower in baseball history, citing these quotes: \\"Joe DiMaggio would say that Paige was the best he ever faced. Bob Feller would say that Paige was the best he ever saw. Hack Wilson would say that the ball looked like a marble when it crossed the plate. Dizzy Dean would say that Paige’s fastball made his own look like a changeup.\\" 1930s: George Blaeholder has been credited with the development of the slider in the early 1930s. George Uhle, a contemporary of Blaeholder, claimed to have come up with the term “slider” for his sailing fastball. 1936: Bob Feller (6.1) begins his MLB career with K/9 seasons of 11.0 and 9.1, in part-time action, despite being just 19 years old in 1936. His K/9 rate would stay in the 7-8 range until age 27, but he spent three years in the military during WWII, so his arm was probably only 24! Bob Feller’s nicknames were Rapid Robert and The Heater from Van Meter. 1941: Virgil Trucks (5.1 with a high of 6.1) is a rookie. Estimated fastball speeds 1920-1950: Lefty Grove and Dazzy Vance (95 mph), Bob Feller and Satchel Paige (95+ mph). Call me a skeptic, but I do not trust the screwy motorcycle test that has been used to claim that Feller threw a pitch 107.6 mph. 1954: Ryne Duren (9.6) is a rookie. He will have six seasons with a 10.0 K/9 or higher. Duren had a blazing fastball, wore super-thick glasses, and had control problems, so he was a terrifying figure on the mound. His manager Casey Stengel observed: “I would not admire hitting against Ryne Duren, because if he ever hit you in the head you might be in the past tense.” 1954: “Bullet” Bob Turley (6.6 with a high of 7.8) was said to have thrown a 103.2 mph pitch in 1954. 1955: Herb Score (9.6 before injuries) leads the AL in strikeouts and sets a new K/9 season record (9.7) as freakin’ rookie! Paul Karp related this interesting account in the comments: “I played golf with Yogi Berra one time. I asked who was the toughest pitcher he ever faced and he said Herb Score was the fastest and toughest to hit until Herb got hit directly in the eye by a line drive. Score was never the same after that.” 1960: Steve Barber (5.9 with a peak of 7.2) is a rookie with the Baltimore Orioles. According to Warren Corbett, Barber was “anointed as the majors’ fastest pitcher before he appeared in a regular-season game.” But he was wild: in the minors he struck out a batter per inning and issued walks at a similar rate. A photographer for This Week had been given an assignment to find the fastest fastball. Mickey Mantle and Bill Skowron suggested Barber. The photographer used a high-speed movie camera to time six MLB speed demons. Barber clocked 95.55 mph, faster than Don Drysdale (who also topped 95), Sandy Koufax, Ryne Duren, Herb Score and Bob Turley. Barber was suggested by Christopher Hahin in the comments. 1960: Don Drysdale (6.2) leads the NL in strikeouts and has his highest K/9 season (8.2). He was tested at 99.8 mph in the spring of 1960 by using a camera and counting frames to determine his fastball’s speed. So which measurement was more accurate? Did Don Drysdale throw 95 mph or 100 mph? I am inclined to go with the 95-96 mph measurement for two reasons: (1) the K/9 rates of the pitchers tested correspond better to other 95-mph pitchers than to known 100-mph pitchers like Nolan Ryan; (2) we know that average fastball velocities have been rising for decades, and we are at a point in time that predates widespread 100-mph pitchers. They are coming, but it’s still a bit early. 1962: Dick Radatz (9.8) has three consecutive years with a K/9 above 10, with a high of 11. Mickey Mantle called Radatz a “monster” and struggled to make contact with his heater. 1965: Sandy Koufax (9.3) has 383 strikeouts with a 10.2 K/9 that would be a new best for a full season for a starter, except for a young gun… 1965: “Sudden” Sam McDowell (8.9), as a 22-year-old rookie, leads the AL with 325 strikeouts and a breathtaking (for that time) 10.7 K/9. 1964: Dean Chance (6.4 with a high of 7.2) is almost unhittable with a 1.65 ERA, 200 ERA+ and 11 shutouts, seven by a 1-0 score! Mickey Mantle said he wanted to throw up when he saw Chance was pitching. The Yankees got one run in 50 innings off Chance in 1964. He was suggested by John in the comments. 1968: Bob Gibson (7.2) has a 1.12 ERA in the “year of the pitcher.” 1968: Denny McLain (6.1 with a peak of 7.8) had a 31-6 record and was the last MLB pitcher to win 30 games. He had a 1.96 earned run average, 280 strikeouts and just 63 walks, giving him a 4.44 K:BB ratio, a Tigers season record that stood until 2016, when it was eclipsed by Justin Verlander. He was suggested by Hank Bennett in the comments. 1969: The former cellar-dwelling New York Mets become the “Amazing Mets” with young fireballers Nolan Ryan (9.3), Tom Seaver (who would peak at 9.1), Tug McGraw (8.3), Jerry Koosman (6.7), Jim McAndrew (6.0) and Gary Gentry (5.9). Was this the greatest collection of strikeout artists up to this point in MLB history? Is it still the best, relative to its era? Please let me know what you think in the comments. I can’t think of a better staff for strikeouts relative to its era. 1971: Tom Seaver (6.8) leads the NL in strikeouts with 289 and has his highest K/9 season (9.1). 1972: Steve Carlton (7.1) is 27-10 for a woeful last-place Phillies team. He will finish fourth all-time in strikeouts with 4,136. 1973: Nolan Ryan (9.5) has 383 strikeouts and his highest K/9 season (10.6). He will go on to record a record seven no-hitters and destroy the all-time MLB career strikeout record, finishing with 5,714. Nigyl Nissan shared this account in the comments: “First of all, well done Mike! Great resource for any baseball fan. Just wanted to add my two cents. I remember reading a Ron Luciano book — don’t recall which one (may have been The Umpire Strikes Back) where he describes the “exploding fast ball.” A ball pitched so fast that, to his eye, it exploded into a million pieces just prior to getting to home plate. Embarrassed to admit what he was seeing, he didn’t mention it to anyone. It was some time later that he learned from a ophthalmologist that what he experienced was an anomaly of light refracting from an object coming towards him at an extraordinary speed. Luciano continues to mention that it didn’t happen just once, but several times — and all by the same pitcher. Nolan Ryan.” 1978: J. R. Richard (8.4) has 303 strikeouts and his highest K/9 season (9.9). 1950-1980 estimated fastball speeds with some scientific testing via fast-action cameras and early radar guns: (95-96) Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Bob Gibson, Denny McClain, Steve Carlton, Steve Barber, “Bullet” Bob Turley(96-97) Tom Seaver, Bob Veale(98-100) Herb Score, “Sudden” Sam McDowell, Dick Radatz, Lee Smith, J. R. Richard, Ryne Duren, Goose Gossage(100+) Nolan Ryan 1986: Roger Clemens (8.6) strikes out 20 batters in a single game. 2014: Aroldis Chapman (14.8) becomes the first MLB pitcher to average 100 mph for a season, with a 100.2 mph average fastball speed. In 2014 he threw 62% of his fastballs and 42% of his total 395 pitches over 100 mph! 2016: Noah Syndergaard (9.5) averaged 97.9 mph on his four-seam fastball for the 2016 season and his 10.7 K/9 was the highest of his career. 2020: Shane Bieber (11.0) has the highest K/9 season of all time for a qualified pitcher (14.2). 2022: Edwin Diaz (14.8) has an insane 17.9 K/9 as I update this article in late July 2022. And it’s no fluke, because Diaz had a 17.5 K/9 in 2020, albeit in just 25 2/3 innings. His fastball has been clocked at 102.6 mph. He was suggested by Frank McGrath in the comments. 1980-2022 fastest pitchers per modern radar guns: Many in the 100-104 mph range, Jordan Hicks and Joel Zumaya (105), Aroldis Chapman (105+) FASTBALL TRIVIA Steve Dalkowski was the prototype for “Nuke” LaLoosh in Bull Durham. Dalkowski was so wild, both on and off the mound, that he never made it to the majors. “Sudden” Sam McDowell was the basis of the Sam Malone character on the hit TV show Cheers. RANKINGS Tim Wendel (author of High Heat) named the game’s hardest throwers in this order: Nolan RyanSteve DalkowskiBob FellerWalter JohnsonSandy KoufaxBilly WagnerSatchel PaigeJoel ZumayaAmos RusieGoose GossageBob GibsonJ.R. Richard. This is my ranking of the best fastball pitchers, based partly on speed but mainly on effectiveness, as measured by ERA+ and the K/9 stat weighed for the pitchers’ respective eras. For instance, 5.5 K/9 in the early 1900s would be comparable to around 9.5 K//9 today. Billy Wagner (11.9, 187 ERA+)Aroldis Chapman (14.8, 170 ERA+)Jacob deGrom (10.7, 157 ERA+)Bullet Rogan (5.5 with a peak of 8.4, 161 ERA+)Bill Foster (5.5 with a peak of 7.2, 164 ERA+)Satchel Paige (7.7 with a peak of 9.6, 152 ERA+)Walter Johnson (5.3 with a peak of 7.6, 147 ERA+) — The Big Train was the first member of the 3,000 strikeout club, and the only member until Bob Gibson joined him, half a century later!Smoky Joe Wood (6.2, 146 ERA+)Lefty Grove (5.2, 148 ERA+)Roger Clemens (8.6, 143 ERA+)Rube Waddell (7.0, 135 ERA+)Sandy Koufax (9.3, 131 ERA+) — Sandy Koufax got a lot of his strikeouts with a devastating curve and his fastball topped out around 93 mph, if I remember correctly. But it was a rising fastball made even harder to hit by his sinking curve.Herb Score (9.6, 154 ERA+ before injuries) — Score only pitched two full seasons before injuries derailed his career. But in those two seasons he was in Nolan Ryan strikeout territory, with a better ERA, and 20 years ahead of his time.Randy Johnson (10.6, 135 ERA+) — Randy Johnson, nicknamed “The Big Unit” was 6′10″ and an intimidating presence on the mound.“Mad” Max Scherzer (10.7, 134 ERA+)Nolan Ryan (9.5, 112 ERA+) — While Ryan has the most career strikeouts, by far, his ERA and ERA+ keep him from being the most effective fastball pitcher in my book. He was, however, the hardest pitcher to hit, according to hits allowed per nine innings.Bob Gibson (7.2, 127 ERA+) — Gibby was the second member of the 3,000 strikeout club, after Walter Johnson.Tom Seaver (6.8 with a peak of 9.1, 127 ERA+) — Johnny Bench said Tom Seaver had the best and hardest fastball he ever caught, and Bench caught fireballers like “Bullet” Don Gullett and Gary Nolan.Dick Radatz (9.8, 135 ERA+ in the 1960s)Clayton Kershaw (9.8, 157 ERA+) — Captain Hook is best known for his curve, but he paired it with a great fastball.Gerrit Cole (10.4, 128 ERA+)Dazzy Vance (6.2 125 ERA+)Bob Feller (6.1, 122 ERA+)Curt Schilling (8.6, 127 ERA+)Pedro Martinez (10.0, 154 ERA+) — Martinez threw fastballs mostly in the 88-89 mph range, although early in his career he could top 95 mph. Still, it was his variety of pitches that made Martinez a great pitcher.Amos Rusie (4.6, 129 ERA+)Steve Carlton (7.1, 115 ERA+) — Carlton was a great strikeout pitcher but his ERA bounced around and like Nolan Ryan he wasn’t as good as pitchers ranked higher at preventing runs.“Sudden” Sam McDowell (8.9, 112 ERA+)J. R. Richard (8.4, 108 ERA+) — Willie Stargell said: “J R throws the ball so g-d-mn fast, I can’t hardly see it.”If a spitter counts as a fastball, Ed Walsh had a great fastball and lowest ERA (1.82) in MLB history for a qualified pitcher. If Mariano Rivera’s cutter counts as a fastball, it would rank high on this list. There is a brief discussion of whether a cutter is a fastball or off-speed pitch in the “Hardest Pitches to Hit” section. HIGH HONORABLE MENTION: Grover Cleveland Alexander, Steve Barber, Tommy Bond, Vida Blue, Asa Brainard, Ray Brown, Jim Bunning, Larry Corcoran, Hugh Daily, Ryne Duren, Kyle Farnsworth, Dwight Gooden, Goose Gossage, “Bullet” Don Gullett, Guy Hecker, Trevor Hoffman, Jim Maloney, Pedro Martinez, Denny McLain, Jouett Meekin, Jack Morris, Kid Nichols, Robin Roberts, Charlie Sweeney, “Bullet” Bob Turley, Bob Veale, Jim Whitney, George Zettlein RECENT AND CURRENT CONTENDERS: Yu Darvish, Edwin Diaz, Josh Hader, Tim Lincecum, Robbie Ray, Chris Sale, Stephen Strasburg, Noah Syndergaard, Justin Verlander, Mark Wohlers, Joel Zumaya Who threw the hardest pitches? If by the “hardest” pitch we mean the fastest pitch, the fastest pitches have been thrown by the pitchers immediately below. But I have created a second list of the “most difficult pitches to hit,” such as Sandy Koufax’s curveball and Mariano Rivera’s cutter. GREASED LIGHTNING: THE FASTEST FASTBALLS OF ALL TIMEby Michael R. Burch Nolan Ryan threw a 108.1 MPH fastball according to a doppler laser radar reading in 1974. And he was still throwing 96 MPH fastballs at age 46! Nolan’s fastball had its own nickname: “The Ryan Express.” How hard was he to hit? He had the lowest hits per nine innings in MLB history and threw a record seven no-hitters, as mentioned by Steve Oglesby in the comments. Bob Feller supposedly reached 107.6 MPH back in 1946, although I doubt the accuracy of the measurement that long ago. The method used was racing a Feller pitch against a speeding motorcycle! That sounds more like a publicity stunt than a scientific experiment. But there is no doubt that Rapid Robert Feller threw extreme heat. After all, the eagle-eyed Ted Williams said that Feller was “the fastest and best pitcher I ever saw during my career.” I would guess something closer to 98-100 mph and perhaps even faster in Feller’s prime. But his K/9 was never higher than 5.9 after age 27. Aroldis Chapman hit 105.8 MPH on a modern radar gun on Sept. 24, 2010 and has thrown 273 pitches of 103 MPH or faster since 2008, by far the most in MLB. Jordan Hicks has 61, Mauricio Cabrera has 11, and no one else is in double digits. Chapman has reached 105 MPH eight times, Hicks has done it twice, and no one else has done it to date. But watch out for a college pitcher named Ben Joyce!… Ben Joyce, a relief pitcher for the University of Tennessee, threw the fastest pitch in 2022 to date, when he was clocked at 105.5 MPH. Joyce has thrown eight pitches of 103 MPH or faster in 2022. Joel Zumaya hit 104.8 MPH on a radar gun in 2006. Cincinnati Reds pitcher Hunter Greene reached 100 MPH multiple times during 2022 spring training and hit 104 MPH in the minors (Triple-A) in 2021. In just his second start in the majors, Greene set an MLB record for the most 100+mph pitches in a single game with 39, according to MLBStats and GoogleCloud. “Bullet” Bob Turley was said to have hit 103.2 MPH way back in 1954, but I’m not sure how the speed was determined. Ryan Helsley has thrown over 103 mph in 2022, reaching 103.1 MPH. He was mentioned in the comments by Tim Tosovsky. Edwin Diaz has clocked 102.6 MPH and in late July 2022 has an insane 17.9 K/9. In effect, he strikes out two of every three batters he faces! He was suggested in the comments by Frank McGrath. Jacob deGrom has clocked 102 MPH and hit 100 MPH on seven of 24 pitches during his first rehab start for Class A St. Lucie. In the comments Harvey Goldhammer suggested Dick Radatz with the following comments: ‘In the 1960’s there was a hard throwing relief pitcher named Dick Radatz. 6′6″ and a blazing fastball. The only other pitcher during that time, who aside from Sandy Koufax, averaged more than a strikeout an inning. He pitched in the majors as a relief pitcher from 1962–1969 and averaged 9.7 strikeouts for 9 innings. Never had a radar gun on his pitching that I knew of.’ I believe Mickey Mantle would concur, since he nicknamed Radatz the “Monster” and struggled to make contact with his pitches. Harvey Goldhammer also suggested Eddie Feigner, noting that ‘The well-known softball pitcher was clocked pitching a softball at 104 MPH. In 1967, in an exhibition charity game, which I saw on TV, he struck out, in order, Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Brooks Robinson, Maury Wills, Harmon Killebrew and Roberto Clemente. Feiner was brought into the game as an “unknown” relief pitcher for the “Hollywood Stars.” Mays dropped his bat, shaking his head, after the first pitch sailed past him.’ Jhoan Duran, a pitcher for the Minnesota Twins, has been clocked four times at 102.1 to 103.3 MPH in 2022. Emmanuel Clase threw a 100.2 MPH cutter in 2021 and has averaged 100 mph for his four-seam fastball and cutter combined, for his MLB career so far! Noah Syndergaard averaged 98 mph on his four-seam fastball from 2015 to 2019, the fastest for a MLB starter by a full 1.5 mph, according to the New York Times. Syndergaard’s average fastball velocity may be the fastest for a starter to date. He has the best combined velocity since 2007, when advanced technology allowed the speed of pitches to be reliably tracked. Exactly how fast the great Walter Johnson threw is unknowable, but according to Jay Jaffe, in 1914 his fastball was measured against a speeding motorcycle and estimated at 97 mph. These are MLB pitches with the single fastest pitch by each pitcher that I have been able to find (but I’m sure there are more). The older pitches are bolded to make the easier to find.

Ted Williams, famous for his 20-10 eyesight, took one pitch from Dalkowski in a practice and stepped away—he said he never saw the ball, he'd only heard it. “He was unbelievable. He threw a lot faster than Ryan. It’s hard to believe but he did,” said Earl Weaver, who saw Nolan Ryan pitch many times, and managed Dalkowski. Paul Blair, who faced Nolan Ryan, Sandy Koufax, Sam McDowell, Vida Blue, Dick Radatz and Goose Gossage, said Dalkowski “threw the hardest I ever saw.” Cal Ripken Sr.[LINKED_TEXT: , ] [URL: http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Cal_Ripken_Sr.]who caught for Dalkowski and saw Nolan Ryan, J.R. Richard, Dwight Gooden, Roger Clemens and Randy Johnson, said: “Steve Dalkowski was the hardest thrower I ever saw.” I have seen reports of Dalkowski being timed at 102.5 mph, but I’m not sure when, where or how. ALAS, WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN! Steve Dalkowski joins the ranks of Smoky Joe Wood, Satchel Paige, Herb Score, Sandy Koufax and J.R. Richard as immortal fireballers who were denied long MLB careers. They might have rewritten the record books otherwise. THE HARDEST PITCHERS TO HIT AND THEIR HARDEST PITCHES TO HITby Michael R. Burch Nolan Ryan’s fastball and curve made him the hardest pitcher to hit, according to his 6.56 H/9 (hits per nine innings). And he threw a record seven no-hitters, as mentioned by Steve Oglesby in the comments. However, Ryan walked so many batters that his WHIP (walks+hits per inning pitched) is just 309th in the all-time ranking. Addie Joss was the hardest pitcher to get on base against, with a .9678 WHIP. He threw a fastball, curve and a “slow ball” that we now call a changeup. Ed Walsh’s spitball made him the only other qualified pitcher with a sub-1.0 WHIP, although just barely at .9996. Mariano Rivera’s cutter was suggested by Bret Yeilding in the comments. According to ERA+ this may have been the most difficult pitch to hit and score on. Rivera also has the third-best WHIP of all time: 1.0003. Is the cutter a fastball, a breaking ball, or somewhere in between? Wikipedia says: “The cutter is typically 2-5 mph slower than a pitcher's four-seam fastball. In 2010, the average pitch classified as a cutter by PITCHf/x thrown by a right-handed pitcher was 88.6 mph; the average two-seamer was 90.97 mph.” Pitchers who threw a high percentage of cutters include Mariano Rivera (87.2%), Kenley Jansen (85%) and Roy Halladay (45%). Andy Pettitte had a good cutter, although I don’t know his percentage.Steve Ensor raised a valid question in the comments: “Not debasing this claim nor his greatness…but wonder how Mariano’s cutter would be zoned in on had he been a starter and batters had more looks?”I also question what would have happened if Rivera started and threw more than one or two innings per game, from a fatigue standpoint. I think his H/9, WHIP and ERA would increase substantially as a starter. Clayton Kershaw is called Captain Hook for his curveball. His 1.0025 WHIP is the fourth-best of all time. Jacob deGrom has a 100-mph fastball and 93-mph slider that make him almost impossible to hit. His 1.0114 WHIP is the fifth-best of all time. As Glen Wells mentioned in the comments, “Jacob deGrom recently had 18 straight swings and misses with his slider (when the batter swung), during this streak there were about 7-9 taken for balls, the pitch wasn’t just unhittable, it was unfoulable.” In 2021, in 15 games before he was injured, deGrom had an otherworldly .554 WHIP and 381 ERA+. Pedro Martinez may have been the most baffling starting pitcher of all time, due to his fastball, circle changeup, cutter, sinker and power curveball. Luis Tiant was another baffling pitcher, due to his wide variety of pitches — fastball, slider, curve, slow curve, palm ball, knuckleball and spitball — all delivered from three different release points with an exaggerated pirouette pitching motion. Reggie Jackson called him “the Fred Astaire of baseball.” In 1968 Tiant was 21-9 with a league-leading 1.60 ERA and nine shutouts, including four in a row. In one 10-inning game he had 19 strikeouts. Rip Sewell’s “eephus” pitch. Satchel Paige’s hesitation pitch. Bill Foster’s “drop ball” in combination with his eight-speed change-up. Foster had a 164 ERA+ in the Negro Leagues, the highest ever by a starting pitcher. Jim Devlin’s “drop pitch” or sinker. Sandy Koufax’s curveball. Kerry Wood’s curve, or was it his slider? Bert Blyleven’s curve was suggested in the comments by Hal Boyd, who said: “I think Bert Blyleven deserves a place on this list. His curveball was amazing, looked like it bounced off an invisible wall on the way to the plate. He [had] right-handed batters bailing out of the batter’s box on pitches thrown for strikes.” Carl Hubbell’s screwball. Christy Mathewson’s screwball. Bruce Sutter’s splitter. Randy Johnson's fastball and hard slider. Steve Carlton’s fastball and hard slider. Tom Seaver’s fastball and hard slider. Bob Feller’s fastball and hard slider. Feller wrote in his book: \\"It was the slider which was of the greatest help to me in 1946 when I established a strikeout record of 348 for a season. I used it in many spots where I had used a curve before.\\" Ferguson “Fergie” Jenkins had a hard slider that consistently froze hitters and helped pave his way to a Cy Young Award and 3,192 strikeouts. Bob Lemon was one of the first pitchers to rely primarily on the slider. Baseball historian Roger Angell called Lemon the \\"first man to have pitched his way into the Hall of Fame with a slider.\\" Lemon won 20 games seven times. Hal Newhouser was an average pitcher … until he developed a slider prior to the 1944 season. In 1944 he won the AL MVP award by going 29-9 with a 2.22 ERA. He won a second consecutive MVP award in 1945 when he won the pitcher’s Triple Crown. And he ended up in the Hall of Fame. “Bullet” Don Gullett had a great fastball, as his nickname suggests, but his best pitch was a hard slider. Stephen Strasburg has a great fastball and a curving slider called a “slurve.” The combination has given him a K/9 of 10.6, which is 7th all-time and just behind Randy Johnson. And that, my friends, is very good company to be keeping! Christy Mathewson’s “fadeaway” pitch, or screwball. Warren Spahn’s screwball. Tug McGraw’s screwball. Trevor Hoffman’s palmball. Phil Niekro’s knuckleball. Hoyt Wilhelm’s knuckleball. R. A. Dickey’s knuckleball. Burt Hooton’s knuckle-curve. Craig Kimbrel’s knuckle-curve. Greg Maddux’s two-seam fastball. Gaylord Perry’s forkball (or spitball). Willie Hernandez's screwball was suggested by Andrew Phillips in the comments. Frank Tanana’s sinker-screwball (that’s what he called it himself). Tanana was suggested by Alexander Angel in the comments. Tanana was a power pitcher who lost his zip and had to adjust. He compensated with a great curve, a great changeup, a forkball, the sinker-slider, and excellent control. Tanana said in an interview that control was his “best pitch.” Nolan Ryan is baseball’s strikeout leader and will probably remain so forever, now that starting pitchers are throwing radically fewer innings per season. But the object of pitching is to keep runs from scoring and thus according to ERA+ the hardest pitch to hit and score on was probably Mariano Rivera’s cutter. But as Rob Egenolf mentioned in the comments, we must not forget the immortal Sidd Finch, who threw fastballs at the speed of light! This is my argument against Walter Johnson throwing 100 mph or faster: If Walter Johnson was throwing 100 mph or faster, why did he have just a 5.3 K/9 rate? Was literally everyone 100 years ago able to hit 100 mph fastballs? I sincerely doubt it. The K/9 rates suggest that Johnson was probably throwing no faster than 95 mph and that Bob Feller was probably in the 95-100 mph range. And if everyone in the past was able to hit 100 mph fastballs, why weren’t they able to make contact with Rube Waddell the way they did Johnson? The “facts” just don’t add up. We know from copious data that strikeout rates soar when pitchers throw 100 mph, and the strikeout rates of the past do not confirm such speeds except in very rare cases like Rube Waddell, Smoky Joe Wood and Bob Feller. I often hear the theory that hitters of yore could hit 100 mph fireballs by choking up and bunting. But here is Walter Johnson on Rube Waddell, confirming that choking up and bunting did not work against extreme heat in days of yore: In my opinion, and I suppose if there is any subject that I am qualified to discuss it is pitching. Rube Waddell had more sheer pitching ability than any man I ever saw. That doesn't say he was the greatest pitcher, by a good deal. Rube had defects of character that prevented him from using his talents to the best effect. He is dead and gone, so there is no need for me to enlarge on his weaknesses. They were well enough known. I would prefer to dwell on his strong points. And he had plenty. There is one game that stands out in my memory above all, perhaps, that I have pitched. That was a game fairly early in my career, when I hooked up in a pitching duel with Rube Waddell. Rube was a queer character and he could get indisposed more quickly than anyone I ever saw, when the mood seized him. That day we scored a run off him in the first inning. This didn't please Rube at all. He wasn't feeling particularly ambitious that day, and as he came in to the bench, he started to limp. His leg, it seemed, hurt him a good deal. We had a coach at the time who had a deep knowledge of human nature and a particular knowledge of Rube Waddell's nature. He started after Rube, without an instant's delay. \\"You'd better be getting on your way to the showers,\\" he said. \\"If you don't get out of the box, we'll knock you out.\\" Somehow, that remark got under Rube's skin. He really was a sensitive soul under it all. He made up his mind that he wouldn't quit. Instead, he came back the next inning with blood in his eyes, and from then on he gave the greatest exhibition of all-round speed and unhittable curves that I ever looked at. They scored a run off me, meantime, to tie up the tally. The game drifted into extra innings. In the eleventh inning they scored another run and beat me by 2 to 1. In those eleven innings Rube struck out seventeen Washington players. Most of the time they were choking up on the bat and just trying to keep from getting struck out. But Rube burned them past in spite of everything. There have been many arguments about pitchers' speed. Such arguments invariably hinge on personal opinion. When Waddell had a red letter day such as the one I have mentioned, and cut loose with everything he had, he showed an amazing amount of speed. But Rube was erratic and uncertain, and his pitching was decidedly unequal. In conclusion, since the invention of fast-action cameras and radar guns we have 50 years of evidence that average fastball velocities have been rising continually, and we know from K/9 rates that strikeouts have been rising dramatically as well. There is a clear correspondence. We also know that sprinters of yore were not as fast as Usain Bolt, that swimmers of yore were not as fast as Michael Phelps, etc. In every sport of which I am aware, all 100-year-old records have been shattered. Why would baseball be the ONLY exception? Also, I we have to listen to the real experts: the great hitters and pitchers. Ted Williams had a great eye but he said it was hard for him to see Steve Dalwoski’s fastball. Yogi Berra had a great eye but said Herb Score was the hardest pitcher to hit. Mickey Mantle called Dick Radatz “The Monster.” Walter Johnson said no one threw faster than Smoky Joe Wood, and that hitters couldn’t hit by choking up and bunting against Rube Waddell. And those pitchers all had K/9 rates well above Johnson’s 5.3 K/9. That suggests pitchers with lower K/9 rates were simply not throwing as hard and were easier to see and hit. Extreme heat was rare in the past but common today, and that is why fastball speeds and strikeouts are soaring together, as batting averages continually fall. I will continue to maintain that there is a direct correlation between fastball velocities and K/9 rates. And this is not a simple matter of batters choking up and bunting more. It has always been extremely difficult to make contact with 100 mph pitches, regardless of the method employed. by Michael R. Burch PITCHING STAFFS OF NOTE FOR STRIKEOUTS In my timeline I mentioned the 1969 Mets and their sky-high K/9 rates for their era: 1969: The former cellar-dwelling New York Mets become the “Amazing Mets” with young fireballers Nolan Ryan (9.3), Tom Seaver (who would peak at 9.1), Tug McGraw (8.3), Jerry Koosman (6.7), Jim McAndrew (6.0) and Gary Gentry (5.9). Was this the greatest collection of strikeout artists up to this point in MLB history? Is it still the best, relative to its era? Please let me know what you think in the comments. I can’t think of a better staff for strikeouts relative to its era. In the comments Steve Ensor mentioned the Nasty Boys, the nickname of the relief staff for the 1990 Cincinnati Reds: The Nasty Boys…Ron Dibble, Norm Charlton and Randy Myers! The \\"Nasty Boys\\" pitched a combined 8+2⁄3 innings in the [LINKED_TEXT: 1990 World Series] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_World_Series] and gave up no earned runs on six hits. Rob Dibble got a win in Game 2 and Randy Myers picked up one save in Game 4. Prior to the series, Myers and Dibble had shared the [LINKED_TEXT: League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_Championship_Series_Most_Valuable_Player_Award]. OBSERVATIONS FROM THE COMMENTS In the comments to another page Steve Foman observed: There is a great baseball documentary on Netflix called “Fastball” where they answer many of the questions raised in your post. Using modern technology, analysts went back and “measured” the speed of many of the fastballers of the past. They determined, for instance, that Walter Johnson rarely approached anymore than the low to mid 90s on his best days but it was so much faster than anybody else of those days that it could overwhelm even the most disciplined batter. His sidearm whip motion also contributed to his effectiveness because the ball was coming from an odd angle as compared to others. Bob Feller’s best fastball was measured at 107.9, while Nolan Ryan’s was the king at 108.1. Neither of these results is considered official as those particular pitches were originally measured at slower speeds (98.6 and 100.9 respectively) using outdated technology. Satchel Paige was reported to throw around 98 mph but that was “measured” later in his career so he may have touched 100 when he was younger. Anyway, it’s a fantastic documentary and you would enjoy it. On the idea that a 100 mph pitch without movement would easy to hit, explaining lower K/9 rates in the past… MRB: Ted Williams had a great eye, with 20–10 vision. Yogi Berra had a great eye and rarely struck out. When confronted by the fastest fireballers they faced, they both said they had trouble SEEING the ball, by which I take them to mean picking up the ball in time to swing at it. I will have to go with these two great hitters who rarely struck out, in this case. Yes, a flat 100 MPH fastball is easier to hit than one that moves, but that doesn’t make it “easy” and anyone who throws 100 MPH is going to register a lot of strikeouts. But we don’t see that in the K/9 rates of yore. On the idea that modern athletes are not actually faster and better than athletes of yore, but just have better technology (track surfaces, shoes, etc.)… MRB: High schoolers are running faster than the best sprinters of yore. And when I was in high school (in the 1970s), records were falling everywhere before the high tech stuff came into vogue. Same for weightlifting and really every athletic endeavor. It’s not all high tech stuff. Athletes are bigger, faster and stronger in EVERY sport around the globe. Why would baseball be the ONLY exception to the rule?Let me quote a New York Times article on the subject: “The pitchers of old who were renowned for speed could not match up against their counterparts today, because of advances in physiology, training and philosophy,” said John Thorn, Major League Baseball’s official historian, who also noted that those pitchers of old made more starts and threw more innings than pitchers now. On Walter Johnson’s size (around six foot and 200 pounds) and him throwing 100 mph: MRB: The bigger pitchers today are much bigger than Walter Johnson, and it’s unlikely that he trained with weights or had any scientific basis to his training. We would expect bigger, stronger pitchers with much more advanced training and science-based nutrition to do better than athletes 100 years ago. On Ty Cobb saying that Walter Johnson threw the fastest pitches: MRB: If everyone else was throwing 85 mph and WJ threw 90 mph, he would be the fastest pitcher to Ty Cobb. On comparing Bob Feller to Walter Johnson, to prove or suggest that WJ was throwing 100 mph: MRB: Feller had a much higher K/9 rate than WJ, with seasons of 11.0, 9.1, 8.4, 7.8, etc. Walter Johnson only had two seasons above 7.0 and never exceeded 7.6. And that fits my theory better than the one that WJ was throwing close to 100 mph. On following the long-term trends back 100 years into the past: MRB: There is an obvious strong correlation between rising pitch velocities, rising K/9 rates and decreasing batting averages. If we trace this trend into the past, we find much lower K/9 rates and much higher batting averages. Thus, we have very good reason to believe that pitch velocities were much lower 100 years ago. All the data suggests exactly that. The idea that baseball is the ONLY sport where modern athletes do not greatly exceed athletes of the past “does not compute” to quote the Lost in Space robot. #MLB #MRB-MLB #MRBMLB #MRBFAST #MRBFASTBALL #MRBK #MRBK9 #MRBFELLER #MRBRYAN #MRBTIMELINE Early speed tests are documented here: [LINKED_TEXT: Fastest Pitchers Ever Recorded in the Major Leagues] [URL: http://www.efastball.com/baseball/stats/fastest-pitch-speed-in-major-leagues/#pre-radar] 222.8K views on 7–4–2023, 192.2K on 5–3–2023"},{"prompt":"Can India, Russia, North Korea, & China together defeat the USA alone in a war, if it happens in 2025?

To put is simply, this belief exists mostly in the USA and even there, the group that thinks this way is a) pretty small / fringe ( even though they like to believe otherwise ), and b) consists almost entirely of people with no scholarly biblical training.

It is simple to code applications for. It is easy to tune for performance for many different workloads and use cases and there are a large number of tunables and a larger number of metrics and system performance information points available to the DBA. On the developer side of my I like the extendability of the server and how well such extensions perform. I love the ability to program for hybrid data paradigms that include relational, object oriented, timeseries, JSON/BSON, geo-spacial, and others all in the same server instance. The DBA in me loves the reliability and extreme uptime capabilities (recently an associate picked up a new client whose server had been online for over 3500 days with zero down time)."},{"prompt":"What are some cool, lesser known facts about the Indian Railways?","completion":"Indian Railways don’t need an introduction as most people travel by train on a daily basis.

Successful sports betting requires a combination of knowledge, discipline, and effective strategies. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the key factors that contribute to successful sports betting. We will address common pain points faced by bettors and provide practical solutions to overcome them. Additionally, we will outline the way forward to help you enhance your betting skills and increase your chances of long-term profitability. Research and Analysis: Thorough research and analysis are fundamental to successful sports betting. Pain point: Many bettors lack the necessary information and analysis skills to make informed decisions. Solution: Invest time in gathering relevant data, studying team and player statistics, analyzing form guides, and keeping up with news updates. Utilize reputable sports analysis websites, expert opinions, and betting communities to gain insights and refine your analysis.Bankroll Management: Proper bankroll management is crucial for successful betting. Pain point: Bettors often face the challenge of managing their finances effectively and avoiding reckless betting. Solution: Set a budget for your betting activities and allocate a specific portion of your bankroll for each bet. Avoid placing bets that exceed a predetermined percentage of your bankroll. Implement a staking plan that accounts for your risk tolerance and protects your bankroll during losing streaks.Emotion Control: Emotional control is a significant factor in successful sports betting. Pain point: Many bettors struggle with impulsive betting decisions driven by emotions such as excitement, frustration, or revenge. Solution: Stay rational and make objective decisions based on data and analysis. Avoid chasing losses or deviating from your strategy due to emotional influences. Develop discipline and stick to your predetermined betting plan, even during winning or losing streaks.Specialization and Focus: Specializing in specific sports or markets can lead to more successful betting outcomes. Pain point: Some bettors spread their attention too thinly across various sports, leagues, and markets, which dilutes their expertise. Solution: Choose a particular sport or market that you are passionate about and invest time in studying its intricacies. Develop a deep understanding of teams, players, playing styles, and key factors that influence outcomes. This specialization will give you an edge and enable you to identify value bets that others may overlook.Record Keeping and Learning: Keeping records of your bets and learning from past experiences are crucial for continuous improvement. Pain point: Many bettors fail to analyze their betting history and miss opportunities to learn from their mistakes. Solution: Maintain a detailed record of your bets, including stake size, odds, and outcomes. Regularly review your performance, identify patterns, strengths, and weaknesses in your approach. Learn from your mistakes and adjust your strategies accordingly. Continuously educate yourself by reading books, articles, and joining betting communities to stay updated on industry trends and gain valuable insights. Conclusion: The key to successful sports betting lies in thorough research, effective bankroll management, emotion control, specialization, and continuous learning. By implementing these strategies, bettors can improve their chances of long-term profitability.

Many smaller countries purchased Spitfires as the major industrial nations phased out propeller-powered aircraft in favour of new jets. [1] When these smaller nations started to update their air forces, many of their Second World War aircraft were sold on the open market to individuals or for scrap. [2] Museums and private collectors began to acquire these Spitfire and Seafire aircraft, and today many survive in these collections around the world.

It would be a tremendous waste of energy and likely cause a seizure."},{"prompt":"f there are big cats, why are there no big dogs?","completion":"There actually are big dogs, some of which can be just as large or even larger than some big cats. For example, the Great Dane, Irish Wolfhound, and Mastiff breeds can all weigh over 100 pounds and stand at over 30 inches tall at the shoulder. In fact, the tallest dog in recorded history was a Great Dane named Zeus, who stood at a height of 44 inches at the shoulder. So while big cats like lions, tigers, and leopards are certainly impressive, there are also big dogs that can match or exceed their size. It's just that big cats tend to be more widely recognized and celebrated in popular culture, likely due to their association with strength and power. follow for more \\"Are you a proud pet parent looking for expert advice and tips?

It can be a hotel’s dedicated website, it can be an OTA like booking. com. or Expedia or it can be a metasearch engine like trivago. In general, a metasearch engine takes the results from several search engines, say Google and Bing, and then apply their algorithms in some cases to re-order the results. Similarly, a hotel industry metasearch engine like trivago takes listings from various online travel agencies (OTAs) and other booking sites and show them all in one place. The consumers can compare hotel rates from various online travel agencies as a certain hotel may have its rates and availability listed at, say, the OTA sites Expedia, Hotels. com, etc. So when you look for a particular hotel on a metasearch engine, you see the hotel’s rates on the various OTA websites. When you find a deal and click you are taken to the source (the OTA or hotel website) to book your stay. The hotel pays the metasearch company a referral commission or a cost per click (CPC) fee for sending the customer to its website. Then we have OTAs which are nothing but a marketplace of hotels. A hotelier list his hotel on an OTA and take an online booking from it. And in return, the hotel pays a commission to the OTAs.

However, when her people's warrior culture began to re-emerge, Satine made what would prove to be a very bad decision: to oppose the warrior culture instead of co-opting it.

I tried for many years to go against the grain, first with Digital Performer (although way back in the early versions) then Nuendo, and I finally gave in years ago and switched to Pro Tools because that’s the DAW format for everything that I came into contact with. Before I learned it, I was in so many situations where I needed to know how to use it and didn’t that it was both embarrassing and cost me work. I’m not saying it’s the best DAW out there (it’s not), but it’s what the vast majority of Pros, at least in the U.S., use."},{"prompt":"Should I repair my own rental properties or hire a contractor?","completion":"Early in your career, it’s probably best to put in some sweat equity to build some wealth, and to get yourself to the point where you can afford to have work done for you. Once you can afford to have the work done, it’s better to free up your time. There were times in my career when the only path to survival was to do the work myself, so i did the work with my very limited skills, usually badly and at great cost of time, due to my incompetence. Recessions eventually end, and if you can get through to the other side by doing whatever it takes, you can make remarkable returns when the good times roll once again. Always be keeping your eyes open for good, skilled workers with integrity. Find workers who are able to do the simple stuff, so you can avoid whenever possible hiring contractors, with their high overhead; a handyman who works out of his own garage can make an excellent living while charging you vastly lower rates for the same work. I have a handyman who charges me 30/hr who gets more done than 3 guys who don’t have a heart for work — and he does the work beautifully. He is a treasure to my business! The reason you want to divest yourself of any work you can is because you can make vastly more as an investor that the pittance you would save by doing it yourself. Time is treasure. If you do all the work yourself, you’ll never see your family, and you won’t make much money.

Firstly, make sure that you are using pure, natural aloe vera gel, without any added chemicals or fragrances. Some commercial aloe vera gels may contain ingredients that can irritate the skin or cause an allergic reaction, so it's important to read the label and choose a product that is safe and suitable for your skin. Secondly, it's a good idea to do a patch test before applying aloe vera gel to your face overnight. Apply a small amount of the gel to a small area of skin on your face, such as behind your ear, and wait for 24 hours to see if you experience any irritation or allergic reaction. If you have sensitive skin or a history of allergic reactions, it's best to consult with a dermatologist before using aloe vera gel on your face overnight. Assuming that you have tested the aloe vera gel and have determined that it is safe for your skin, applying it on your face overnight can have several benefits. Aloe vera gel has moisturizing, anti-inflammatory, and soothing properties, and can help to reduce redness, irritation, and dryness on the skin. It can also help to promote healing and regeneration of the skin cells, leading to a healthier and more youthful-looking complexion.

Please do not hide files from the FBI if they have probable cause or a valid warrant to search the aforementioned data. Pictured: An 8tb Hard Drive Disk, or HDD. Source: Amazon, found via Google. Method 1: The easy way: Take a hammer to the hard drive and flush it down a toilet out-of-county (or state). Problem solved. Issues may arise if being watched. Method 2: The hard (but better) way: Being followed? Don’t fret, just do the following; Open up the hard drive cover with a screwdriver and scratch an insulting bit of taunting text onto the inside of the case. Take the screwdriver, royally scratch the platters, and hit them with hammers until they are dust. Ensure any chips on the PCB or on the bit connecting the PCB to the magnetic read/write. There is also a chip on the back of the orange bit on the bit that the magnetic read/write swivels on. Otherwise the HDD may store cached files on one of those chips, the rest is for good measure. Flush the dust and disassembled drive down the toilet. Problem solved. Method 3: The fun (and pyromaniac) way: Like thermite and chemistry? Does the BATFE think you’re a wacky terrorist because of this? Is the FBI investigating you on the BATFE’s request? No issue! Make thermite, place the HDD in a dry ceramic container, pour thermite on that and light it! I’d like to see anyone recover any data from platters, which have either been completely destroyed by the extreme heat or mixed with iron slag, with the case melted onto it. Issue majorly solved. Method 4: The nuclear method: Is every intelligence and law enforcement agency trying to find your secrets? This requires the upmost destruction to Mr. HDD. In the countryside, dig a nice big hole. Make 100 pounds of Dynamite with 60% Nitro, or make high-purity RDX, and put some under where the HDD will go. Put some on top of it. Rig an electric detonator or a timer. Proceed to run. The hard drive will be made into scattered atoms. No evidence that a hard drive was even there. Issue finally solved for good. Don’t ever destroy evidence, please. destroying evidence is a crime in virtually every jurisdiction. Method 1 and 2 are safe unless the drives contain evidence in a criminal investigation, method 3 may carry a fire risk, and method 4 is almost always illegal due to the use of explosives."},{"prompt":"w can I get a call history of any number?","completion":"No, it is not possible for an individual to access the call history of a mobile phone number without proper authorization.

No problem you will be clarified totally please be focused. So the question is why would you want to use a proxy ? A proxy has several benefits Privacy-It allows you to surf the internet anonymously because it hides your IP address because without using proxy your public IP address is visible, certain people can know what you are browsing But using a proxy your public IP address is not visible.Your IP address stops at server and then Proxy IP address retrieves the data which we need. Speed- From the above point Proxy retrieves the data from web-page for us by hiding Actual IP address .Proxy server actually stores the data into a centralized cache so when another user on a different computer goes through the same data then the proxy server doesn’t have to go to the web-page instead of that it simply retrieves the data from its Centralized Cache Database on Proxy Server by this speed increases because the retrieval time much faster. Saves Bandwidth-Bandwidth describes the maximum data transfer rate of a network or Internet connection. It measures how much data can be sent over a specific connection in a given amount of timeActivity Log : Most of the companies will use a proxy to track of what websites their employees are surfing. So when a company’s employees surfing the internet the Proxy will keep the record what websites they’re visiting at and Duration time of that website.In addition to this a company’s Proxy can configure the proxy ,to block certain websites.Problem with proxy : Proxy server cannot encrypt data so the data can be hacked or known by hackers, government, and Internet Service Providers such as Airtel, idea, Jio, wifi Providers, ….etc But Happily we have VPN or Virtual Private Network it not only hides your data but it also encrypts the data which being transferred the data between your device and internet so that any activity you do on the internet such as visiting the web-pages or transferring files the data is encrypted and kept private when using the VPN.

Piston engines don’t produce torque output all the time, which is why they need a flywheel to store some kinetic energy and produce a continuous output thereby. If there are many engines working alternatively, they can compensate for each other, which reduces the need for bigger flywheels and mechanical vibrations. It’s just like it’s easier to convert multiphase AC into DC due to the smaller amounts of ripple produced by multiphase rectifiers. Radial engines also have a much larger cross section than inline engines, which enables them to be cooled by air alone, without the need of liquid coolant. As a result, radial engines are much more rugged against battle damages because they have no coolant to lose. The downside is that larger cross section also produces more aerodynamic drag. However, radial engines can be shrouded with aerodynamic fairings ([LINKED_TEXT: NACA cowling] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_cowling]) to reduce the drag while not compromising the cooling efficiency."},{"prompt":"Do soldiers only eat MREs when they are deployed or at a base?","completion":"NO.

However, with the right mindset and approach, it is possible to lead a fulfilling and successful life. I want to share some of the tips that have helped me reach my goals and live a happy life. 1. Define Your Purpose One of the most important things you can do for yourself is to define your purpose. This means understanding what drives you, what you are passionate about, and what you want to achieve in life. When you have a clear purpose, it can give you direction and motivation to pursue your goals. 2. Set Goals Once you have defined your purpose, the next step is to set goals. Goals give you something to work towards and help you measure your progress. When setting goals, make sure they are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. This will help you stay focused and motivated as you work towards achieving them. 3. Develop a Positive Mindset Your mindset plays a crucial role in how you approach life. A positive mindset can help you overcome challenges, stay motivated, and see opportunities where others see obstacles. To develop a positive mindset, focus on the good in every situation, practice gratitude, and surround yourself with positive people. 4. Learn from Failure Failure is a natural part of life, and it's important to learn from it. Instead of seeing failure as a setback, view it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Analyze what went wrong, identify what you could have done differently, and use that knowledge to improve in the future. 5. Take Care of Your Health Your health is one of your most valuable assets, and it's important to take care of it. This means eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and managing stress. When you prioritize your health, you will have more energy and focus to pursue your goals. 6. Build Strong Relationships Relationships are an essential part of life, and they can have a significant impact on your happiness and success. Invest time in building strong relationships with family, friends, and colleagues. This means being present, listening actively, and showing empathy. 7. Embrace Change Change is inevitable, and it's important to embrace it. Instead of resisting change, view it as an opportunity for growth and learning. Be open-minded, flexible, and willing to adapt to new situations. 8. Practice Self-Care Self-care is essential for your mental and emotional well-being. This means taking time for yourself to do things that nourish your soul, such as reading a book, taking a walk in nature, or practicing meditation. When you prioritize self-care, you will be better equipped to handle the challenges that come your way. 9. Continuously Learn Learning is a lifelong process, and it's essential for personal growth and development. Make a commitment to continuously learn new things through reading books, attending workshops or seminars, or taking online courses. This will help you stay relevant and adapt to changing circumstances. 10. Give Back Finally, giving back is an essential part of living a fulfilling life. Whether it's volunteering at a local charity or donating to a cause that you care about, giving back can bring a sense of purpose and meaning to your life. These are some of the best life advice that can help you live a fulfilling and successful life. Remember to define your purpose, set goals, develop a positive mindset, learn from failure, take care of your health, build strong relationships, embrace change, practice self-care, continuously learn, and give back. You can be confident that you can create a life that brings you joy and fulfillment."},{"prompt":"Why should we not use firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali?","completion":"The History of Diwali Fireworks Image source: The Daily Switch Information source: Reference in Arhtashastra: [LINKED_TEXT: In Paintings: Diwali & A History of Firecrackers in India | The Heritage Lab] [URL: https://www.theheritagelab.in/paintings-diwali-history-firecrackers-india/] Nilamata Purana reference: [LINKED_TEXT: True Indology on Twitter] [URL: https://twitter.com/TIinExile/status/1188196928787337216?s=20] Chinese text with reference to purple smoke: [LINKED_TEXT: Are Fireworks part of Indian Culture? - Guruprasad's Portal] [URL: http://guruprasad.net/posts/fireworks-part-indian-culture/] Italian traveler says Vijaynagara empire are masters of making fireworks: [LINKED_TEXT: A brief and crackling history of fireworks in India] [URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/research/a-crackling-history-of-fireworks-in-india-4890178/] Formulas for fireworks exist in Kautukachintamani: [LINKED_TEXT: A brief and crackling history of fireworks in India] [URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/research/a-crackling-history-of-fireworks-in-india-4890178/] Aurangzeb banned fireworks: [LINKED_TEXT: तत्कालीन मुगल सम्राट औरंगजेब ने भी लगाया था आतिशबाजी पर प्रतिबंध] [URL: https://www.patrika.com/bikaner-news/mughul-ruler-aurangzeb-banned-fireworks-in-1667-1904988/]"},{"prompt":"What should writers know?","completion":"If you want to do [LINKED_TEXT: Anonymous Blog] [URL: https://vigyaa.io/anonymous-blog-756da043/] then you need to try vigyaa, cause this is a best platform for writers who want to share the feeling without sharing the identity and location"},{"prompt":"Would you rather make out with a vampire or make out with a mermaid?","completion":"It depends on which version of mermaids you are talking about.

It’s easy to look at many places in Europe and say “see, it’s working there, their murder rate is lower than ours, and they have gun control.” That is a great example of post hoc fallacy. What were their murder/violent crime rates before gun control? Unfortunately for you, there is no answer to this. Only the UK has been keeping/publishing crime stats for about as long as the US (both date back to the early 20th century on this point). The UK’s murder rate has never varied by much, no matter what their gun control laws looked like. Some years, their murder rate was as low as about 1.5 per 100,000 people, and as high as about 3 in 100,000. More and more strict gun control over the last century in the UK hasn’t moved the needle on that at all. Much of the rest of Europe suffered the destruction wrought by 2 world wars, from which they didn’t fully recover until the 1970s, and that’s when most of them started reporting on the data. Gun control was already largely in place by that time, and we really don’t have any idea what the crime stats looked like before then. They either didn’t keep them at all, or the records were destroyed in WWII. And in fact, in the US, crime rates had steadily plummeted from an all time high in 1980 of 10 murders per 100,000 people to around half that by the time the “summer of peace” arrived in 2020. And at least at the state level, gun laws have been greatly relaxed over those 40 years. There are now 26 states with what are called “constitutional carry” laws, meaning people can carry pistols, openly or concealed, without having to obtain a permit to do so. Forty years ago, there were 4 or 5, I think. Then combine all of that with the fact that gun ownership has exploded (as measured by the number of 1st time buyers). In 2020 alone, there were something like 10 million new gun owners. That put a huge dent in the supply chain for ammo, which we’re still dealing with almost 3 years later."},{"prompt":"What did the US Government do that was so heinous that it caused Americans to decide they needed an unchecked right to bear arms?","completion":"Allowed slavery and all the guns in private hands did not a thing to make better."},{"prompt":"Would a random number generator be more or less random than me just randomly saying numbers?

If your random number generator is based on a truly random process such as the least significant bit (LSB) of the time interval between radionuclide decay events, then it’s going to beat anything computed. A pseudorandom algorithm is NOT reliably random for every purpose no matter how craftily it’s designed or employed.

Herman Miller makes other fine chairs too, which are priced less than the Aeron - the Sayl, for instance, is half the price of an Aeron.

There were several hypotheses but none were valid. “Cum hoc ergo propter hoc”! The non-avian dinosaurs became extinct prior to the asteroid impact. The ‘Three Meter Gap’ below the iridium clay layer is devoid of dinosaur remains. Paleontology professor Dr. William A Clemens, not finding bones within 10 feet of the clay layer at Hell Hollow stated “You’ve got to have more than circumstantial evidence to prove the asteroid hypotheses.” The youtube video referenced below proves that during the last million years before the impact all, or almost all, non-avian dinosaurs became extinct. View the chart at time 16:03 of the video below ‘The Cretaceous-Palaeogene Mass Extinction: What Do We Really Know?’ My theory, ‘The Gravity Theory of Mass Extinction’ explains how increasing surface gravity, on Pangea and its broken apart remnants, caused the extinctions (see link below). Dr. Howard Hutchinson, of Berkeley Paleontology Museum, noted that the diminishing size and diversity of turtles in the late Cretaceous Period. [LINKED_TEXT: The Gravity Theory of Mass ExtinctionThe Gravity Theory of Mass Extinction Authors: John Stojanowski The cause of mass extinctions is a subject that has been debated for well over a hundred years. Currently, the two prime suspects are bolide impact and volcanism, specifically flood basalt eruptions referred to as Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs). Bolide impact has only been associated with one of the Big Five mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous Period whereas four of the Big Five mass extinctions have unquestionably been associated with LIPs as is the case for other major extinctions. Based upon the above, volcanic association with mass extinction is hypothesized to have had its lethal effect via global warming, global cooling, anoxia and hypoxia. However, the problem with the volcanogenic extinction hypothesis is that the onset of eruptions in the mid-Phanerozoic eon slightly postdates the main phase of extinctions.09,14 This paper introduces a third theory to explain the mass extinctions, the Gravity Theory of Mass Extinction (GTME)01, which is able to explain the primary cause of the extinctions, which is not volcanogenic and not the result of bolide impact. It is also able to explain why LIPs are associated with most of the extinctions as well as geomagnetic reversals and massive changes in sea level. In addition, it offers a reason why a bolide impact occurred near the end of the Cretaceous Period. Comments: 11 Pages.

In fact, a relatively small portion of EV metals comes from Africa. See below for the proof. And remember that ores used in electric car batteries will be recycled due to their high worth—so they only need to be mined once. ~~~~ Every continent is mined, but some areas have already used up their best ores, and some have better natural concentrations than others. Many mineral and metal deposits in Africa are as yet undeveloped. Probably the most mining today for EV batteries is happening in Australia and South America. Most critical EV ore refining is done in China. The New Caledonia Tesla Nickel Mine will be producing a large share of the world’s nickel soon. Quite a large percentage of cobalt comes from Africa. Cobalt is critical for the manufacture of some EV batteries, but it accounts for less than 3% of the total mass of EV batteries today. Cobalt is being phased out of many EV batteries, so growth in demand is shifting to other metals. Even more important than cobalt, today, is lithium. With 8 million tons, Chile has the world's largest known lithium reserves. This puts the South American country ahead of Australia (2.7 million tons), Argentina (2 million tons) and China (1 million tons).

Hint—it is not on the list. Also more important than cobalt is nickel: Where is Africa on this list? Hint—it is not on the list. This chart shows projected increase in EV battery “metal” demand, 2019 to 2030: ^ Bloomberg DETAILS Africa is a very large continent—only Eurasia is larger. Each continent has valuable minerals that are concentrated more there than on other continents. Africa, as a continent, was not mined as much in antiquity for raw materials for manufacturing as Europe, Asia, and the Americas were… because the industrial revolution started later in Africa, and transport of ores from Africa to factories on other continents was expensive until relatively recently. Many of the best deposits of metals in Europe and the US are already gone. In the past, the 1910s through the 1950s, when cars were made, the center of that was Detroit, Michigan, USA. Detroit was chosen because it was very near iron ore deposits and the Great Lakes—that allowed quick and inexpensive movement of raw materials. Detroit already had a well-developed stove manufacturing industry, so the logistics infrastructure was already extensive there when auto manufacturing began to take off. Why ship ores from Africa to the USA, when you can get them from the US and Canada? Detroit was also the center of the mass production line manufacturing revolution. By the 1910s, an influx of workers from around the world came to Detroit to work in high paying factory jobs. In the 1950s, Detroit was the richest city in the world. Today, the auto industry is in another revolution—the EV revolution that was started in California by Tesla, and has now spread to many corners of the world. What is the current mining burden of Africa? Cobalt has been very sought after for making batteries for Electric Vehicles. Africa has some of the best cobalt deposits. This gets a lot of attention, because human rights groups see poor living conditions among miners, and some African countries allow the use of minors as miners. Gold and diamonds have been sought after for a long time, and are very concentrated in several African countries. While Russia wins for diamond reserves and Australia for gold, the amount in Africa is a very significant share of the total. So Africa has been a major supplier of gold and diamonds for a long time. This was also a human rights issue—you may have heard about the so-called “blood diamonds.” What are the ores where Africa leads? Africa is richly endowed with mineral reserves and ranks first in quantity of world reserves of bauxite, cobalt, industrial diamond, phosphate rock, platinum-group metals (PGM), vermiculite, and zirconium. [LINKED_TEXT: Mineral industry of Africa - WikipediaOverview about the mineral industry of Africa The second-largest mineral industry in the world is the mineral industry of Africa, which implies large quantities of resources due to Africa being the second largest continent, with 30.37 million square kilometres of land.With a population of 1.4 billion living there, mineral exploration and production constitute significant parts of their economies for many African countries and remain keys to economic growth. Africa is richly endowed with mineral reserves and ranks first in quantity of world reserves for bauxite , cobalt , industrial diamond , phosphate rock , platinum-group metals (PGM) , vermiculite , and zirconium . The Central African Mining and Exploration Company (CAMEC), one of Africa's primary mining enterprises, faced criticisms for its unregulated environmental impact and minimal social stewardship. In the spring of 2009, retired British cricket player Phil Edmonds ' assets were seized by the United Kingdom 's government due to CAMEC's illicit association with former self-appointed Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe . CAMEC underwent restructuring and sold 95.4% of its shares to the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation . Consequently, it no longer operates under the CAMEC brand.

Because the job was to lift and throw around bags of soil and paver stones, the department was basically nothing but 18–23 year old guys, save for the little old lady and 2 female cashiers. That little old lady became our default granny, and as most grannies do, she loved all “her boys” unconditionally. One day, the security team was following a guy who was trying to steal a computer system. They funneled him to the garden center where they thought “the boys” could prevent him from getting away. I was standing just outside the fence with one of my coworkers and there were 3 guys behind us. Being young and stupid, and strong as bulls, we were kinda itching for what was to come. Granny had spunk, and I’d imagine at one time in her life she was quite the firecracker. She took no crap from anyone, and for a woman who was in her 70’s, she still thought he was a much younger lady. As the thief ran out of the doors to the garden center, he made a beeline straight for the fence, which Granny had blocked. I don’t suppose the thief saw the group of hungry boys standing behind her, but thinking he could get away by bowling her over seemed like his best option. He pushed his basket with the computer system directly into her, knocking her down. Dearest readers, I’m not proud of what happened next, but I kinda am. My store had a police detail that was also following the thief along with store security. When the officer and security made it outside, they found 5 very angry young men beating the snot out of a thief who tried to take out a beloved Granny. As we were pulled off of this unfortunate soul, he tried to plead a case to the officer about how we beat him up. He was having none of it, he saw Granny on the ground and figured out what happened.

MAMC, VMMC, Seth GS, Topiwala National, etc. The reason is that there is a huge amount of exposure to a huge variety of cases and the institutions would have good investigative and treatment modalities than compared to other places. 3) After this , there is state top institutes, for example if the candidate is from UP he should try for KGMC, RML, Kanpur, Prayagraj, etc. 4) Everything after that is more or less up for personal preference or as per convenience. It should be noted that various individuals would want the candidate to opt for Tier 1 city colleges over choosing peripheral AIIMS like AIIMS Patna or Rishikesh. This is entirely upto the candidate honestly. Choose wisely and the candidate would come out as a big learner.

I could probably stop there. If you’re sitting with a laptop on your lap, you naturally use the keyboard and pointing device, not the screen, probably because you are typing and navigating. Many applications just aren’t designed for touch. Pointing at the screen can disturb things. Apple had the right idea, for the moment at least.

Around 1996 we transitioned to Visual C++, the forerunner to Visual Studio. It was probably Visual C++ 6. All my programming was done in C++ and sometimes C. Art was developed with a variety of tools, though that wasn’t really my realm. I remember Photoshop being pretty popular. For 3D models, Maya was used. Realtime 3D wasn’t really a “thing” until the late 90s, though some 3D models were used to generate art that would be turned into 2D assets. For console games, special development kits were used. These were coded largely in assembly (SNES, Sega Saturn), though by the end of the 90s, I wouldn’t be surprised if some eventually started using at least some C (especially with later consoles, like the PlayStation). The PS1 dev kit looked just like a regular PlayStation, but was blue.

Dofollow links are a way to pass on authority to a website, while a nofollow link does not pass on link juice. A dofollow link is a link that helps in terms of SEO by passing the authority of the origin site to the destination site. This passing of authority is called, “link juice.” Acquiring dofollow backlinks will help improve a website’s domain authority, or domain rating, which in turn, helps to improve keyword ranking. By default, links are dofollow, so there is no need for rel=”dofollow” when linking to a website. A nofollow link, or backlink, is a link that does not pass authority on to the website it is linking to. These links do not help in terms of SEO. To make a link nofollow, add rel=”nofollow” to the code when linking to a website.

Various entities and factors play significant roles in shaping the world's affairs. Some of the key players include: Governments: Nation-states and their respective governments have a substantial impact on global politics, economies, and international relations. Major powers like the United States, China, Russia, the European Union, and others exert considerable influence on the world stage.Corporations: Multinational corporations, especially those in industries like finance, technology, and energy, possess immense economic power and can influence policies and decision-making.International Organizations: Entities like the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organization play essential roles in promoting cooperation, setting global standards, and addressing international challenges.Financial Institutions: Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have significant influence over monetary policies and financial systems.Global Elite: A small group of wealthy individuals, entrepreneurs, and influential figures, often referred to as the \\"global elite,\\" can have connections and resources that enable them to shape global events.Intelligence Agencies: Secretive intelligence agencies of various countries play vital roles in gathering information, conducting covert operations, and influencing international affairs.Media and Communication Networks: Media outlets and communication platforms have the power to shape public opinion and influence how information is disseminated.NGOs and Activist Groups: Non-governmental organizations and grassroots activist groups can influence public opinion, advocate for social and environmental issues, and hold powerful entities accountable. It's important to note that the world is incredibly complex, and power dynamics can change over time and in different contexts. Additionally, power is not always centralized, but rather distributed across various actors and institutions. The idea of a single secretive group or organization controlling everything is often associated with conspiracy theories, which are typically unsupported by credible evidence. Instead, it's more accurate to recognize that power and influence are distributed across multiple entities and interests in a complex global system."},{"prompt":"Why do we need a MAC address when we have a private IP address for each device? Can someone explain it in simple words?","completion":"Q: Why do we need a MAC address when we have a private IP address for each device? Can someone explain it in simple words? One thing I have not noticed in any of the other answers is DHCP. When you move around with your laptop or phone, that device has to be assigned a private IP address on the WiFi network you choose to use. The MAC address is supposed to be a worldwide unique 48-bit address that only your device has. When you connect to a new network, then the default is for the device to send out a broadcast to a DHCP server on that network giving its unique MAC address, and requesting an IP address to be assigned that is within the address range of that network. The DHCP server replies to the MAC address providing the local private IP address, the gateway address to allow the device to route to other networks including the Internet, the network mask to be used on the network, the recommended DNS server addresses the device should use and the maximum time for which the device can use that address without requesting a renewal. If several devices make a DHCP request at the same time, it is the MAC address in the reply that delivers the IP address to the specific client for which it is intended. Once a device has this information it can work out whether other IP addresses are local so connections do not need to be routed to a different network, or the connection has to go through a router to reach the destination. The other alternative to using DHCP is to have each device manually configured to use a specific address each time it connects to a particular network. The problem with this is that for the vast majority of home users of networked computers, they have no idea of how to go about assigning addresses and avoiding problems such as two devices having the same IP address, or having an address that is not on the same subnet as the router so they cannot reach other networks or the Internet. The default setting of address assignment being automatic means that for most users connecting devices it becomes a ‘plug & play’ process."},{"prompt":"What are your choices of preference in NEET 2022 counseling?","completion":"Hey So I am a general unreserved candidate from Delhi.

Now please understand there are thousands of ways that you can find speculative stocks and I am not saying that the process I go through is better than anyone else’s. Rather this is the process that works best for me and for my investment strategy. This process works well for investors who take a longer view or timeframe for holding stocks and definitely would not be suited to a day trader, as an example. The first thing I would say is social media in not a tool to rely on to find speculative stocks. Sure you may stumble across a conversation between people discussing a particular stock and there is nothing wrong with researching the stock they are discussing. Obviously every stock, regardless of where you come across it needs to be put through your investment strategy. The issue I have with buying stocks that people are discussing on social media is there is a very high chance that you are not one of the investors who found this stock before the masses. The key to success in investing in speculative stocks is finding a stock before other people do as you will have the opportunity to accumulate it if there is little liquidity. The way I find speculative stocks most of the time really has no reliance on any person or any platform. At a high level I go through the following steps. 1. Create a spreadsheet with a column that represents each of the factors that I consider in my investment strategy. To understand more about these factors please read my other articles that focus on this called “Investment Strategy – Key Terms”. 2. Open the site which provides a list of every company listed on the ASX. If you trade other exchanges simply use the relevant exchange site. 3. Now this next step depends on your experience level: A. Inexperienced: If you are in this category I hope you are sitting down when you read this. You will need to work out the market capitalisation for every company in the list. There are roughly 2,000 on any given day. The reason I suggest you do this manually is you need to experience working out the MC for many different types of companies that have different share structures. You only need to do this exercise once before you can progress to the easier automated way outlined below. In your investment strategy you should have a maximum MC you are willing to invest in. Simply filter your results to include every company up to the MC you are comfortable with. B. Experienced: Simply run a scan, there are plenty online however if you have never used one perhaps you can start with trading view as its pretty simple to use. All you need to do is run a scan to provide every company under a specific MC. 4. At this stage you will have a list of companies that most likely number in the hundreds. What you then need to do is run your investment strategy through every single company to continue to narrow down the list. If I look at my own strategy I look for companies that have at least 6 quarters of cash in the bank. When I apply this filter it automatically removes roughly 70% of companies from the list. So as you can see as you analyse these stock with your investment strategy the list will continue to reduce in potential investments. By the time you complete this exercise you will have a shortlist of I would say probably 20-30 companies that you can take to the next stage. If the number is still quite large then I would say your investment strategy isn’t focussed enough. You don’t need hundreds of factors but I would say somewhere between 5 -10 is acceptable. 5. Now it’s time to dig much deeper into the company. A. Look in the past quarterlies and annual reports and see what commitments/goals management have set. Have they achieved these? If not why? If there is no valid reason then why would you trust them with any future goals? B. Does the company have any upcoming milestones? If not what are going to be catalysts for share price appreciation? C. If cash levels is not a factor that you consider in your investment strategy then definitely need to check this here. Total cash and debt can be found in the latest quarterly cash flow report. From a risk perspective, a company with a market cap of say 10m but has no cash is completely different to a company with 10m market cap but has 5m cash. This is a very important factor as if the company cannot fund its own operations this means they have to conduct a capital raise by issuing more shares to “sophisticated investors”. This in and of itself is not an issue, however you want to ensure that you are accumulating shares as close to the capital raise price as possible. This will be impossible to know though months in advance so if you are investing in a company that has low cash levels then you can be sure that the cap raise price will be at a discounted price to the market. Then all of a sudden you have a number of sophisticated investors who have obtained shares cheaper than you and are willing to flip it around the price you invested in. This means future share price appreciation is much more difficult for you. D. If debt is not a factor that you consider in your investment strategy then definitely need to check this here. In my 10 years of investing I can’t recall one micro-cap company that had significant debt and went on to become successful. The landscape is hard enough for micro-cap companies as it is to then add on debt which means future capital raises are required, future revenue and profits will be eaten up etc E. Google the company and the directors. There may be information in the public arena that isn’t mentioned in an ASX announcement. As an example directors may have previous company dealings which ended badly due to a decision of your companies director. F. Call management to discuss the company and their vision. Now you are not looking for any inside information here, rather you want to have what kind of person the director is and to determine why they are passionate about achieving the companies goals. If the director as an example, doesn’t return your call or only wants to spend 5 minutes talking to you then this is a bad sign. Understand that the directors are managing your hard earned money so get to know them and if you aren’t comfortable with how the conversation went then don’t invest. Please remember that none of the above will make sense if you do not have a written investment/trading plan. You can’t possibly analyse a company if you don’t have a plan to analyse against.

Simply google “the spec investor” and I am first in the list!"},{"prompt":"What would be an opening scene if a biopic is made on Rahul Dravid?","completion":"I’d start with a scene in the forest 1500 years ago with a sapling growing in a forest in the ancient university city of Nalander.

I really hate seeing males wearing their pants off the hip showing off their underwear. I had told my boys many times not to ever do this. What I didn’t know was the boys would wait until they got to school and pull their pants down. I saw this one day unexpectedly, so I decided to teach them a lesson. I had called the school and sent a note to his homeroom teacher to let them know what I was doing. Everyone but my son knew what I had planned. One morning I waited for the boys to get to school. I got “dressed”. This took some work. I found the oldest pajamas I owned. The pajamas was so old, one couldn’t tell what colors they were. I made sure to put on one of my husband's boxers — you know the ones they refused to throw away? The ones with holes and stains. BTW, nothing I had on matched. I pulled my pajama pant down showing my husband’s oldest boxer. I left the rollers in my hair. Made sure to leave the toothpaste around my mouth and put on my makeup like a 4-year-old did it … jacked up! I got to the school and entered the office to sign in; everyone looked at me and burst into laughter. I looked so jacked up it was crazy. I walked the hall smiling at all the kids. Oh, did I mention I left the cereal between my teeth. All the kids were just looking at me in disgust. I entered my son’s homeroom. Made sure to be loud enough so everyone knows I have arrived. My son saw me and if the ground would have opened he would have jumped in. He was so embarrassed. He was trying to hide under the table. All he could muster was, “Mom, what are you doing here and why do you look like that?” I told him, “Well you get to dress however you want not caring if it is embarrassing your family or not, so I don’t care either.” I said pointing to him, “Look at your pants, do you think I want any of my friends seeing you like that? Or want anyone to see you and think you are from the street and don’t have a home?” He promised to never wear his pants down if I promised to never leave the house dressed the way I was dressed. After I told him the reason behind the dropped pants, he understood and never did it again! NOTE: The reason behind the dropped pants is during the old days, prisons used to order uniform “one size fits all”. If you were in prison and your pants were too big, they would just have to drop off your hips — no belt or adjustment were made to accommodate you. Men got out of prison and continued the trend.

How you speak English and what type of English you use. English has a semi-musical rhythm as compared to flat-rhythm of most languages. Not all words are stressed equally. And Some words are fully pronounced and other words are shortened and partially pronounced. If you listen to any native speaker in English movies, it should be quite clear to you. But, no amount of listening will make you speak like a native. You have to do a lot of rhythm drills. Native speakers make use of ready-built word groups (collocations). They don’t talk by stringing individual words. No. Rather, they use ready-to-assemble word clusters which are fixed and standard expressions. take a walk, build a house, change the oil, avoid an accident, by mistake, in queue, at the top, take advantage of, pay attention, etc. You see, these type of word groups work as idea units. These clusters enable you to express your thoughts without having to worry about putting individual words together and worrying about grammar. They change the focus from how to form sentences to what you want to say. That said, never imitate others’ accents! You’d sound awful. You’d sound unauthentic. Native speakers don’t have an accent. It’s the way they speak. The best the foreign speakers can do is speak English in the way it should be spoken. We as foreign speakers assume English is spoken in the same way as our mother tongue. This makes it difficult to carry on conversation in English over longer periods of time even for people who know English quite well. English is spoken quite differently and none of the Indian/Asian language bears any resemblance. English has its own set of phrases, idioms, and collocations and its very own song-like way of speech. You see, English has a certain rhythm and not all words are pronounced equally. Some words are shortened, some words change form in Spoken English. For ex: 1. It is hell of a game. spoken as: isheləvəgame (notice ‘It’s’ became ‘Is’, ‘Of’ became ‘əv’, ‘a’ became ‘ə’) 2. The discount price is 10. Spoken as: thədiscoumpricis10 (notice ‘nt’ became ‘m’) 3. I’m not used to this kind of weather. Spoken as: əmnochoostothiskindəweather (notice ‘I’m’ became ‘əm’, ‘not used’ became ‘nochoosed’, ‘used to’ became ‘use to’, etc.) That brings us to: Syllables Every word in English has one or more syllables. A syllable is a vowel sound in a word. For ex: “Moon” has only 1 syllable “English” has 2 syllables viz. Eng, lish “Syllable” has 3 syllables viz. Sy, lla, ble “Ability” has 4 syllables viz. A, bi, li, ty And only one syllable is always stressed and other syllables are unstressed. The syllable which receives stress can be in any position. “Moon” should be always stressed as it’s the only syllable there. “English” has 2 syllables and stress falls only on first syllable and second syllable is unstressed: pronounced like “ENGlish” Stressed syllable gets longer time and unstressed syllables are rushed over. For ex, in “Impressive”, the stress falls on second syllable and it’s pronounced as “imPRESSive”. You should spend more time on “PRESS” and stress it and just glide over “im” and “ive” and shouldn’t stress them. “Schwa” In unstressed syllables, vowels often get reduced to a semi-vowel sound called ‘Schwa’. It’s written as inverted ‘e’ (“ə”). It’s the the sound between ‘s’ and ‘p’ in ‘supply’. the sound between ‘p’ and ’n’ in ‘company’. So in connected speech, “am” gets reduced to “əm”, “and” to “ən”, “was” to “wəs”, etc. These and other things are clearly explained in [LINKED_TEXT: Fluentzy: The Fluency Development Course] [URL: http://fluentzy.com/] by Prof. Kev Nair in detail. I have done this course and been still studying for almost 10 years. Now, Fluentzy course is the most comprehensive and very thorough. It’s one of a kind. Prof. Kev Nair is a well-known authority and is considered “The Father of Fluency Development”. It is a set of 20 books. It doesn’t teach grammar. It is for people who already know English quite well and want to speak fluently. It asserts self-study is the only way to true fluency as there are a number of factors at play in real-time conversations. You can’t plan for them nor can an instructor correct you. You just have to understand the principles of spoken English and practise rigorously. This course contains a huge collection of ready-built word groups and it explains in detail about how English should be spoken through a lot of rhythm drills. I’ll just give some highlights from this course.1. Foreign speakers learn English the wrong way. We are taught to write English rather than to speak first.2. There’s a lot of differences between written and spoken English.3. The right way to learn to speak is in word-groups instead of individual words.4. The way English is spoken is completely different from the way our languages are spoken.5. Fluency is achieved only when our ears and tongue are trained in English. We may know English but the tongue has to be taught in English ways. And ears have to stop being hesitant to English sounds.6. Fluency is achieved only through self-study, without any instructor, without any recordings. Any external means is a hurdle.7. We should get exposed to spoken English a lot. We should read novels written in loose, conversational style. Newspaper, non-fiction books, magazines, and like should be avoided as they’re written for different purpose and aren’t suitable from fluency perspective.8. We should avoid bilingual dictionaries and learn to think in English. We should buy at least one Advanced English dictionary and look up words for even simple words. Not any word, but fluency oriented words.

On average, it probably accounts for about 60% of the warming effect. However, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is controlled mostly by air temperature, rather than by emissions. Water vapor dont accumulate, it rains out rather quickly, while CO2 stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. (Methane, another potent gas, stays for 5–10 years.) For that reason, scientists consider water vapor a feedback agent, rather than a forcing to climate change. Greenhouse gases whose percentages vary daily, seasonally, and annually have physical and chemical properties which make them interact with solar radiation and infrared light (heat) given off from the earth to affect the energy balance of the globe. This is why scientists are watching the observed increase in greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane carefully, because even though they are small in amount, they can strongly affect the global energy balance and temperature over time. CO2 happens to have a special feature naturally. It absorbs heat radiation very effectively. It has to do with the vibratory and rotational properties of the molecule itself. The structure of their molecules makes them especially effective at absorbing heat radiation while the major atmospheric gases, nitrogen and oxygen, are essentially transparent to it. We can easily measure CO2s properties in laboratories, and derive them from quantum physics.

I think this term is highly subjective, depending on the viewpoints of the person left to perceive this. For instance, an average person at math (say having gone through algebra, geometry and prealgebra) would definitely see mathematicians as exceptionally great. Whereas someone like a physicist or aspiring profession alike might see mathematicians as moderately good at their field. In short, there don’t seem to be any secrets, apart from immersing themselves deeply in the subject and devoting themselves day after day.

Now lets look a little at that MIG. The Soviet Union made some experimentation with logistics of all things that beae on this. The First supersonic fighter the Soviets fielded was the Mig 19. They decided that engine maintenance was a waste of time and resources. It wound up cheaper to follow the idea of “planned uselessness”. At 100 hours you simply replaced the whole engine, you didn’t try to overhaul it. The Mig25 followed a similar path to get the maximum thrust Mig wanted. Mig used a supersonic cruise missile engine in it! Those things were designed as ONE TIME USE engines. So it was not the case that the Mig25 was pushing the performance of the engines to the point of failure. It was the thrust available to the engine, which was designed to be expendable, that made the engine choice attractive.

What do you make of this statement? I have no idea who this guy is, but he is wrong. Every language has grammar. Vocabulary, syntax, and grammar are what makes it a language and not just a combination of words or sounds or letters. In some ways, English grammar is simpler than that of other languages. Take, for example, verb conjugations. In English, only the 3rd person singular is inflected (leaving out the archaic 2nd person singular, thou). I love, you love (or thou loveth), he/she/it loves, and any plural love. Compare with, for example, Latin. Amo, amas, amat, amamus, amatis, amant. English adjectives are not inflected, and only two (this and that) even have a plural form. Even the artificial Esperanto inflects adjectives for number and case. Other than in the 3rd person singular pronouns, English has no gender, and when it does it is natural. Compare German, where knife, fork, and spoon are all different genders. However, in some ways, English grammar is more complicated. Other than some rare Celtic languages, English is the only language that has a continuous present tense. The French, for example, je marche, in English could be either I walk, I do walk, or I am walking.

Read more: [LINKED_TEXT: Balancing DoFollow and NoFollow: The Key to Effective SEOIntroduction: In search engine optimization (SEO), finding the right balance between DoFollow and NoFollow links is crucial for improving website visibility and rankings. Both types of links serve different purposes and impact your website’s overall SEO strategy. Understanding the differences and efficiently managing their execution can help you optimize your website for search engines while maintaining a healthy and natural link profile. I. What are DoFollow and NoFollow Links? A. DoFollow Links: DoFollow links are regular hyperlinks that pass link equity or “link juice” from one website to another. Search engines follow these links and consider them as votes of confidence or confirmations for the linked page’s quality and relevance. DoFollow links can positively effect a website’s search engine rankings and organic visibility. B. NoFollow Links: NoFollow links contain an HTML attribute called “rel=nofollow,” which instructs search engines not to follow or pass link equity. These links were introduced to combat spam and discourage paid links, blog comments, and user-generated content from influencing search rankings. NoFollow links are not considered as direct endorsements by search engines but still contribute to overall website visibility. II. Importance of Balancing DoFollow and NoFollow Links: A. SEO Authority and Credibility: DoFollow links from reputable and authoritative websites signal to search engines that your website is trustworthy and relevant. Having a healthy mix of DoFollow links helps build your website’s authority, which positively impacts search rankings. B. Natural Link Profile: Search engines expect a diverse and natural link profile that includes both DoFollow and NoFollow links. A well-balanced link profile appears more organic and genuine, reducing the risk of penalties or algorithmic filters. C. User Engagement and Traffic: While NoFollow links don’t directly impact SEO rankings, they can still drive valuable referral traffic and increase user engagement. NoFollow links from high-traffic websites or relevant communities can attract potential visitors to your site. Read More About: Top 5 Pitfalls to Dodge in Your Link Building Strategy III. Strategies for Balancing DoFollow and NoFollow Links: A. DoFollow Link Strategies: Earn editorial links by creating high-quality content that naturally attracts attention and backlinks from other websites. Seek guest blogging opportunities on authoritative websites within your niche, ensuring the inclusion of relevant DoFollow links. Engage in influencer marketing or partnerships to obtain DoFollow links from reputable industry figures. B. NoFollow Link Strategies: Participate in relevant online communities, forums, or social media platforms, contributing valuable insights and including NoFollow links in your profile or comments.

If a power grid uses wind generation, then it must have a backup source of power available, because the wind does not always blow when people need power. The backup source must have two properties particular to this purpose: The backup source must be able to change its generation rate on relatively short notice. The required rapidity of response depends on the predictability of changes of the wind, of course, so may range from minutes to hours.The backup source must have low capital cost, because it will be in operation only for part of the time, i.e. with low duty factor. The lower the duty factor, the lower the capital cost must be. The duty factor depends on the variability of the wind. Hydroelectric power is an option, if available. It must have generating capacity greater than that which the average flow rate of incoming water could support steadily, so that it can utilize fully the incoming flow while operating intermittently. This requirement adds to the capital cost of a hydroelectric installation, but not a lot in comparison to the usual cost of a dam and reservoir. In actual settings, if there is adequate hydroelectric power available to serve as backup for wind power, then there is usually adequate hydroelectric power to serve the needs of the grid without wind power. Only in marginal settings, where a region is beginning to outgrow its hydroelectric capacity, can hydroelectric power serve as the necessary secondary source of power. Ontario is an example of this situation, as its base load is met by nuclear power, and hydroelectric power serves for much of the load following. Nuclear power is unsuitable for backup, because of its high capital cost and because it does not respond well to rapid changes of generation rate. Fossil-fueled steam power plants have similar limitations, to a lesser degree. The remaining alternatives are In small regions, diesel generators. They are the most efficient source of power for small loads, up to a population of a few thousand, and can be started and stopped, and throttled up or down in seconds.Otherwise, gas turbines are the source of choice. They mostly run on natural gas, which is mostly methane. Although it has lower carbon content than e.g. Diesel fuel, it forms carbon dioxide as does any other fossil fuel. In any case, wind turbines indeed call for the consumption of fossil fuel in any realistic setting. Diesel fuel will be consumed in smaller, isolated settings, methane in full-scale grids."},{"prompt":"ve there ever been any members of the US military special operations forces who were officially recognized as world class athletes?","completion":"I was sitting in a snack bar in the US Embassy Moscow (circa1970’s).

India is growling along with America. ” China had crossed the Line of Actual Control and entered the southern part of Pangong lake. Our brave soldiers demolished this conspiracy which was being operated in midnight. In Chushul India has stationed two tank regiments and battle carts. Missiles and tanks are also ready in eastern Ladakh. China's thousands of soldiers are now active in Ladakh. So is a war inevitable now ? Yes and no. If a war starts at Ladakh border it will divert the attention of Chinese citizens. Chinese government might be loudly making claims of their victory over Covid and saying that their GDP has grown by 3•5% over this period but the reality is known to only their leaders. No doubt China keeps on claiming to teach a lesson to Honk Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, S.Korea and Japan but it knows that if it does anything offense to any of these then America will leave no stone unturned to twist China's wrist. It is true that there is a huge difference between 2020’s India and 1962’s India. If a war breaks, China would be able to throw weight around India's neighbours in a much better way. India doesn't want to wage war with China. Prime Minister Narendra Modi or any other minister never took China's name to curse it. Indian government might be cancelling business and industrial deals with China, banning many of its projects and inviting the indigenous industries that were operating in China but it is trying that the border conflict gets resolved through dialogue. But even if a war breaks, not only America but most of the world super powers would be on India's side. India and China both are nuclear powers.

Caucasoids (generally, Asia west of the Himalayas, Europe, and North Africa in the Sahara)Negroids (generally Sub-Sahara Africa and Australia)Mongoloids (generally Asia east of the Himalayas and the Americas) These three races will get confusing if we solely focus on skin tone or family languages; for example in another period “Aryans” were distinguished from “Semites”—Aryans being an older term for Indo-European family language groups, and Semites referring to Semitic family language groups. But actually, both Aryans and Semites belong to the Caucasoid race. Keep in mind, skin tone was not a deciding factor in racial classification. Arabians and Indians generally appear dark when compared to more North-western Europeans; and Ethiopians are perhaps some of the darkest Caucasoids yet! This outdated race chart (though the one I still follow—if we can’t simply all just be Homo Sapiens) also messes with our conception of who is an African-American or Asian-American. First, just ignore the hyphenated “American” part. I assume the rest of the world—outside of America—does. But in America, we refer to Asian-Americans as the peoples originating from the east of Asia, while forgetting that places like India, Iran, the whole Middle East for that matter, the greater part of Russia, Turkey, etc. all belong to the continent of Asia—because Asia is pretty darn big. And those we call African-Americans excludes the Berbers who happen to originate in Africa (in the upper part nearer the Mediterranean coast). Now as for the most prominent racial determining factor in classifying from this outdated system? Skeletal remains, more precisely the shape of the skull. The Mongoloid skull is flatter, more evenly, about the front of the face; the Caucasoid more protruding toward the center about the nose; the Negroid more protruding about the lower jaw area. Anyhow, to answer your question in regards to the Assyrian—“What race are the Assyrians?” Well, for starters, they are no more. These were an ancient Semitic-speaking group from the northern part of Mesopotamia. They once became a very strong people, formed an empire, and ultimately wiped out of existence Israel (not including a southern tribe represented as the remnant of Israel, those of ancient Judah—who eventually became Judaeans and then scattered worldwide as Jews). Linguistically Assyrians were Semites; racially, according to my outdated race chart, they were Caucasoids."},{"prompt":"Rahul is not able to put his house in order, instead he is passing baseless allegations on my party says BSP Chief, Mayawathi.

Rahul has stated that he requested Mayawathi to become the CM by forming an allaince with Congress - literally it seems Rahul has begged Mayawathi for allaince, what a shame! Mayawathi was the CM three times and in 2007 she completed her full term. Don't you feel she is more competent than the clown prince? This shows Rahul Gandhi's request went abegging, again it is shameful before the public.🤣 Sometime back I was listening to one particular discussion about the horoscope of Rahul Gandhi. The priest and the astrologer, the name I forgot however, he is from Karnataka who stated that during Indira Gandhi's rule when Rahul was born this astrologer was invited to scrutinize Rahul's horoscope in her official PM's residence. After scrutiny, he stated to Indira that Rahul is born in Vrischika Rashi under the influence of Jeshta Nakshtra. He doesn't have Rajayoga like Narendra Modi, but there's a possibility of becoming PM of India, however it depends on his personal capabilities. The priest suggested to Indira to perform some horoscope related rituals and Indira agreed. He says some 25 priests were engaged in the rituals spreading over several days in order to thwart the evil spirit dogging Rahul baba. The priest also concluded his discussion by saying Narendra Modi will continue to rule India as long as he wishes and it will be extremely difficult to defeat Modi in the coming days by Rahul Gandhi.

Be clear about what it is that your management team is looking for because that will effect your enterprise asset management software selection and will also impact what you can do down the road. In addition to selecting a major asset management product, it’s a good choice to use multiple systems to source data and the overall discovery footprint - this allows more triangulation on the assets and offers a better overlay for asset discovery. If you think of it like a Venn diagram, each additional discovery source will allow you to see where you have alignment and where you do not. This is all good because you are learning and you want to discover both where the pools of assets are aligned and where they are not. Other sources to complete the asset inventory: Information security scanning toolsMobile device management toolsActive Directory / Computers container Asset management reports are always a point in time. Assets can be offline, powered off for repairs, unavailable due to network outages - so communicate often that the reports are a point in time and subject to change.

Source article [LINKED_TEXT: Why Should Mitochondria Define Species?More than a decade of DNA barcoding encompassing about five million specimens covering 100,000 animal species supports the generalization that mitochondrial DNA clusters largely overlap with species as defined by domain experts. Most barcode clustering reflects synonymous substitutions. What evolutionary mechanisms account for synonymous clusters being largely coincident with species? The answer depends on whether variants are phenotypically neutral. To the degree that variants are selectable, purifying selection limits variation within species and neighboring species have distinct adaptive peaks. Phenotypically neutral variants are only subject to demographic processes—drift, lineage sorting, genetic hitchhiking, and bottlenecks. The evolution of modern humans has been studied from several disciplines with detail unique among animal species. Mitochondrial barcodes provide a commensurable way to compare modern humans to other animal species. Barcode variation in the modern human population is quantitatively similar to that within other animal species. Several convergent lines of evidence show that mitochondrial diversity in modern humans follows from sequence uniformity followed by the accumulation of largely neutral diversity during a population expansion that began approximately 100,000 years ago. A straightforward hypothesis is that the extant populations of almost all animal species have arrived at a similar result consequent to a similar process of expansion from mitochondrial uniformity within the last one to several hundred thousand years.https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/276717v1] [URL: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/276717v1]Lay article [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6424407/Every-person-spawned-single-pair-adults-living-200-000-years-ago-scientists-claim.html] [URL: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6424407/Every-person-spawned-single-pair-adults-living-200-000-years-ago-scientists-claim.html]"},{"prompt":"What wind speed cancel flights?

Yes I know that might sound silly. But I am always a big fan of the sillier parts of superheroics (with Batman the Brave and the Bold being my favorite tv show) so I figured it could make for a fun story. When I heard Safespace I envisioned someone akin to Sue Storm. Someone who could create an unbreakable shield thus creating a “Safespace” within their immediate area. Snowflake I figured would either have typically ice powers or be able to act as a weakener to other people. Like making someone like Batman able to break superman’s jaw with her powers effecting the man of steel as an example. Trailblazer would be a Speedster but rather than lightning like the flash would instead emit fire and their moves would be more based on utilizing that. B Negative would be a very typically vampire but end up being a bit overly cynical to the point of comedy. Think an overacting drama theater kid as an example as they break out Yorick’s skull to monologyue about the human condition over every little thing. And finally Screentime would be an ironic power. They’d have no power whatsoever other than to force people to look at them. Think of it like the opposite of a perception filter. This wouldn’t make the opponent a berserker but rather just unable to turn away. THAT are a few of the thoughts that came to my mind with these character names so I admit I got a bit excited. And then I saw some of the stuff about them. First lets go over the designs. They suck. They really suck. And its not because they’re diverse or anything. Its that their costumes kinda have nothing to them. Lets take the knockoff of Ben 10 first. Screentime’s design has no clear illusion to him being connected to the internet. A Superhero design should have more to it beyond just looking cool. It is meant to emphasis character and his just doesn’t. It doesn’t tell me about his character or powers in any interesting way. This is kinda made worse when we move over to the twins. Safespace does have a similar power to what I expected so I am honestly glad that at least exists. But why the hell are they described as a big burly guy when they don’t look like it? To me they look someone more likely to be a baseketball player or trackstar. Neither of those things are big and burly. So the art fails in delivering what it claims it is looking for. As for Snowflake why is she even psychic to begin with? What of their designs scream psychic? And again what does this say about their characters? That they liked blue and pink? Really interesting stuff. What makes it worse is they’re just the same design with the minimal effort to differentiate themselves. And for superhero costumes that is BAD. You want them to POP individually while complimenting one another. The two just feel like one was the original and another was a “MY TOTAL ORIGINAL DESIGN DO NOT STEAL” type thing and its embarrassing. And then there is Trailblazer with a magic backpack. WHY THE HELL DOES HER MAGIC BACKPACK LOOK LIKE FREAKING TECH?! ITS SUPPOSE TO BE FREAKING MAGIC! THIS REALLY ANGERS ME SINCE MAGIC EXISTS IN THE MARVEL UNIVERSE DAMN IT! There is no excuse here. Also her costume feels like normal clothes that someone just spilled random colors on and then said its a superhero outfit. And not in an endearing way like Miles Morales Spidey suit. This design infuriates me the most because at least the other costumes TRIED to emulate superhero costumes. This DOES NOT and I WILL NOT stand for that. Also literally anyone can be Trailblazer and WHY THE HELL IS SHE CALLED TRAILBLAZER WITH A FREAKING MAGIC BACKPACK AND NOT LIKE SATCHEL OR PACK OR SOMETHING? WHY THE HELL ARE THEY CALLED TRAILBLAZER?! IT MAKES NO FREAKING SENSE!!! You might have noticed I avoided B Negative. And there was a reason for that. I want to end on a positive note and thankfully B Negative gives me that. Because B Negative actually has a decent design. His design screams “Punk” which fits since he is suppose to be a music influenced kid. He has a sorta rocker flaire to him which fits with the vampire aesthetic. But beyond that the colors actually pop here. There is enough black, white and pink throughout his design to feel deliberate without going overboard. The other designs use of color felt very random and slap dashed without any real rhyme or reason or were frankly uninspired generic (in the case of Snowflake and Safespace). With B Negative’s colors you get the sense they actually put thought into it. His wings and gloves help bring up his black clothes. But the best example part is the pink belt around his waist. This prevents him from running into the same problem Superman without his trunks went into. Without it the white legs would just be a big ol blob. But its also great because it still adheres to his punk aesthetic while incorporating the pink part of his aesthetic also to his lower body and not just the upper part. Also as for his backstory I’m fine with it. I mean it worked for She Hulk so why not here? I think he has real promise."},{"prompt":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","completion":"Chicago is home to a plethora of mobile app development firms, each with its own set of strengths and talents.

To celebrate the 35th anniversary of Canada’s golden-hued circulation coin, we revisit the story of the Voyageur design and explore the many commemorative designs that the Loonie has featured since its arrival.https://www.mint.ca/en/blog/2022-07-a-tale-of-two-designs-loonie] [URL: https://www.mint.ca/en/blog/2022-07-a-tale-of-two-designs-loonie]Here is a glance at how a common loon found a permanent place on Canada’s one-dollar coin and became the only Canadian dollar found in circulation today. Early 1985: Government recommends the issuance of a new one-dollar coin and the phasing out of the bank note over a three-year period. Early 1986: Preparations for production of the new coin and work on the new tooling (master dies) begins. November 1986: A courier company collects the master dies from the Mint’s facility in Ottawa but (during a snowstorm), loses track of them while on route to Winnipeg, where the coin was to be struck. December 1986: Search for an alternative design begins. January 1987: A new design of a common loon is authorized. June 1987: A new dollar coin (the Loonie) is launched on June 30. June 1988: End of distribution of the one-dollar note is announced. April 1989: The last one-dollar bank note is printed by the Bank of Canada. The coin’s design was created by Canadian wildlife artist, Robert-Ralph Carmichael and was instantly dubbed the \\"Loonie.\\" It’s not known who came up with the name first or why, but the nickname caught on and Canadians have been using it ever since. At that time, the Loonie’s official introduction into circulation signaled the most significant change to Canada’s coinage system in over 50 years, and the coin’s classic loon design remained virtually untouched up until 2012 when a new generation of one-dollar coins arrived. Since 2012, the Loonie now incorporates an advanced security feature (a laser mark), which can been seen above the loon in the shape of a maple leaf. Although circulation coin counterfeiting is not a problem in Canada, in a proactive move to make the coin more resistant to potential counterfeiting, the laser mark was added."},{"prompt":"Whats the #1 thing you always pray for?","completion":"One notable maneuver often cited is the strategic acquisition of Instagram by Facebook. In 2012, Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, recognized the growing popularity of photo-sharing apps and the potential threat Instagram posed to Facebook's dominance in the social media space. Instead of competing directly, Zuckerberg made a bold move and acquired Instagram for 1 billion. This acquisition proved to be a shrewd and smart maneuver for several reasons: Competitive Edge: By acquiring Instagram, Facebook gained a significant competitive advantage. Instagram's user base and unique features complemented Facebook's existing platform, allowing Facebook to extend its reach and stay ahead of the competition.User Engagement and Growth: Instagram's younger demographic and visual-focused content appealed to a different audience than Facebook. The acquisition allowed Facebook to tap into this market and continue its user base expansion, ensuring sustained growth and relevance.Talent and Innovation: The acquisition brought on board a talented team from Instagram, led by its co-founder Kevin Systrom. This team continued to innovate and enhance the Instagram platform under Facebook's resources, further solidifying its position in the market.Diversification and Monetization: The acquisition allowed Facebook to diversify its revenue streams by leveraging Instagram's advertising potential. Over time, Instagram has become a significant contributor to Facebook's overall revenue, proving the strategic value of the acquisition. This maneuver exemplifies the shrewdness and strategic thinking required in business. Recognizing the potential threat, assessing the synergies, and taking decisive action allowed Facebook to strengthen its position and secure long-term success in the evolving social media landscape.

But with so many options available, it can be overwhelming to decide where to put your hard-earned money. Fortunately, there are several tried-and-true methods to invest your money wisely. Here are some of the best ways to invest money: 1. Stock Market: Investing in the stock market can be highly profitable if done with caution. By purchasing shares of publicly traded companies, you become a partial owner and can benefit from their growth. However, it's important to do thorough research and diversify your portfolio to mitigate risks. 2. Mutual Funds: Mutual funds offer a diversified investment option by pooling money from multiple investors and investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities. This reduces the risk associated with investing in individual stocks and provides professional management. 3. Real Estate: Investing in real estate can be a lucrative long-term strategy. You can buy properties and earn rental income or invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs) that let you invest in properties without the hassle of property management. 4. Bonds: Bonds are fixed-income securities that pay interest over a specific period of time. They are considered safer investments compared to stocks, as they provide regular income and have a lower risk of capital loss. 5. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): ETFs are similar to mutual funds but trade on the stock exchange. They offer diversification and can be a cost-effective way to invest in various assets like stocks, bonds, commodities, or even sectors. 6. Peer-to-Peer Lending: With the rise of online platforms, peer-to-peer lending has become an attractive investment option. By lending money directly to individuals or businesses, you can earn interest on your investment. 7. Retirement Accounts: Contributing to retirement accounts like 401(k) or Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) can provide tax advantages and help you save for retirement. These accounts often offer a range of investment options such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. 8. Start a Business: If you have an entrepreneurial spirit, starting your own business can be a rewarding investment. However, it's important to conduct thorough market research and create a solid business plan before diving in. 9. Education: Investing in yourself through education or skill development can yield long-term benefits. Enhancing your knowledge and expertise can lead to better career prospects and higher earning potential. 10. Diversification: Regardless of the investment option you choose, diversification is key. Spreading your investments across different asset classes can help reduce risk and increase the potential for returns. Remember, investing involves risk, and it's crucial to understand your risk tolerance and financial goals before making any investment decisions. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances. In conclusion, the best ways to invest money include the stock market, mutual funds, real estate, bonds, ETFs, peer-to-peer lending, retirement accounts, starting a business, education, and diversification. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to do thorough research and consider your financial goals before making any investment decisions."},{"prompt":"What would happen if Klingons encountered Xenomorphs from the Alien movies?","completion":"The Klingons would not hesitate to nuke the site from orbit.

There was this crack on the pitch around the short- of-length spot from where the ball would just take off. Cummins has the skill to make the ball rear up from there and make it follow you.

Vlad Ţepeş (Drăculea), biografie | Sumar Vlad Țepeș sau Vlad Drăculea (1431 – 1467) a fost un important conducător al românilor și un mare lider european al vremii, care pe parcursul domniei sale a oprit înaintarea otomană înspre Occident. Asociat pe de o parte cu personajul fantastic Dracula iar pe de altă parte cu metoda de execuție prin tragere în țeapă, Vlad Țepeș a fost portretizat greșit secole întregi, adevărul istoric fiind diferit de imaginea sa de tiran. Transylvania World îl definește pe Vlad Țepeș ca un adevărat salvator al creștinătății și a Europei occidentale, un lord inteligent, elegant și bine educat, membru al Dinastiei Drăculeștilor, al cărui arbore genealogic duce până la Prințul Charles de Wales (fapt confirmat chiar de către Prinț într-un interviu video). Vlad Ţepeş (Drăculea), adevăr istoric | Concept Vlad Țepeș sau Vlad Drăculea (1431 – 1467), conducător impunător al românilor începând cu 1448, este un personaj controversat al istoriei și datorită asocierii acestuia cu personajul de ficţiune Dracula . Controversele izvorăsc din necunoaşterea istoriei României şi mediatizarea internaţională masivă dar eronată a personajului fantastic. Transylvania World îşi propune să clarifice simplu şi la obiect diferenţa între personajul istoric Vlad Țepeș (Vlad Drăculea) şi personajul fictiv Dracula. În același timp asociația noastră face înțeles rolul istoric al lui Țepeș și contrazice teoriile conform cărora domnitorul român ar fi fost un tiran. Nepot al marelui domnitor român Mircea cel Bătrân și membru al Dinastiei Drăculeștilor, Vlad Țepeș (Vlad Drăculea) s-a născut în anul 1431 în Sighişoara, petrecându-și primii ani în Transilvania şi Ungaria. A avut o copilărie grea, la 11 ani fiind luat ostatic de către turci împreună cu fratele său, suferința întâmpinată în următorii șase ani marcându-i profund viaţa. Denumirea Dracul(a) se trage de la numele tatălui său, Vlad Dracul, terminația \\"a\\" indicând în limba română că este vorba de “fiul lui” (Dracul). [1] [2] [3] Făcând parte din Dinastia Drăculeștilor, Vlad Țepeș a primit o educaţie foarte bună din partea profesorilor români şi a învățaților greci de la Constantinopol. El a dobândit în timp abilităţi tactice militare și cunoștințe de geografie, matematică, ştiinţe, arte clasice precum şi stăpânirea unor limbi străine ca vechea slavă, germană, turcă şi latină. Pentru o mai bună înțelegere a familiei din care se trage Vlad Țepeș, trebuie menționat faptul că Prințul Charles al Marii Britanii se înrudește cu domnitorul român, fapt confirmat de prinț într-un interviu video.

The building was supposed to be able to take a hit by a 707 but that was pure supposition. They used the crash of the B 25 Bomber into the Empire State Building as the example while designing the building. They never suspected some terrorist would purposely push the throttles up to increase the speed of the aircraft before it hit. The support system of both buildings is best described as an outer square steel support cage with an inner square steel support cage inside that. The floors were tensioned concrete slabs that are attached to those cages. As the plane load of fuel dumped into the flammable building material and the metals like aluminum and titanium from the aircraft burned, it created furnace like atmosphere that softened the inner support cage. Once the upper part of the building fell into the compromised section because of its weight, the tensioned floor slabs started to snap and fall creating what's called a pancake collapse. You will notice the windows blowing out on the lower floors in the videos (that the conspiracy nuts like to say was proof of explosives) from the sudden and violent increase of air pressure in the building from those floors collapsing.

What do they do to grow their company every day?","completion":"So many great answers. Will try to be useful and short. It’s really hard as CEO/co-founder to focus only on CEO things. Basically, before you set-up a proper company with all bells and whistles in place, having a CEO title is meaningless because as founder you do so much more. Because you have to. You obsess so much about it. In early days, there were only 3 of us doing a fairly complex product. I am the only non-tech founder so basically I did everything but coding and design. Especially product. I love our product and the moment we got that it really helps our customers was the moment you live for (in business, of course). So, as a founder I did fundraising, biz dev, sales, administration, networking, hiring, strategy, tactics, operations, product, support, public speaking, writing (copy, blog, brochures, pitches…)… you get the picture. Obviously, I can’t be the best in the world at all of this (at the same time). And so, this is more of a list of what every obsessed founder does because he/she has to. Not that much CEOing done. So I made it my primary job to hire people who can do those much better than me. They take them of my list of jobs one by one (same goes for my tech co-founders). But I don’t think it will ever come down to just classic CEO stuff.

Heat energy from fuel, mechanical energy from collision destroyed the strength of the building structures at and around the floors impacted.

That generated force was too much for that floor to hold up so it collapsed down to the next and so on with ever INCREASING force (weight) at some point maybe reaching straight line acceleration with only tiny bumps at lower floors. Very common scenario in computer simulations for strength of materials modeling and stuctural engineering classes. The media hyped or gave voice to every conspiracy theory of the mentally retarded. The Jews, the Bushes, Militias, and on and on all were accused. No reality check…..the media are in the salacious promo BUSINESS for money..because the public is mostly made up of inflammatory dolts.

I have no desire to make anyone else miserable just becuase they don’t agree with me about board games. That said, I have no interest in playing Munchkin ever again, because I think the game fails to deliver strategy, comedy, or drama. Munchkin *looks* like it might be a lightweight strategy game; you collect weapons, you attack monsters, you add up point values to see who wins, so maybe it’s supposed to be a way to get a classic medieval/fantasy combat experience in half an hour. The problem is that you don’t really face any meaningful strategic choices. The cards you receive are random, and your only choices are whether to use them now, use them later, or ignore them. The correct answer, strategically, is to use exactly as many cards as you need to beat any given monster, and no more. Because all of the points you get are interchangeable (e.g. it’s just “attack” points, not strength or dexterity or magic) and because there are no opportunities for synergy or interesting trade-offs, you can always see exactly what the best tactical move is, so once you know the rules, the strategy part of the game quickly loses all of its interest. Munchkin also *looks* like it might be a lighthearted comedy game; the pictures are silly, and some of the cards are clearly making fun of Dungeons & Dragons tropes. And, yeah, it’s kind of amusing for the first 15 minutes or so…but there aren’t enough jokes or enough cartoons to hold an average gamer’s interest for even one full game, let alone for a dozen games. There are no running gags or cleverly subverted expectations; it’s just a bit of caricature. Finally, Munchkin *looks* like it might be a social/drama game; maybe you’re supposed to play it with your friends and surprise each other with “take that!” cards and scheme to wind up on top. Unfortunately, this aspect of the game also falls very, very flat: the game does not really support any kind of alliances or rivalries, and it’s pretty clear who is closest to winning; if you count the cards in someone’s hand and see what level their character is at (e.g. are they Level 3, or Level 9?) then you have a very good idea of whether they’re about to reach Level 10 and win. If you want to stop them from winning, it’s very easy to play negative cards against them and stop them from winning. If, on the other hand, you are thoroughly bored with the game and just want the pain to stop, or if you’re trying to flirt with the player in the lead, then it’s very easy to not play negative cards and let them win. If you want a quick medieval strategy game, then Castle Panic or Kingsburg will be a lot more satisfying. If you want a quick comedy game, then Exploding Kittens or Cards Against Humanity is funnier. If you want a quick social game, then Secret Hitler or Werewolf will give you much more interesting dynamics to work with. If you want a combination of strategy and social drama, try Citadels, and if you want a combination of strategy and comedy, try The Order of the Stick. Munchkin *appears* to deliver all of these things, but in practice it delivers none of them. It looks very accessible and fun from the box and from a 30-second description, so my less-experienced buddies always want to play it — and I wind up feeling like a snob or a spoilsport when I turn them down…but if we do agree to play then I know that I’ll have a lousy time and my friends will have, on average, an OK time because they’re still figuring out the rules and their minds are occupied with seeing how the game works. Once you learn it, though, the game really isn’t much fun. The designer, Steve Jackson, is actually a genius — I strongly recommend his games Illuminati, Lord of the Fries, and Revolution. Steve Jackson’s GURPS, while tragically flawed, is still a profoundly impressive work of roleplaying game design that has lots of useful features that can be ‘borrowed’ for other systems."},{"prompt":"Did they ever prove that George Floyd intentionally used counterfeit money, and is there a way to posthumously charge Floyd with fraud?","completion":"Hey; it’s tough ENOUGH for the police to pin a Charge on the Living… Now you want Them to pin them on the Dead- too ?! :o"},{"prompt":"Are there any 9mm revolvers that have a capacity of 10 or more rounds?","completion":"If you want that kind of capacity go with a standard 9mm pistol and you can have larger magazines."},{"prompt":"it a sin to listen to metal core and deathcore?","completion":"Yes, it is.

But tell them they were going home, they suddenly turned into a well oiled machine rolling up their tent and getting their gear stowed long before everyone else. One of the Russians had been in Russian prison. He wasn't afraid of anyone, especially not 20 year old sergeants. They were afraid of him.

When you are caught by traffic policeman, your fine is 500 but you are willing to get away by giving up to 400 in under table bribe. You are happy, cop is happy. See, the cop has no incentive to bind with the laws and regulations. There are two ways to resolve this issue: Monitoring: This is very simple. You just arrange for a third party to monitor every policeman and citizen undergoing such transactions. However this is costly and is relevant only in case of big frauds. That is why all big firms undergo financial “auditing”.Optimal Contracting: The idea here is again very simple. You need to have a contract with the cop so that it is in his favor to not cheat. So, when I bribe the cop with 400, if there is a system through which the cop can report me and get a reward bigger than the initial 400 I offered, then why would a cop ever cheat? See, we are all here to earn money and save money. This is called rationality in economics. This is hardwired in our brain. And we are smart enough to calculate which scenario will cost us more. And then we will all bind to the contract and not indulge in cheating. People have won Nobel prize for their work in contract theory.

They mounted a top pylon on at least one, to carry experimental payloads, and then looked at modifying it to punch through the high-drag transonic regime faster with nitrous oxide injectors. I'm not joking. It dumped a huge load of nitrous (1225 kg) into the afterburner in just 169 seconds. This tells you a number of things, and one of them is that the SR-71 was already using essentially ALL of the oxygen in the air going through it! That's a completely different part of the design space than nearly any other jet engine that comes to mind. On page 6 of that paper, figure 6 shows how second stage turbine life is related to rotor speed and turbine exhaust temperature, and figure 7 shows how rotor speed and turbine exhaust temperature increases increase thrust. Bottom line, you can get about 5% more thrust from a 75 F increase in exhaust temperature, which will drop turbine life from 400 to 70 hours. Pratt & Whitney picked an operating point with an additional 150 RPM of rotor speed as well, but the paper doesn’t explain why. It’s a little difficult to get from thrust increases to speed increases, since when you go faster you fly higher to keep the dynamic pressure constant, and that keeps drag closer to constant than you might think. I did some modelling work once that suggested that 5% more thrust would get the SR-71 another 0.1 Mach (but that’s not a result published by NASA). That extra turbine temperature comes from increased compressor face temperature due to higher shock heating at the higher velocity. According to figure 6 and extrapolating from figure 7, if you pushed the turbine exhaust temperature up 150 degrees, at which point the turbine would need a rebuild after 10 flight hours, maybe you could get another 5% thrust and another 0.1 Mach."},{"prompt":"w do I install luxury vinyl flooring?","completion":"You can easily install luxury vinyl flooring installation.

The entire semiconductor industry would not be possible without Teflon because we use it as an insulator to allow measurement tiny currents common in tiny transistors. The problem is that the manufacture of Teflon is fraught with environmental peril. The precursors have been found to be non-biodegradable and cancer-causing.

[LINKED_TEXT: GenX - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GenX] The only reason it’s been accepted, used and dumped despite its environmental peril is that regulations by EPA and state EPAs take a long time to add and all chemicals a initially allowed until proven guilty even when the chemical structure strongly suggests problems will arise. Related to this is the lack of assays which can quickly, reliably and accurate predict subtle and long-term biological risks. There are some being worked on but they are not ready yet. In the mean time, only extreme and acute chemical toxicity and carcinogenicity are tested (using assays like the [LINKED_TEXT: Ames test] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames_test]) and only for “active ingredients”.

But, it will always exist, even though it will eventually be the bottom most choice. Some thoughts: THE HOURS + INADEQUATE SLEEP. According to Dr. Sleep — that is, Matthew Walker, PhD, and professor of neuroscience and psychology, and author of [LINKED_TEXT: Why We Sleep] [URL: https://news.berkeley.edu/2017/10/17/whywesleep/], Asking your teenage son or daughter to go to bed and fall asleep at ten p.m. is the circadian equivalent of asking you, their parent, to go to sleep at seven or eight p.m. No matter how loud you enunciate the order, no matter how much that teenager truly wishes to obey your instruction, and no matter what amount of willed effort is applied by either of the two parties, the circadian rhythm of a teenager will not be miraculously coaxed into a change. Furthermore, asking that same teenager to wake up at seven the next morning and function with intellect, grace, and good mood is the equivalent of asking you, their parent, to do the same at four or five a.m. Schools maintain a barbaric schedule for young teens and by clinging to this outdated model of education we are bankrupting their sleep lives placing dangerous stressors on their hearts and their immune systems, not to mention their happiness. ANXIETY. Constant assessments + social media + a feeling of helplessness = profound unhappiness. It is a well-known fact that suicide rates in children and teens [LINKED_TEXT: spikes during the school calendar. ] [URL: https://fee.org/articles/children-s-and-teens-suicides-related-to-the-school-calendar/]And it is considerably worse for boys than for girls. One finding that bears repeating comes from a large survey conducted a few years ago by the American Psychological Association, which revealed that teenagers are the most stressed, anxious people in America; that 83 percent of them cite school as a cause of their stress; and that, during the school year, 27 percent of them reported experiencing “extreme stress” compared to 13 percent reporting that during the summer. Clearly, the current model of education is bad for the mental health of our youth. NO CLEAR PURPOSE. People put their kids in schools for all kinds of reasons. They are on automatic — they went to school, their parents went to school, their grandparents went to school, and they all survived, so it must be fine.They need warehousing for their kids — parents need income and have jobs. No one really thinks about how damaging the environment might be, because they obviously can’t leave the kids at home alone.They drink the KoolAide and actually believe it is what’s best for their kids.They know it is bad but work hard to make lots of money outside of the home, and then throw that money at shrinks, tutors, consultants, and anyone who can actually help their kids. Often this works — for those who can afford it. Kids are well aware that they have no choice. They are aware of the fact that there is “no clear theory of the deal”. When there is a heavy snow and classes are cancelled, but the school opens it gymnasium for “drop off”, the students know that the role of the school is to make it possible for parents to get to work. Snow or no snow. They know that they must be handed off. When kids get most of their meals at the school, what do they think about the academics, or is school just a substitute home? When a very bright kid is forced to babysit a misbehaving, highly distractible and irritating peer , what is that bright learner supposed to believe about the system meant to help him get an education? During the PARCC testing weeks in my state, students are not permitted to READ BOOKS during the many hours of down time in between. You read that right. Students in school NOT permitted to read novels or any book for that matter. (It might sharpen their senses too much and they’d have an unfair advantage during the testing.) This might read like an Onion article, but it is true. Do you think that students do not see how learning has become utterly lost in an ocean of policy makers, bootlickers and toadies all competing for education ? The purpose of school has been scattered all over the social landscape and politicians, publishers and testing organizations take advantage of the chaos and lack of focus and purpose. They make it worse. Kids. Know. This. NO FREEDOM. Many students can blow through the work assigned to them very quickly. Are they permitted to take advanced classes? Only if they are willing to jump through multiple nonsense hoops. Can a freshman take APUSH if he/she feels ready? Very unlikely. Can a B- student do two sports? Very unlikely. Can a student who is competing in a national or international science fair take days off from school without being “docked” those days? In most schools - no. Can a student choose to study something that deeply interests him - only if the school offers the subject and if she is prepared to jump through numerous hoops. Can students act in their own self-interest during the school day from start to finish? Very, very rarely. NO FLOW. In his world-famous, best-seller, FLOW,Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi , describes a state of existence many of us have experienced. It occurs when we concentrate for a long period of time on something which is difficult, but something which brings us pleasure. For example, producing a work of art, building with legos, knitting a blanket, creating computer code, writing a story, crunching math problems — all of these things can deliver the state of flow, when the world falls away, and all we experience is the task at hand. We lose track of time. Hours may pass. The DEEP WORK we are doing is valuable — to us and to the world. Great learning takes place in this state. Do 43 minute long classes of 20+ students help to deliver students into a state of Flow? Do they get to do DEEP WORK? In his book, he describes how a person (the self) grows: To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments. To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. She has to develop the ability to find enjoyment and purpose regardless of external circumstances.” It is when we act freely, for the sake of the action itself rather than for ulterior motives, that we learn to become more than what we were. When we choose a goal and invest ourselves in it to the limits of concentration, whatever we do will be enjoyable. And once we have tasted this joy, we will redouble our efforts to taste it again. This is the way the self grows. The problem with the current education system is that mass-schooling was a bad idea from the start. It is an unsustainable model but it is all that our generation and the previous two generations have ever known. We have to dare to walk away."},{"prompt":"Do all UK people say they speak “English” and not “British English”?","completion":"English is the language spoken by the English and in UK it is the definitive version of the language.

My parents were also born and raised there. My kids were born and raised there as well. (Grandparents were raised there but born in the east, great-grandparents immigrated to the US). Lot of history there. The big problem with California is that over the years it has become far more expensive to survive there, far more crowded, and far less tolerant of other people and their viewpoints. When I grew up I had friends who I played with in the neighborhood who were black and latino and I never thought anything of it. By the time my kids were growing up the local black communities were banding together and discriminating against whites and latinos - yes, they were the primary source of prejudice - something that few of them will actually admit to - it’s always the “whites” discriminating - hard to figure how they as 17% of the LA populace could claim discrimination when we elected a black mayor sometime back - but they did and do. And it is getting worse with the intolerance of the “Woke” community (which really needs to wake up to the fact that the majority of people both within CA and the nation are not in agreement with their positions). And beyond that, the state politics shifted from a relatively balanced conservative/liberal mix, where compromise on positions was possible, to a very left leaning Democrat run position with attendant significant tax increases until we are the highest taxed state in the union. And what do we get for those taxes? Well, the cost of everything in the state is higher than surrounding states as a result, the housing is exorbitant in price, the gasoline is outrageously expensive (we pump oil, refine it, and ship gasoline to Arizona and even with the added cost of transport they sell it for over a dollar a gallon less than we pay for it locally in CA), energy is expensive, the state has some of the most restrictive pollution laws going (they encourage people to buy electric cars then turn around and charge extra fees on those cars above and beyond those on gas powered cars - not that the fees on those are at all cheap either). And I haven’t even mentioned the insane politicking on the issue of firearms. For that you just have to realize that current CA politicians are incredibly stupid and seem to think that layering more and more restrictions on LAW ABIDING Californians is going to stop criminal activity, and that releasing criminals back to the street with little to no penalty, rather than incarcerating them, is going to stop crime from occurring. And now they are trying to ban the most popular rifle in the country because it’s (typically) black and “scary” (looks like, but does not perform at all like, a military select fire automatic rifle) even though it’s used so infrequently in crime that you have to assemble the stats for the entire nation to get more that a handful of instances where it was used. Totally ignoring the fact that criminals prefer to use handguns thousands of times more frequently because they are easily concealed and easier to use. And, my favorite part, CA will allow you to have one of these scary rifles as long as you change the stock set out so it doesn’t look military - that’s like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic - changes nothing about how the rifle operates, just its look. I told you they (CA politicians) were stupid. As to what I got when I left CA - the benefits were many - I was able to get a better house with land. My Ex kept our house in So. Cal. - a 1,500 sq. ft 3 bedroom 2 bath house on a 150′x50′ lot with a single car detached garage valued at over 850K. (whoops! Just checked the valuation, now it’s listed for over 1.152M - over a million!!) While, in a moderately expensive section of Tx, I bought a 5,425 sq. ft. house with a 1,600 sq. ft. garage complex (4 Beds, 5 baths, pool & spa) in a gated community that sits on just over 4 acres (2 of them virgin forest) for 624K. My mortgage payment is lower than many apartment rents were where I used to live in California. Bit of an upgrade there. I register my cars each year for less than a quarter of what CA charged. I don’t pay a state income tax or state disability fee but do pay slightly higher property taxes - which I don’t mind as 80% goes to the local schools and the remainder to the city and county (not like in CA where the property taxes went to Sacramento to be doled back out as the Sacramento saw fit). Fact is, my savings on income tax/state disability more than pay for my mortgage and impounds (incl. property taxes) each year. And now I pay less than half what gasoline cost in CA (which, admittedly affects the cost balance of owning an electric car - but I’ll still stick with my Chevy Volts as they are the most reliable, efficient, and long term affordable cars I have ever owned). The cost of electricity here is far less than half what it was in California, although where I live, however, the cost of natural gas is a bit more than back home in CA. The roads take a bit of getting used to as local roads tend to be a bit less generous in width and the freeways all run at far higher speeds than in CA - and I mean run, not crawl like the 405 I used to drive every day. There is also a significant network of toll roads that can be used and they tend to run even faster - but you do have to be careful not to wander onto one unintentionally. Government agencies seem to function far more smoothly here - it took me 7 hours (without an appointment and before COVID) at the CA DMV to update my license to a “REAL” ID drivers license (the guy sitting with me had an appointment and only took 4 hours to do the same thing), here, in Texas (and during COVID and with no appointments at any location) it took me 4 hours total time - including driving time between locations - to get my car inspected (for safety), licensed (with plates handed me that day) at the local tax assessors office, and to get my “REAL” ID drivers license. CA has to be the inspiration for Disney’s Zootopia DMV. And it’s not just the California DMV but most other CA local or state government offices that operate with equally woeful inefficiency. And finally, on the topic of firearms, TX seems quite open to them with many shops supporting the sales of firearms and ammunition - and hunting getting a lot of positive attention. No 10 day waiting period here - pass the NICS instant background check (5 - 10 minutes) and you can walk out with your gun today (did that recently and was able to buy a modern handgun with improved safety features that CA will no allow to be sold in their state). And think about it - the 10 day waiting period is billed as a “cooling off” period - what good does it serve if you already have a gun? No limit to buy one gun a month as in CA - buy as many as you want or can afford. No stigma attached to gun ownership here and here you can actually get suppressor’s and fully automatic firearms (provided you pay for the tax stamp, pass the more extensive background check, and can find one for sale at a reasonable price - which, while possible for the suppressor, is not very likely for a fully automatic firearm (try 25,000+ - again, if you can find one that is legal to own) - but you can own one if you want, but I don’t see a need for one and, as the only crime on record committed with one in the last 35 years was by a police officer, I’m not seeing them as much of a threat). And probably the most important thing - here you can have an opinion without the liberal left or the alt right jumping down your throat. Freedom of expression exists here - you don’t have to agree but you do get your say. Refreshing. I call that freedom and worth the cost and hassle of moving from CA."},{"prompt":"What are some effective software tools that an inside sales team can use to boost productivity?","completion":"I want to suggest you a name AutoOptimize tool for increase your sales very quickly for detail about this tool please visit [LINKED_TEXT: Automatically Optimize Your Site Conversion Rate] [URL: https://autooptimize.ai/]"},{"prompt":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","completion":"Starting to make money online through affiliate marketing involves several steps.

Here's a breakdown of the key differences between the two: Version and Release Date: AngularJS (also known as Angular 1) was the first version of the Angular framework, released in 2010 by Google.Angular (also referred to as Angular 2 and later versions) is a complete rewrite of AngularJS and was first released in 2016.Architecture: AngularJS uses a two-way data binding approach, where changes in the model are automatically reflected in the view and vice versa.Angular employs a unidirectional data flow, using a hierarchical component-based architecture. Data flows in one direction: from parent components to child components.Performance: Angular introduced improvements in terms of performance, mainly due to its modern architecture. It uses a virtual DOM and change detection mechanism that is more efficient compared to AngularJS's digest cycle.AngularJS's two-way data binding and digest cycle approach can sometimes lead to performance bottlenecks, especially in complex applications.TypeScript: Angular is primarily built using TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. TypeScript improves code maintainability, provides better tooling, and catches errors at compile time.AngularJS uses standard JavaScript, which lacks the benefits of static typing that TypeScript offers.Modularity: Angular emphasizes modularity through its use of components and modules. Components encapsulate different parts of the user interface and logic, making it easier to manage and maintain large applications.AngularJS also supports modularity through directives, controllers, and services, but the organization and structure might not be as well-defined as in Angular.Dependency Injection: Both Angular and AngularJS support dependency injection, but Angular has a more advanced and built-in dependency injection system that helps manage component dependencies and improves testability.Mobile Development: Angular has better support for mobile development through tools like Angular CLI and Ionic, which allow developers to build cross-platform mobile applications.While AngularJS can also be used for mobile development, its architecture and tooling might not be as optimized for this purpose.Community and Support: Angular has a larger and more active community, with regular updates and improvements being made by the Angular team at Google. AngularJS is still in use, but its community has been gradually transitioning to Angular due to the latter's improved features and performance. In summary, Angular is a more modern and efficient framework compared to AngularJS, offering improved performance, better modularity, and enhanced tooling. If you're starting a new project, it's recommended to use Angular over AngularJS.

What does a typical day look like? What are their responsibilities? What do they do to grow their company every day?","completion":"Responsibilities and daily routines of startup CEOs highly vary, depending on their industry, the stage their startup is in, and a plethora of other factors. Unfortunately, it’s hard to get a clear perspective on exactly what CEOs do day-to-day. Too many anecdotes choose to focus on building a startup CEO up to be bigger than life. To me, this sort of stuff is useless to everyone and everything except the CEO’s ego. Let me give you an example that probably feels all too familiar: “I wake up at 3 AM. I take a brisk morning jog of 26.2 miles while listening to 3 of my favorite self-improvement podcasts simultaneously -- this saves an immense amount of time. After my run, I take an ice bath while meditating and drinking meal-replacement shake filled with all the ingredients that Silicon Valley is currently buzzing about. Then I read for 4 hours. Somehow, I still manage to arrive at the office by 6 AM. It’s important to arrive before my other employees. As the leader of the company, I need to set the standard. I check my email inbox. It’s filled with 1000 new messages. I reduce this to zero in 15 minutes. Then I take another ice bath. By now, it’s time for my 20 back-to-back high-profile client and investor meetings. I secure 10 new multi-million dollar investments and 10 new multi-million dollar clients. Between these meetings, I work on other startup ideas, just for the fun of it. The rest of my day is consumed by finalizing the development of our latest products and marketing campaigns. I usually clock in an average of 20 hours per day, every day. Weekends included. The hustle never ends. By the time I arrive home, it’s 2:30 AM -- enough time for a quick ice bath! After the ice bath, I take a 15-minute nap. Then I gear up to repeat the entire day all over again!” I know, I know. This is absolutely absurd. Forget the fact that the math doesn’t even add up! How many ice baths does one need?! These types of stories are preposterous and build unrealistic expectations in readers’ heads. Let’s get to the truth of the matter. I think I can speak for most startup CEOs on this topic -- obviously, we spend our days writing answers to Quora questions! Okay, last joke. I swear. My day’s a little more involved than that. I love your question, especially the last part: “What do they do to grow their company every day?” You pretty much hit the nail on the head with that one. This is what I focus on every day. Every day, my main mission is to make sure my team is taking the right steps towards the big picture. I view this as my main responsibility. I want to ensure the work we’re doing is actually aligned with our vision. And I imagine this is the same for many CEOs. Now, let’s go through a real walkthrough of a typical day in my shoes. I begin each morning with an inhumane amount of coffee, the elixir of startup founders everywhere! Once I get to the office, I hold a daily scrum with my team. We review high-priority tasks, assign responsibilities, and hone in on removing any blockers impeding the workflow so we can get on track and make some progress. This last part is essential. And not just for that day, but for the week ahead as well. Addressing obstacles before they blow up into bigger problems is key to saving resources. Organize your objectives, the obstacles in your way, and the steps you must take to overcome them -- this is the moment your idea starts becoming more than a thought -- it starts becoming a reality. My day-to-day highly varies after the scrum. Possibilities include client meetings, setting milestones for new agendas, and executing what needs to be done to make progress on certain projects. But again, I’d like to emphasize: a substantial portion of my day is dedicated to taking stock of current endeavors. This ensures our clients are more than happy and also makes sure that we’re staying true to Dogtown Media’s vision: to not only drive maximum impact and value but to produce products with purpose. Aligning my employees with this message is imperative. And I know this responsibility rests with me. If you’re the leader of your company, you must set the tone for your company’s vision. It’s truly the only way to stay on track towards progress. If your vision is not cohesive and coherent, your employee’s outlook on the company’s future will not be, either. It’s as simple as that. To drive things in the direction you want to go, you must share your beliefs, objectives, and strategies with your team. This allows each member to become a stakeholder in the company’s endeavors. You can accomplish this through regular check-ups with your team, leadership, and of course, yourself. You’re the captain of the ship. And continuous course correction is necessary to get where you want to go. Regularly take some time to ask yourself how you could do something better. It’s extremely beneficial! This allows you to be more cognizant of your product’s place in the world and the problems it solves. Because of this, you can tailor solutions to your clients’ challenges on a deeper level than before. Many CEOs (me included) jam-pack our days with so much that it can be tempting to put this type of thinking the backburner. But I always make it a point to prioritize it. Speaking of ‘jam-packed’... remember to take a break! This is the real secret to optimizing creativity, productivity, and effectiveness. In my case, I like to spend five to ten minutes meditating every afternoon. It not only breaks up my busy schedule, but it stops my mind from going into overload. Remember, entrepreneurship is a marathon, not a sprint. If you feel bad for taking a break because you see others cranking it out for 24 hours straight, just remember: They’re not doing themselves any favors in the long run. Once I’m done taking care of any loose ends and my day starts to cool down, I wrap it up the same way every time: I make it a point to jot down the three biggest accomplishments or wins of the day. This is crucial. Your gratitude for your present situation has a profoundly powerful impact on shaping your future. So take a second to reflect on your recent accomplishments. There’s nothing wrong with congratulating yourself with a pat on the back. For me, it’s also a great reminder of why I do what I do. Taking a second to look back does wonders for rekindling that spark and passion you felt when you first embarked on your entrepreneurial adventure. And that about does it -- a day in the life of a startup CEO. I know it’s not as sexy as some of the other stories you’ve probably heard. But I guarantee it’s more real. And it gets the job done!"},{"prompt":"w does a wave function collapse in quantum mechanics/physics?","completion":"It is fantasy meeting reality.

Whether we are looking at pictures of friends on social media, huge billboards or advertising campaigns at local departmental stores; photography is used to communicate a message or tell a story to the viewer. We may be shooting pictures every day, but how many of us know the different styles of photography that have been inspiring photographers? Understanding the different styles or genres of photography is key for developing our knowledge in the area and also for gaining an insight as to where our photography fits. Let’s look at the top 15 genres that we can draw inspiration from: Aerial Photography: As soon as our flight takes off, we love to shoot the landscape or city scene below which gives us an advantage of taking a picture from above. So, images that are captured from above is known as aerial photography. French photographer and balloonist, Gaspar Felix Tournachon, took the first aerial photograph in 1858. He experimented for three years before he could produce the photograph. He had captured the French village, Petit-Becetre, from a hot-air balloon, 80 metres above the ground. 2. Architectural photography: Capturing an interesting form, shape or colour of the structure can be visually appealing. Therefore visuals of buildings that are interesting fall under this genre. We can include interiors or exteriors of buildings and even an interesting element of the design. The two challenging aspects for photographers while shooting buildings are: Lighting and image distortion. You have only natural light while capturing the façade of the building and you have to make the best use of it to bring out the glamorous aspect. When there are horizontal and vertical lines in the building your images appear distorted. Only with the correct equipment coupled with right angles you can avoid the snag. 3. Candid photography: This is a very popular genre of photography. Moments captured spontaneously as they happen is known as candid photography. The subjects are usually not aware of the photographer, so they appear very relaxed. Wedding photography is a perfect example of this style of photography. A tip: Use a long zoom while capturing candid moments. This will help your subjects to be more relaxed and natural, as they will be unaware of you photographing them. 4. Documentary photography: Manual pictures that form a photo story come under this style. It is about a particular subject or a story that a photographer wants to highlight. They are all objective pictures and can be about a war, social issues, science and so on. When you are chronicling significant events, for instance, the life of a celebrity or a sportsman, plan to spend some time with the person; chat; listen and capture what comes naturally. Try and capture details and let your pictures tell a story. Do not try to shoot something that is not a part of his or her life. 5. Fashion photography: Typically used to sell something, this type of photography lures customers by glamorising the product. They are generally very creative and visually very interesting and can be taken in any location like a studio, an apartment, a rundown building or anywhere outdoors. A fashion photographer should always prepare in advance. In this genre of photography, the location, lighting, makeup, stylists and the model play a significant role. However, you should also be open to ideas and suggestions, as it involves a lot of team work. 6. Food photography: Whether we are sharing an image of food served at a restaurant or on our dinner table, almost everyone seems to be at it today. This type of photography is used by restaurants, websites or bloggers to entice customers to try and sell their products. A Tip: One of the most crucial factor in food photography is to use natural light. Always remember to turn off the flash. It’s a big ‘No’ in this style of photography. When you use flash, many unwanted elements get captured. For instance, your food might look greasy and the actual colours get washed out. 7. Landscape photography: This is one of the most popular types of photography, as it can portray a scenery, or can even show an impact of environmental change. We all love to capture a beautiful landscape when we see one. However, we need to wait for the right light to capture that perfect moment. Also, while shooting a landscape, if you want a sharp image, use a tripod which will help eliminate the camera shakes. Using a long shutter speed can give you the perfect shot. For example, if you are capturing the waves, it will turn to a smooth white and moving clouds will turn wispy. 8. Night-long exposure photography: It’s a great way to capture how the world transforms after dark. This type of photography requires good knowledge of how we use light, shutter speed and aperture. These types of photos are interesting as the viewer gets to see some unusual aspects that cannot be seen by the naked eye. To takes such shots, it is imperative to be comfortable with our camera’s manual mode and implement the correct settings. 9. Photojournalism: This photography is similar to the documentary genre. The only difference here is that a photographer captures live events as and when it happens and informs the world about it. Examples of this style of photography is what we see every day in newspapers, magazines etc. Photojournalism is not about shooting unexpected events, but about capturing unexpected moments at events that are planned. It is serious journalism and a person needs to plan it right to be at the right place and at the right time. 10. Conceptual/ fine art photography: Images that tell a story come under this genre. In terms of conceptual/ fine art photography, we can create our own fiction with characters in made-up environment. However, the photographer needs to have a vision of what their picture will look like, as this genre is all about an emotion, an idea or a message. The photographer tries to convey a message through his image. 11. Portraiture: Capturing peoples’ moods and expressions is an intriguing subject for photographers. They can be close-up images, body portraits etc. Typically the face is the focus of this type of photography. While taking a portrait, the photographer should ensure that the subject’s face is sharp and focussed, especially his or her eyes. The subject’s pose should also be flattering. To capture a person’s natural expressions, the photographer should lighten the mood by cracking a joke or two. 12. Sport photography: This category involves getting up-close to the action in a very fast-paced and action-packed setting. Sports events are captured with very long lenses as we usually see photographers during an event. A Tip: Always use a high ISO. Increasing the ISO on your camera will enable you to shoot at a higher shutter speed; consequently giving you the perfect shot. Try to be original and get something different by getting different angle shots. 13. Street photography: Capturing ordinary, everyday life in public spaces or life as it happens is known as street photography. It is very similar to candid photography, but the photographer documents the public space as he or she sees it. A street photographer should not just look at the popular tourist spots, but he or she should try out some real-life scenes coupled with some behind the scene images. They must be observant about every little aspect around them. As soon as they see a story unfold, they should not hesitate to capture the moment. 14. War photography: Capturing images of conflicts in war-torn areas fall under this genre. War photographers usually put their life in danger to cover the event. War photography can even document the aftermath of war. A war photographer should always simplify the photography kit, as he/she should not be bothered about changing lenses etc. Carrying heavy equipment is also a big ‘no’ because there might be circumstances where he or she will be better off with less equipment. 15. Wildlife photography: This is a very challenging type of photography, as it might be difficult to capture animals in their proper habitat. This style requires proper technical skills and it needs to be planned accordingly. In wildlife photography, you need to be absolutely comfortable with your camera’s settings. If you are not quick enough, you might miss the perfect shot. The key to taking a good photograph is to go ahead and have fun while you shoot. Your pictures will speak for itself no matter which genre you choose."},{"prompt":"w can I improve my Quora writing skills?","completion":"Grammarly plugin for Google Chrome.

He had a favourite Ikea carpet that he’d sleep on, but, sometimes he’d even sleep on the hardwood floor. During that year he also decided to stop wearing diapers at night. Needless to say there were no mattress protectors made for carpets and we no longer have that carpet :). At one point his younger brother spent a night or two sleeping on his own carpet. That didn’t last and he promptly went back to his own bed. Our eldest is now 7, sleeps in his own bed all the time, is well behaved at school and is the most well read 7 year old you’ll ever meet.

In credit card terms, debt is in the form of a charge to a customer’s bank card account. A credit card debt can be incurred to a credit card account through use of the card to purchase goods or services, by cash withdrawal at an ATM, or by use of “convenience checks.” Credit card debts have higher interest rates than rates for other types of loans. That’s because they are unsecured debts, unlike mortgages or car loans, in which the lender can seize property if the debt is unpaid. I had a situation where the client was very very depressed and she was so excited knowing that if she came to me to give my services, she will be able to buy a home and i look back over the seven years i have been cleaning credit reports and all kind of credit debt that everyone comes in fearful, scared, depressed and that it’s amazing that they come out with the new home, new car, and life is it. they feel invigorated because of what we have achieved together..

I just don’t get why it needs to do that if we’re basically our brains.","completion":"All the previous comments about dopamine notwithstanding, it’s important to understand that the brain is a biological computer (for lack of a better word.) In the same way that the internal messaging of a desktop computer is accomplished by moving electrons around, the internal operations of the brain are chemical, and are accomplished by the release and uptake of neurotransmitters (and at an even more fundamental level, electrons too). So the release of dopamine, or serotonin, or any neurotransmitter is in fact the way that your brain “just tells itself’ to do anything at all. Hope that addresses your question.

Pierrepoint took his duty very seriously and aimed to ensure that the process was as swift and painless as possible. He developed his own technique to calculate the exact length of rope needed for each execution, considering factors like the prisoner's weight, height, and physical condition, to ensure an instant death. Interestingly, after retiring, Pierrepoint became a vocal critic of the death penalty. He wrote in his autobiography, \\"I have come to the conclusion that executions solve nothing and are only an antiquated relic of a primitive desire for revenge.\\" This change in perspective contributes to the view of him as a more humane figure in the history of executioners."},{"prompt":"What would you do if you woke up beside Kamala Harris?","completion":"I’m a confirmed Republican right wing conservative.

However, I wouldn’t want to support such sentiments and superstitions. Simply because, if you consider it to be a boon or a something, you will start expecting something good to happen in your life. It may or may not happen. If some good does happen, you will tell every one that it is because of that the garland fell down on your head. If nothing changes, you will think why nothing happened despite the garland falling on your head. If something bad happens, you can also create that since trishul fell on your head, you have an inner demon and so on. The problem with these thoughts is that in all these thoughts, you lose being the devotee of Durga. Let it be simple. Keep your devotion to the Lord clear. Don’t let such things disturb. Regardless of these incidents, your life will happen the way it is destined to. If you keep an open mind, all the events in life, good and bad, can be accepted as the will of God and live peacefully. Otherwise, you will complicate life further. It is not required to do so. Hope this helps.

The explanation lies in Outside-in vs. Inside-out approach. ‘Outside-in approach' implies Aryans/ Vedas/ Sanskrit came to India from outsideWhile, ‘Inside-out approach' implies people & langauge went from India to outside Why should the whole similarity between Sanskrit and European languages should be seen as outside-in process, and not inside-out process. after all, there is no archaeological evidence so far to support large scale Aryan invasion or migration coming into India Couldn't it be possible that this similarity between languages exist, because people from India went outside into other countries and mingled with local people, which led to development of local languages drawing from Sanskrit ? after all, Hind numerals were carried to Middle-East by Arab traders hence became Arab numerals. Later it was carried to Europe through Arab-Europe interaction where it became modern numerals (0, 1, 2, …, 9, 10)similarly, Upanishads were first translated into Persian, from where it got translated into EnglishMartial arts went from India to ChinaBuddhism went from India to South-east Asia Nobody gives a theory that since Buddhism is so much similar to Hinduism, hence Hindus/Prakrit* etc should have come to India from China ?? (*Prakrit is the language in which many buddhist texts were written at that time) 2. The other explanation could be open source vs. closed source langauges English is like an open source language, which continuously absorbs words from various other langauges (including Hindi) as it is, that's why Oxford dictionary keeps growing biggerOther langauges may not absorb words like that. For instance, Sanskrit focuses more on word construction from roots. Both the above reasons (1 & 2) are based more on logic, rather than any concrete evidence. But, so is the case of Aryan or Sanskrit migration theory — the whole theory is based on selective literary interpretation by some European scholars, instead of any solid archaeological evidence or literary reference.

The DCAU version of Wonder Woman was a fucking badass. Cartoon Wonder Woman was able to pull off feats that the live-action Wonder Woman can’t do. Unfortunately she never got her own solo series, but Wonder Woman was great in Justice League. I’ve never been a fan of the Lynda Carter version. Maybe I would be if I was old enough to remember it, but looking at it today, I find it corny and boring. Gal Gadot was great in 2016’s Wonder Woman.

North Hollywood shootings occurred almost a decade after California banned them and 3 years after the AWB / Brady bill of 1994 . During the AWB AR15 style weapons quadrupled in manufacturing and sales. Crime supposedly dropped. So if crime decreased and sales increased then we have to conclude that gun sales doesn’t have anything to do with crime statistics. the biggest problem that we face is that 70–80 Percent of all major cities have either a democrat as major or democrats in the city government (often both). forget national politics for a moment we are directly impacted by local governments. if your community has higher than average crime rates then it’s your local governments fault (not guns) my local government banned gun shows completely as did most cities in Texas .

Buying the right mattress can be tricky. But I recommend you go to a store rather than buying one online. As this way you can experience the mattress before you decide to buy one. You can also follow the checklist below to help you buy the right mattress.

All you get is a decently good feeling, especially if you have chronic pains then you feel good as your pain ebbs away EDIT: I should also mention that just like with cannabis, kratom also has different strains producing different effects. For example, there are some that is more energizing and keeping you clear headed so you can go on through your workday more easily. On the other side of the coin, there are other strains that can knock you out on the couch (couchlock) but those ones are also the best for pain relief. I believe people are starting to make different hybrids, like people do with cannabis, to produce strains that can keep you energized so you can get through work but also with good pain relief without making you pass out. So far kratom is still fully legal in Canada, so Canadians here can order different strains online. Not sure what’s going on between the DEA and the FDA in the USA, as far as I know they’re still fighting about it’s legality (while it’s still technically legal, there has still been seizures and arrests made because of kratom) and still haven’t come to any kind of conclusion.

There are guidelines which to me indicate that she probably should, but they are not binding law. Recusal at all levels of courts in the US is primarily voluntary, and judges are expected to do so when there is even the possibility that there would be an appearance of bias. But they are not required to do so. In this case, the fact that the person who appointed her to the court creates an obvious appearance of bias, but unless the US DOJ takes the matter up the chain, there will be no order for her to recuse herself.

Do you like the world science has lead you to?","completion":"Science for one example has achieved a lot of medical advances. Science, not prayer. I see science has helped recognize “sins” like homosexuality as more acceptable and there seems to be less discrimination happening. As well as other differences. Religion? Haha, we still have abortion bans because Jesus said it’s wrong and a bunch of conservative assholes still take away individual rights due to their beliefs being the right and only. This recently resulted in a 10 year old rape victim forced to have the baby the rapist pigs sperm had a hand in creating. god or gods are intangible human created “things” that never sometimes even change (eg old school baptist etc), but change, whether we like it or not, is something the world is constantly doing. We need to try to adapt to new ideas, which can’t be grafted on a closed mind. It must be open. Things like race and sexual identity discrimination for example, keep us divided and weak. A lot of religion keeps us the same. I trust scientific advancement a lot due to it being far more tangible than any theist belief.

He puts himself on our level quite a bit. At least he used too, hopefully he’s still doing it. Michael always seemed very high up there, kind of unapproachable to us humans. At least to me. They both have extremely important jobs. In my opinion their equal on that level, Michael has been known to speak to humans on God’s behalf, not as often as Gabriel. And Gabriel has been known to go into battle alone, Probably not as often as Michael. I am also aware that some people think Michael is really Jesus, I don’t share in that particular belief. There is no where in the Bible that states that, or even that Jesus was ever an Angel. Jesus himself said he was in Heaven and watched Satan fall, and described what he looked like as he fell. But he never said he was an Angel, After all God isn’t an Angel and he’s always been in Heaven. Anyway Gabriel gets my pitiful vote.

It’s a sweeping study of bureaucratic dysfunction caused by a “poisonous, disloyal atmosphere” that engulfed the White House and federal agencies tasked with dealing with Covid-19, protests over police brutality, and the transfer of power to a Biden administration. Among the plethora of galling anecdotes, Leonnig and Rucker reveal that Trump expected the FDA to approve remdesivir as a Covid-19 treatment because Oracle founder Larry Ellison said it worked, that chief of staff Mark Meadows considered Anthony Fauci a “fearmonger” and blocked his TV appearances, and that Rudy Giuliani’s advice to Trump on election night was to “just say we won.” Unfortunately, the book’s moment-by-moment accumulation of detail grows dull at times, and the desire of Leonnig and Rucker’s largely anonymous sources to shift blame and preserve their own reputations makes it hard to parse what actually happened during controversial events such as the violent removal of protestors from Washington, D.C.’s Lafayette Square for a Trump photo op.

Would you still have to have a priest?","completion":"A marriage happens when a recognized official signs the marriage certificate and the certificate is turned into the courthouse to be recorded. That's it. Everything else is unnecessary ceremony. The official signing the certificate can be a priest or other church leader. But it can also be a judge, a clerk of court, a notary public, the captain of a ship, a holder of public office such as a mayor and a few other depending on jurisdiction. Religious persons may choose to have their marriage recognized by the church they attend and have the ceremony presided over by their church leader. But that is optional. The ceremony has no meaning as far as the state is concerned. The marriage is not legally recognized unless the certificate is signed and turned into the courthouse. In fact some churches were conducting marriage ceremonies for same sex couples who could not legally marry at the time. The couple was accepted and their union recognized by the church, but not by the state. A couple does not have to have a ceremony at all. As long as they fill out the marriage license, it is signed by an official recognized by the court and submitted, the marriage is legal. As I stated before.

The iPhone 6 Plus sold well because there was a lot of demand for an iPhone with a bigger screen. Other than that, the iPhone 6 was just another incremental improvement from the previous model.

Once nonduality is realized you will no longer need dualistic training wheels to realize what life is, as you will know life beyond the form life. Worshipping a deity is done by those who may become loving by doing it but will never know themselves as their nondual and immortal God that they worship for the love they think they receive from him. So, worship is a tool used to cultivate the emotions of God with. Devotion to truth or a god using the dualistic human faculty of emotions, it works for realizing the truth in some way, but it is not full-on transcendence that enlightenment offers. With full enlightenment, devotion to the will of God is as automatic as breathing. So is gratitude for existence. No need to worship, one is the object of worship, and therefore everything is seen as such, as worthy of love and as loving. This is only because of the Spirit that comes to live in you.

Overtraining occurs when a runner does not allow their body enough time to recover from long and hard runs. When you start running, you are going to make some incredible progress in a short period of time. You can get overly concerned with extending your PRs, personal records. Your body needs to rest and recuperate to keep on performing at a high level. If you don't let your muscles, ligaments, and tendons rest you could experience tendonitis, shin splints, plantar fasciitis or other overuse injuries. My advice is don't run more than 5 days a week, and 4 is even better. Stretch after you run. Race strategy includes going out too fast and not training far enough. If you get caught up in the race pace and go out too fast, the last mile or two is going to really suck. Run smart, pick your first mile or two pace and run slightly under it. Then start your next mile or two pace and eun slightly under it so that you finish strong. You will be passing a lot of PEOPLE who went out too fast, or did not train well. They will be fading while you are seemingly getting stronger. And passing them helps you feel better. If you fail to run far enough in training your races will find you fading at the end of the race. If you are going to tun a 10k race, make sure you can run at least 5 miles without stopping. If you are going to do a half marathon make sure you can run at least 11 miles before attempting that distance."},{"prompt":"What are some travel tips for an Indian visiting Bhutan?","completion":"7 travel tips that I live by: Pick a destinationLook after your healthInvestigate your destination… [LINKED_TEXT: How to Plan Your Trip In 7 Steps1.

Here are some tips: 1. Maintain a healthy diet: Eating a balanced diet that is low in processed foods, sugar, and saturated fats can help reduce overall body fat, including fat in the face. 2. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water can help flush out toxins and reduce bloating in the face. 3. Incorporate cardiovascular exercise: Regular cardiovascular exercise, such as running, cycling, or swimming, can help burn calories and reduce overall body fat, including in the face. 4. Engage in strength training: Strength training exercises, such as weightlifting or resistance band workouts, can help build muscle and increase metabolism, which can help reduce overall body fat. 5. Practice facial exercises: Specific facial exercises, such as blowing air into a balloon or making exaggerated facial expressions, can help tone the muscles in the face and reduce the appearance of fat. 6. Get enough sleep: Getting enough sleep can help regulate hormones that affect appetite and metabolism, which can help reduce overall body fat. It's important to note that spot reduction, or targeting fat in a specific area of the body, is not possible. Therefore, a combination of overall weight loss and targeted facial exercises may be necessary to reduce face fat. It's also important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise or diet program."},{"prompt":"What are the musthave iPhone apps?

There’s a funny/vexatious event that happened approximately a month ago. First, watch: That’s an excerpt of a trashy sensationalist TV show that is actually quite popular here in Brazil. The anchorman declares that they are showing scenes of Trump’s new driver test. A limousine driving backwards at full speed is part of the escape tactics that the driver must guarantee (according to him). He even knew the rules for approval, as he states during the scene: “if the driver gets out of track, he’s out”. A co-host adds that, although it is hard to get the job, it has an excellent wage. LOL! That’s a fragment of XBOX “FORZA 6” gameplay. But I think everybody (except to those ”journalists” and their editors) know that. (I know that is not exactly the answer that you’re looking for. But it is so ridiculously funny, I thought it’s not fair to keep that only here in Brazil)."},{"prompt":"f you were ancient Egyptian royalty, would you renounce your gods and trade a life of riches and luxury to walk with Moses in the desert?","completion":"No, why would I do that ?

Similarly there was no accepted after life - so tell me, why would I renounce the other gods, the riches or the luxury ? (thats if you believed a word of it - frankly I find the Egyptian pantheon more plausible and more worshippable than the old testament god - which is more or less the Jewish interpretation). Question: If you were ancient Egyptian royalty, would you renounce your gods and trade a life of riches and luxury to walk with Moses in the desert?"},{"prompt":"w do you know dinosaurs actually existed just other than fossils?","completion":"I watched Jurassic Park."},{"prompt":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","completion":"hello if you work in affiliate marketing and want to make 1000 dollars per day this ebook is where you will find the secrets of success in affiliate marketing : [LINKED_TEXT: digitalceela.gumroad.com/l/Affiliatemarketing] [URL: http://digitalceela.gumroad.com/l/Affiliatemarketing]"},{"prompt":"Can 3070 run 4K 120Hz?","completion":"Yes. (the answer cannot be ‘No”!) Since the answer obviously has to be “yes” I am wondering if you actually only meant to ask “Can 3070 run in 4K at 120fps?” To fully understand why yes, a few things to keep in mind: 1) 120Hz is a property of the monitor. Everything displayed on a monitor running at 4K/120Hz runs at a native resolution of 4K and a native frame (fresh) rate of 120Hz. These two properties are fixed, until you reconfigure the monitor to run at a different resolution and/or a different frequency. 2) The 120Hz number has little to do with the frame rate of your game. As long as your computer fully supports your monitor (you need to check the connection cable, typically it has to be a display port v2 or equivalent or better, otherwise there may not be enough data to pass to your monitor to fully support a high frame rate at 4K), you can configure it to run in the 4K/120Hz mode, regardless what you want it to display. Which means: even if your 3070 can run only at, say, 12 frame rate per second (12fps), your monitor is still running at 4K/120Hz. 3) The frame rate of your game is dynamically determined, meaning: it can be higher or lower than 120Hz. If it’s higher than 120, only 120 frames will be displayed, all others discarded. If it’s smaller than 120, the monitor will display everything and have to repeat certain frames. 4) Whether or not 3070 can run your games at 4K/120fps depends on what games you run. Older games can upscale to 4K and should have no problem running at 120fps (Note: not all games are designed to run at 120fps = Notably, Skyrim is designed to run only at up to 60fps. If you force it to run at 120fps, a lot of things in the game will have a weird behavior and many characters may not have enough time to finish their scripted dialogs). In this case, 3070 may be considered an overkill. On the other hand, no graphics card is too much for those graphically intense games capable of utilizing latest graphical features such as ray tracing. In this case, 3070 is not enough. 3080 is not enough. 3090 is not enough. No GPU is fast enough. You’ll have to lower video settings to push to 120fps - even by doing so, you are not guaranteed to be able to reach 120fps. For example, 3080Ti is only fast enough to get half of 144 fps on my 4K/144hz monitor while running Far Cry 6 in 4K, regardless on Low or on Ultra."},{"prompt":"Do you believe in karma? Why or why not?","completion":"According to Buddhism, you ARE your karma. Your actions - both inner and outer - make you who and how you are. And in turn, that determines who/what you are attracted to … andwho/what is attracte to you. There is some scientific support for some of this: Every inner/outer actions creates imprints in our brain. And 95% of our actions and emotions arise automatically from whatever kind of imprints we have created in our brain. Moreover, everyone is constantly subtly sending out subconscoius cues about who they are, and we are constantly subconsciously reading the cues of others and responding accordingly. So the nature of our imprints determines our interactions with others .. and to a large extent, much of what happens to us depends on what others offer to us. Even in Buddhism, not everything that happens to us depends on our karmas .. for instance, natural disasters: sometimes we are just in the wrong place at the wrong time."},{"prompt":"What are some UX basics that every software technology entrepreneur must know?","completion":"Many good answers but I’d like to add to the pile.

Rents are not determined by whim or emotion. They are totals of property/other taxes and fees, insurance, some or all utilities and maintenance. There are often also property management costs and the landlord's time and risk. The best way a tenant can reduce their rent is to purchase their own property.

In Australia, there’s nothing to prevent people going to the doctor excessively when they aren’t sick. But this isn’t a problem. It’s a benefit. There’s nothing to discourage people from visiting the doctor when they have what they consider to be minor symptoms. This means that our doctors get to diagnose people with serious issues much earlier, which actually means that we save money, because many of those issue can be treated much cheaper at an earlier stage, than they can at later stages. Sure some people will visit the doctor for reasons that turn out to be nothing. But the ability to diagnose serious illness at an early stage far outweighs the cost of doctors seeing people with no health issues. When there is a cost to visit the doctor, people delay visiting the doctor until their minor illness, that can be quickly and cheaply treated, has turned into a serious illness that costs a significant amount of money to treat and may even lead to death."},{"prompt":"What is the best Bollywood song for caller tune?","completion":"Dheere Dheere Se Meri Zindagi Mein Aana (From \\"Aashiqui\\") ...Ve Maahi. ...O Mere Dil Ke Chain. ...Maiyya Mainu.

Why did they use red anyway?","completion":"A few years ago I read a fascinating explanation about why barns are red - and it was all about astrophysics. Here’s the link to the summary - unfortunately the source article seems to be no longer available.

The iron residue comes to Earth through dust and meteorites, and oxidizes on Earth’s surface. The abundance of iron oxide makes it inexpensive as a pigment for red paint, so therefore it is commonly used on large surfaces such as barns.

However, problem in relationships start with unexpected events that happen, if we do not define and self-control our relationships. Any relationships needs a defining of its rights and duties. In the absence of such a definition, one cannot self-discipline our relationships because of the fictitious nature of being human. We are intellectual beings moving a physical body. This is not the fact about human beings. The truth about human being is that our personality is a fiction. Until we become a true personality (intellectual being), we are in the negative status of existence. Because of this negativity, we feel fear, emptiness and inferiority of being oneself. Because of these feelings, we are badly in need of anchors in life. Any relationship serves as an anchor in the helplessness of being human. Friendship is the easiest and (comparatively) risk free form of relationship. Friendship is a relationship without commitments. All other relationships has a purpose and commitment to the purpose. Because friendship does not have any commitments, it is the most attractive form of socializing and enjoying life. However, friendship too has its dangers. When friends become foe, it is a disaster for both sides."},{"prompt":"Why did JFK have affairs?","completion":"Because he was a sex addict and got away with it."},{"prompt":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","completion":"There are several good options for a car under 10 lakhs in India, depending on your preferences and specific needs.

State Sen. Leland Yee, gun control champion, heading to prison for weapons trafficking] [URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/02/25/ex-calif-state-sen-leeland-yee-gun-control-champion-heading-to-prison-for-weapons-trafficking/] Today’s nature of law is business. It used to be ethics and morality. I don't know what people believe - nor do I care. But I do know that the laws are designed to eventually eliminate all public ownership of weapons. “Gun reform” will eliminate the right to own a firearm. Gun Control has three main euphemisms: Gun safety: which is ridiculous, because more appropriately applied those means being safe with a gun. It's one of the first things you learn at any gun class, or by a range instructor. Gun reform: You can’t reform an inanimate object, and tens of millions of Americans know that guns aren’t in and of themselves a problem. Gun violence prevention: The term “gun violence” puts the focus on guns rather than perpetrators; when did you last hear about an example of “knife violence”? Gun violence prevention was pushed by Hillary Clinton. She's absolutely against the ownership of private firearms... Meanwhile: Hilly C. shopping in Rome, surrounded by armed guards... Gun reform is a 12-step plan designed to return us to a feudal society where only lords, their royal relatives, and their security (guards, police, military) can legally own weapons. It is one among many slow changes designed to lobotomize the social mind of self-volition. For the most part, humans are quite capable of self-governance. The problem today is not that more people are committing crimes, but that more people are made more aware of crimes, through modern technology and media, that crimes that are committed. Gun buy-backs are bad for local safety and they offer greater opportunities for criminals to prey on those who could otherwise equalize any personal threat. Gun buy-backs are the result of the power-hungry who are afraid to lose their power. The problem with gun buy-backs is that they are a sign of a weak society. Weak people do not produce or create, because self-driven mentalities are discouraged by governments that want weak people. If We are the People of the United States of America are the source of our government's power, why should we agree to lose our power and equality unless we prefer serfdom, i.e. slavery? The empires that existed in China made weapon ownership illegal for fire millennia. On the good side though, stupid politicians are generally balanced out by a few smart folks. All the places that made weapon ownership illegal also brought various types of martial arts into the world."},{"prompt":"[math]S[/math]","completion":"Ignoring the fact that it might be circular, there is a kind of proof here: [LINKED_TEXT: Universal Proof of Natural Deduction] [URL: https://emporium.quora.com/Universal-Proof-of-Natural-Deduction]"},{"prompt":"What is sprint planning?","completion":"The purpose of sprint planning meeting is to define what can be completed during the next sprint and decide how the work will get done and by who.

The narcissist relationship partner's significant other is the \\"giver.\\" In regard to this answer the narcissist is a covert narc as opposed to a grandiose narc. Although both narcs are in general inordinately selfish, there are some notable differences. The grandiose narc is often a high achiever; the covert narc, in general, far more likely to be non-achiever. Hence, he has low self esteem in addition to other characteristics and traits on the taker list below. The “Giver\\": •is a rare commodity •is compassionate •is empathetic •is capable of being judiciously selfless (not to giver’s detriment) •gives unconditionally but not senselessly •will honor integrity of the relationship •gives judiciously— not to own detriment •giver likely to hear himself saying over and over, “try to see this from my perspective too.” The “Taker” •trusts no one •lacks empathy •lacks self-awareness •under a layer a false bravado the taker believes that the giver would not want to maintain an interest in him •will bail if there is the slightest whiff of rejection •has weak sense of self •prone to be attracted to those who will enhance financial standing, status, or sense of specialness. •prone to convert feelings of shame, guilt, humiliation, embarrassment to anger. Thereafter, off loads the anger onto giver. •low EQ •prone to feel that those who find fault with his behavior to be merely jealous •avoids shame at all costs •not eager to be alone •prone to believe his “specialness” is either not recognized or misunderstood •easily bored. •once SO vests emotionally boredom likely soon follow •will focus on enhancing physical appearance which is of primary importantance •can been a highly intuitive asset miner •procrastinator •can present as charming in spurts •thrill seeker •not prone to ask for help as he would think it would cause him to be perceived as weak •can not delay gratification •if he is not center on conversation, he will change subject back to himself, get fidgety, stair off into space or simply leave the scene. •wooden behavior and plastic smiles •internally aware that many people wince in either embarrassment or emotional pain due to his social blunders, externally appears to not care about how he is perceived •prone to hang back and observe others behaviors in different social contextual situations to learn/adopt appropriate behavioral skills •if he experiences “a wake up call” he may demonstrate that he has the capability to understand how to engage in a adult relationship. However, likely to revert back to old ways once the “wake up call issue” is resolved. •prone to utilize passive-aggressive maladaptive coping mechanisms to punish giver •people are grouped into categories, ever cognizant of status markers •may start looking for giver’s flaws as early as love bombing stage. These flaws will not be alluded to until devaluation phase when he needs to instigate a fight which will serve as pretext for preemptive bailing •whatever attributes he admired giver for during love bombing phase will be the very attributes for which he devalues giver during devaluation phase • “go to” punishment tool is the silent treatment which is his way of saying giver is too insignificant to acknowledge •if not treating, will assert that has a penchant for bad girls/bad boys. In actuality is a low self esteem issue. •in the work place careful not to leave his “finger print” anywhere near the chaos he creates so that he is not identified as the chaos generator •prone to choreograph an exit strategy for bailing on giver once new acquisition source is fully groomed for replacement duties •will not “own” his issues •tried to compartmentalize life so that bad acts are hidden from new acquisition source •is consciously aware that he can stop loving a SO without residual feelings. •if he succeeds in timing out a giver who reaches out to him, he will believe he has “won” •shame is his Achilles heal; shame is the ultimate anathema that must be avoided at all costs •prone to feel anxious, but will try hard not to show it •exploits people without mercy •vulnerability is avoided at all costs •prone to “ghost” former givers •will cut of his nose to spite his face rather than admit feeling vulnerable •does not think of long-term consequences •lives from minute to minute •often knows truth deep down •will aggressively pursue that what he wants, may feign “shyness” •gravitates to distortion and mirrors •abhors self and reflection(s) of any kind Taker/Narc is Self-Interested/Opportunistic The only time giver’s needs are even considered is when by happenstance they intersect with taker’s and/or if taker needs something from giver. Therefore, without either of the aforementioned criteria met, the giver is not likely to receive: •a thank you •words of appreciation •taker likely has great respect for giver’s character traits. Nonetheless, he will belittle the very traits he admires. •If giver is well liked, taker will downplay giver’s objective likability. Rather, taker will assert people only like giver because they can get something from giver. (NB, example of projection) •unsolicited words of encouragement •concern about giver’s emotional and/or physical well-being •unsolicited assistance with errands •an apology for cruel/insensitive/self-serving behavior •remorse •a compliment — without a disclaimer attached •concern about giver’s family •a request for giver’s opinion (unless taker needs something) •congratulations for a job well done Hypocrisy If taker and giver agree upon an informal relationship code of conduct, the taker will verbally flay giver alive for any perceived violations. On the other hand, taker will be inclined to ignore any previously made agreements. Despite taker’s commitment to honor his word, taker will shamelessly commit the same relationship violations over and over. Taker’s life is fraught with patterns of the same mistakes made over and over in part due to: •revisionist history •selective memory •living in the now in order to avoid thinking about past wreckage/damage inflicted and possible future ramifications that may be a consequence of impulsive actions. •disassociative amnesia •wholesale new narrative construction •lack of desire to self-reflect •lack of whole object relations •lack of object constancy •lack of empathy •pathological lies Taker is ever the hypocrite. •if giver doesn’t immediately return a text or pick up taker’s call, there is hell to pay •when giver texts or calls taker, taker will get to it when he gets to it. (unless he needs something) •taker will tell giver relationship betrayals are cardinal sins if they are committed against taker •if taker betrays the giver; the taker exclaim’s “what’s the big deal” — taker will further say to giver “get over yourself.” •taker will express his righteous indignation when he frequently incorrectly perceives giver’s comments are a slight concerning his competence or intelligence. •When giver objects to taker’s cruel comments that were intended to demean giver, taker will insinuate that giver is overly sensitive or has an “insecurity problem” (Taker will attack utilizing many variations of this blatantly hypocritical “role-reversal” theme; however, there is one constant — they are all flagrant attempts to hold giver responsible for taker’s mean-spirited actions Taker will assert: “What is your problem?” “Why are you so sensitive?” “I did not mean it like that.” “You do not control me.” “You know I exaggerate; I did not mean it the way you think I did.” “Can’t you take a joke.” “Come on, it was NBD.” “Victim!” “I was only kidding.” “This so simple. You do not to complicate it.” “I have got to be free.” “You need to grow up!” “Start acting like an adult.” “You are not the victim here.” “What….now?” “You can take the adult out of the kid, but you can’t take the kid out of the adult.” “You need help?” “I need to start taking care of me!” “Maybe you need to see someone for your sensitivity issues.” “How did I hurt your feelings now?” “I need to focus on me.” “Grow up.” Taker's Body Language Taker corresponding body language when making the foregoing comments: shoulders arched, arms extended, palms up, brow furrowed, and eye roll as if to say with feigned innocence, “What did I do?” Taker-Giver Hypocritical Event Chain: ••taker continually wants to know who giver is with, what giver is doing, and where giver is ••and/or makes it patently clear that certain betrayals are unacceptable. ••giver with integrity honors their informal agreement(s) ••taker’s continues to clearly telegraph which behaviors would be considered a relationship betrayal however, in the meantime, taker ••turns cell phone face down at all times ••keeps giver in the dark about taker’s checkered relationship history ••insists on only receiving emails rather than texts ••surreptitiously hides flirtations on social media, adventures on dating sites, and contacts with other acquisition sources. ••often addicted to social media.

Before they are cut apart, the individual dies (chips) are tested for speed. Each die will have a different maximum speed, but all of the dies on that wafer will be rated the same as the slowest die. Because most of the dies are capable of faster speeds, this allows overclocking, a method of operating a CPU at a faster clock speed than it is labeled for.

And how do you move on in everyday life?","completion":"Hello! tomorrow I am 2 months of NC. It's costing me a lot. At times, I would like to write to her and ask her questions, scream in her face, I would like to be able to get rid of the anger, the emptiness that I have inside me ... the doubts, the fears, the anguish. On the other hand I still want to take revenge on her, but I know it would not help. I read a lot about narcissism and codependence. I read a lot here on Quora about people's experiences, about how they survived narcissistic abuse. It's so sad. People think they are going to be immortal and young forever ... they are wrong! They believe that they can use you at will, that they can cleanse themselves in you, as if you were an old rug and then discard you, like a garbage bag. All without exception we will end up in the same place ... dead and without feelings. Why can not there be more love in the world? Why can not people love with more enthusiasm? The world would be so good if more people would let themselves love and give more love. I really still can not believe that there are people like narcissists who hurt people for fun, that they feed on emotions, that they like to see a person crying, while they say to them I LOVE YOU! I can not conceive it. It is assumed that there is nothing more beautiful than being loved, respected and valued ... why destroy it? Why destroy the moral of a person who feels nice things for you? Hopefully one day life will give back everything they gave. I was always mistreated by my narcissistic mother, but I still think about being a good person, loving and giving the best of myself. I think firmly about making friends, about meeting good people and being at peace with myself. I do not want to have people hating me or angry with me. I want peace, not war. Two months have passed since I try not to think about her. I was not a victim of hoovering yet, and I guess I'm not going to have to suffer it either. She discarded me saying she did not want a serious partner, and she was already having sex with two more men. She blocked me from all sides except the facebook messenger. It is a daily and constant struggle, even if you know everything that happened, you still have the hope of being able to talk things over and hear the word \\"I'm sorry\\" from her mouth. Final point: sincerely after the love bombing, after the silent treatment, after the discard ... I do not wish anyone what I lived. It is ugly (and very painful) to fall in love with an \\"illusion\\", to fall in love with a monstrous and false entity and to know that everything lived was always a lie. I have not seen another woman for months, I find it hard to start conversations and trust people again. Maybe one day I can trust again, and love again… but it will not be the same anymore."},{"prompt":"What are some short stories about wives?","completion":"Husband drinks everyday night and goes to his home: NIGHT 1 - Husband - Hi honey, its me.

Can a GP refuse to arrange these checks because the client has no symptoms?","completion":"The fact that NHS hospital doctors/surgeons are salaried rather than receiving an item of service payment also alters the Dr/patient dynamic on occasion. It becomes one of “does this patient need this investigation or treatment” with no financial incentive to the surgeon/Dr of recommending any particular treatment. Where surgeons are paid on a per case basis there will always be a temptation for the occasional unscrupulous practitioner to change their treatment threshold from “do they need” to “can I justify”. Hopefully the medical principle of “first do no harm” will make such decisions consciously made for profit a rare event, but there is always a risk that on occasions it will be factored in. An even worse situation can potentially exist when the doctor patient relationships is entirely replaced with a employer/employee relationship. Hopefully the doctor will have the good sense and professionalism to steer clear of engaging in unorthodox treatments at the request of the employer, as may have happened with Michael Jackson."},{"prompt":"You are having a big argument with your spouse.

Most write (to quote everybody here) “garbage” repetitive answers to seemingly repetitive questions.Many times I would be in the middle of reading an answer and I switch apps or an internet hiccup happens and I go back and lose it, and since the feed changes, I most probably never encounter it again. Make a continue where you left off feature.On the iOS app, Many times I open an answer which opens in a new window, then try to open the author’s profile and it tries to open the app in another window but remains completely white. Going back and forward a few times fixes it (I can probably find steps to reproduce it,) but in any case, it is weird that there is the feed and then there is these new windows, which recursively say open the author’s profile, then scroll through their answers, see an interesting question check other answers, etc, Then accidentally close the window and all is lost. There has to be a better way.It would be nice to have recommendations on how to improve answers. These could be based on feedback given from readers. Or just good old ML. For example, instead of asking a reader “Did you find this answer useful?” Ask: “Is this answer missing more details? Does it need references? Could it be more succinct? Is there a turn off somewhere that could be revised/redacted by the author? In the supreme court, justices sometime narrow the scope of an opinion to get more consensus, nothing shameful about that.A Quora SSO would be nice. Unlike google for instance, you typically have the work and school of users, which could be nice in signing up to other websites. (Might not super align with the mission, but I can imagine spinning it off) Overall, Quora is great to the point that I sometimes delete it to focus.

However it is usually seen that gold generally has a good time when a lot of stocks are in a rut Or recession. It's usually sane to invest around 0.5-1% of your money in gold holdings. Also it makes very little sense to invest in gold if you have very little money(<1–2million) as you'd be better off buying stocks.

Maybe less than nothing. Back in the day, we did not have academic degrees in animal behavior and certainly no online training certifications. Not saying that all certified behaviorists or certified trainers are phonies, but many have not trained a single dog. Back in the day, people knew what the trainer’s dogs were like before you trained them and what they were like afterward. They knew you or had heard of you from people they trusted. They may have come to know the dog you trained. It was that simple. You saw the results and you liked them or you didn’t. Now, we have the complication of people who have an advanced degree in behavior, which they acquired from some books, inside a classroom. Or some letters after their name which they acquired in an online course. They don’t even have to have a dog. Lastly, the most important thing to remember in the dog world is that a veterinarian is not a trainer and a trainer is not a vet, and a rescue manager is neither. Nor is a breeder. Also, an agility trainer is not a trainer for reactive dogs; a competition obedience trainer is neither."},{"prompt":"Was Elvis Presley merely the first white musician to offer rock music to the masses, having borrowed heavily from what was already widespread within black culture?","completion":"That is the revisionist history narrative."},{"prompt":"What is it like to be morbidly obese (BMI > 40)?","completion":"I’m currently morbidly obese, my bmi is 63, so I believe I can sufficiently answer, lol. I’ll try to be neutral about it, rather than the replies that outright demonize the experience, or one I’ve seen who claims to enjoy it. I do think an objective answer is most fitting. You will undeniably feel heavier and more out of shape, even if you’ve always been big, when you reach a level of morbid obesity like my 63 bmi. You’ll start dealing with chronic pain, but it creeps up on you. You don’t necessarily realize that it’s actually chronic pain until it sinks in that average weight people can stand, walk, climb stairs, etc without pain and breathlessness for minutes afterwards. Your back will be sore if you have a big belly, possibly your hips, definitely your knees, though it may take a little while to begin… 18–19 years old I thought I was free of it. Now, at 20, it’s gotten painful just to stand up. If you’re like me, you may have a sort of body dysphoria or denial about your size in a mirror, especially if your weight gain was very fast. However, obvious signs such as outgrowing clothes, can’t be ignored. You eventually have to worry about if a store will carry clothes big enough for you, when for a while, all of them did. You worry about stares and looks, assumptions on how you live and eat, assumptions of greed and laziness that may, or may entirely not, be true, as no two obese people are the same."},{"prompt":"Why is encryption so much easier than decryption in cryptography?","completion":"Is it?

Last year, me and my brother Dev, went to watch the movie Golmaal Again. The theater was packed, and we were in our usual seats. A couple came along, after about half an hour the movie started, with a baby boy of about 2.5 years old. The boy was uncomfortable in the dark stuffed movie theatre and started crying- asking to be taken out. I thought, as everyone, that maybe he would subside after settling down. But was I ever wrong!! “Please stop crying, please,” I was internally requesting the baby. It increased its howl. Oh, God!! The people in the other seats were also given the baby an incredulous look. That didn't deter the baby, and it continued its bawling. Many around were fidgeting in their seats, wondering who would bell the cat- and ask that the baby be quietened. The child kept on with his constant stream of wails, he just wanted to go out of there. His parents just didn't care, and let him shriek and scream. Some people around did try to ask the parents to pacify the child, but all they got in response was a shrug. And the baby was crying and crying more, asking to be taken out. The security of the theater also wasn't interested in any kind of peace-keeping. Neither the mother nor the father showed any kind of interest in calming the child- they were engrossed in the movie- having turned a deaf ear to the child’s crying and other people’s discomfort. We hardly got to hear the dialogues. The constant wails of the child didn't let anyone concentrate on the movie and it became our worst movie experience yet. People were kind enough, that they tolerated such behaviour, understanding the plight of the parents. There was no obligation to do so, they were just being benevolent. But did those parents get that, that only because they wanted to watch a movie and couldn't have anyone else to take care of their child, they ruined a movie for all those present there? People dish out a fair sum of money, to enjoy movies in a theater, it is not a sanctuary. The heavens wouldn't have fallen down if as a parent of a small child, they didn't watch a movie, that too at others cost. Me being quite an erratic child, my parents never went to a movie until I was young enough to sit through a movie quietly. There are many other parents who do so. But, some parents just don’t get it. Either their children would be crying or playing on the stairs- which again recently happened in a movie. Actually, I have noticed it is becoming quite common. Keep your children home, making some arrangements for them. Or do not come to watch a movie. Please, do not ruin other’s fun and be a reason for flushing their money down the drain. -Khushbu."},{"prompt":"Why are jellied eels such a wellknown food in the UK?","completion":"Never heard of it"},{"prompt":"Did you ever think that if you could convince 1 million people to give you only 1 miserable dollar you would become a millionaire?","completion":"Yes!

I had had to beg a friend to also stay there, while offering to cover his expenses as well. In the end, he willingly foot his portion of the bill, confessing that he had regretted having to leave, and will be back again one day. It is right in the middle of a tropical rainforest, whilst having constant access to various world class hotel services. Look at the lush greenery: The distance between the main road/gate, and the hotel entrance porch is almost half a kilometer away to maintain peace, calm and ambience of the rainforest. Entry between the porch and the hotel reception is almost tunnel like passing by the rocks of the hill which the hotel is built upon. This leads to the main reception, whom had automatically given you an upgrade as better rooms are available. The reception area is reflective of Sri Lankan style — simple, yet classy without the slightest hint of opulence: You make your way along the cliff face, passing by the infinity pool where Sigiriya can be seen in the distance: You look back from the poolside to see the hotel blended so well with its surroundings like it had grown out of the hill: Making your way to the rooms, you pass by cliffs, roof gardens with a view out to the surroundings.

This made sense, since they really didn’t need a college education, since it wouldn’t matter to their employment prospects. But to some of us for whom the memory of hunger in our families is only 1 or 2 generations removed, we have to approach the idea of a university education from a more practical frame of mind."},{"prompt":"What do you think should happen to people whose ancestors owned slaves in the southern part of the United States?","completion":"Nothing should happen to them. Their ancestors owned slaves not them. But your logic I should pay in some ways for my ancestors sins. I am Portuguese. I know for a fact one of my ancestors was a first mate on a slave ship a few hundred years ago. But wait I am also a son of Italy. I am pretty sure that my Roman ancestors onwed slaves. Should I pay for their sins. To me slavery is horrible. But every civilization owned slaves. So we all should pay. But let's go by your logic. If people had ancestors in the south who owned slaves they should be punished. Let's us not stop there. The slaves of the southern states came originally from Africa. So they were captured not by European's but by native Africans. This included Muslim raiders and native Africans. So we need to find their ancestors and punish them. Then they were sold to European's who transported them to Cuba, Caribbean, southern US colonies. So we need to punish all their ancestors. We also need to include ancestors of the northern US states. Slavery was also legal their during 1600–1700 hundreds. Oh also the southern Cherokee had plantations that do not be shocked. They also had African slaves. Should their ancestors be punished or did the Trail of Tears cover that. The point I am getting at is this. Slavery was horrible. History shows that every civilization had slaves. This is a horrible truth but it is the truth. So we should all be punished."},{"prompt":"Do people in the United States actually believe that gun reform will cause them to lose their right to own a weapon?","completion":"No. Gun reform?!?…really?…nobody cares.

How much do you drive (7.5,10k,12k,15k) a year? • The best leases are 12k or less, If you drive almost 15k a year I don’t suggest leasing. The residual value makes a bigger hit at 15k and I don’t recommend it in most cases. Are you a good driver / car owner? • You need to keep your car in the same condition when you got it. That means any damage must be repaired and fixed to OEM if applicable. • To add one you cannot modify the vehicle 3rd party with any aftermarket body kits, spoilers, wheels, etc. I mean honestly you could, but they want it back exact how you got it, OEM. They will charge you. Do you really want/need a new vehicle that often? • If you’re merely looking to just buy a car and drive it, honestly just buy it outright and keep it forever. • If you like to always have a newish car and want updated technology definetly give it a shot If you’re solely leasing because it’s “cheaper” I’m goin a have to stop you there. The reasonable way it’ll be cheaper is if you do the research and negotiate. Just because you walk into a dealer and the lease payment for a car is 275 when the finance price is 320 doesn’t mean you’re saving anything more.

We can adopt a simple but equivalent definition of a manifold: starting with any Euclidean space E of high enough dimension, a subset M is a (sub)manifold in E if there is an open subset U of E containing M and a smooth map r:U→U with rr=r and r(U)=M. We call r a smooth retraction. Here I will denote composition of maps by juxtaposition. Thus a smooth manifold can simply be defined as a smooth retract of an open subset of a Euclidean space. Notice that M is the set of points p in U satisfying r(p)=p. Suppose that N is a smooth retract of the open subset V of Euclidean space F. Let s denote any smooth retraction of V on N. A map f:M→N is smooth if and only if there is a smooth map H:U→V with sH=fr. It is not hard to see that the composition of smooth maps is again smooth for smooth maps of manifolds. Recall that if f:U→F is a smooth map into Euclidean space F, then the derivative f’ of f is a smooth map for of U into L(E;F), the space of linear maps of E into F, which is a Euclidean space with the inner product <A|B>=trace(B*A). If v is a vector in E and x is a point of U, then we can form the affine function k(t)=x+tv which has values in U for all small enough t, and is smooth, so in fact f’(x)v=the ordinary derivative of f(x+tv) with respect to t at t=0. The chain rule then has the simple form (gf)’(x)=g’(f(x))f’(x). Obviously, if 1=id(U) denotes the the identity map on U, then 1’(p)=id(E), for any p in U. If V is open in F and f(U) is a subset of V, then we define the tangent map Tf:UxE→VxF by Tf(p,v)=(f(p),f’(p)v). We call UxE the Tangent Bundle of U, and denote it by TU. Thus Tf:TU→TV. The chain rule now becomes simply T(gf)=[Tg][Tf]. Obviously T[id(U)]=id(TU). Now, if r is a smooth retraction of U onto M, then Tr is a smooth retraction of TU whose image we denote TM and is the tangent bundle of M, so TM is a submanifold of TU because Tr is smooth, TU is an open subset of TE=ExE which is a Euclidean space, and by the chain rule, using rr=r gives [Tr][Tr]=Tr. Applying the Tangent “functor” to sH=fr, we find that if f:M→N is smooth, then T(fr) carries TM into TN, so defines Tf:TM→TN, so now we have the tangent “functor” extended to apply to all smooth manifolds. Now, if E(k) is a Euclidean space for each positive integer k, then a multilinear map (specifically, an n-linear map) w:E(1)xE(2)x…xE(n)→F is a map which is linear in each variable when the other variables are kept fixed. For instance, the inner product of two vectors is a bilinear map where F is the real line, whereas the vector cross product in three dimensional Euclidean space is a bilinear vector valued map. The usual vector triple product is an example of a 3-linear real valued map and gives what we call the volume form of ordinary Euclidean space. Multilinear maps are also called tensors. If M is a manifold, a smooth retract of an open subset U of E, then for each point p in M, TM(p) is the set of vectors (p,v) in UxE with r’(p)v=v, and calling v the principal part of (p,v), we see that these vectors form a vector subspace of E which we denote T(p)M, so TM(p)=pxT(p)M, and using the obvious bijection we make TM(p) a vector space. We have a natural smooth “projection” map b:TM→M with b(p,v)=p, for any (p,v) in TM, called the TANGENT BUNDLE PROJECTION. If b:B→M is any smooth map of manifolds, we sometimes find it useful to think of each inverse image of a point p of M under b to be a fiber B(p), so then B is the union of these fibers and thus a bundle of fibers. Thus we call b:B→M a (smooth) bundle. We call B(p) the fiber of B over the point p of M. If F is any manifold, then the first factor projection MxF→M is a fiber bundle with all fibers really the same as F itself and we call this the PRODUCT BUNDLE over M with fiber F. When the projection map of the bundle b:B→M is understood, we often simply refer to B as the bundle and M as the base. If b:B→M and c:C→N are both smooth bundles, then by a smooth bundle map h:B→C we really mean a pair of maps (h;f):b→c, where f:M→N and ch=fb. Here we say h COVERS f or is OVER f. Notice that if p belongs to M and v is in the fiber of B over p, then h(v) is in the fiber of C over f(p), so h restricts to give a map h(p), with h(p):B(p)→C(f(p)). Anyway, it is easy to see that the composition of smooth bundle maps is again a smooth bundle map, and id(B) is a smooth bundle map of B on itself. A bundle isomorphism is simply a smooth bundle map with an inverse which is also a smooth bundle map. Notice that if p is a point of M, then h(B(p)) is contained in C(f(p)). The simplest bundle over M is simply id(M):M→M. The bundle maps M→B are then called SECTIONS of B. If s is a section, then s:M→B and s(p) is in B (p) for each p in M. Using the inverse function theorem, one can prove that if M is a smooth retract of the open subset U of E, and if p is in M, then there is an open subset V of U so that if W is the overlap of M and V, then W is diffeomorphic to an open subset of a Euclidean space and applying the tangent functor to this diffeomorphism shows TW is bundle isomorphic to a product bundle. Any bundle which is bundle isomorphic to a product bundle is called TRIVIAL. Thus all tangent bundles are locally trivial. Also, BxC is a smooth bundle over MxN with projection bxc defined by bxc(d,e)=(b(d),c(e)), if (d,e) is in BxC. This is the bundle product of B and C. On the other hand, if f:M→N is any smooth map, then we can form MxC as a smooth manifold, and then form the subset f*C={(p,e) in MxC : f(p)=c(e)}, which is a submanifold. The restriction of first factor projection MxC→M to the subset f*C defines the projection f*c:f*C→M, and we call f*C the PULLBACK of C over M via f. In particular, notice that the fiber over p in M of the pullback is [f*C](p)=pxC(f(p)), so the fiber of f*C over p is really the fiber of C over f(p) “pulled back” over p. In particular, if B(1),B(2),…,B(n) are all bundles, then we can form the bundle product B=B(1)xB(2)x…xB(n) which has base space the product of all the individual base spaces. If these happen to all be the same base space M, then the base of the bundle product B is the n-fold cartesian product of M with itself, denoted M^n. If p is a point of M, let p^n be the n-tuple having all entries equal to p, so p^n=(p,p,p,…,p), with n entries in the list. Define d:M→M^n by d(p)=p^n, all p in M. Then with B the bundle product, d*B is called the FIBER PRODUCT or WHITNEY SUM of the bundles and it is again a bundle over M with fiber over p in M being [d*B](p)=[B(1)](p)x…x[B(n)](p). If all the fibers of B are vector spaces the addition map in each fiber gives a map d*[BxB]→B And if this is smooth and likewise for the bundle map defined by the scalar multiplication, then B is a smooth vector bundle. A smooth vector bundle map is a smooth bundle map of smooth vector bundles which is linear on fibers. Thus if f:M→N is a smooth map of manifolds, then Tf:TM→TN is a smooth vector bundle map and if f is a diffeomorphism, then Tf is a smooth vector bundle isomorphism covering f. If B(1),B(2),…,B(n) are all smooth vector bundles over M, then for their Whitney sum B over M, the fiber over a point p of M is then the product of the various fibers over p, so if C is also a smooth vector bundle over M, then a smooth bundle map t:B→C, which is multilinear on each fiber of B, is called a TENSOR FIELD. Notice that for each p in M, the map on the fiber over p is t(p) which is a multilinear map on the fiber of B over p. In fact, there is an “associated” vector bundle L=L(B(1),…,B(n);C) whose fiber over p in M is exactly the vector space L(p)=L([B(1)](p),…,[B(n)](p);C(p)), and thus t defines a section of L with value t(p) at p in M. If C is the trivial product bundle with scalar field as fiber, and if n=1, then we call L the DUAL BUNDLE of B=B(1), denoted B*. If n is arbitrary and each B(k) is either TM or TM*, then t is called a tensor field on M, and L is called a tensor bundle over M. If instead, C is arbitrary, then we call L the bundle of C-valued tensor fields over M. If each B(k) is the tangent bundle of M, TM, then the tensor field is called COVARIANT, whereas if each B(k) is TM*, then the tensor field is called CONTRAVARIANT. Thus, finally, all (Smooth) tensor fields are themselves (smooth) sections of associated tensor bundles to the tangent bundle. Naturally, the question arises as to how to differentiate a smooth section so as to get a smooth section. If we look at the product bundle MxF where M and F are any manifolds, then a smooth section is completely determined by its principal part. Thus if s:M→MxF, then s(p)=(p,f(p)), for all p in M, and if v is in T(p)M, then the derivative f’(p)v which is in TF(p) should really be the derivative along v, as we want the derivative to again be a section of a bundle so the derivative of s at p along (p,v) should be (p,f’(p)v) in px[T(f(p))F]=[f*TF](p). But this only works for a product bundle. Suppose b:B→M is any smooth bundle and s is any smooth section, then bs=id(M), so [Tb][Ts]=id(TM). Also, b is constant with value p on all of TM(p), so as sb is a smooth retraction of TM onto itself whose image is the submanifold s(M) of B, we see that Tb carries the sub bundle T[s(M)] of TB isomorphically onto TM. On the other hand, b is constant on B(p), so Tb is constant on the sub bundle T[B(p)] of TB, and has value=0(p), the zero vector in TM(p). In case B is a product bundle, we think of B as “sitting over” M which is “positioned horizontally”, so we think of the fibers of any general bundle b:B→M as being “vertical slices” of B, with b being “downward projection”. Thus vectors tangent to fibers of B are considered vertical tangent vectors. Thus if s is a smooth section of B→M, then its derivative at p in M should give a linear map Ds:TM(p)→VTB(s(p)), where VTB is the sub bundle of TB consisting of all the vertical vectors in TB. To make this happen, we need a LINEAR VECTOR BUNDLE RETRACTION V:TB→TB over B with V(TB)=VTB. We call V a CONNECTION on b:B→M. Then, for any smooth section s:M→B of B, we define the COVARIANT DERIVATIVE of s to be Ds=V[Ts]. Thus for p in M and w=s(p), and v in TM(p), [Ds(p)]v is in VTB(w). If B happens to be itself a vector bundle, then B(p) is a vector space and as the tangent space to a vector space at each of its points is just the vector space itself, we have VTB(w)=T[B(p)]=B(p), and therefore in this case, [Ds(p)]v is in B(p) as well, so if v is a smooth section of TM→M, the tangent bundle of M, then [Ds]v is a new smooth section of b:B→M called the COVARIANT DERIVATIVE of s along v, defined by ([Ds]v)(p)=[Ds(p)][v(p)], all p in M. It is then easy to see that D is linear on vector fields, that is additive with constants coming out just like ordinary differentiation, and also the product rule holds: if f is any smooth scalar valued function and s is any smooth section, then D(fs)v=([Df]v)s+f[Ds]v, all smooth tangent fields v of M, and therefore we can write (with obvious meaning) D(fs)=[Df]s+f[Ds]. Notice this all depends on the bundle retraction V. This might seem to be a problem to produce, but in many situations that happen naturally, it is rather obvious. Especially in cases of vector bundles. In fact, if F is any vector space of high enough dimension, then we can find a smooth vector bundle isomorphism of B onto a vector sub bundle of MxF. We can put a non degenerate inner product on F, say <v|w>=inner product of v and w in F. We do not assume that <v|v> is non negative. Non degeneracy means we assume that if <v|w> vanishes for every w in F, then v must be zero. Thus F with such a non degenerate inner product is not Euclidean, but rather merely pseudo Euclidean or semi Euclidean. Since B is a smooth sub bundle of MxF, for p in M, B(p)=pxF(p), where F(p) is a vector subspace of F. We let H(p) be the orthogonal complement of F(p) in F, and we require that F(p) and H(p) have only the zero vector in common. Then F(p)+H(p)=F, so every vector in F decomposes as an orthogonal sum and we define P(p):F→F to be the linear retraction of F with image F(p), for each p in M. Let E=MxF. We define P:E→E, a linear bundle retraction by P(p,v)=(p,P(p)v), for (p,v) in E. Then P(E)=B, and if s is any smooth section of B, then Ds=P[Ts] will define the covariant derivative. In particular, if we take the case where M is a submanifold of F, then B=TM is already naturally a smooth vector sub bundle of E, and this gives the standard covariant derivative of s. In this case, assuming <|>is also non degenerate on each fiber of TM, we define the metric tensor g on M by g(v,w)=<v|w>, v, w in TM(p), and this defines a smooth tensor field called the metric tensor field making M a smooth semi-Riemannian manifold. The covariant derivative operation on general vector bundles is an example of what is called a Kozul connection. The bundle retraction V onto the vertical vectors is called a connection in the general bundle setting. In the case of the submanifold of a semi Euclidean space, as defined using the metric, it is called the Levi Civita connection on the tangent bundle. If v and w are principal parts of tangent vector fields, considered as smooth maps M→F whose value at each p belongs to F(p), one easily shows using equality of mixed partial derivatives or mixed directional derivatives of the retraction of an open subset of F on M, that [v’w-w’v](p) is in TpM, all p, so v’w-w’v=[v,w] is the principal part of a section of TM. Thus we use that to define what is called the Lie bracket of vector fields. If s and t are tangent vector fields of M having principal parts v and w, then [s,t] has principal part [v,w]. Thus, [s,t]=P[s,t](p)=(p,P(p)v’w(p)-P(p)w’v(p)) =[Ds]t-[Dt]s, so [s,t]=[Ds]t-[Dt]s, for all sections of TM. This condition is special and due to the fact that we defined the connection using P. In general, we define the TORSION TENSOR denoted T, called the torsion of the connection D, by T(s,t)=[Ds]t-[Dt]s-[s,t]. Thus, the torsion of the Levi Civita connection vanishes. Also, [g(s,t)]’v=g([Ds]v,t)+g(s,[Dt]v) follows from the definition of g in terms of <|> on F, as M is a submanifold of F. More generally, if B is any tensor bundle over M involving “tensor” products of TM and its dual TM*, then the product rule for differentiation can be easily used to define the covariant derivatives of tensor fields over M. As an example, if h is a smooth section of L=L(TM,TM;R), then for any smooth tangent vector fields u, v , w on M, h(v,w) is a smooth function on M whose derivative along u is, by the product rule, [h(v,w)]’u=[[Dh]u](v,w)+h([Dv]u, w)+h(v,[Dw]u), provided the product rule holds, and thus, we use this equation to define Dh so that it is then forced to hold. In particular, it follows from our computation above with g, that Dg=0, for the Levi Civita connection. In fact, if D is a connection for M which is torsion free and for which Dg=0, then D is the Levi Civita connection determined by g. But more generally, we see that by making unrestricted use of the product rule, we get the connection on TM extended to give connections on all tensor bundles on M. If h is a covariant vector field, the number of tangent vector variables it takes to get a value is called the rank of h. Thus g is a second rank tensor field. If h has rank k and if the value if h is unchanged by any rearrangement of the vector inputs, we say h is SYMMETRIC. If h vanishes as soon as any two inputs are alike, then h is ALTERNATING or ANTI SYMMETRIC. Thus g is obviously symmetric and the torsion tensor is always anti symmetric. If we average all the values obtained by rearranging the inputs, we get the SYMMETRIZATION of h denoted by Sym(h). Thus if h has rank 2, then Sym(h)(s,t)=(1/2)[h(s,t)+h(t,s)]. Likewise, if we average the values for all rearrangements weighted by plus or minus 1 according to whether the arrangement takes an odd or even number of interchanges, then we get the ALTERNATION of h, denoted Alt(h). Thus for rank 2 h we have Alt(h)(s,t)=(1/2)[h(s,t)-h(t,s)]. If h has rank k and is alternating, it is also called a k-form. We can notice that if k is larger than the dimension of M, then Alt(h)=0. This is because we can choose a basis for TM(p) of fewer than k vectors, express each input in terms of these and expand using the multilinearity, and each term in the expansion will have at least two inputs the same and must therefore vanish. In case k is the dimension of M, each term will have exactly the same inputs all the different basis vectors but in some rearrangement, so the set of alternating k-forms of rank equal to the dimension of M is a vector bundle with one dimensional fiber. We can choose an orthonormal frame field locally, and produce a form of rank k which has value 1 when we put in the orthonormal basis vectors. This gives what we call the VOLUME FORM on M. We can then define the integral of any smooth function f on M as the integral of fu, where u is the volume form. This integral generalizes the various line integrals and surface integrals of vector calculus. If C is a k- cube in k dimensional Euclidean space E, then the interior of C is an open set, so is a smooth manifold open in E, and if f is a smooth function, then the integral of fu is the usual Riemann integral of f. If h:C→M is a smooth map and w is a smooth k-form on M, then h*w is a smooth k form on C so must be of the form fu for some smooth function f, and we use this to define the integral of w over h. We can form formal linear combinations of such mappings with integer coefficients, and then use the same combination to define the integral of w over that linear combination. We call these linear combinations CHAINS. So we can integrate a k- form on M over any k-chain in M. Next, we can define the EXTERIOR DERIVATIVE of any alternating k-form w which we denote by dw. It is defined as dw=[1/(k+1)]Alt(Dw), Where Dw is the covariant derivative of w considered as a (k+1)-form via using the direction in which you differentiate to give the extra variable input. In a tedious calculation you find ddw=0, which generalizes div curl=0 and curl grad=0. Then the generalization of Green Gauss Stokes comes from the fact that if C is a k-chain, then you can define its boundary as a (k-1)-chain. The general theorem, now called Stokes Theorem which includes all the integral theorems you spoke of, is that if w is any (k-1)-form on M and C is any k-chain on M, then the integral of dw over C is equal to the integral of w over the boundary of C. The definition I used of a manifold and of semi Riemannian manifold is actually perfectly general due to an embedding theorem of Greene which generalizes the Nash embedding theorem for Riemannian manifolds. The existence of P comes from the tubular neighborhood theorem. In effect, differential geometry is just calculus on smooth retracts of open subsets of semi Euclidean spaces. More generally, if X and Y are any subsets of a semi Euclidean spaces E and F, respectively, then we can say f:X→Y is smooth at p in X provided there is U open in E and h:U→F an ordinary smooth map such that f and h agree on the overlap of X and U. We say f is smooth if it is smooth at each point of X. Then we easily see that if g:Y→Z is smooth at f(p), then gf is smooth at p, so compositions of smooth maps are again smooth for any subsets of semi Euclidean spaces. Open subsets of X are simply intersections of open sets in E with X. Obviously id(X) is smooth. If Z=X and fg and gf are identity maps, then f and g are MUTUALLY INVERSE DIFFEOMORPHISMS. We say X is a smooth manifold if each point of M has an open neighborhood which is diffeomorphic to an open subset of a semi Euclidean space. We can define H=H(u) to be a closed half space of E as say the set of points v for which <v|u> is not negative. Here u is a fixed non zero vector in E. We say M is a manifold with boundary B if each point of M has an open neighborhood diffeomorphic to an open subset of H. The boundary of H is the vector subspace orthogonal to u, call it K. The boundary B of M consists of points which map to K under various diffeomorphisms of open subsets of M with open subsets of H. For some interesting purely topological applications of these ideas, you can check into the neat little book by John Milnor, Topology From the Differentiable Viewpoint."},{"prompt":"Did Pfizer purposely hold back on announcing a vaccine for COVID19 in order to hurt Trump’s chances of winning the election?","completion":"The company developing this vaccine candidate announced that in testing/trials it has been found to have a 90% effectiveness in the trial participants.

For the past couple of years people call me “pretty” and they think I’m perfect. It’s only the recent change in beauty standards that caused this. Other wise, I’ve always been judged for my appearance. Round Face- people would make fun of my round shaped face a lot. I still feel insecure about it to this day, people say I’m overdramatic sometimes and say that my face shape is perfect but I’ve had so much teasing that it made me insecure. I have naturally chubby cheeks which was also something I was made fun of for. I’ve been called so many names.. I message my face a lot, actually I do it every morning and night, it has made a difference over the years. I message my face to make my jawline more noticeable and my face look less round and look smaller. But I tried to select some photos that showcase my cheeks a bit more. curly hair- what I was wearing in the last 2 photos is a wig. I unfortunately got cancer back in December 2019, I have hair but it’s so short and because of my insecurities surrounding my round face I don’t like to walk around without a wig since I feel like it accentuates it more. My natural hair is curly. My mom is mixed, half european and half black but shes Honduran. so this is where I get my curly hair from. Growing up, people made fun of my curly hair and called it “clown hair” and often looked at it as ugly. Although there were people who loved my hair, classmates made fun of me. When I’d straighten my hair, people would say they like it more and that it fits me more. Old photo but this is my curly hair. This is from about 2 years ago I think maybe 1 and a half years ago. Skin Color- people always judged my skin color. I’m in no way comparing myself to other darker girls because I know how it must be for people with darker skin and how discriminatory it must be. But I have been discriminated and judged for my tan skin. It’s hard to tell since someone could mistaken it for shadows but I do have tan skin with yellow undertone. People often said to me my skin color is so yellow and weird. And make racist comments about it. This is me during the summer of July 2020. I do get very dark as you can see, and this has no filters whatsoever. People have often told me I would look better if I was lighter. makeup - people have always judged me for wearing makeup. They say I put too much on. I really don’t but it gets me insecure when someone judges me for it. They call me a catfish and other names. But doesn’t every girl put on some makeup sometimes ? I like makeup and it’s a passion of mine, it helps me calm down and relaxes me and also takes my mind off of my stresses. I get backlash from other girls and guys for wearing makeup.

The following advice will assist you in writing your Ph.D. thesis: Start Early: Write your thesis as soon as you can, even if that means just making notes or an outline. You'll have enough time if you get started early to plan, research, write, and edit your work. Establish a Writing Schedule: Establish and adhere to a writing plan that works for you. Setting aside definite blocks of time for writing and avoiding interruptions during those times might be beneficial. Break it Down: To make your thesis more achievable and to keep you organized, divide it into smaller, more digestible pieces or chapters. Employ a Structured Format: When writing a scientific paper, use a framework that is standard in your field, such as the IMRAD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) format. You'll be able to better arrange your ideas and write more cogently as a result. Edit and Revise: The writing process requires editing and revision, which are both crucial steps. Review your work thoroughly, make any necessary changes, and proofread for grammatical, punctuation, and spelling mistakes. Seek Feedback: To help you write better, ask your adviser or other reliable peers for their opinions. To share ideas and receive criticism, think about finding a writing partner or joining a writing club. Take Breaks: Taking breaks will help you stay productive and prevent burnout. Spend some time relaxing and caring for yourself to keep your motivation and focus high. It is crucial to recognize your accomplishments along the way because finishing a Ph.D. thesis is a big step. You can successfully write and defend your thesis if you adhere to these suggestions and maintain organization."},{"prompt":"Iraq better off today than it would have been still under Saddam?","completion":"The question is not whether Iraq would be better today under Saddam or as is.

But I think is a pretty wide context. Regions rich in resources will be conquered, controlled or submitted by more powerful nations or conglomerates in order to exploit those resources. Only if those regiones happen to be one of the powerful ones, this can be avoided. And again, the outcomes generally tend to change. Some outcomes of the curse are… worse than others. For example, Hispania had tons of gold. Which ensued Roman occupation for six centuries. But then again, that civilized Spain, changed completely his culture (thus the Iberian basal population became “Hispanoromans”) and put the Peninsula in the best position towards the middle age compared with the rest of Europe. Something similar happened with the Spanish conquest of America, full of resources. 300 long years, the resulting population was a mixture of natives and conquerors, and the nations that came from that were in an outstanding position (During the 19th century nations like Mexico, Argentina or Chile were among the wealthiest of the world). The north of America suffered a worse outcome, at least for the natives. Population was almost fully replaced (almost no mixing at all, and the little mixing that existed was mainly in the former Hispanic areas), and all but annihilated. The resulting entity, USA, was extremely successful, but it was a clone of the colonizing civilization, with no rests whatsoever of the previous occupants of the land. This is possibly the worst outcome possible of the resource curse. Total annihilation of the native population, with only a few remaining in an almost museum-stand capacity. Other places, like Africa, suffered a slightly less bad outcome, albeit pretty bad too. First directly colonized, then politically controlled, they suffer until today the resource curse, without a chance to enjoy the wealth that they have access. In modern times, the resource curse tends to adopt an slightly different form: the natural wealth of the nation enables a very powerful extractive caste, that controls the country with an iron fist, generally supported by the foreign powers that benefit from it, for the detriment of the local population.

Understanding That It Will Need Time and Effort First of all and foremost, it’s crucial to realize that building a prosperous internet company requires time and work. There are no shortcuts or magic solutions that will make you rich immediately. Welcome the fact that you will need to commit the effort and have patience, as success rarely comes quickly. As a newbie, you should be geared up to spend your time into gaining new competencies, establishing your network, and laboring hard to develop your company. For example, when I first started, I spent countless hours studying different side hustle models, getting to know digital marketing, and networking with other side hustle owners.

How to Stay Organized Staying organized is vital for any side hustle owner, but it’s particularly important when you’re just starting.

To stay organized, I suggest using a project management tool like Trello or Asana. These tools enable you to create dashboards and lists to watch your tasks, due dates, and advancement. You can also use them to work together with team members or contractors if you decide to bring on additional help. For example, when I first began my online side hustle, I made a Trello board to follow all my assignments, such as studying potential niches, setting up my website, and creating my marketing strategy. By dividing my goals into smaller, manageable assignments, I was able to stay focused and make regular progress. Additionally, consider setting up a designated workspace for your side hustle. This can be as easy as a desk in a calm corner of your dwelling or a co-working space where you can be more productive.

Accepting the Long-Term Mindset One of the most significant pros of concentrating on the long term is that it permits you to make superior decisions for your business. Instead of chasing short-term profits, you’ll be capable to prioritize expenditures that will produce benefits in the long term, such as improving your competencies, building your name, and fostering strong relationships with customers and partners. For illustration, when I first began, I centered on supplying high-quality content and resources for my viewers, even if it meant forgoing prompt profits. This permitted me to develop trust and set up myself as an leader in my niche, which eventually led to long-term success. Also, keep in mind that setbacks and failures are a standard part of the entrepreneurial journey. Welcome these events as chances to learn and develop, rather than enabling them dishearten you. With a long-term mindset, you’ll be more resilient and more suitably equipped to maneuver the challenges that come with creating an internet side hustle.

One method to do this is by devoting time each week to staying informed about your industry and any new changes that could impact your business. This can involve reading blogs, tuning in to podcasts, attending webinars, or linking up with other side hustlers in your niche. Additionally, don’t be afraid to try new strategies and experiment with different routes to find what works most effectively for your company. For illustration, when I first started, I relied heavily on organic search traffic from Google. However, as the online landscape shifted and competition increased, I recognized that I needed to diversify my marketing efforts. By educating myself about other marketing channels, such as social media and email marketing, I was capable to adjust and continue growing my side hustle despite the shifts in the industry.

This can function as a valuable guide for future decision-making and give a source of inspiration when you face setbacks. Furthermore, don’t neglect to mark your milestones, no matter how small they may look.

Some key differences between wireless and wired networks include: Mobility: Wireless networks allow devices to connect to the network from anywhere within range, while wired networks require devices to be physically connected to the network.Installation: Setting up a wired network typically involves running cables through walls and ceilings, which can be time-consuming and difficult. Setting up a wireless network, on the other hand, is generally much simpler and can often be done by a single person.Scalability: Wireless networks are generally more scalable than wired networks, as it's easier to add new devices to a wireless network than it is to add new devices to a wired network.Cost: Setting up a wired network can be expensive due to the cost of cables and the labor required to run them. Wireless networks, on the other hand, are generally less expensive to set up.Security: Wired networks are generally considered to be more secure than wireless networks, as it's harder to intercept data on a wired network than it is on a wireless network.Speed: Wired networks can provide faster data transfer speeds than wireless networks, although this is becoming less of a difference with new technologies like Wi-Fi 6.
