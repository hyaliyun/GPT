Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information: - Ascension Island is an isolated volcanic island in the equatorial waters of the South Atlantic Ocean, around from the coast of Africa and from the coast of Brazil, which is roughly midway between the horn of South America and Africa. It is governed as part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, of which the main island, Saint Helena, is around to the southeast. The territory also includes the sparsely populated Tristan da Cunha archipelago, some to the south, about halfway to the Antarctic Circle. - Tristan da Cunha, colloquially Tristan, is the name of both a remote group of volcanic islands in the south Atlantic Ocean and the main island of that group. It is the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, lying from the nearest inhabited land, Saint Helena, and from the nearest continental land, South Africa. It is from South America. The territory consists of the main island, named Tristan da Cunha, which has a northsouth length of and an area of , along with the smaller, uninhabited Nightingale Islands and the wildlife reserves of Inaccessible and Gough islands. As of January 2017, the main island has 262 permanent inhabitants. Meanwhile, the other islands are uninhabited, except for the personnel of a weather station on Gough Island. - Queen Mary 's Peak is the summit of the island of Tristan da Cunha , in the South Atlantic Ocean . It has an elevation of 2,062 metres ( 6,765 ft ) above sea level . It is named after Mary of Teck , the Queen consort of King George V. It is the highest point of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena , Ascension and Tristan da Cunha . The mountain is the peak of the massive shield volcano which forms the island . A 300 m ( 1,000 ft ) wide summit crater caps the peak , and it contains a heart - shaped crater lake . This lake is normally frozen during the winter , and the upper slopes of the volcano are covered in snow . The only recorded historical eruption occurred in 1961 from a vent on the north shore of the island . The island community had to be evacuated . Queen Mary 's Peak was used by sailors on the route from Europe to the Indian Ocean and beyond as a navigational aid . In the 17th century the East India Company instructed captains to sail via Tristan . In 2004 , Ellen MacArthur sighted the Peak on her record - breaking circumnavigation of the world . - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Mary of Teck (Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes; 26 May 1867 24 March 1953) was Queen of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions and Empress of India as the wife of King-Emperor George V. - Saint Helena is a volcanic tropical island in the South Atlantic Ocean, east of Rio de Janeiro and west of the Cunene River, which marks the border between Namibia and Angola in southwestern Africa.

In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch. - Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha is a British Overseas Territory located in the South Atlantic and consisting of the island of Saint Helena, Ascension Island and the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha. - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\". - Bulgaria (tr. '), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (tr. '), is a country in southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes. The door opened. \\"Dingo.\\" \\"Hey, Luna.\\" Her job as Rick's assistant was to take care of his place while he was out being a rock star.

Afterwards, Harry is sent to get a chicken for lunch, but they fire a machine gun at him and throw a grenade, which Harry throws into the chicken shed, blowing them up. Nan tells Harry the story of his twin brother, Otto, which Harry claims to have heard before. Suddenly, Harry and Nan then discover that their beloved pet hamster Abu is ill after he vomits a green substance on them, so they take him to the vet. He is almost put down until Harry takes him back home. Ed the vet and his assistant, Kisko, are working for Harry's neo-Nazi twin brother Otto who was abandoned by Nan in the 1970s, claiming it was because she couldn't look after them both, and was raised by Alsatians. After another failed attempt to capture Abu (by disguising as a priest and a nun), Harry and Nan decide to take him on a trip in their Rover P6 to Blackpool for a week before he dies (when Abu really wanted to visit the home of Rihanna).

After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.The Dominicans established themselves in Xocolo on the shore of Lake Izabal in the mid-16th century.

This implies that the reason behind their decision was dissatisfaction with the salary they were receiving, as well as the monotonous nature of the tasks involved in their job. The context doesn't specifically mention that Jan wants to earn more money, find a new job, or get a promotion at work. However, we can infer their intentions and possibilities from the situation. Option A: Earn more money - This option is partially true since Jan quit their job due to being underpaid, which means they might be seeking a better-paying job to resolve this issue. However, this option doesn't address the aspect of their job being tedious. Option B: Find a new job - This option can be considered the best answer to the question according to the context.

Mike Bishop, R-Rochester, won the race to replace former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Howell, last year, beating Democrat Eric Schertzing, 54%-42%. But someone with Gilbert's celebrity could make a splash, especially when it comes to raising funds for her campaign. Bishop was recently added to the Republican's Patriot Program, an effort to help potentially vulnerable incumbents maintain their seats in Congress, though it's unclear why he was marked for such aid. “I'm running for Congress to make life a little easier for all the families who feel they have fallen through the cracks in today's economy,” Gilbert said in a statement released on her website, www.gilbertformichigan.com. “I believe building a new economy is a team effort, and we need to bring fresh voices to the table to get the job done.” Her hopes could also be helped in a presidential year when Democratic turnout tends to be higher. President Barack Obama won the district 52%-46% in 2008, though Republican nominee Mitt Romney outperformed the incumbent Democrat 51%-48% in 2012. Gilbert, 51, has not held political office before but was president of the Screen Actors Guild from 2001 to 2005, serving two terms. An actress and director, she is a native of California and moved to Howell in 2013 after marrying Busfield, who is a native of East Lansing. There are questions she will have to address, however. In June, the Daily Press & Argus in Livingston County reported that the IRS filed a lien against Gilbert, alleging she owes more than 360,000 in back taxes, a point that Michigan Republicans were quick to point out as she announced her campaign. Bishop's campaign spokesman Stu Sandler sent out a statement saying Gilbert \\"can afford to have a stylist for her dog, but cannot pay her taxes. Her values are out of whack with the district.” “The truth is I got caught in a perfect storm of financial difficulty, which is why I initiated a conversation with the IRS, told them I was having trouble and together we set up a payment plan,\\" Gilbert said in a statement to the Free Press. Asked for additional details about the tax bill, a campaign spokesman declined, saying, \\"The statement is the statement.\\" Michigan's 8th Congressional District stretches east of Lansing through Ingham and Livingston counties and into northern Oakland County.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Burke was born in Dublin, Ireland. His mother Mary nee Nagle (c. 1702-1770) was a Roman Catholic who hailed from a declasse County Cork family (and a cousin of Nano Nagle), whereas his father, a successful solicitor, Richard (died 1761), was a member of the Church of Ireland; it remains unclear whether this is the same Richard Burke who converted from Catholicism. The Burke dynasty descends from an Anglo-Norman knight surnamed de Burgh (Latinised as de Burgo) who arrived in Ireland in 1185 following Henry II of England's 1171 invasion of Ireland and is among the chief \\"Gall\\" families that assimilated into Gaelic society, becoming \\"more Irish than the Irish themselves\\". Burke adhered to his father's faith and remained a practising Anglican throughout his life, unlike his sister Juliana who was brought up as and remained a Roman Catholic. In 1774, Burke's Speech to the Electors at Bristol at the Conclusion of the Poll was noted for its defence of the principles of representative government against the notion that elected officials should merely be delegates: ... it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. Political scientist Hanna Pitkin points out that Burke linked the interest of the district with the proper behaviour of its elected official, explaining, \\"Burke conceives of broad, relatively fixed interest, few in number and clearly defined, of which any group or locality has just one. These interests are largely economic or associated with particular localities whose livelihood they characterize, in his over-all prosperity they involve.\\" Burke was a leading sceptic with respect to democracy. While admitting that theoretically, in some cases it might be desirable, he insisted a democratic government in Britain in his day would not only be inept, but also oppressive. He opposed democracy for three basic reasons. First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people. Second, he thought that if they had the vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property. Third, Burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over unpopular minorities, who needed the protection of the upper classes. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Yes, there are other interesting aspects in the article. One of them is about Burke's views on representative government: \\"It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living.\\" This quote shows how Burke believed that elected officials should balance the interests and opinions of their constituents with their own judgment and principles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened. But I can use this background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. What is an answer for this question: Who had a somatic mutation?

The file exists on PCs too, but we haven't written a version of the application that runs on Windows ourselves. If you do a web search, you'll now find versions that other people have created, but while we have no reason to believe they contain any malicious code, we haven't inspected and verified any of them ourselves. Since we can't vouch for them we don't feel capable of recommending one in particular. How does the application work? If you run it on an OS X machine that you’ve been syncing with an iPhone or an iPad with cellular plan, it will scan through the backup files that are automatically made, looking for the hidden file containing your location. If it finds this file, it will then display the location history on the map. How can I examine the data without running the application? It will be stored in a folder inside /Users/<your user name>/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/. Each time you sync up an iOS device (iPad, iPhone, etc) files will be copied into a new folder here. The names of the folders and the files within them are mostly random strings, but there are some index files like Info.plist and Manifest.mbdb. Find the folder that has the most recent backup by looking at the modified dates of the files. Then, load Info.plist into a text editor to see what device it's for. You should see a 'Device Name' value in the XML, make sure that it matches your iPhone. The Manifest.mbdb and Manifest.mbdx files contain a listing of the real names of the files represented by random strings in that folder. Luckily, Alasdair found a Python script here that can convert those: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3085153/how-to-parse-the-manifest-mbdb-file-in-an-ios-4-0-itunes-backup If you cd into the folder in the terminal, and run iphonels.py you'll see a listing of all the files with their real names. Now, pipe it through grep to find the file we want, eg: ~/Downloads/iphonels.py | grep \\"consolidated\\" You should see something like this: -rw-r--r-- 00000000 00000000 28082176 1297319654 1297319654 1282888290 (4096c9ec676f2847dc283405900e284a7c815836)RootDomain::Library/Caches/locationd/consolidated.db That text in brackets just before 'RootDomain::' is the name of the actual file on disk that holds the location data.

One thing that will help is choosing encrypted backups, since that will prevent other users or programs on your machine from viewing the data, but there will still be a copy on your device. Why is Apple collecting this information? It’s unclear. One guess might be that they have new features in mind that require a history of your location, but that’s pure speculation. The fact that it's transferred across devices when you restore or migrate is evidence the data-gathering isn't accidental. Is Apple storing this information elsewhere? There’s no evidence that it’s being transmitted beyond your device and any machines you sync it with. What’s so bad about this? The most immediate problem is that this data is stored in an easily-readable form on your machine. Any other program you run or user with access to your machine can look through it. The more fundamental problem is that Apple are collecting this information at all. Cell-phone providers collect similar data almost inevitably as part of their operations, but it’s kept behind their firewall. It normally requires a court order to gain access to it, whereas this is available to anyone who can get their hands on your phone or computer. By passively logging your location without your permission, Apple have made it possible for anyone from a jealous spouse to a private investigator to get a detailed picture of your movements. Why did you open-source this code, won’t that make the problem worse? We did hesitate over the right thing to do in this case, but when it became clear that \\"Individuals familiar with iPhone forensic analysis will be quite familiar\\" with it, as Ryan Neal puts it and that at least one other person had tried to alert the public but apparently failed to make it clear what was going on, a demonstration application seemed the lesser evil. To make it less useful for snoops, the spatial and temporal accuracy of the data has been artificially reduced. You can only animate week-by-week even though the data is timed to the second, and if you zoom in you’ll see the points are constrained to a grid, so your exact location is not revealed. The underlying database has no such constraints, unfortunately. Why are some points in places I’ve never visited? As far as we can tell, the location is determined by triangulating against the nearest cell-phone towers. This isn’t as accurate as GPS, but presumably takes less power. In some cases it can get very confused and temporarily think you’re several miles from your actual location, but these tend to be intermittent glitches. How was it discovered? We’ve been collaborating on several location data visualization projects, for example this map of radiation levels in Japan: http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2011/mar/24/fukushima-radiation-levels We’d been discussing doing a visualization of mobile data, and while he was researching into what was available, Alasdair discovered this file. At first we weren’t sure how much data was there, but after we dug further and visualized the extracted data, it became clear that there was a scary amount of detail on our movements. It also became obvious that at least some other people knew about it, but it wasn't being publicized. What’s your relationship with Apple? Pete worked for Apple for five years, and left three years ago on good terms. He had no contact with anything iPhone related, (he worked on desktop visualization software) and received no help or information from inside the company while researching this problem. We’re both big fans of Apple’s products, and take no pleasure in uncovering this issue. You say no data is shared, but why do I see the web accessed when I run the app? The visualization is implemented as a view onto a local web page using the OpenHeatMap jQuery plugin. This means that the following resources are pulled from the web: OpenStreetMap background tiles The jQuery main script file hosted on Google The OpenHeatMap script and CSS files All of these are just static files that are downloaded from the web, and none of your data ever leaves your machine. We do still recommend inspecting the source code if you're a developer, or even just relying on the directions that allow you to inspect the data using standard database tools. How can I choose which device's location data will be shown? There's no user interface to choose different devices, it just picks the most recently synced iPad or iPhone with valid data. This means you can usually view a particular device's information by syncing it, so that it's files are the newest, and then re-running the application. What does the size and color of the circles represent? Basically the smallest orange circles represent one or two points near a location, and the large dark-blue circles are for dozens of points near the same place. We're counting how many points fall within a 1/100th of a degree square. ||||| Update, 4/27/11 — Apple has posted a response to questions raised in this report and others. By Alasdair Allan and Pete Warden Today at Where 2.0 Pete Warden and I will announce the discovery that your iPhone, and your 3G iPad, is regularly recording the position of your device into a hidden file. Ever since iOS 4 arrived, your device has been storing a long list of locations and time stamps. We’re not sure why Apple is gathering this data, but it’s clearly intentional, as the database is being restored across backups, and even device migrations. A visualization of iPhone location data. Click to enlarge. The presence of this data on your iPhone, your iPad, and your backups has security and privacy implications. We’ve contacted Apple’s Product Security team, but we haven’t heard back. What makes this issue worse is that the file is unencrypted and unprotected, and it’s on any machine you’ve synched with your iOS device. It can also be easily accessed on the device itself if it falls into the wrong hands. Anybody with access to this file knows where you’ve been over the last year, since iOS 4 was released. In the following video, we discuss how the file was discovered and take a look at the data contained in the file. Further details are posted below. What information is being recorded? All iPhones appear to log your location to a file called “consolidated.db.” This contains latitude-longitude coordinates along with a timestamp. The coordinates aren’t always exact, but they are pretty detailed. There can be tens of thousands of data points in this file, and it appears the collection started with iOS 4, so there’s typically around a year’s worth of information at this point. Our best guess is that the location is determined by cell-tower triangulation, and the timing of the recording is erratic, with a widely varying frequency of updates that may be triggered by traveling between cells or activity on the phone itself. Who has access to this data? Don’t panic. As we discuss in the video, there’s no immediate harm that would seem to come from the availability of this data. Nor is there evidence to suggest this data is leaving your custody. But why this data is stored and how Apple intends to use it — or not — are important questions that need to be explored. Related books by Alasdair Allan and Pete Warden What are the implications of this location data? The cell phone companies have always had this data, but it takes a court order to access it. Now this information is sitting in plain view, unprotected from the world. Beyond this, there is even more data that we have yet to look at in depth. For example, in my own case I (Alasdair) discovered a list of hundreds of thousands of wireless access points that my iPhone has been in range of during the last year. How can you look at your own data? We have built an application that helps you look at your own data. It’s available at petewarden.github.com/iPhoneTracker along with the source code and deeper technical information. What can you do about this? An immediate step you can take is to encrypt your backups through iTunes (click on your device within iTunes and then check “Encrypt iPhone Backup” under the “Options” area).

A Wednesday blog post published on O'Reilly Radar claims that devices running iOS 4 are gathering location and storing it in an unencrypted manner. \\"What makes this issue worse is that the file is unencrypted and unprotected, and it's on any machine you've synched with your iOS device. It can also be easily accessed on the device itself if it falls into the wrong hands. Anybody with access to this file knows where you've been over the last year, since iOS 4 was released,\\" wrote Pete Warden, founder of the Data Science Toolkit, and Alasdair Allan, a senior research fellow at the University of Exeter. The data is being stored to a file known as \\"consolidated.db,\\" which includes latitude-longitude coordinates and a timestamp. \\"The coordinates aren't always exact, but they are pretty detailed. There can be tens of thousands of data points in this file, and it appears the collection started with iOS 4, so there's typically around a year's worth of information at this point,\\" Warden and Allan wrote. The duo speculated that the data collection is erratic. Update times vary and might be triggered by traveling between cells or activity on the phone itself. But while this data is being stored on your phones and iOS devices, Warden and Allan acknowledge that there is no \\"evidence to suggest this data is leaving your custody\\"aka, being sent to Apple. There is also \\"no immediate harm that would seem to come from the availability of this data.\\" \\"But why this data is stored and how Apple intends to use itor notare important questions that need to be explored,\\" they wrote. \\"The cell phone companies have always had this data, but it takes a court order to access it. Now this information is sitting in plain view, unprotected from the world. Beyond this, there is even more data that we have yet to look at in depth.\\" As one commenter on the blog post pointed out, this data collection was first discussed last year. Digital forensic specialist Christopher Vance wrote on his blog that the location data is used as part of iAds, in addition to apps that require location-based data. In a later blog post, however, Vance said \\"these points are being used not in direct connection with iAds but on your device itself.\\" Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but another commenter pointed to a July 2010 letter that Apple penned to House lawmakers about its location-based services. Apple insisted that its location-based services exist only to enhance the user experience and that the company does not activate these services until it has received express consent from users. It collects data \\"anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services,\\" Bruce Sewell, general counsel and senior vice president of legal and government affairs at Apple, wrote in a letter to Reps. Edward Markey and Joe Barton. \\"Apple is committed to giving our customers clear notice and control over their information, and we believe our products do this in a simple and elegant way,\\" he said. The inquiry occured after Apple updated its privacy policy to say that it could \\"collect, use, and share precise location data, including real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device.\\" In the letter, Apple said four Apple devices collected geographic location data: the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3GS, the iPhone 4, and the iPad Wi-Fi + 3G. To a lesser extent, older iPhone models, the iPad Wi-Fi, the iPod touch, Mac computers with Snow Leopard, and Safari 5 also collect similar information. Apple started collecting location-based data and Wi-Fi information in January 2008. \\"Apple has always provided its customers with the ability to control the location-based service capabilities of their devices,\\" Sewell said. \\"In fact, Apple now provides customers even greater control over such capabilities for devices running the current version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 4.\\" With iOS 4, customers can pick and choose the apps with which they do not want to share location information, even if the global, location-based capabilities on their device are turned on, Apple said. An arrow icon, meanwhile, alerts iOS 4 users if an app is using or has recently used location-based information. Warden and Allan seemed to take issue with the fact that the data collected was easily accessible. They built an app that helps you look at your own data, and suggested that concerned users encrypt their backups via iTunes. To do so, click on your device within iTunes and then check \\"Encrypt iPhone Backup\\" under the \\"Options\\" area. A more detailed look at Warden and Allan's investigation is in the video below. The news is also interesting in light of a case out of Michigan where police officers have been accused of secretly extracting data from peoples' cell phones during routine stops. The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan has urged the Michigan State Police (MSP) to release information about the alleged practice.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Like all surgical procedures, breast augmentation carries risks. Some are severe, while some less so, but it is important to know what risks you are taking, for bigger boobs: Nerve damage in the breast may cause numbness in the nipples or breast tissue; an inability to feel anything. These effects can be permanent. Complications with future mammography. Breast implants make breast-cancer screening more difficult and demand an x-ray technician experienced in working with implants. Your doctor may also require additional tests with each checkup including an ultrasound and an MRI. Do not forget, these procedures are the result of cosmetic surgery, unlikely to be covered by insurance. Your scars will be firm and pink for at least six weeks. They may remain the same size for several months, or even appear to widen. After several months, your scars will begin to fade, though they will never disappear completely. Capsular contracture refers to a painful complication in which scar tissue hardens around the implant and squeezes, which can result in shape changes in the breasts, breasts that are hard to the touch, and pain. Additional surgery is required to deal with capsular contracture. Some women suffer severe infections one to two weeks after surgery. In rare cases, the implant will have to be surgically removed. You may experience excessive bleeding following the surgery, along with swelling and pain. Again, additional operations will be needed if this happens. Implants can break or leak. Beyond factory defects, many things can cause the implants to break and leak inside your body. These activities include exercise, injury and even normal day-to-day movement. Ruptured implants are a controversial topic and more can be written about the subject. In general, what happens when an implant breaks depends on the kind of implant: If a saline-filled implant breaks, the implant will deflate in a few hours and the salt water will be absorbed and naturally expelled by the body. If a silicone-gel filled implant leak or break, the elastic silicone gel may remain within the implant shell, or may escape into the breast. A leaking silicone gel implant may not be noticeable except through expensive tests like an MRI. Thus women with silicone breast implants are advised to visit with their plastic surgeon every year, to make sure they are still functioning properly. Your new breasts may be slightly different from one another, potentially in both size and shape. Engage in your regular day to day activities. Routine activity or injury can cause damage, resulting in the implants leaking or breaking. Additional surgery will be necessary to remove the implant or replace it. There is no evidence that implants change your ability to nurse an infant, or change anything about your pregnancy. It is possible, however, that the pregnancy will alter your body enough that the implants will have to be replaced for aesthetic reasons.","completion":"Breast augmentation is a surgery for bigger boobs, but it has some risks.

Children lack schooling in Syria crisis, UNICEF says BEIRUT — Syria’s civil conflict has battered the nation’s education system, depriving hundreds of thousands of children of schooling, UNICEF said Tuesday. One in 5 Syrian schools have suffered damage or have been converted into shelters, UNICEF said in a new overview of the parlous state of education in Syria, where an armed rebellion has been raging for almost two years. In some cases, UNICEF said, armed groups have commandeered schools. At least 2,400 schools have been damaged or destroyed, the U.N. children's agency said. More than 110 teachers and staff members have been killed, UNICEF said, and others are no longer reporting to their schools. Many parents are reluctant to send their children to classes, fearing for their safety. In the embattled northern city of Aleppo, the site of daily clashes, the school attendance rate has dropped as low as 6%, UNICEF said. “Syria once prided itself on the quality of its schools,” said Youssouf Abdel-Jelil, UNICEF’s Syria representative. “Now it’s seeing the gains it made over the years rapidly reversed.” The U.N. agency says its efforts in Syria include providing teaching and learning supplies, assisting in remedial education and repairing damaged facilities. UNICEF says its education initiatives in Syria will cost about 20 million during the first six months of 2013, but the agency, which relies on private and public donations, has received no more than 3 million.

SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

The 35-year-old Collins made the announcement in a first-person story for Sports Illustrated magazine. It's the same forum he used in April, 2013, to publicly reveal his sexuality and become the first openly gay man in any of the four major North American professional leagues. Scroll down for video. Jason Collins become the first openly gay man in any of the four major North American professional leagues. Collins made both announcements in first-person articles for Sports Illustrated magazine. He joined the Brooklyn Nets in February and played 22 games for the team, but was not on the roster this season. 'It feels wonderful to have been part of these milestones for sports and for gay rights, and to have been embraced by the public, the coaches, the players, the league and history,' Collins wrote. Collins started his career with the New Jersey Nets in 2001 and rejoined the franchise in Brooklyn. Nets spokesman Aaron Harris said Collins was expected to make an official announcement at the Barclays Center before the Nets game with the Milwaukee Bucks. Bucks coach Jason Kidd was Brooklyn's coach last year, and Collins singled him out for the 'courage' he showed in bringing him on board. 'It had been argued that no team would want to take on a player who was likely to attract a media circus from the outset and whose sexuality would be a distraction,' he wrote. 'I'm happy to have helped put those canards to rest.' Collins wore No 98 during his final seasons in the league - 1998 was year that Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming - was killed. Collins said his most poignant moment came during his third game back last season, when he met Shepard's family in Denver. Following Collins revelation, Missouri defensive end Michael Sam came out in February and was drafted by the St Louis Rams in the NFL. He was later cut by the Rams and was released from the Dallas Cowboys practice squad last month. In April, University of Massachusetts guard Derrick Gordon became the first openly gay player in Division I men's basketball. But Collins stressed that there are still no openly gay players in the NFL, NHL or major league baseball. He said: 'When we get to the point where he's not compelled to hide his true self and is able to live an authentic life,' being a gay athlete won't be a big deal. 'But we're not there yet.' Collins started his career with the New Jersey Nets in 2001 and rejoined the franchise in Brooklyn.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores, but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi. I am facing a new situation today: Bess and Dee were two entomologists. they were studying ants. Dee liked to learn more about leaf cutter ants, while Bess learned all she could about all other ants.

He had a younger brother, James Peale (1749-1831). Charles became an apprentice to a saddle maker when he was thirteen years old. Upon reaching maturity, he opened his own saddle shop; however, when his Loyalist creditors discovered he had joined the Sons of Liberty, they conspired to bankrupt his business. In 1762, Peale married Rachel Brewer (1744-1790), who bore him ten children, most named for Peale's favorite artists, male and female. The sons included Raphaelle Peale (1774-1825), Rembrandt Peale (1778-1860), who was another famous portrait painter and museum owner/operator in Baltimore, and scientific inventor and businessman, Titian Peale I (1780-1798), and Rubens Peale (1784-1865). Among the daughters: Angelica Kauffman Peale (named for Angelica Kauffman, Peale's favorite female painter) married Alexander Robinson, her daughter Priscilla Peale wed Dr. Henry Boteler, and Sophonisba Angusciola Peale (named for Sofonisba Anguissola) married Coleman Sellers. After Rachel's death in 1790, Peale married Elizabeth de Peyster (d. 1804) the next year. With his second wife, he had six additional children. One son, Franklin Peale, born on October 15, 1795, became the Chief Coiner at the Philadelphia Mint. Their youngest son, Titian Ramsay Peale (1799-1885), became an important naturalist and pioneer in photography. Their daughter, Elizabeth De Peyster Peale (1802-57), married William Augustus Patterson (1792-1833) in 1820. Hannah More, a Quaker from Philadelphia, married Peale in 1804, becoming his third wife. She helped raise the younger children from his previous two marriages. Peale's slave, Moses Williams, was also trained in the arts while growing up in the Peale household and later became a professional silhouette artist. In 1810, Peale purchased a farm in Germantown where he intended to retire. He named this estate 'Belfield', and cultivated extensive gardens there. After Hannah's death in 1821, Peale lived with his son Rubens and sold Belfield in 1826. Peale died on February 22, 1827, and was buried at the Saint Peter's Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"There are several interesting aspects in the article about Charles Willson Peale. One notable quote from the article is: \\"Charles became an apprentice to a saddle maker when he was thirteen years old. Upon reaching maturity, he opened his own saddle shop; however, when his Loyalist creditors discovered he had joined the Sons of Liberty, they conspired to bankrupt his business.\\" This quote highlights Peale's early life and his involvement in politics as a member of the Sons of Liberty, a secret organization that played a significant role in the American Revolution. His political stance led to challenges in his professional life due to the influence of his Loyalist creditors. Another interesting aspect of the article is about Peale's naming conventions for his children: \\"In 1762, Peale married Rachel Brewer (1744-1790), who bore him ten children, most named for Peale's favorite artists, male and female.\\" This demonstrates Peale's passion for the arts and his admiration for other artists.

Trivia question: George Washington Gale Ferris, Jr. invented what engineering marvel for the 1893 exposition in Chicago in the hopes of creating something as impressive as the Eiffel Tower? And the answer is?","completion":"The answer is the Ferris Wheel. George Washington Gale Ferris, Jr., an American civil engineer, invented the Ferris Wheel for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago, Illinois. The exposition commemorated the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World in 1492, and America wanted to showcase something that would rival the Eiffel Tower, which had been the centerpiece of the 1889 Paris Exposition. Ferris was inspired by the idea of creating a unique and impressive attraction that could captivate people's imagination and demonstrate America's engineering prowess. He decided to design a gigantic observation wheel that not only would symbolize the technological advancement of the country but also generate the same level of excitement and awe that the Eiffel Tower had created during the Paris Exposition. Ferris' wheel, named the \\"Ferris Wheel,\\" stood 264 feet tall and had a capacity to carry more than 2,000 passengers at once. The wheel featured 36 fully enclosed passenger gondolas, each with an approximate seating capacity of 60 people. The observation wheel allowed passengers to experience panoramic views of the exposition and the surrounding areas from a height and perspective never before seen. Despite facing skepticism and doubts from fellow engineers and critics about the safety and feasibility of such a colossal structure, Ferris successfully demonstrated his engineering marvel to the world. The Ferris Wheel became the star attraction of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition and an enduring symbol of human ingenuity and innovation. Since then, the Ferris Wheel has become a staple among amusement parks and various global events across the world. It has evolved in terms of technology, size, and design, with newer and larger versions being constructed as a testament to mankind's fascination with these rotating wonders. Notable examples include the London Eye in the United Kingdom and the Singapore Flyer in Singapore. In summary, George Washington Gale Ferris, Jr. invented the Ferris Wheel as an engineering marvel for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, in hopes of showcasing an attraction as impressive as the Eiffel Tower. The Ferris Wheel has since become a beloved and enduring symbol of entertainment and engineering achievement across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Michael asked Robert how to draw the perfect hexagon because","completion":"Michael asked Robert how to draw the perfect hexagon because, although both of them had learned about it in the past, neither could recall the exact steps or techniques required to do so. As close friends who had a shared interest in art, design, and geometry, they often engaged in collaborative projects, challenging each other to enhance their skills or learn new techniques. This time, they had decided to recreate a beautiful, intricate geometric pattern that they had seen in a book on Islamic art, which prominently featured a perfect hexagon. Robert, being the more skilled drafter of the two, was known for his ability to create precise and intricate drawings. Michael thought that even if he didn't remember how to draw a perfect hexagon, Robert might be able to provide some guidance on the process or point them in the right direction to figure it out. In the back of their minds, they recalled certain aspects of drawing a hexagon, such as knowing that it has six equal sides and angles, and it can be inscribed within a circle. Despite this basic understanding, they knew that creating the perfect hexagon would require more detailed knowledge of the drawing process and, perhaps, some mathematical understanding of the hexagon's dimensions and relationships between its elements. As they began their project, Michael and Robert first spent some time researching how to draw the perfect hexagon. They came across different methods, such as using a compass and straightedge, applying mathematical formulas like the Pythagorean theorem, or leveraging grid paper for accurate measurement and alignment. They knew that selecting the most appropriate technique would be essential for achieving the precision and symmetry necessary for their pattern. The more they investigated, the more they narrowed down their approach. They decided to use a compass and straightedge, as it was a classical technique that had been employed by mathematicians and artists alike for centuries. It would also provide them with the accuracy they sought, and the satisfaction of mastering an age-old skill. Following the steps they found in their research, Michael and Robert began the process of drawing the perfect hexagon: 1. First, Michael drew a circle with a compass, ensuring that it was centered and of the desired diameter. 2. Keeping the compass at the same width, Robert gently marked six equally spaced points along the circle's edge without drawing a complete circle. 3. With a straightedge, Michael connected each adjacent pair of points to create the six equal sides. 4. As Robert connected the points, Michael carefully checked the angles to ensure they were all at 120 degrees, making any minor adjustments if necessary. 5. Finally, they both scrutinized their resulting hexagon, confirming that it was visually symmetrical and of the desired precision. With the perfect hexagon now complete, Michael and Robert could proceed with developing the elaborate geometric pattern they had envisioned. Additionally, they were both content that, through their collaborative efforts, they had re-learned the technique for drawing a flawless hexagon and deepened their understanding of the finer points of geometric design. In the end, the journey of rediscovering how to draw the perfect hexagon was as rewarding as the result itself. Michael and Robert not only deepened their appreciation for the art of geometry but also strengthened their bond as friends by sharing a common challenge and working together to overcome it."},{"prompt":"Addison tried hard in class and got a very good grade on their math exam.

While speeding down a dirt road, they hit and kill a grizzly bear cub, sending their Jeep Cherokee into a tree and cracking the radiator. As they argue over whether they should bury the dead cub, they hear its mother coming and run. The vehicle overheats down the road so Wes and Ritch go into the forest to find water. The Grizzly Bear finds and attacks Ritch. Having heard Ritch's screams to run, Wes inadvertently runs into the bear and it attacks him.

Morgan is inside the article: James Longacre died suddenly at his home in Philadelphia on January 1, 1869. A memorial meeting was held at the Philadelphia Mint on January 5, attended by the facility's employees. The Director of the Mint, Henry Linderman, delivered a speech in praise of Longacre prior to the formal eulogy, which was given by Longacre's assistant, William Barber, who would be appointed as Longacre's successor. Like each of his predecessors, Longacre died in office.Longacre was recognized in an exhibit of 100 notable American engravers sponsored by the New York Public Library in 1928. In 1970, art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on U.S. coins, viewed Longacre and his works less favorably, \\"uniform in their dullness, lack of inspiration, and even quaintness, Longacre's contributions to patterns and regular coinage were a decided step backwards from the art of [Thomas] Sully, [Titian] Peale, [Robert] Hughes, and Gobrecht\\" and \\"whatever his previous qualities as an engraver of portraits, he seems not to have brought much imagination to his important post at the Philadelphia Mint.\\" However, Vermeule considered the Flying Eagle cent more of a work of art, far above the mundane.In his 1991 article, McKenzie notes Vermeule's concerns, but considers Longacre's work important for its use of American symbols, including the representations of Native Americans. He believes Longacre's use of such symbols influenced later coin designers, such as George T. Morgan, Victor D. Brenner, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens. He particularly praises the ornate scroll on the reverse of the double eagle, calling it \\"unique in American numismatic art and enhances the elegance of a design befitting the highest-denomination U.S. coin\\", and applauds \\"the exciting innovation in symbolism and expression of national sentiment that he brought to U.S. numismatic art\\".According to Bowers, \\"Today, Longacre is widely admired by numismatists.\\" Lange notes that Longacre's \\"artistic vision graced 60 years of American coins\\".

Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press.

George Clooney, the man long considered one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors, followed up his private wedding to British human rights attorney Amal Alamuddin with a civil ceremony in Venice, Italy, on Monday. Clooney, 53, and Alamuddin, 36, arrived at Venice's city hall -- the Ca' Farsetti palazzo -- in a water taxi appropriately named \\"Amore,\\" or \\"Love.\\" Venetian authorities stopped pedestrian and boat traffic in the area for the ceremony. Clooney wore a gray suit and dark tie, while Alamuddin was dressed in flowing cream trousers, a cream top with a blue border and a wide-brimmed matching hat. The couple spent about 10 minutes inside the venue before boating to their hotel, with well-wishers lining the canal. Rai, Italian state television, later reported that they had left Venice on a private jet, heading for London -- leaving \\"Amore\\" free for other visitors to the city. Private ceremony. Celebrities, paparazzi and the world's media congregated in Venice for Clooney and Alamuddin's widely anticipated nuptials. Their private ceremony on Saturday was marked with a star-studded bash at the Aman Canal Grande Venice resort, housed in the 16th-century Palazzo Papadopoli. Clooney also arrived by motorboat to that ceremony, waving to the sound of \\"George, auguri!\\" as Venetians offered their best wishes. Plenty of paparazzi, cameramen and photographers were on the docks facing the Aman Canal Grande. Others were going up and down the Grand Canal on taxi boats. The first celebrity guests to arrive were also caught on camera in the city famed for romance, notably actor Matt Damon, American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and supermodel Cindy Crawford. \\"I guess this is, as Dean Martin put it, 'That's Amore,' the land of love,\\" said a tourist visiting Venice from Canada, referring to the late crooner's signature song. \\"Yes, my heart is broken but I'm excited,\\" his partner said with a smile.

Clooney revealed earlier this month at a celebrity charity event in Tuscany, Italy, that he and Alamuddin would be tying the knot in Venice. According to People magazine, Clooney was receiving a humanitarian award at the black-tie gala, and said during his acceptance speech, \\"I met my lovely bride-to-be here in Italy, whom I will be marrying, in a couple of weeks, in Venice, of all places.\\" Since they became engaged in the spring, Clooney and Alamuddin have been largely protective of their relationship.

On the other hand, Tanya's parents thought it would be better for her to learn just one language, so she can concentrate on it and become really good at it. They wanted her to have an easy time understanding stories, watching movies, and speaking with her friends and teachers at school. One sunny day, Laura and Tanya decided to go to the park to play.

Maria could only speak Spanish. Laura quickly became friends with Maria because they both understood and could speak Spanish. They laughed, played, and shared stories using their second language. Tanya felt a bit left out because she didn't understand what Laura and Maria were saying. She felt sad and couldn't join in their fun conversations. Although Laura tried her best to include Tanya, Tanya still felt a little confused about all the new words she was hearing.

Write the answer: Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulphur/sulfur hexafluoride are widely referred to by what collective metaphorical term?","completion":"Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulfur hexafluoride are widely referred to by the collective metaphorical term \\"Greenhouse Gases.\\" This term is used because these gases' behavior in the Earth's atmosphere is akin to the effect of a greenhouse in regulating temperature. Greenhouse gases have a significant impact on the planet's climate and have been the primary driving force behind global warming and climate change. To understand why they are called greenhouse gases, we need to first understand how a greenhouse works. A greenhouse is a structure made of glass or transparent plastic, which allows sunlight to enter and warm the interior. The glass or plastic traps heat, preventing it from easily escaping and maintaining a warmer temperature inside. This controlled environment is beneficial for growing plants, especially in cold climates. Similarly, greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere allow sunlight to pass through and warm the surface of the planet. Once the sunlight is absorbed by the Earth, it is re-emitted as infrared radiation, which is a form of heat. Instead of allowing this heat to escape back into space, greenhouse gases absorb and trap it, thereby warming the planet further. This phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect. Each of the greenhouse gases mentioned plays a different role in the atmosphere, and they vary in their potency, sources, and atmospheric lifetime: 1. Carbon Dioxide (CO2): CO2 is the most prevalent greenhouse gas, accounting for about 76% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It is primarily released through the combustion of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as through deforestation and certain industrial processes. Carbon dioxide can remain in the atmosphere for centuries, making it a long-lasting contributor to global warming. 2. Methane (CH4): Methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas, contributing to approximately 16% of global emissions. It is about 25 times more effective at trapping heat compared to carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. Methane is primarily released from agriculture (like enteric fermentation in livestock and rice paddies), fossil fuel extraction, and decomposing organic matter in landfills. 3. Nitrous Oxide (N2O): This greenhouse gas makes up around 6% of total emissions and is approximately 298 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. Nitrous oxide is mainly released through agricultural activities like the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers, as well as industrial processes and the burning of fossil fuels. It can stay in the atmosphere for over a century. 4. Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6): Although this gas only contributes to less than 0.1% of global emissions, it is exceptionally potent. Sulfur hexafluoride is 22,800 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. It is utilized in a variety of applications, including electrical switchgear, magnesium production, and semiconductor manufacturing. SF6 has an atmospheric lifetime of over 3,000 years. In summary, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulfur hexafluoride are collectively referred to as greenhouse gases due to their heat-trapping properties in the atmosphere, which contribute to the warming of the planet and the subsequent consequences of climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do hurricanes do to the amount of water contained in bodies in water?\\" is \\"fissures of hot, acidic water\\", given that hurricanes cause bodies of water to increase amount of water they contain? The answer is:","completion":"No, the statement \\"fissures of hot, acidic water\\" is not the right answer to the question \\"what do hurricanes do to the amount of water contained in bodies of water?\\", given that hurricanes cause bodies of water to increase the amount of water they contain. Hurricanes, also known as tropical cyclones, are large and powerful storms that form over warm ocean waters and can bring heavy rainfall, strong winds, storm surges, and flooding. When a hurricane makes landfall, it often leads to an increase in the amount of water contained in bodies of water like rivers, lakes, and coastal areas due to the massive influx of rainwater that it brings with it. As hurricanes generate intense rainfall, they can cause bodies of water to swell significantly, leading to an increase in the overall volume of water in the affected water bodies. This increase in water volume can result in localized flooding, coastal inundation, and even a rise in groundwater levels in some cases., particularly when a hurricane takes days to pass over a specific region or when the area experiences back-to-back storm events. As a result, local ecosystems could be significantly impacted, with aquatic habitats, as well as water quality, being affected by the sudden surge in water levels. Furthermore, hurricanes bring with them strong winds and storm surges. Storm surges can lead to significant coastal flooding, as powerful onshore winds push ocean water towards the coast and cause water levels to rise well above normal tide levels. In some cases, storm surges can inundate large areas of land and cause bodies of water along the coast to merge or expand across land. This inundation, combined with the heavy rainfall, can drastically increase the total amount of water contained within bodies of water in affected regions. The answer \\"fissures of hot, acidic water\\" seems to be unrelated, as it refers to a geological phenomenon wherein hot, acidic water emerges from cracks in the Earth's surface, typically in the vicinity of volcanic or geothermal activity. While it is possible that hurricanes and other severe weather events could modulate the behavior of geothermal systems, including the emergence of hot, acidic water through fissures, the primary mechanism by which hurricanes affect the amount of water contained in bodies of water is through increased precipitation and storm surges. In summary, the right answer to the question \\"what do hurricanes do to the amount of water contained in bodies of water?\\" should focus on the impacts of heavy rainfall and coastal flooding due to storm surges, rather than a seemingly unrelated geological phenomenon like fissures of hot, acidic water. Hurricanes, through their intense precipitation and associated storm surges, can significantly increase the amount of water contained in various bodies of water, leading to events such as flooding, coastal inundation, and potential shifts in local ecosystems and water quality."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve -124*l = 243*l + 223*l - 12980 for l.. What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation -124*l = 243*l + 223*l - 12980 for l, we will follow these steps: 1. Combine the like terms on the right side of the equation. 2. Add or subtract the constant term from both sides to isolate the variable-term. 3. Subtract or add the variable term to get the variable by itself. 4. Divide by the coefficient of the variable to find the value of the variable. Step 1: Combine the like terms on the right side of the equation. 243*l + 223*l = (243 + 223)*l = 466*l So now the equation becomes: -124*l = 466*l - 12980 Step 2: Add or subtract the constant term to isolate the variable-term. In this case, we don't need to do anything in this step as there is no constant term combined with the variable. Step 3: Subtract or add the variable term to get the variable by itself. To cancel out the 466*l term on the right side, we will add 124*l to both sides of the equation. -124*l + 124*l = 466*l - 12980 + 124*l This simplifies to: 0 = 590*l - 12980 Step 4: Divide by the coefficient of the variable to find the value of the variable. To isolate l, we'll first add 12980 to both sides: 590*l = 12980 Next, we'll divide both sides by 590: l = 12980 / 590 Now, we can perform the division to find the value of l: l = 22 So, the solution for the equation is l=22."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: people on boats going down a river .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise states that there are people on boats going down a thick tree-lined river. The hypothesis simplifies this statement to people on boats going down a river. Since the premise includes people riding boats along a river, and the only addition in the premise is the description of the river as \\"thick tree-lined,\\" it does not contradict the hypothesis. Therefore, if the premise is accurate, the hypothesis must also be true. Let's analyze the two statements in detail: 1. Premise: People on boats going down a thick tree-lined river. In this statement, we have three main pieces of information: a. The presence of people: There are individuals involved in the scenario. b. The mode of transport: These people are traveling on boats. c. The location: They are navigating through a river that is surrounded by dense trees. 2. Hypothesis: People on boats going down a river. In the hypothesis, we also have three main elements: a. The presence of people: Similar to the premise, the hypothesis mentions individuals involved in the scenario. b. The mode of transport: The people are again described as traveling on boats. c. The location: They are going down a river, which is the only aspect that does not include the detailed description found in the premise. The primary difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the level of detail provided in each statement. The premise is more descriptive and specific, mentioning that the river is thick and tree-lined, while the hypothesis is more general, simply stating that people are on boats going down a river. To conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, we can consider the key elements present in both statements: people, boats, and a river. Since the inclusion of the thick tree-lined description in the premise does not directly contradict or negate the hypothesis, we can safely deduce that the hypothesis is valid when the premise is true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English","completion":"Proposing that the future security policy should be based on nuclear deterrence in 1996 is not only outdated, but also extremely dangerous. The idea of relying on nuclear deterrence for security policy in 1996, many years after the end of the Cold War, presents several issues and risks. While nuclear deterrence may have played a considerable role during the Cold War era, it is important to understand the evolving global security landscape. Firstly, such a proposal is outdated as it does not consider the changes in the strategic environment that have occurred since the end of the Cold War. In the post-Cold War era, the primary threats to international security have diversified and evolved significantly. Issues such as terrorism, cyber warfare, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, have become new and crucial areas for security policy focus. Secondly, maintaining a security policy that is based on nuclear deterrence can be extremely dangerous, as it encourages the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This may lead to a world with a multilateral nuclear arms race, which, in turn, increases the risk of accidental launches, nuclear escalation, and the potential use of nuclear weapons by terrorists or other non-state actors. Thirdly, relying on nuclear deterrence can also fuel geopolitical tensions and contribute to destabilizing relationships between nuclear-armed states. As nations seek to counter perceived threats with their nuclear capabilities, a dangerous cycle of arms racing, mistrust, and brinkmanship can emerge – a situation that can lead to conflicts and even wars. Fourth, a security policy based on nuclear deterrence goes against the global trend towards disarmament and the principles of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which seeks to curb the spread of nuclear weapons, promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and move towards global nuclear disarmament. Furthermore, using nuclear deterrence as the basis for security policy implies that the safety of civilians is predicated upon the threat of mutually assured destruction. This has been widely criticized as immoral and unethical, given the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental consequences that would follow any nuclear exchange. In conclusion, proposing that the future security policy should be based on nuclear deterrence in 1996 is not only outdated but also extremely dangerous. Rather than perpetuating a reliance on nuclear weapons, governments should focus on addressing the evolving threats in the global security landscape and promoting diplomatic solutions to conflicts. Reducing nuclear arsenals, engaging in arms control and disarmament initiatives, and adopting a more comprehensive approach to security would be a more responsible course of action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To answer the question, we can discuss the developments in British law that occurred in the 19th century concerning the abolition of slavery and the initiation of apprenticeship for emancipated slaves. During the early 19th century, the British government took gradual steps toward the abolition of slavery. The statement provided regarding the 1807 Slave Trade Act is an example of this gradual approach. While that act indeed abolished the slave trade in the British empire, it did not abolish slavery itself. It was not until the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 that the British government began to address the end of slavery directly. The Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 formally abolished slavery throughout the British Empire and laid out steps to free slaves. Upon its implementation on August 1, 1834, the act did not grant immediate freedom to all slaves; instead, it introduced a mandatory apprenticeship system. This apprenticeship system required slaves over the age of six to serve their former owners or \\"masters\\" for a period of time before they would be officially emancipated. The apprenticeship period was divided into two categories: 1. For the enslaved working in Agriculture, the Penal Apprenticeship Term was established, which was between four to six years long, ending on August 1, 1838. 2. For the enslaved working in the service industry or performing domestic duties, the Non-Penal Apprenticeship Term was established, which was two to four years long, ending on August 1, 1836. During this apprenticeship period, the former slaves were supposed to receive wages for their labor, although many continued to be exploited under harsh conditions. The apprenticeship system was intended to help facilitate a smoother transition from slavery to a more equitable form of labor and free society. However, the apprenticeship system was widely criticized for being a continuation of slavery in all but name, and several instances of abuse and unrest led to increasing pressure on the British government. Due to these factors, along with continuous abolitionist campaigns and influence, the British Colonial Office decided to end the apprenticeship system early, resulting in all remaining apprentices being fully emancipated on August 1, 1838. In conclusion, the length of the apprenticeship for slaves before they were fully freed varied between two to six years, depending on the type of work they were engaged in, although the majority were set free after four years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You've gotten not quite a 'yes' and not quite a 'no.' You have deadlines to meet for responding to the other schools that did accept you. Should you send in that deposit to your second or third choice, or remain on your top school's list? Before you panic, there are some things you can do to strengthen your chance of getting in. In Pictures: How to Get Off The B-School Wait List Every school has a different policy about whether you should be in touch with them. Some say outright don't call us, we'll call you. If yours is one of them, follow those instructions. Disobeying will most likely do more harm than good. Some permit contact but in very specific ways. Columbia Business School changed its policy this year. \\"We no longer encourage people to set up an appointment with their wait list manager or reach out voluntarily to us,\\" says Linda B. Meehan, assistant dean and executive director of M.B.A. admissions there. \\"We've decided it makes better use of our resources if we reach out when we have questions, rather than having candidates flood us with information we may or may not be looking for.\\" Still, Meehan says, if you get an e-mail from Columbia asking if you'd like to remain on the wait list, \\"That's the time to tell us about something to enhance your application.\\" The Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, prefers to hear from wait-listed students by e-mail only; the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and the Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College are both more open. There are several reasons candidates get relegated to the wait list. If you can find out which reason applies to you, you can try to address the problem. Among the most common: a low score on the Graduate Management Admission Test; insufficient community service or leadership experience; low grades in college math classes; unclear career goals. However, \\"They won't wait list anybody unless they're willing to admit them,\\" says Scott Shrum, director of M.B.A. admissions research at Veritas Prep, an M.B.A. application consulting firm in Los Angeles. Shrumsuggests that you show your application to someone who knows about the process and together figure out what your weaknesses are. At some schools, including Northwestern, they say it's acceptable to reach out to the admissions office and ask if there's anything about your candidacy they found wanting. Beth Flye, assistant dean and director of admissions and financial aid at Northwestern's Kellogg School, recently spoke to someone she considered a strong applicant but who had taken the GMAT only once and gotten a relatively low score. Flye encouraged the candidate to take it again, since applicants can do so every 30 days, and scores tend to go up. If you got low math grades in college, take a calculus class locally and earn an A, admissions officers say. And let the school know. If there's not enough time to finish such a course, at least begin it and tell your intended school you're taking the class and are off to a strong start. Your stated career goal could also be the issue. Linda Meehan gives the example of applicants who have seemed to insist on getting into private equity after school. \\"The marketplace has changed. We want to know a little more because that may not be an option when they finish,\\" she says. As for enthusiasm, that will only get you so far. \\"Some people believe that convincing us they're really, really interested will get them off the wait list. That's just not true,\\" says Peter Johnson, executive director of admissions for the full-time M.B.A. program at the Haas School. \\"What gets them off the wait list is strengthening one of these weaknesses.\\" But it's a balance. Flye says it doesn't hurt to let the admissions staff know Kellogg is your first choice. Scott Shrum suggests that when you're asked whether you'd like to remain on the list you send an e-mail saying something like: \\"Your school is my No. 1 choice, and I can say without hesitation that if accepted I'd send in my deposit today.\\" Of course, you only want to say that if it's true. What does not work--and will land you on the rejected list--is pestering the admissions office. \\"There have been people on the wait list in past years whose interest level was inappropriate,\\" says Meehan. \\"Finding anyone under any rock who is associated with Columbia and having them send us e-mails is not helpful. If every time I turn around someone's name is coming across my screen or a wait list manager's screen, that's not in their best interest.\\" When you do get in touch, explain why that particular school is the right fit. Personalize your letter by describing the experience you had while visiting the school. Shrum suggests saying something like, \\"In the fall I had the chance to visit Wharton and sit in on Professor Siegel's finance class. After listening to the depth of discussion, I knew this was where I wanted to be.\\" There are no figures for how many applicants successfully get off waiting lists. It varies since it depends on the strength of the application pool and whether the fully accepted students decide to attend or go elsewhere. Late last year, when layoffs were at their highest, the thought was M.B.A. applications this year would skyrocket. Applications were indeed up at the beginning of many schools' application seasons, but they've since evened out. That could be good news for wait-listed students. \\"One of the big determinants in getting off the wait list has nothing to do with you,\\" says Peter Johnson. \\"We can't predict what all the admitted students will do. Our goal is to minimize the stress as much as we can. We try to communicate frequently--and not give anyone unrealistic hopes.\\" In Pictures: How to Get Off The B-School Wait List What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is about how to increase your chances of getting off the waiting list for your top choice business school. Here are the most important parts: 1. Follow the specific instructions given by each school about staying in touch. Some schools do not want to be contacted, while others have specific ways they want to be contacted. 2. Discover the reason you are on the waiting list and try to address that issue. Common reasons include low test scores, not enough community service or leadership experience, low college math grades, or unclear career goals. 3. Show your application to someone knowledgeable and work together to identify and improve your weaknesses. 4. If needed, retake exams like the GMAT, since scores tend to improve after multiple attempts. 5. Communicate any positive changes you have made, such as enrolling in a math class or updating your career goals. 6. It's okay to express enthusiasm for the school but remember that addressing your weaknesses is more important. 7. Do not pester the admissions office or constantly send them messages. This can hurt your chances of getting accepted. 8. Personalize your communications by mentioning specific experiences you had while visiting the school. 9. Understand that the number of applicants who successfully get off waiting lists varies and depends on factors outside of your control. Remember, improving your weaknesses and following each school's communication preferences are the best ways to increase your chances of getting off the waiting list for your top choice business school."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town – the first planned industrial estate in the world – had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared. Tangerine Dream was the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on 19 October 1975. In more recent years, Lancashire... Guess a valid title for it!

Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing happened at 9:02 am and killed at least 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed one-third of the building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated 652 million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies in the wake of the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. Until the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States, and remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in the country's history. Within 90 minutes of the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, a veteran of the Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives parked in front of the building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and unhappy about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound..., can you guess it ?

Sewerage floods the alleyway; on either side of the narrow passage are aging buildings. The stench of urine fills the air. As we make our way into the night, I begin to make out shadows lining the side of the street. \\"Odijo, odijo,\\" they shout. Odijo is sheng (Kenyan slang) for teacher - it's an affectionate name they use for the man who has become something of a \\"messiah\\" for Nairobi's forgotten children. Clifford Oluoch is a primary school teacher in Nairobi by day but has been spending his evenings for the last three months feeding street children. \\"I was walking home one night and came across boys haggling for a cob of corn. I offered to buy them a cob each, more came, then more. By the end of the night, I had bought corn for 25 people,\\" he says. \\"They asked if I could come back tomorrow and do the same and I said I would. I've been keeping that promise.\\" The latest figures are difficult to come by but a 2012 Unicef report estimated that there were 250-300,000 homeless children in Kenya, most of them in the big cities. According to Nairobi-based charity Kenya Children of Hope, 63% of the cities' homeless children have been on the streets on a part- or full-time basis for up to five years. In the city centre, the vile smell of human waste, flowing near where we stand, mixes with a thick cloud of industrial glue - a drug of choice here. There is a group of about 20 youngsters waiting crouching on the concrete. Many of them are carrying small plastic containers - a few sniffs of glue can last for several hours. It smells strong and potent. I gesture to it and ask one boy why he uses it. \\"It makes me warm and makes it easier to sleep at night out here,\\" he says, before drawing three quick pulls from the plastic bottle. I sense he doesn't want to continue with the topic. His name is Thomas, he's 14 and has been living out here for the past four years. Thomas says he has seen many people trying to help but says he thinks \\"Odijo\\" is different. Some of the children here are from abusive homes, others left alcoholic parents behind. But the streets are no picnic either. \\"Life here is hard. Bad things happen, young boys get beaten up by the older homeless people and we fight for food,\\" says one of the boys huddled around me, he too is sniffing glue and his eyes are blood-shot. But they are mostly orderly and welcome me as Odijo's guest. They tell me he is like their \\"messiah\\". Earlier that evening, the teacher, his wife Benedette and their 13-year old daughter had buttered 30 loaves of bread. This type of meal costs about 2,000 Kenyan shillings (22; Â£14) a day. For months he has been splitting his salary between his wife and two children and 60 street children and says he was beginning to feel the pinch. Thankfully word is slowly started to spread in his community - this month he got a donor for bread. He says he can now use that money to see to other needs such as transporting someone to hospital, or helping some of the homeless women set up fruit stalls. Still, this is an expensive project to maintain on a teacher's salary, not to mention the time away from his family - up to three hours every evening. So why does he do it? \\"My wife and I feel strongly about helping other people,\\" he says. \\"We know what is it to grow up having nothing. We know how difficult life is when you have no-one. This is making a difference, that makes all of it worth it,\\" Benedette told me earlier. It's dark now and he hands out the parcels quickly, desperate to get to the next location - for some this is the first and only meal of the day. What took him and his family an hour to prepare is gobbled down in 10 minutes. Some nights the feeding is followed by a counselling session - this is the most difficult part. \\"A lot of these children have been disappointed so many times and that's made some of them hard. I've learned that they are just hungry for love - for someone who will care about them,\\" he says, as if drowning under the weight of this task. The children have a lot of faith in him - he tells me they make him feel superhuman, like he can solve all their problems. He, of course, knows he can't. He has big plans to help get them off the streets - but with no-one else to help, that's a long way off. We take a short drive. A group of mothers is huddled under a flickering streetlight near a shopping centre in the affluent Westlands district. It's a busy area with fast-food restaurants. It smells of roasted garlic and warm curry - torture, even for me. As Clifford makes his way to them, a crowd of children no more than three years old runs to him, tugging at the plastic bags in his hands. Another feeding frenzy. \\"This is no place for children. I'm hoping to get the youngsters out while they still have a chance,\\" he says. One of the women tells me says she's been homeless for seven years and has no skills to speak of. Her son, Wesley, just a year old, has a cold, so we walk to a nearby pharmacy where Clifford buys him medication. The contrast of the woman and baby in their grubby clothes and the health worker in his crisp white coats is stark. \\"They know I don't give them money. I don't encourage people to give them money either but if I can help with things like buying medicine then I do,\\" explains Clifford as we walk out. By this point the woman and her boy have disappeared back into the night. Clifford has learned that the streets are addictive and that some people cannot leave - some do not even want to. This is all they know. Being a Good Samaritan can be a thankless task as some sell the clothes he collects for them to buy drugs or alcohol. But some - although few - still dream of a different life. \\"I left school after my father died and my mother couldn't afford to take me to school, I thought it was easier to go out and take care of myself,\\" says 13-year old Neville, who adds he wants to be a reporter. \\"I want to go back to school one day. I'm hoping Odijo can help with that. I don't want to live here for the rest of my life.\\" Hearing this fills Clifford with hope and the drive to keep going. \\"If I can save just one person, just one child, that would be enough for me,\\" he says. And so he keeps coming back, night after night with nothing more than buttered bread and a heart ready to love - and they are grateful.

Some adhesives, such as \\"cut-back\\" adhesives and \\"mastic,\\" were often mixed with asbestos up until the late 1980s, and are still occasionally used today. These adhesives were most commonly used to bond the floor to tiles or to heating and air ducts, not to carpets, and are often black in color. If you suspect your adhesive contains asbestos, do not use this method, as sanding or scraping the dry adhesive can release dangerous asbestos fibers into the air. Refer to the solvent section instead, or hire a professional to remove the asbestos. Chipping and scraping off the old adhesive can be tedious, although not much more so than using a solvent. The main benefit is a lower risk of discoloring the wood or clogging its pores. After using this method, it should be easy to bond a new stain or finish to the wood. However, if there is an existing finish you plan to leave on, or if you plan to cover the floor with a new carpet, the solvent method may save you some time. Note: renting a wet/dry vacuum from a tool rental service is highly recommended for quick, safe cleanup after the adhesive is removed. If you're lucky, the adhesive will chip right off when you apply pressure with a putty knife. Some areas may take more pressure than others. Only use a plastic putty knife, not metal, to avoid scratching the floor. If the adhesive only comes off in tiny chips, try making it easier to remove with dry ice as described below, or use solvents instead. Pick the widest putty knife you can find to make the task less tedious. If you plan to apply a new stain or finish to the floor, this is your best option for making adhesive removal easier without affecting the wood pores. Place pieces of dry ice in a cookie tray and slide the tray over each section of adhesive before you chip, to make the glue brittle and easier to remove. Always follow these safety precautions before you buy dry ice: Wear thick gloves while handling dry ice, as the extreme cold can instantly cause painful skin damage. Always store and work with dry ice in a well-ventilated room, and leave immediately if you have trouble breathing. Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide, and can fill a small space with unbreathable gas. Do not store in an airtight container, which may explode as the dry ice expands into gas. Clean up the chips of adhesive using a wet/dry vacuum if possible, or a broom. Your local government may require you to dispose of them at a waste collection center, rather than adding it to your ordinary trash, since some adhesives contain toxic materials. However, since you did not use any solvents, you may be able to dispose of adhesives normally; contact local waste collection services to find out about local regulations. The floor may need to be sanded to clear up any scuff marks caused by the carpet installation or the glue removal. Use 16 or 24 grit sandpaper, but go slowly to avoid scraping into the wood. Optionally, sand away the old finish in preparation for adding a new stain and/or finish. Sanding away the adhesive itself is not recommended, as the sandpaper will quickly get clogged and need replacing. Heat from the friction may also melt the adhesive, which can be messy.

The white sands, imported from the far west mountains of limestone, sucked up the fire of the huge red sun. It was always hot in the south desert. Even in the deep of night the stones of Gazu Kadem kept the city warm. Now, at mid-day, it was at its hottest. A quarter of a million people at the arena didn't make it any cooler. The merchants, nobles, and the slaves lucky enough to attend had waited outside Dan Trex's arena for days. They knew the value of entertainment in such a dark world. They wore cowls to protect themselves from the sun as they waited. Entire businesses thrived on the forced mercantile of the captive audience. Food went for thrice its cost to those waiting near the entrance. Water went for five times as much. The arena was as old as the city, built in the days of the old empire for a king now long forgotten. The octagonal arena was a machine, an engine that built warriors out of the raw material of flesh, blood, and steel. Now, thousands of years later, it still served that purpose. The machine had built Dan Trex's army, half a million of the most ruthless and well trained soldiers to ever walk the planet. While one hundred and fifty thousand civilians and slaves got drunk, gambled, shat, fucked, and slept on the stone steps; one hundred thousand of his men sat in silence wearing black and bronze and watching him as Trex walked out into the arena alone and unhelmed. His soldiers watched the games in silence. They made not a sound when twelve of the most beautiful girls to walk on small bare feet were raped and flayed apart by dark priests in a ritual to Gazu Kadem's god-king, Danken Ovelde. They studied the three-horned desert bull as it gored five slaves. They watched the spear technique of four slave armies as they warred in a single great battle. They watched blades of silver spray fans of red blood into the air. They watched vital organs spill onto the white sands. They heard men and women scream as life left them. They... Question: How long did the event probably last? Answer: A:","completion":"The details in the context do not provide an exact duration for the event at Dan Trex's arena. However, we can deduce an estimation based on the sequence of activities mentioned. Considering the following events: 1. Twelve girls being raped and flayed apart by dark priests in a ritual. 2. A three-horned desert bull goring five slaves. 3. Four slave armies partaking in a single great battle. Keeping in mind the time it would take for each of these events to unfold, along with additional time for preparations, transitions, and potential smaller events not mentioned in the context, one could estimate that the event would likely last for several hours, possibly spanning an entire day or even longer. However, without specific information on the duration of each event and potential breaks between the activities, it is difficult to provide a more precise estimate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who is the plaintiff in Hill v. McDonough? Context: Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.

Which team had fewer athletes with increased blood flow to the muscles before the race? Two teams were competing in a 5 km race.

Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate.

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it’s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.

Q:Jimmy is currently shopping at his local grocery store during his weekly trip to get food and other necessities. He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk. Which brand of milk has lower eutrophication potential per hectare of farmland? Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). A:","completion":"Based on the hint provided, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland compared to conventional milk production.

They had many mutual interests, including geology and earthquakes. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person lived farther from Kauai island? The answer is:","completion":"Pete lived farther from Kauai Island. To provide a detailed explanation, let's first discuss the locations of Alaska and Hawaii. Alaska is the northwest-most state in the United States, which is a non-contiguous state as it is geographically separated from the contiguous 48 states. Alaska is the largest state and is situated adjacent to the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the south, Canada's British Columbia, and the Yukon Territory to the east. On the other hand, Hawaii is also a non-contiguous state in the United States. It is located in the North Pacific Ocean and is the southernmost state with the closest continents being North America, Asia, and Australia. Hawaii is an archipelago consisting of eight major islands, one of which is Kauai Island. Kauai Island is the oldest and most northwestern of the major Hawaiian Islands. Now, considering the distances, Alaska is considerably farther away from Kauai Island compared to Hawaii. The distance from Alaska to Kauai Island is approximately 2,640 miles (4,250 kilometers), depending on the specific location in Alaska, which is much farther compared to the distance between Kauai Island and the other major islands of Hawaii. For example, the distance between Kauai Island and the island of Oahu, where Hawaii's capital, Honolulu, is located, is about 102 miles (164 kilometers). Since Pete lived in Alaska and visited his friend Julia in Hawaii, who is geographically closer to Kauai Island, we can safely say that Pete lived farther from Kauai Island compared to Julia. Their shared interests in geology and earthquakes are relevant to both their locations given that both Hawaii and Alaska are known for their volcanic and seismic activities.

The devastating incident has left Australia, and the world of cricket, mourning the loss of a young talent - someone who lived for the sport. Prime Minister Tony Abbott expressed his profound grief at the untimely passing of Phillip Hughes, stating that it is a sorrowful time for Australia and the global cricket fraternity. He emphasized that people should not have to face death while playing a sport that is considered a national treasure. Abbott paid tribute to the young cricketer who 'left us too soon'.

The young cricketer left a lasting impression on everyone who had the privilege of being a part of his journey. His presence on the field, as well as his humble and compassionate attitude off the field, made him a role model for many aspiring cricketers. Phillip Hughes' passing has raised eyebrows on player safety and the overall rules and regulations of the sport. Cricket, like all other sports, carries inherent risks, but this incident has brought to light these issues in a heartrending manner. As the cricketing community grapples with the enormity of this tragedy, there have been suggestions that the sport needs to take more steps to protect its players from such potentially fatal accidents. Meanwhile, tributes have poured in from across the globe.

As Australia and the cricketing world come to terms with this loss, Phillip Hughes' life and accomplishments will not be forgotten. A spirited player who always played the game with passion and dedication, he embodied the enduring spirit of cricket. In his short yet illustrious career, Hughes left a lasting impact on the sport and its fans.

This research aims to assess and understand changes in both species’ populations and their interactions within the region while also identifying potential threats to their survival and to the overall health of the water habitat. Project Overview and Objectives In response to increasing concerns about fluctuations in species abundance, experts from various marine science institutions have joined forces to conduct an in-depth analysis of the marine ecosystem in Jersey waters. This collaborative effort intends to monitor, document, and investigate the possible causes behind the changes observed in the marine life inhabiting the area. The primary objectives of the study include: - Assessing the current state of biodiversity in Jersey waters - Documenting the shifting patterns of species distribution and abundance - Investigating the impacts of climate change, pollution, and human activities on the local marine life - Identifying measures to mitigate potential threats to the ecosystem - Increasing public awareness and collaborative efforts to protect Jersey's marine environment Methodology and Data Collection A holistic approach will be employed to collect data and analyze the dynamics of Jersey's marine ecosystem. The methods of data collection will involve tracking and monitoring of various marine species, documenting habitat shifts, oceanographic measurements, water quality assessments, and a review of historical data. Specifically, the methods will include: 1. Conducting underwater surveys to monitor species composition, abundance, and distribution. 2. Utilizing GPS-tagged devices to track the movement and migration of larger marine species such as sharks and whales. 3. Employing remote sensing technology to study oceanographic variables such as sea-surface temperatures, ocean currents, and chlorophyll concentrations. 4. Conducting water quality tests to assess the levels of pollution and the impact of nutrient availability on species distributions. 5. Comparing the current state of the ecosystem with historical data to identify trends in species population fluctuations and habitat changes. Expected Outcomes and Significance of the Study The results of this extensive research will provide invaluable insights into the complex dynamics of the Jersey marine ecosystem. Documenting fluctuations in species diversity, abundance, and distribution will contribute to identifying the potential factors responsible for these changes, such as climate change, pollution, and human activities. Understanding the direct and indirect influences of these factors on the marine environment will help inform the development of adaptive management strategies to mitigate the identified threats. Furthermore, the findings are expected to foster public interest and support to protect the region's invaluable marine resources and bolster the role of marine conservation efforts. Conclusion Jersey waters are rich in biodiversity, and their health is essential not only for the island's flora and fauna but also for its economy and ecology. With an ever-growing global population's need for resource utilization and climate change accelerating the decline of marine ecosystems worldwide, the importance of analyzing and understanding the processes that impact our seas is paramount. The collaboration of sea life experts in studying the Jersey waters' marine life is a critical step in unravelling the mysteries of species interactions and reactions to environmental changes. As we move towards deciphering the intertwined challenges our ocean faces, we must raise public awareness and encourage responsible stewardship of the marine world to address these threats and ensure a sustainable future for all life on earth, on land and at sea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"The Royal Navy's second new aircraft carrier, the Prince of Wales, is to be brought into service rather than sold off or mothballed, Prime Minister David Cameron has announced.\\" Article:","completion":"\\"The Second Jewel in the Crown: Prince of Wales Aircraft Carrier to be Commissioned\\" In a significant development for the Royal Navy, United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron has announced that the Queen's second new aircraft carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, will enter into active service. This move avoids the speculated fate of the ship being mothballed or sold off, which was largely anticipated amidst budgetary pressures and operational requirements. Designed and built in the UK, the HMS Prince of Wales stands as a shining emblem of British maritime prowess and a testament to the nation's resilience. With a displacement of around 65,000 tonnes and a length exceeding 280 metres, this supercarrier is second in a series of two, her sister ship being the HMS Queen Elizabeth. The decision to commission the Prince of Wales into active service has been influenced by various strategic and defensive considerations. Firstly, the ongoing global unrest and the ever-evolving nature of security threats necessitated the need for bolstering the nation's naval power. Secondly, it assures the Royal Navy of an enhanced capability of projecting air power anywhere in the world. Despite concerns related to cost, maintenance, and operation, the decision highlights the government's commitment to upholding Britain's long-standing naval tradition and sustaining its global influence. It reinforces the continued relevance and indispensability of sea power in global politics and armed conflict. The introduction of HMS Prince of Wales has been met with distinct approval from the Navy. Senior figures within the institution have long argued for the significance of a two-carrier fleet. The announcement strengthens Britain's strategic maritime capabilities, enabling it to maintain a permanent carrier strike presence, and offer a greater degree of flexibility in managing global commitments and contingencies. Interestingly, the decision will also impact the domestic front, especially on the employment sector. The maintenance and servicing of the Prince of Wales are likely to create jobs, boost local economies, and supply chains, in addition to enhancing the country's engineering and defense manufacturing skills base. While many pundits were skeptical over HMS Prince of Wales's future, fearing it would follow the path of several Royal Navy vessels that have been decommissioned, sold, or mothballed due to budget constraints, Prime Minister Cameron's announcement has put those concerns to rest. It asserts that maintaining and enhancing national security continues to be a number one priority for his administration. The coming years will indeed be historic ones for Britain's naval defense, with the Prince of Wales embarking on various missions around the globe. Its operational readiness is set to escalate the Royal Navy's deterrence capabilities, significantly contributing to the safeguarding of British interests at home and overseas. To conclude, the planned commissioning of the HMS Prince of Wales signals a momentous milestone in Britain’s naval history, reinforcing the fact that the country's maritime strength remains a cornerstone of its national defense and global standing. It represents the government's dedicated commitment to ensuring the Royal Navy retains its reputation as a world-leading maritime force, capable of responding effectively and powerfully to any threat."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pool Video The 17 miners, all men ranging in age from their 20s to 60, were just descending down the shaft to a salt mine below Cayuga Lake at the start of a 10 p.m. shift Wednesday. The men were working as part of a third-shift underground production crew. WHAT HAPPENED? What caused the Cargill elevator to stop? HELP: Families waited for Cargill miners' safe return NY RESPONSE: Gov. Cuomo issues statement on Cargill mine rescue e-NEWSPAPER: See coverage in The Ithaca Journal Cargill spokesman Mark Klein said Thursday afternoon that a steel guide beam that keeps the elevator centered is the most likely cause of the mechanical failure. The beam might have come out of line, he said, and that could have caused the elevator to stop in the shaft. An outgoing shift had used the same two-level elevator about five minutes before the 17 men descended down the shaft, Wilczynski said, and there had been no indications of a possible problem. Cargill Mine Manager Shawn Wilczynski talks at an early morning press conference at the Lansing Fire Department after 17 mine staff were stuck in an elevator at 900 feet below the ground. SIMON WHEELER / Staff Video Cargill intends to perform a full safety check of the elevator once it can be removed from the shaft, according to Wilczynski, who described that process as a \\"slow and purposeful approach,\\" without a timetable as of Thursday. He said Cargill will work with the federal Mine Health and Safety Administration, or MSHA, regarding safety plans in light of the accident, in addition to performing an inspection of the malfunctioned elevator. If necessary, he said, the elevator could be replaced. “We will not go back to work until all our infrastructure is back in 100 percent safe operating conditions. We will take whatever time is necessary.” Shawn Wilczynski, Cargill Mine Manager \\"We will not go back to work until all our infrastructure is back in 100 percent safe operating conditions,\\" Wilczynski said. \\"We will take whatever time is necessary.\\" Cargill also has a stockpile of salt in its inventory, he added, so there is no concern about the company's inability to serve customers with work temporarily suspended. The rescue The crane rescue effort at Cargill Salt Mine in Lansing recovered the first group of workers at about 7 a.m. The last workers were pulled up at about 8:10 a.m. A crane from Auburn Crane & Rigging was used to lower a rescue basket and bring the men up four at a time. Throughout the endeavor, company officials and emergency responders kept in radio contact with the miners, said Joe Mareane, Tompkins County administrator. Buy Photo The fourth group of workers emerge from an elevator Thursday after they were stuck overnight in a shaft at Cargill salt mine in Lansing. (Photo: Simon Wheeler / Staff photo) Emergency management officials said the miners did whatever they could to keep in good spirits during the rescue efforts. Wilczynski said officials got them blankets, heat packs and other supplies, but the miners managed to keep themselves in fair condition while waiting for their rescue. \\"All 17 miners carry with them at all times their personal equipment, and that includes their own cap-lamp for illumination,\\" Wilczynski said. \\"They also had their full complement of food they'd bring down for their dinners; there's one individual ... he brings a lunch bucket full of food every time.\\" Apart from being cold due to their prolonged exposure to low temperatures, the miners were all in good physical health at the time of their rescue, officials said. The mine shaft descends 2,300 feet to the deepest salt mine in North America. The mine produces road de-icing salt from deposits deep beneath Cayuga Lake. According to the company's website, it has been in operation since 1921 as the Rock Salt Corp. Cargill has operated it since 1970. 911 call An emergency call was placed to the Tompkins County 911 Center at 11:40 p.m. Wednesday, according to a Tompkins County news release. Firefighters from Lansing, Ithaca, Cayuga Heights, along with Tompkins County Sheriff's deputies and the Tompkins County Department of Emergency Management answered the call. \\"Our first job was to make sure the elevator was secure and the miners were safe,\\" said Assistant Lansing Fire Chief Dennis Griffin. \\"We might've changed our game plans five or six times.\\" Firefighters were prepared to rappel down the shaft and pull out the stranded miners one at at time, he said, but the crane rescue became the best available option. The elevator has two levels for passengers and, according to Wilczynski, there were passengers on both levels of the device. Safety issues Cargill has reported 21 problems with hoists at the Cayuga Lake salt mine since the start of 2013, according to data compiled and made available online by the MSHA. Most of them involved electrical problems that interrupted power to the hoist. “Hoist” is the term used for elevators and other vertical conveyances at mines. Any time a hoist is out of service for 30 minutes or more, it must be reported as an accident, according to Ellen Smith, owner and managing editor of Mine Safety and Health News, an independent news publication based in Pittsford, Monroe County. Buy Photo Miners from the second-last group to be removed from a stuck elevator at the Cargill salt mine in Lansing are given blankets after spending the night trapped in an elevator 900 feet below the surface. (Photo: SIMON WHEELER / Staff Photo) The other active salt mine in New York, American Rock Salt’s facility in Livingston County, has reported only four hoist-related accidents in that time period, the MSHA data show. The most recent incident at Cargill occurred just five days ago, when a hoist known as No. 3 lost power when an electrical breaker tripped and would not reset. It took 45 minutes to repair. No one was working underground in the mine at the time. Elevators have failed numerous times while miners were at work, however. Workers were forced to evacuate the mine five times in 2014 and five times in 2013 after one of the elevators failed. By law, underground miners must have two separate means of egress, Smith said. If one is out of service, the mine must be evacuated. Cargill officials confirmed Thursday afternoon that hoist No. 3 was involved in the incident. The MSHA data noted past problems with hoists 1, 2 and 3, although No. 3 had by far the most reported problems. No injuries have been associated with the incidents, according to accident summaries on the MSHA data website. There is no mention of workers being stranded on a stalled elevator in the past three years. In March 2010, a contract truck driver was killed at the Lansing mine when a 150-ton salt bin collapsed. According to the MSHA, the piece of a 150-ton salt bin that corroded and caused the collapse that killed contract truck driver Rolland F. Clark on March 24 was not visible from the ground, and MSHA inspectors are not \\"trained or expected\\" to carefully examine such structures. New York Gov.

Moore chronicles how GM had previously defined his childhood while growing up in Flint, Michigan, and how the company was the primary economic and social hub of the town. He points out that Flint is the place where the 1937 Flint Sit-Down Strike occurred, resulting in the birth of the United Auto Workers.

As he returns (in 1985), General Motors announces the layoffs of thousands of Flint auto workers, the jobs of whom will go to cheaper labor when the plant relocates to Mexico.

Breaking down company details: First, I'm going to separate individual words and details related to the company and address. - \\"ifmelectronicgmbh\\": This appears to be a company name, which should be \\"ifm electronic gmbh\\". - \\"•Friedrichstraße1•45128Essen\\": This seems to be a street address in Germany (Friedrichstraße 1, 45128 Essen). - The bullet character (•) can be considered as a separator. After making these changes, the phrase so far is: \\"ifm electronic gmbh • Friedrichstraße 1 • 45128 Essen\\". 2. Handling reservation clause: Next, I notice the segment of text starting with \\"Wereservetherighttomaketechnicalalterationswithoutpriornotice.\\" This appears to be a standard non-liability clause. Let's break it down: - \\"Wereservetherighttomaketechnicalalterationswithoutpriornotice\\": This can be separated into \\"We reserve the right to make technical alterations without prior notice.\\" After adding these modifications, the sentence so far becomes \\"ifm electronic gmbh • Friedrichstraße 1 • 45128 Essen - We reserve the right to make technical alterations without prior notice.\\" 3. Identifying product details and date: To wrap up, I'll divide the final details which seem to be related to a product model number and the date: - \\"—GB—SV5200—03.06.2015\\": Here, I can establish that \\"GB\\" and \\"SV5200\\" are likely separate entities (looks like product identifiers or codes), and \\"03.06.2015\\" is probably a date. Therefore, this segment becomes: \\"- GB - SV5200 - 03.06.2015.\\" So, the final version of the separated text is: \\"ifm electronic gmbh • Friedrichstraße 1 • 45128 Essen - We reserve the right to make technical alterations without prior notice. - GB - SV5200 - 03.06.2015.\\" This step-wise breakdown splits the original text into more readable sentences and phrases while maintaining their meanings and serving the reader's clarity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. Paragraph: Italy and Greece attended the World Ecological Conference. they were looking for solutions to improve their environment. Italy's air was very polluted, while Greece had problems with drought.

Passage:On 24 February 1996, Cadete was introduced at Celtic Park, Glasgow to supporters before Celtic's league match against Partick Thistle. However, due to lengthy negotiations between Celtic and Sporting and issues with registering the player, his transfer was not finalised until April, and turned out to be controversial: despite being signed prior to the transfer deadline, the Scottish Football Association delayed processing his registration in time for the Scottish Cup semi-finals against Rangers at Hampden Park, and following a complaint from Celtic chairman Fergus McCann, SFA chief Jim Farry was eventually relieved of his duties after being found guilty of deliberately holding back the player's registration. His eventual debut came at home against Aberdeen as he came off the bench to score his team's fifth goal in a 5–0 win, thus becoming an instant hit; the loud roar generated by the fans celebrating his goal blew out BBC Radio 5's microphones, who had been covering the game UK wide on radio, and they went off air for a short time until it was repaired.

The context provides several important insights that specifically mention the release of the manga in America. 1. The context states that Viz, an American manga publisher and distributor, began releasing the series under the name \\"Wild Ones\\" in December 2007. This clearly indicates that Wild Ones was not exclusive to Japan and was indeed available outside of Japan, specifically, in America. 2.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials say the only American soldier held prisoner in Afghanistan has been freed and is in U.S. custody. The officials say Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's (boh BURG'-dahl) release was part of a negotiation that includes the release of five Afghan detainees held in the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The negotiation between the U.S. and the Taliban was mediated by the government of Qatar. The 28-year-old Berghdal had been held by the Taliban since June 30, 2009. The officials say he is in good condition and able to walk. The officials insisted on anonymity in order to describe the details on Bergdahl's release. ||||| Taliban fighters released the sole remaining American military hostage Saturday morning to a team of U.S. troops in eastern Afghanistan, who quickly hustled him onto a helicopter. Once airborne, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl scribbled the letters “SF?” on a paper plate, seeking confirmation that he was with Special Operations forces. “Yes!” one of the troops hollered back above the din of the aircraft’s blades, according to a defense official who described Bergdahl’s first moments of freedom. “We’ve been looking for you for a long time.” Bergdahl, 28, who had been held captive nearly five years, broke down in tears. His release was secured after the Obama administration, working through Qatari government intermediaries, agreed to free five high-profile Afghan inmates held by the U.S. military in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The influential commanders, including the former head of the Taliban’s army, were loaded onto a U.S. military aircraft bound for Qatar after U.S. officials got confirmation that Bergdahl had been freed. Bergdahl’s “safety and health were both in jeopardy,” and officials had to act quickly to obtain his release, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Sunday, according to the Associated Press. 1 of 33 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Caption U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the only U.S. service member known to be held hostage in Afghanistan, was handed over on May 31 by members of the Taliban in exchange for five Afghan detainees held at the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, U.S. officials said. U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is seen in this undated photo. Courtesy of Kim Harrison Buy Photo President Obama hailed Bergdahl’s recovery as a triumph of years of high-wire diplomatic efforts that reached a breakthrough in the waning months of the U.S. combat mission there. “He wasn’t forgotten by his country,” Obama said Saturday evening in the Rose Garden, standing alongside Bergdahl’s parents, Robert and Jani. “The United States of America does not ever leave our men and women in uniform behind.” His father, who grew a long beard in a gesture of solidarity with his son, said a few words to him in Pashto, the language spoken in southern Afghanistan, saying that he understood his son is having trouble speaking English. “I am your father, Bowe,” Robert Bergdahl said. “I look forward to continuing the recovery of our son which will be a considerable task for our family.” While leaders across the political spectrum expressed relief at the news, prominent Republican lawmakers chided the White House for skirting a legal requirement to notify them about the planned release of Guantanamo inmates. Some criticized the president for breaking with longtime U.S. policy against negotiating with militant groups. “This fundamental shift in U.S. policy signals to terrorists around the world a greater incentive to take US hostages,” Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. The AP reported Hagel, who was traveling to Afghanistan to meet with U.S. troops, as saying that the action was not relayed to Congress because of its urgency. He said intelligence indicated that Bergdahl’s “health was deteriorating.” Peaceful exchange Bergdahl’s release at 10:30 a.m. in Khost province, which borders Pakistan, capped a week of intense, secret negotiations conducted through the Qataris. A team of dozens of Special Operations forces took custody of Bergdahl from a group of 18 Taliban fighters. The rare encounter on the battlefield between warriors who have spent years killing one another lasted just a few minutes and was peaceful, U.S. officials said. Bergdahl walked onto the aircraft, U.S. officials said, suggesting he is in relatively stable health. Officials said it was too early to know anything definitive about the mental state of a soldier who bewildered his comrades after he walked off base in volatile Paktika province on June 30, 2009. Officials at the Pentagon, who had grown concerned that the end of the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of the year would dim the prospect of getting Bergdahl back alive, rejoiced. “It is our ethos that we never leave a fallen comrade,” Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a statement. “Today we have back in our ranks the only remaining captured soldier from our conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Welcome home Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.” There was no indication that the soldier would face any reprimand for the circumstances under which he was taken, which led some of his comrades to call him a deserter. While it is unclear whether he will remain on active duty, a senior U.S. military official said the Army plans to promote Bergdahl to staff sergeant next month. “I can’t imagine there would be repercussions,” said the official, who was among several who would speak about the case only on the condition of anonymity. Defense officials said they were working to get Bergdahl to the United States as soon as possible. After passing through Bagram air base in Afghanistan, Bergdahl was en route to the U.S military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, according to Pentagon officials traveling with Hagel. They said his first U.S. stop would likely be the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, where after a thorough medical screening he will likely be debriefed by intelligence officials. Year-long stay in Qatar The released inmates include Mullah Mohammad Fazl, a former Taliban deputy defense minister. U.S. officials said that under a memorandum of understanding signed by Washington and Doha, the men will be subject to a year-long travel ban in Qatar. They declined to offer more details about any restrictions the men would face but expressed confidence that their release would not put Americans in harm’s way. “The United States has coordinated closely with Qatar to ensure that security measures are in place and the national security of the United States will not be compromised,” Hagel said in a statement from Singapore, where he was attending a security conference. “Sgt. Bergdahl’s return is a powerful reminder of the enduring, sacred commitment our nation makes to all those who serve in uniform.” Hagel informed members of Congress on Saturday about the prisoner swap deal. The administration is required by law to notify Congress about its intention to release Guantanamo detainees 30 days in advance. “Due to a near-term opportunity to save Sergeant Bergdahl’s life, we moved as quickly as possible,” a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to explain the timing of the congressional notification. “The administration determined that given these unique and exigent circumstances, such a transfer should go forward notwithstanding the notice requirement” in the law. Talks falter, then revive The Obama administration began seriously exploring the possibility of negotiating Bergdahl’s release in late 2011, when secret talks between U.S. diplomats and members of the Taliban appeared to be gaining traction. The talks, part of a broader effort to explore a negotiated end of a conflict that had only become deadlier as the White House approved a surge of 30,000 troops in 2009, collapsed in March 2012 when the Taliban suspended them, arguing that the United States was not acting in good faith. Last summer, when the Taliban was allowed to open a political office in the Qatari capital, American officials grew hopeful that prisoner swap negotiations could resume. The effort foundered just hours after the office formally opened after the Afghan government protested that the Taliban had been given de-facto diplomatic status. Unexpectedly, representatives of the Taliban conveyed to U.S. officials last fall that they were once again amenable to discussing the release of Bergdahl, but set as a condition that they would only deal with Washington through intermediaries, American officials said. U.S. officials received a video of Bergdahl last fall after they had demanded proof that he remained alive. Unlike past videos of the captive, the one released last year was delivered privately, rather than through the Taliban’s media operatives. It showed the soldier looking “very gaunt, haggard,” a U.S. military official who has seen clips said. In a departure of its former negotiating stance, the administration sought to enhance the American offer of a prisoner exchange by proposing to release the five men simultaneously. Taliban representatives had objected to the previous proposed plan, under which the inmates would be turned over in stages in an effort to test whether the Taliban and the Qatari intermediaries could guarantee that the men would not return to militancy. A statement issued Saturday by the Taliban said the men would be residing with their families in Qatar, a tiny, wealthy Gulf emirate. U.S. officials said they had no indication that the Taliban was open to more substantive talks but expressed hope that the swap would build trust. “We continue to hope there will be a decision by the Taliban to move forward to initiate a political dialogue with the Afghan government, and it is our hope that the events leading to Sergeant Bergdahl’s return could potentially open the door for broader discussions with the Taliban by building confidence that the two sides can negotiate honestly with each other,” a senior administration official said. A celebration in Idaho The Obama administration has sought to keep Bergdahl’s profile relatively low over the years, fearing that widespread publicity of his plight would boost his value in the eyes of the Taliban and strengthen the group’s negotiating hand. For a period, White House officials asked that several U.S. newspapers refrain from publishing his name in the context of peace talks. As his hopes dimmed, Bergdahl’s father sought to personally secure his son’s release by learning Pashto and attempting to contact the Taliban online. Bergdahl’s parents had traveled to Washington for a Memorial Day event and stayed in town for a few days to attend meetings with senior U.S. officials. They were in Washington when Obama called them Saturday morning to deliver the news, U.S. officials said. “We were so joyful and relieved when President Obama called us today to give us the news that Bowe is finally coming home!” Bergdahl’s parents said in a statement. “We cannot wait to wrap our arms around our only son. Today, we are ecstatic!” In Bergdahl’s home town of Hailey, Idaho, there was jubilation Saturday. Residents had been planning a June 28 concert to call attention to his plight. They were expecting up to 7,000 people to attend, and singer Carole King was going to perform for free. The concert will go on, said organizer Stefanie O’Neill, but it is now going to be “the biggest welcome-home party the country has ever seen.” Kim Harrison, who said she was listed as Bergdahl’s godmother in his military records, said, “I’m excited, I’m kind of numb, and I hope that they take it easy on him when he gets back.” She said she knows Bergdahl as the precocious teenager who took ballet with her daughter and came to spend hours at the Harrison house in Ketchum, Idaho, reading poetry and studying philosophy. She described Bergdahl as a sensitive young man who “questioned everything” and who went to Afghanistan because he wanted to help people. “Now the only thing I can think of worth talking about is protecting him from people criticizing him and trying to find a negative source of why he left in the first place,” she said. Karen DeYoung, traveling in Asia with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and Anne Gearan, Julie Tate and Stephanie McCrummen in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| WASHINGTON — The lone American prisoner of war from the Afghan conflict, captured by insurgents nearly five years ago, has been released to American forces in exchange for five Taliban detainees held at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, Obama administration officials said Saturday. The soldier, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, 28, was handed over to American Special Operations troops inside Afghanistan near the Pakistan border about 10:30 a.m. Saturday in a tense but uneventful exchange with 18 Taliban officials, American officials said. Moments later, Sergeant Bergdahl was whisked away by the helicopter-borne commandos, American officials said. He was described in good physical condition. The five Taliban detainees at Guantánamo, including two senior militant commanders said to be linked to operations that killed American and allied troops as well as implicated in murdering thousands of Shiites in Afghanistan, were flown from Cuba in the custody of officials from Qatar, who will accompany them back to that Persian Gulf state. They will be subject to security restrictions there, including a one-year travel ban. Photo Senior administration officials cautioned that the discussions over the prisoner swap, which were secretly restarted last fall after collapsing several months earlier, did not necessarily presage the resumption of the broader, on-again-off-again peace talks to end the 13-year war. “This is the only issue we’ve discussed with the Taliban in recent months,” said one senior Obama administration official involved in the talks. “We do hope that having succeeded in this narrow but important step, it will create the possibility of expanding the dialogue to other issues. But we don’t have any promises to that effect.” But word of renewed, secret negotiations with the Taliban brought immediate criticism from some lawmakers, including Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. “I have little confidence in the security assurances regarding the movement and activities of the now-released Taliban leaders, and I have even less confidence in this administration’s willingness to ensure they are enforced,” he said. “I believe this decision will threaten the lives of American soldiers for years to come.” A Western official in Kabul said the Afghan government was not told ahead of time that the Taliban were going to hand over Sergeant Bergdahl or that the release of prisoners from Guantánamo Bay was proceeding, though the Afghans were broadly aware that the talks had been rekindled. American officials feared leaks could scuttle the deal. President Obama personally called the soldier’s parents on Saturday, shortly after Sergeant Bergdahl was transferred to the American military; the Bergdahl family was in Washington after a visit here for Memorial Day, officials said. Later on Saturday in the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Obama, flanked by Robert and Jani Bergdahl, the sergeant’s parents, said, “Right now, our top priority is making sure that Bowe gets the care and support that he needs, and that he can be reunited with his family as soon as possible.” The Bergdahls, who have waged a tireless campaign for their son’s release, have sometimes criticized the Obama administration for lack of action. But at the impromptu Rose Garden appearance and in a statement released earlier in the day, they praised the American and Qatari governments for their help. “We cannot wait to wrap our arms around our only son,” they said in the statement. “Today, we are ecstatic!” Family and friends in the Bergdahl family’s hometown, Hailey, Idaho, said they were planning a celebration on Sunday. A Pentagon official said Saturday evening that Sergeant Bergdahl was en route to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. He would then be transferred to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio when doctors felt he was fit to travel. Continue reading the main story Video Negotiations and internal deliberations over the potential for a swap have waxed and waned for years, but they intensified in the past several weeks as an agreement appeared within reach, according to an official familiar with the matter. Among other complications, there was a potential legal obstacle: Congress has imposed statutory restrictions on the transfer of detainees from Guantánamo Bay. The statutes say the secretary of defense must determine that a transfer is in the interest of national security, that steps have been taken to substantially mitigate a future threat by a released detainee, and that the secretary notify Congress 30 days before any transfer of his determination. In this case, the secretary, Chuck Hagel, acknowledged in a statement that he did not notify Congress ahead of time. When Mr. Obama signed a bill containing the latest version of the transfer restrictions into law, he issued a signing statement claiming that he could lawfully override them under his executive powers. “The executive branch must have the flexibility, among other things, to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers,” he wrote in the signing statement, adding that if the restrictions “operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles, my administration will implement them in a manner that avoids the constitutional conflict.” An administration official said the circumstances of a fast-moving exchange deal made it appropriate to act outside the statutory framework for transfers. The top Republicans on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, Representative Howard McKeon of California and Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, said the release of the Taliban prisoners “clearly violated laws” governing the transfer of detainees from Guantánamo Bay. One senior administration official defended the decision, saying that “due to a near-term opportunity to save Sergeant Bergdahl’s life, we moved as quickly as possible,” requiring action outside the notice requirement of the statute. In his comments Saturday afternoon, Mr. Obama said, “The Qatari government has given us assurances that it will put in place measures to protect our national security.” Prisoner swaps have been more common in conventional wars between two nation-state armies than in the sort of insurgency conflict that characterized Afghanistan and Iraq, and American officials could not cite another instance in which an American soldier had been freed in these conflicts in a swap. Photo The transfer reduces the detainee population at Guantánamo to 149. They include 12 Afghan citizens — each of whom was deemed far less important and dangerous than the five who were included in the swap. Sergeant Bergdahl was believed to have been held by the militant Haqqani network in the tribal area of Pakistan’s northwest frontier, on the Afghan border. He was captured in Paktika Province in Afghanistan on June 30, 2009. The circumstances of how he was separated from his unit and captured have remained a mystery. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Hopes for Sergeant Bergdahl’s release were lifted last November when the Taliban signaled it was prepared to engage the United States on the limited issue of a prisoner swap, but not on wider issues including reconciliation with the government of Afghanistan, a senior administration official said Saturday. The discussions resumed with the Qatari government acting as an intermediary for messages between the two sides, the official said. Previous talks faltered over issues including restrictions on any released detainees; it was unclear whether the one-year travel prohibition was a breakthrough compromise. While it was described by American officials, it was not mentioned in a Taliban statement on the swap. The latest evidence indicating that Sergeant Bergdahl, who was promoted twice while being held as a prisoner, was still alive came in January, when the American military obtained a video showing him alert but also apparently in declining health. In the past week, detailed negotiations culminated in an agreement for a Taliban delegation to bring Sergeant Bergdahl to Afghanistan, where he would be retrieved by American Special Operations troops. Mr. Obama called the emir of Qatar on Tuesday, and they gave each other assurances about the proposed transfers, an administration official said Saturday. Sergeant Bergdahl was handed over about 7 p.m. local time without incident with the several dozen Special Operations troops spending only a few minutes on the ground, said American officials, who did not disclose the swap’s location in Afghanistan. Taliban officials, though, said the exchange was carried out in Khost Province. Photo The Taliban statement said that the swap was “a result of nonstraightforward negotiations” with the United States, with mediation by Qatar, and that the released detainees “will reside in Qatar with their families.” The details of what the government believes it knows about the five former Taliban leaders were made public in classified military files given to WikiLeaks by Pfc. Bradley Manning, now Chelsea Manning. Mohammad Nabi Omari is described in the files as “one of the most significant former Taliban leaders detained” at Guantánamo. He is said to have strong operational ties to anticoalition militia groups, including Al Qaeda, the Taliban and the Haqqani network. A former Taliban provincial governor, Mullah Norullah Noori, is also “considered one of the most significant former Taliban officials” at the prison, according to the documents. Both Mr. Noori and a third detainee being exchanged, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, a former Taliban deputy defense minister, are accused of having commanded forces that killed thousands of Shiite Muslims, a minority in Afghanistan, before the Taliban were toppled in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The fourth detainee is Abdul Haq Wasiq, a former top Taliban intelligence official. The fifth, Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa, is a former minister of the interior and provincial governor. The Western official in Kabul said the Afghan government was not told about the deal beforehand because there had been a number of false starts since the exchange negotiations had picked up in the past few weeks. One of the Americans’ chief concerns was that word of the plan would leak, and the Taliban would get cold feet or face pressure from harder line elements not to release Sergeant Bergdahl. The Americans also feared the possibility of the exchange being upended by an outburst from the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, who might see the prisoner swap as an attempt to open peace talks with the Taliban behind his back. He has previously claimed that the United States aimed to weaken the Afghan government by cutting a separate peace agreement with the Taliban and its backers in Pakistan, and “no one wanted to deal with that kind of stuff right now,” the Western official said. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Sgt.

Later that day, Linda visits Robbie and he confronts her for leaving him at the altar, rather than tell him the truth so they can cancel the wedding. She reveals that she stopped loving him when she found out that he lost his ambitions of being a rock star and instead became a wedding singer. Linda tells Robbie that after talking to her friends, she realizes she cannot continue lying to herself and ends their relationship. He tries to move forward with his life, but despair hinders his performances. Julia tries to cheer him up and later asks him to help her plan her own wedding. Robbie eventually agrees and their friendship blossoms. Meanwhile, as he spends more time with Julia, Robbie begins to realize how shallow Linda is. During a double date between Julia and Glenn, and Julia's cousin, Holly (Christine Taylor), Robbie learns that Glenn frequently cheats on Julia and does not plan to stop after being married.

For the next year and a half, he studied philosophy, in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions, then go to the mosque, and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the Metaphysics of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by Farabi, which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams. So great was his joy at the discovery, made with the help of a work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed alms upon the poor.

The Houthis ousted President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi last month, who fled to the southern port city of Aden where he established a rival power base. At the weekend, the Houthis seized Taiz, Yemen's third largest city, bringing them closer to Aden. The UN has warned that Yemen is on the edge of civil war. Mr Hadi's Foreign Minister Riad Yassin told the Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat newspaper he asked the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to intervene, without elaborating what that would mean. He also said he had asked the UN and GCC to impose a no-fly zone, after warplanes hit the presidential palace in Aden over the weekend. The Houthis' rise has alarmed the GCC, and in particular Sunni-controlled Saudi Arabia, which accuses the Houthis of being a proxy for their key regional rival, Shia-majority Iran. Both of them have denied the Saudi claims. Yemen - who is fighting whom? The Houthis: A minority Shia from the north, the group seized control of Sanaa last year and have since been expanding their control.

Further deepening the crisis, Islamic State (IS) militants appear to have emerged as a presence in Yemen.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

Question 1: Why was the Indian Ocean named after India? Question 2: Why Indian Ocean named under India? pick from the following. 1). no 2). yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"2). yes Both questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing, which is the reasoning behind the naming of the Indian Ocean after India. Let me provide you with a detailed explanation for this. The Indian Ocean is the third-largest of the five oceans in the world, spanning approximately 20% of the world's water surface. It is bounded by Asia to the north, Africa to the west, Australia to the east, and the Southern Ocean to the south. Due to its vast expanse and strategic importance, the Indian Ocean has been a prominent feature in world history, particularly in trade, navigation, and cultural exchange. Historically, the origin of the name \\"Indian Ocean\\" can be traced back to the ancient classical texts, when the regions surrounding the ocean were collectively referred to as 'India' or 'Indies.' The term 'India' originally comes from the Greek word 'Indos,' which was adopted and used frequently by Europeans during the age of exploration, commencing in the late 15th century. This term was used to describe not only the Indian subcontinent, but also the lands stretching as far as present-day Malaysia and Indonesia. Throughout history, the Indian subcontinent has played a central role in the development of maritime trade and cultural exchange within the Indian Ocean region. It served as a critical bridge for trade between various ancient civilizations, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Persia, and China. One of the most significant trade routes of the ancient world, the Silk Road, connected Asia, Africa, and Europe and had a significant influence on the history and culture of those regions. Due to India's strategic location, it has long been at the heart of cultural interactions and exchanges on an international scale. Indian merchants and seafarers navigated the waters of the Indian Ocean to trade with various nations and spread Indian culture and religion beyond its borders. In particular, the spread of Hinduism and Buddhism to Southeast Asia was facilitated by the interactions within the Indian Ocean region. The importance of the Indian subcontinent, its significant position geographically, and its rich history in the development of trade and cultural exchange within the Indian Ocean region are the reasons why the ocean is named after India. Moreover, it serves to highlight the long-standing impact of India on the shaping of the ocean's history and its broader global influence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What increases teh odds of a male bird obtaining a mate?\\" is in \\"Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What increases the odds of a male bird obtaining a mate?\\" can be found in the provided text, which discusses various aspects of bird behavior and plumage. The primary factors that increase the odds of a male bird obtaining a mate are: 1. Plumage: Birds use plumage to display social dominance, display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays. Attractive or elaborate plumage can help catch the attention of a potential mate and show that the male is healthy and has good genes. 2. Visual communication and ritualized displays: These displays can signal aggression, submission, or contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. By engaging in such visual communication, a male bird can demonstrate to potential mates that it is a suitable partner. 3. Complex courtship displays: In many bird species, courtship displays involve elaborate \\"dances\\" formed from combinations of various movements. These displays allow the male bird to showcase its physical prowess, coordination, and stamina. A high-quality display can greatly increase a male bird's chances of successfully obtaining a mate, as it may signify overall fitness and the ability to care for young. In summary, the odds of a male bird obtaining a mate can be increased through the presence of impressive plumage, engaging in visual communication and ritualized displays, and performing complex courtship displays. These factors indicate a male bird's fitness, strength, and suitability as a partner, thus making it more attractive to potential mates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

Write an email with the following subject: Transwestern's Unsubscribed Capacity Tariff Language Email:","completion":"Subject: Transwestern's Unsubscribed Capacity Tariff Language Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you to shed some light on Transwestern's Unsubscribed Capacity Tariff Language, its implications, and benefits for our esteemed customers. Our team at Transwestern constantly strives to improve our service offerings and ensure transparency in compliance with FERC regulations. The Unsubscribed Capacity Tariff Language refers to the provisions that form a part of our tariff, which enables our shippers to secure unsubscribed firm capacity on our natural gas pipeline system. The purpose of this email is to clarify the significance and relevance of these provisions and to answer any questions or concerns that you might have about them. Firstly, let us understand the concept of unsubscribed capacity. Unsubscribed capacity is the available firm capacity on our pipeline system that is not currently under a contract with any shipper. This capacity can be obtained by shippers seeking short-term or long-term firm transportation capacity for natural gas and helps them in meeting their supply and contractual obligations. Transwestern's Unsubscribed Capacity Tariff Language elaborates on the procedures, terms, and conditions applicable to shippers who are interested in securing this capacity. Here's a brief overview: 1. Open Season: We conduct an open season periodically to award the unsubscribed capacity to shippers on a non-discriminatory basis. During the open season, we invite bids from interested shippers with details, such as their desired contract term, quantities, and rate they are willing to pay. 2. Bidding Process: Shippers must submit a complete bid during the open season, adhering to the guidelines and timelines. Each bid will be evaluated based on the rate offered, term, and other factors, including creditworthiness and past performance. 3. Awarding Capacity: After evaluating the bids, we will award the unsubscribed capacity to the shipper(s) based on the highest net present value derived from their proposal. Successful bidders will be informed and required to enter into service agreements with us. 4. Rates and Charges: The tariff provides details on the rates, charges, surcharges, and other fees associated with the unsubscribed capacity. These will be in compliance with FERC regulations and may be negotiated based on the market situation and competition. 5. Availability of Information: Transwestern makes sure that all the relevant details and information related to the unsubscribed capacity and the open season are available on our website for shippers to access. Shippers can also reach out to our customer representatives for additional queries or assistance. By incorporating the Unsubscribed Capacity Tariff Language, we aim to uphold transparency, create new opportunities for our customers, and promote operational efficiency by utilizing our system optimally. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or need clarification on any aspects of the Unsubscribed Capacity Tariff Language. Our team would be more than happy to assist you.

Marty is a high-powered single literary agent in Manhattan. Marie (also Moore) is a widow in Provence with two daughters and a peaceful life. Marty has been seeing a therapist to deal with her vivid dreams of Marie's life; when Marie falls asleep she dreams Marty's life, but is much less disturbed by it. Each woman is convinced that the other is a figment of her imagination. When Marty meets Aaron they become friends and eventually lovers; terrified that her vivid other life means that she's losing her mind, Marty does not want to tell Aaron about it but finally does. Marie, meanwhile, has met William; she too is reluctant to tell William about her dreams, particularly since she (as Marty) is falling in love with Aaron, but realizes that she cannot keep such an important part of her life a secret. The two men react very differently: William is jealous, while Aaron is skeptical but not at all threatened, and wants only for Marty to be happy. Dreams and real life begin to merge when Marie goes on holiday with William to Paris, and Marty wakes up with an ashtray from the hotel on her night stand. Eventually Marty/Marie must come to terms with reality and choose which life is real and which is illusion.

The US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the move \\"counter-productive\\" to peace talks while the EU said the plan should be \\"reversed\\". The announcement comes days after Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas called for full UN membership for a Palestinian state. The new houses are to be constructed at Gilo, in East Jerusalem. Almost 500,000 Jews live in settlements on occupied territory. The settlements are illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. 'Provocative' US-brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians are deadlocked over the issue of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Mrs Clinton said Israel's move would damage attempts to resume direct negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. \\"We have long urged both sides to avoid any kind of action which could undermine trust, including, and perhaps most particularly, in Jerusalem, any action that could be viewed as provocative by either side,\\" she said. The European Union's Foreign Policy Chief Catherine Ashton told the EU parliament that she heard \\"with deep regret\\" that Israeli settlement plans were continuing. \\"This plan should be reversed. Settlement activity threatens the viability of an agreed two-state solution and runs contrary to the Israeli-stated commitment to resume negotiations.\\" She said she would raise the issue with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when she next met him. \\"He should stop announcing them and, more importantly, stop building them,\\" she said, adding that it was wrong to get people to live in a place from which they may have to move from after any negotiated settlement is achieved. British Foreign Secretary William Hague too urged Israel to revoke its decision. \\"Settlement expansion is illegal under international law, corrodes trust and undermines the basic principle of land for peace,\\" he said in a statement. The plan for construction in Gilo includes the construction of small housing units, public buildings, a school and an industrial zone, according to the Ynet news website. \\"It's a nice gift for Rosh Hashanah [Jewish New Year],\\" Yair Gabay, a member of the Jerusalem planning committee, told Ynet. The authorities have now approved the building of almost 3,000 homes in Gilo over the past two years. The chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the decision represented a rejection of a proposal by the Quartet of Mid East negotiators - the US, the EU, Russia and the UN - for new talks between the Palestinians and Israelis, expected to be made officially on Friday. \\"With this, Israel is responding to the Quartet's statement with 1,100 'NOs',\\" he said. On Monday, a divided UN Security Council met behind closed doors for its first discussion of last week's Palestinian application for full state membership of the UN. The request needs the support of nine of the 15 members of the council, but the US has said it will veto the bid. Israel built the settlement at Gilo on land it captured in 1967. It later annexed the area to the Jerusalem municipality in a move not recognised by the international community. Israel says it does not consider areas within the Jerusalem municipality to be settlements. Gilo lies across a narrow valley from the Palestinian village of Beit Jala. It became a target for militants during the second Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in 2000. Meanwhile, the UN rapporteurs on housing, water, sanitation and food rights said there had been a \\"dramatic increase\\" in the demolitions this year. \\"The impact and discriminatory nature of these demolitions and evictions is completely unacceptable,\\" they said in a statement. \\"These actions by the Israeli authorities violate human rights and humanitarian law and must end immediately.\\" This article was about:","completion":"This article discusses the international response to Israel's plan to build 1,100 new homes in the contested territory of East Jerusalem.

Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws.

Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision.

Rangersâ Streak Ends With Loss to Canadiens The Canadiens' Carey Price blocking one of only 17 shots taken by the Rangers on Saturday. MONTREAL — All good things must come to an end, but, for the Rangers, this good thing came to an end pretty badly. The Rangers’ bid to win an eighth straight game and put together their longest winning streak since 1974-75 ended Saturday night with an emphatic 4-0 loss to the Canadiens. “We were chasing the game — never caught up to it,” said John Tortorella, the Rangers’ coach, after a flat performance from most of his players. “It just wasn’t happening tonight.” The Rangers were not overwhelming during their winning streak, but they played well enough through it to beat a series of weak and middling teams, including the Canadiens on Nov. 5 at Madison Square Garden. But at the Bell Centre, their forwards underperformed. So did their defense, and so did their goalie. The Rangers could not get on track against a patchwork Montreal defense. Four of the six Canadiens defensemen had fewer than 69 games of N.H.L. experience. Against this green blue-line corps, the Rangers managed just 17 shots, only 2 more than their season low. The Canadiens took 31 shots. The Ranger forwards, including the top line of Marian Gaborik, Derek Stepan and Artem Anisimov, kept the puck in the Montreal end for long stretches in the first 25 minutes, but could not get square to shoot on Canadiens goalie Carey Price. After that, the attack generated almost nothing. At the other end, Rangers goalie Martin Biron lost for the first time in his fourth start of the season. He made several good saves, but he allowed a soft goal at 8 minutes 12 seconds of the second period that made the score 2-0. Brian Gionta scored the goal on an innocent shot from the boards that Biron simply missed, letting it go between his legs. Replays showed that a strap on his right pad had come loose, and after the goal he went to the bench to get it fixed. But Biron did not blame his equipment. “I was overthinking the short side on a bad-angle shot,” he said. “It changes the game.” Tortorella said Biron was not the goat. “Don’t look at our goalie, I’ll tell you that,” Tortorella said. He attributed the loss to “our full crew.” The Rangers trailed for only 42 seconds during their seven-game winning streak, but on Saturday they fell behind early after defenseman Ryan McDonagh was sent off for hooking at 3:14. On the ensuing power play, another defenseman, Michael Del Zotto, was caught too high in the neutral zone to stop a pass to Erik Cole at the Rangers’ blue line. Cole wheeled in and struck a perfect shot to the top corner at 3:45, giving the Canadiens a 1-0 lead. “Michael struggled with Cole,” Tortorella said, explaining that he moved Del Zotto to a different defense pairing in the second period so he wouldn’t have to face Cole. “Michael really struggled with his speed.” But Tortorella added, “Let’s face it, none of our D played well.” Tomas Plekanec made the score 3-0 at 7:05 of the third period with the Canadiens’ second power-play goal. The Rangers allowed six power plays in all, the most since their fourth game of the season, at a time when they were losing often. Gionta struck for his second goal less than seven minutes later to close out the scoring. Late in the second period, when it was still 2-0, it looked as if the Rangers might get a two-man advantage, as Del Zotto fell spinning to the ice on a power play after being tripped by Frederic St-Denis. But the referees ruled that Del Zotto embellished the fall with the spin, and sent him off as well as St.-Denis. That was the Rangers’ last hurrah in a poor performance. Andre Deveaux of the Rangers drove Petteri Nokelainen into the boards with a blindside hit in the third period, which may bring a call from Brendan Shanahan, the N.H.L.’s chief disciplinarian.

Read this and answer the question Demand in Europe for Chinese goods such as silk, tea, and ceramics could only be met if European companies funneled their limited supplies of silver into China. In the late 1700s, the governments of Britain and France were deeply concerned about the imbalance of trade and the drain of silver. To meet the growing Chinese demand for opium, the British East India Company greatly expanded its production in Bengal. Since China's economy was essentially self-sufficient, the country had little need to import goods or raw materials from the Europeans, so the usual way of payment was through silver. The Daoguang Emperor, concerned both over the outflow of silver and the damage that opium smoking was causing to his subjects, ordered Lin Zexu to end the opium trade. Lin confiscated the stocks of opium without compensation in 1839, leading Britain to send a military expedition the following year.

Spectre (2015 film) Filming temporarily returned to England to shoot scenes at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, which stood in for a location in Rome, before moving on to the city itself for a five-week shoot across the city, with locations including the Ponte Sisto bridge and the Roman Forum. The production faced opposition from a variety of special interest groups and city authorities, who were concerned about the potential for damage to historical sites around the city, and problems with graffiti and rubbish appearing in the film. A car chase scene set along the banks of the Tiber River and through the streets of Rome featured an Aston Martin DB10 and a Jaguar C-X75. The C-X75 was originally developed as a hybrid electric vehicle with four independent electric engines powered by two jet turbines, before the project was cancelled. The version used for filming was converted to use a conventional internal combustion engine, to minimise the potential for disruption from mechanical problems with the complex hybrid system.

The number of centenarians in Japan is expected to hit a record 58,820 on Respect-for-the-Aged Day on Sept. 15, an increase of 4,423 from a year earlier, according to the welfare ministry. It will be the 44th consecutive yearly record since 1971, when 339 people were 100 years old or older, according to ministry statistics released on Sept. 12. Women account for about 87 percent of the centenarians. At 116 years old, Osaka’s Misao Okawa is not only the oldest person in Japan but also the oldest person on the planet, according to Guinness World Records. Okawa, who lives in a nursing home, is known for her strong appetite, with one of her favorite dishes being sashimi. She uses her wheelchair several times a month. Sakari Momoi, 111, a resident of Saitama, is the oldest man in Japan. He was recognized as the world’s oldest man in August by Guinness World Records. He currently resides in a hospital but eats regular food and takes part in hospital events. Momoi communicates with others, sometimes through written messages. The welfare ministry compiled the number of people expected to be 100 or older as of Sept. 15 based on resident registries. ||||| The government is finding it costly furnishing Japan’s growing number of centenarians with a token of congratulation in the form of an expensive sake dish. Since fiscal 1963, the prime minister has traditionally presented new centenarians with a commemorative silver sakazuki, a flat saucer-like cup. As their numbers have increased, the costs have soared, tarnishing the government’s goodwill. It now plans to cease distributing the ¥8,000 silver cups and will instead select something cheaper. The presentations are made every year on Seniors’ Day, Sept. 15. The gesture is one few could quibble with: It praises the centenarians’ contributions to society. Officials admit that the program has become a significant budgetary burden. It cost ¥260 million in 2014. Japanese people have one of world’s greatest life expectancies. Last fiscal year, 29,357 people — 25,000 of whom were women — were inducted into the ranks of centenarians, compared with only 153 when the silver cup program began half a century ago, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. The government knows it needs to act fast, as the ministry predicts the number of newcomers will reach 39,000 in 2018. The ministry is looking at options for cutting costs, such as fabricating the cup from a cheaper material, adopting a different gift entirely or just sending a letter of congratulations, the officials said. Average longevity in 2014 was 86.83 years for women and 80.50 for men, both a record high. Women had the longest life expectancy in the world for the third consecutive year, with men ranking third, up from fourth the previous year. ||||| Image caption Japan's elderly population continues to grow, with more than a quarter of the population now of retirement age Japan's government plans to end the tradition of giving centenarians a silver commemorative gift, because the growing elderly population has made it too expensive, it's reported. Since 1963, a silver sake cup - or sakazuki - has been presented to everyone who reaches 100 years old. The cups, worth 8,000 yen (65; £40) each, are a thank you for centenarians' contribution to society. But as Japan's elderly population has expanded, so too has the gift bill, Kyodo news agency reports. Last year, the government shelled out 260 million yen (2.1m; £1.3m) on the items, a figure officials say isn't sustainable. As a result, they want to replace the gift with something less pricey. Options being considered include using cheaper materials or choosing something completely different to mark the occasion - possibly just a letter of congratulations, officials tell Kyodo. There were more than 29,000 new centenarians in Japan last year, compared to 153 when the scheme began, the report says. Life expectancy in Japan is among the highest in the world, and the number of people seeing their 100th birthday has grown every year since 1971.

The average life expectancy for Japanese men is 80.5 years of age, while for women, life expectancy was calculated at 86.83 years of age, Fuji TV reported Friday. Both groups increased by 0.29 and 0.22 years respectively over 2013. For male life expectancy, Japan ranked third after Hong Kong and Iceland, but remained No. 1 for female life expectancy for the third year in a row, ahead of Hong Kong and Spain. As reasons for the extended life expectancy in Japan, the ministry cited lower numbers of deaths from cancer and heart disease due to advances in medical treatment, Fuji reported. Japan Today ||||| Every year for more than 50 years, Japan’s new centenarians have been honoured with a silver sake cup and a congratulatory letter from the prime minister. But as the country prepares to mark Respect for the Aged Day next month, the latest crop of citizens who turned 100 in the past 12 months face disappointment, as the soaring number of centenarians puts a new strain on the government’s coffers. The saucer-like sakazuki, a gift from the government since 1963, could be replaced by a cheaper version or be scrapped altogether this year after the health and welfare ministry complained it could not afford to keep up with the number of new recipients. In 1963 Japan had just 153 centenarians, and as recently as 1998 the number stood at just 10,000. At the last count Japan’s 100-plus age group numbered almost 59,000, and that figure is expected to rise when the government releases new population data before Seniors’ Day on 15 September. Last year the ministry spent 260 million yen (£1.3m) on giving the cups – each worth about 8,000 yen – to almost 30,000 people, including 25,000 women. Local media pointed out that some people die before the gifts can be distributed, forcing them to be scrapped. Several years ago the cup’s diameter was slightly reduced amid concern over rising production costs, but the strain on the ministry’s finances could see the sakazuki replaced with a cup made from a cheaper metal, according to Japanese media reports. Other options being mulled are a different – and cheaper – commemorative gift, or restricting the official offering to the prime minister’s letter. “We are reviewing it, but we have not made any firm decisions,” a health ministry official told AFP. Demographers predict that Japan’s centenarian population will continue to grow as the general population ages – the result of regular medical examinations, universal healthcare and, among Japanese over a certain age, a fastidious attachment to the traditional low-fat diet of fish, tofu, vegetables and rice. Japanese women live an average of 86.3 years, putting them at the top of the global longevity table last year, while Japanese men were in fourth place with an average lifespan of 80.5 years. Just over a quarter of Japan’s 126 million people are 65 or over, according to the most recent census, and the proportion is expected to grow to about 40% by the middle of the century. It remains to be seen how most Japanese senior citizens will react to any decision to scale back official recognition of their accomplishment. Until recently the titles of world’s oldest man and woman were held by Japanese. Sakari Momoi, who cited healthy eating and a good night’s sleep as the secrets to his very long life, died in July aged 112. Misao Okawa, formerly the world’s oldest person, died in April this year, weeks after her 117th birthday. Last year the number of Japanese centenarians reached a record 58,820 on Respect for the Aged Day, an increase of 4,423 from the previous year. Japan’s oldest citizens were at the centre of a scandal in 2010 when it emerged that at least 200 centenarians had gone missing from local government records. In some cases, people who had died were still listed as alive, including a woman mistakenly recorded as having reached 125, whose registered home had been turned into a park in 1981. ||||| The third Monday of September is Respect for the Aged Day, a national holiday in Japan. The Japanese call national holidays “red days” because they appear in red print on the calendar. As this will make September 12–14 a long weekend, be prepared for heavier than usual traffic and crowded trains if you are traveling. Japanese people traditionally wear red on their 60th birthday because 60 years is one cycle on the Chinese calendar and after 60, it is said that you become a baby again. Babies in Japan are called “aka-chan” or “red one.” Respect for the Aged Day, called keiro no hi, is not quite like “Grandparent’s Day” in the U.S. It is far more serious. Neighborhoods will have volunteers distribute free “obento” boxed lunches to elderly people in the neighborhood and smaller villages will hold keirokai shows where the younger people and school children prepare dances and songs for a special keirokai ceremony. The elderly attendees are also treated to lunch, tea, and sweets after the performance. As Japan’s nation grays and people get older and older, some of these traditions may change, however. On the small island of 700 people where I live, the keirokai ceremony used to be held for those 60 years old and over. But with so many people over the age of 60 now, the qualifying age to attend the keirokai has steadily increased, and is now 65. As Japan’s society ages and nursing homes become more popular, being old may not be so special anymore—but rather the norm. Respect for the Aged Day is also a way to honor longevity, and Japanese people have always been some of the longest living in the world. But this is also changing as more and more Japanese people add meat and other western foods to their diets. In addition, city living is seen to cut lifespan due to pollution and stress.

In addition, in many parts of the world dams have helped to remedy life-threatening problems such as poverty from lack of economic development, famine as a result of drought, devastation from floods, and continued disease from lack of potable water supplies. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Lack of economic development decreases poverty.","completion":"The given sentence \\"Lack of economic development decreases poverty\\" is not an accurate representation of the relationship between economic development and poverty, based on the preceding text provided. In fact, the statement contradicts the information previously mentioned. The proper sentence should be \\"Economic development contributes to the decrease in poverty.\\" The preceding text emphasizes the contributions of Western farmers in feeding not only the United States but also a significant portion of the world. The implication is that a well-developed agricultural industry can offer a stable food supply, promote trade, and create job opportunities, ultimately fostering economic growth. Economic development, in turn, supports poverty reduction through better access to resources, income generation, and overall improved living conditions. The text also mentions India's irrigation systems that have allowed the country to be self-sufficient in food production since 1974. Access to consistent food sources means that the country can focus on other aspects of economic growth and reduce dependence on imports, which contributes to poverty alleviation. These irrigation systems are an example of infrastructural improvement, a key aspect of overall economic development. The construction of dams is another point mentioned in the text. Dams play an essential role in many aspects of economic development, such as providing hydroelectric power, allaying the severity of floods and droughts, and making potable water for consumption and sanitation more readily available. Improved infrastructure, through the use of dams and other developments, allows societies to better confront various challenges, including poverty, famine, and disease. Thus, it is important to recognize that economic development is instrumental in reducing poverty levels by fostering increased access to resources, creating more job opportunities, and improving the quality of life in various parts of the world.

If a particular boulder weighs 800 pounds on Planet X, then it will weigh _____ on planet Z. (A) less (B) more. What is the most sensical answer between \\"Planet Z\\" and \\"Planet X\\"? Answer:","completion":"The most sensical answer is that the boulder will weigh less on Planet Z compared to Planet X. To provide a detailed explanation, we must first understand the relationship between mass, weight, and gravity. Weight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity, and it depends on both the mass of the object and the strength of the gravitational force. The formula for weight is: Weight = Mass × Gravity Since Planet X has 10% more mass than Planet Z, it means that Planet X will have a stronger gravitational force. Assuming the boulder has the same mass on both planets, the difference in gravitational force will determine the difference in weight. If the boulder weighs 800 pounds on Planet X, it will weigh less on Planet Z because the gravitational force on Planet Z will be weaker due to its smaller mass. So, the answer is (A) less."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Context: The Texas church where a gunman opened fire during Sunday services, killing 26 and injuring 20, may not reopen. Pastor Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using the church as a place of worship. Pomeroy, who lost his own 14-year-old daughter in the massacre, proposed turning the site into a memorial and building another church on a different site. The final decision on the fate of the building will be made by the denomination's top leaders, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support. But a national Southern Baptist spokesman said the pastor's wishes will be taken into consideration. Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere. A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The original site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby. Also Thursday, the father of the Texas gunman broke his silence to say his family is in mourning. Michael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 55 kilometers north of Sutherland Springs. He refused to comment further, saying he does not want the \\"media circus'' surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy \\"our lives, our grandchildren's lives.'' A motive for the carnage remains unclear, but the younger Kelley appears to have targeted the church because it was attended by his wife's family. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being shot and chased by two residents as he was leaving the church. Question: How does Michael Kelly feel about the church?

Is \\"The collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from collector to emitter.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"While the statement \\"The collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from collector to emitter\\" provides a rudimentary understanding of the phenomenon, a more detailed and accurate answer requires delving into the principles of transistor operation. In grounded-emitter transistor circuits, the collector voltage drops because of the relationship between the base-emitter current and the collector-emitter current, as controlled by the transistor's current gain. To better understand this concept, let's first discuss the basic structure and operation of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). BJTs have three layers of doped semiconductors - the emitter, base, and collector. For an NPN transistor, the layers are ordered as N-P-N, while for a PNP transistor, they are organized as P-N-P. In a grounded-emitter configuration, the emitter is connected to a common ground while the base and collector terminals are both controlled by external voltages. When a small current flows into the base terminal in an NPN transistor (or out of the base terminal in a PNP transistor), it modulates the conductivity of the collector-emitter junction, allowing a larger current to flow between the collector and emitter. This current gain from the base to the collector current is called the transistor's \\"beta\\" (β) or \\"current gain.\\" In grounded-emitter transistor circuits, the input current (at the base-emitter junction) controls the output current (at the collector-emitter junction). When the input current increases, the output current also increases according to the transistor's current gain. As a result, more current flows through the collector resistor connected in series with the collector-emitter junction. This increased current causes a larger voltage drop across the collector resistor according to Ohm's law (V = I * R). As the voltage drop across the collector resistor increases, the potential difference between the supply voltage (Vcc) and the voltage drop diminishes, leading to a reduced collector voltage. The collector voltage, therefore, depends on the input current, the transistor's current gain, and the collector resistor. So, while the original statement captures a basic idea of why the collector voltage drops, a more precise explanation is that the collector voltage drops in grounded-emitter transistor circuits because of the dependence of the collector-emitter current on the base-emitter current, as controlled by the transistor's current gain and the voltage drop across the collector resistor due to Ohm's law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose cooler temperatures in oceans happens, how will it affect LESS erosion by the ocean. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you present suggests that cooler ocean temperatures might lead to less erosion by the ocean. To analyze the potential effect of this perturbation on the erosion process, we should examine each part of the process and consider any direct or indirect effects that could be influenced by cooler ocean temperatures. 1. Ocean waves hit land: Cooler ocean temperatures could potentially affect wave characteristics, such as wave height, frequency, or energy content. Waves generated by cooler ocean temperatures might be less powerful; thus, there could be a direct impact on the force with which waves hit the land and contribute to erosion. 2. Ocean water pulls sand off beaches: Cooler ocean water is denser than warmer water, which could potentially make it more difficult for the water to pull sand off beaches. If cooler water temperature reduces wave energy, the ability of ocean water to pull sand off beaches would likely be further diminished. In this case, the perturbation would have a direct effect on this stage of the erosion process. 3. Ocean water breaks rocks off cliffs: Cooler ocean temperatures could lead to less powerful waves that may be less effective in breaking rocks off cliffs. Moreover, if cooler water is denser, it could theoretically exert a stronger force on the rocks, making them more resistant to erosion. As such, cooler ocean temperatures may have both direct and indirect effects on this part of the erosion process. 4. Ocean water carries sand and rocks into the ocean: If cooler water temperature results in less powerful waves, it may also affect the ability of ocean water to carry sand and rocks into the ocean. Moreover, since cooler and denser water might make it more difficult for sand and rocks to be moved and transported, this perturbation could have a direct impact on this part of the erosion process. 5. Sand and rocks go to other land or the bottom of the ocean: Cooler ocean temperatures may have an indirect impact on this part of the erosion process. Less powerful waves and the reduced ability of cooler, denser water to transport sand and rocks could ultimately result in less erosion material being deposited onto other land or settling at the bottom of the ocean. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that cooler ocean temperatures could have a direct impact on multiple stages of the erosion process, likely resulting in less erosion by the ocean. The influence of cooler ocean temperatures could be seen in the alteration of wave characteristics, the reduced effectiveness of ocean water in pulling sand off beaches and breaking rocks off cliffs, and the decreased ability of ocean water to transport and deposit sand and rocks."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","completion":"A task that would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning could be to build a simple tower using objects of different shapes and sizes, such as wooden blocks or LEGO bricks. This task would require the individual to reason about the physical properties of the objects, their stability, and their interaction with other objects to make a stable structure. Step 1: Assess the available objects The first step would be to examine the objects available for building the tower. This includes evaluating their shapes, sizes, and considering their physical properties, such as weight distribution and ability to support other objects. Step 2: Plan the base of the tower Choose objects that have the largest surface area and can provide the most stability for the bottom layer. A stable base is essential for a tall and sturdy structure, so it is important to consider the physical properties of the chosen objects to ensure that they will not easily topple. Step 3: Stack objects with stability in mind Continue stacking objects on top of the base, keeping in mind that objects closer to the ground level should be stronger and able to support the weight of the objects above it. As you stack, continue to consider how the objects can be arranged to maximize stability. This may involve using interlocking shapes, balancing weights, or creating additional support points. Step 4: Find the center of gravity Throughout the building process, consider the tower's center of gravity. A balanced tower is more likely to stay upright. The center of gravity should ideally be close to the middle of the structure, vertically and horizontally. Step 5: Test the stability of the tower Gently nudge the tower to test its stability. If the tower wobbles or starts to collapse, adjust the placement of objects or reconsider the choice of objects used to improve stability. Step 6: Iterate as needed After each test, make any necessary adjustments to the tower's structure based on your physical reasoning and the tower's response to your tests. This may involve adding, removing, or rearranging objects to maximize stability. In conclusion, this type of task tests an individual's physical reasoning by requiring them to plan, build, and adjust a structure based on their understanding of the physical properties and interactions of the objects involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: To bend strips of metal that are too strong to bend by hand, you can Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish this goal of bending strips of metal that are too strong to bend by hand, several methods can be employed. The effectiveness of each method depends on various factors, such as the type of metal, the desired bend angle, and the tools available. Below, I will detail a few methods and analyze their sensibility when it comes to bending strong metal strips. 1. Using a Bench Vise and a Metal Pipe: One of the simplest and most affordable methods is to use a bench vise and a metal pipe (also known as a cheater bar). Bench vises provide a stable clamping surface to hold the metal strip in place while the metal pipe serves as a lever to amplify the force applied. First, secure the metal strip in the vise with the desired bend location positioned at the edge of the vise jaws. Then, slide the metal pipe over the free end of the strip. Apply downward pressure on the pipe to create a controlled bend in the strip using leverage. This method is sensible for occasional bending tasks, where precise angles are not required. 2. Hydraulic Press Brake: A hydraulic press brake is an industrial-grade machine used specifically for bending metal. It operates using a hydraulic cylinder that applies pressure onto a die, which then bends the metal strip. The amount of pressure exerted can be adjusted based on the thickness and strength of the metal. Press brakes can also accommodate various die shapes to create specific bends. This method provides greater control and precision but comes with a much higher cost. It is more sensible for facilities that require frequent metal bending with a high degree of accuracy. 3. Induction Bending: Induction bending is a process in which heat is applied to the area of the metal strip where bending is desired. This is typically done using an induction coil that generates an electromagnetic field to heat the strip, making it more pliable. Once the desired temperature is reached, bending pressure is applied, allowing for smooth bends without leaving marks or damaging the metal strip. Induction bending is a sensible method for projects that require high-quality bends with minimal stress or deformation on the metal. However, it necessitates specialized equipment and trained personnel, making it less practical for smaller projects or occasional bending tasks. 4. Sheet Metal Brake: A sheet metal brake is a hand-operated tool designed to bend metal sheets or strips. It consists of a clamping bar that holds the metal in place and a bending plate that shapes the metal when pressure is applied. Sheet metal brakes are available in various sizes and capacities, with some models capable of handling thick, strong metal strips. This method is sensible for projects that require numerous bends or specific bend angles, as it offers precise control and repeatability. Additionally, it is more affordable than hydraulic presses or induction bending equipment. In conclusion, selecting the most sensible method to accomplish the goal of bending strong metal strips depends on several factors. For occasional or small-scale projects, using a bench vise and a metal pipe or a sheet metal brake may be the most appropriate choice. For larger projects or specialized bend requirements, a hydraulic press brake or induction bending may be more suitable. Ultimately, the method chosen should balance factors such as cost, precision, frequency of use, and the specific properties of the metal strips being bent."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the last names of the people who discover Elspeth is lonely?, using the article: Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates.

Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. Bubba and Dean are two farmers which realized the benefits of having AM fungi in their soil. Dean, however, took active steps in helping the growth of AM fungi so he grew cover crops on his lands. Which farmer didn't increase the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop?","completion":"Bubba is the farmer who didn't increase the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop. This is because Dean took active steps to help the growth of AM fungi by growing cover crops on his lands, while Bubba did not take any such steps."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For this, we will add 50 to both sides of the equation: -42*h - 50 + 50 = 118 + 50 This simplifies to: -42*h = 168 Step 2: Now, we need to isolate the variable h by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of h, which in this case is -42: -42*h / -42 = 168 / -42 This simplifies to: h = -4 Thus, the solution to the equation -42*h - 50 = 118 for the variable h is h = -4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Question: \\"Who did Antigonus Gonatas belong to?\\" Context: \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Antigonus Gonatas belonged to the Antigonid dynasty, as he was the son of Demetrius I Poliorcetes and grandson of Antigonus I Monophthalmus.

Beijing, the capital of China, is a significant player on the world stage and is an emerging powerhouse in the Asia-Pacific region. As home to many global conglomerates and multinational corporations, Beijing represents a huge market for retail due to its massive population and increasing levels of disposable income.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore.

Given the context: Why did Tracy do this? Possible answers: cure her boredom, drive to the store, find the perfect outfit Answer:","completion":"Tracy purchased clothes at the store because she finally found the perfect outfit to wear after going through what could have been a long process of searching and trying on different clothing options. In this context, it is clear that her main motivation for making the purchase was to acquire the perfect outfit that she had been searching for. To fully understand Tracy's actions, it is important to analyze the possible reasons mentioned in the question: 1. Cure her boredom: Although shopping can be a fun and exciting activity that could potentially help cure someone's boredom, it is not the primary reason behind Tracy's decision to purchase clothes. The statement \\"Tracy finally found the perfect outfit to wear\\" indicates that her main objective was to find the right outfit rather than just passing time or alleviating boredom. 2. Drive to the store: Driving to the store is more of an essential step taken to find the perfect outfit rather than the reason why she made the purchase. The process of going to the store would have allowed Tracy to browse through various options and try on multiple outfits, eventually leading her to find the one that met her needs and preferences. Hence, driving to the store was a necessary action in achieving her goal but not the primary reason for her purchase decision. 3. Find the perfect outfit: This appears to be the most accurate reason behind Tracy's decision to purchase clothes at the store. The context given clearly states that she finally found the perfect outfit to wear. This indicates that Tracy had been searching for a specific outfit or style that met her criteria, and upon finding it, she decided to make the purchase. Her satisfaction with the chosen outfit justified her decision to buy it and accomplished the goal she set out to achieve when shopping. In conclusion, Tracy's primary reason for purchasing clothes at the store was to find the perfect outfit that fit her needs, taste, and preferences. The process of going to the store and trying on different options allowed her to achieve this goal. While shopping could have helped to cure boredom or provide entertainment, these were not the main driving factors behind her decision to make the purchase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, wet the toothbrush and toothpaste a little bit under some water. This will help it work better when you start brushing. 3. Open your mouth and place the toothbrush bristles on your teeth. Hold the toothbrush like a pencil so you can reach all the corners of your mouth. Make sure you angle the toothbrush so the bristles are pointing towards your gums. 4. Gently brush your teeth using small, circular motions. Take your time, and make sure you brush all the sides of your teeth - the front, the back, and the top. 5. You need to brush for about two minutes to make sure your teeth are clean. It's like singing the ABCs song four times. You can ask a grown-up to count for you if you find it difficult. 6. When you're done brushing, spit out all the toothpaste foam in the sink. Remember not to swallow it. 7.

Hewn ruthlessly from the earth by water over 270million years, these stone structures are a testament to the power of the natural world. The pillars, arches and columns rise hundred of feet into the air over a vast region of southern China, striking awe into observers who have flocked to the area for thousands of years. Known as karsts, the limestone structures - captured in these images for National Geographic Magazine - are created when water forces fissures, sinkholes, cracks and caverns into the soft rock, leaving only a series of monoliths above ground. Vast: Jaw-dropping limestone 'karsts' formed by erosion over 270million years soar hundreds of feet into the air across a huge region of southern China. Pictured, climber Emily Harrington takes the hard way up Moon Hill, an arch which was formed from the remains of a collapsed cave. Sightseers can take an easier dirt track. Awe: The enormity of the structures is clear compared to the size of the cavers ascending them, from a limestone spire in the Enshi canyon (left) to the Great Arch in Ziyun Getu He Chuandong National Park (right). Seeing these sights can be much easier, as a new glass elevator delivers less intrepid tourists to the foot of the arch. China's Stone Forest is one of the. largest, with huge arches which once belonged to cave systems but now. protrude awkwardly above the lush green hills around. Covering an estimated half a million square kilometres, south China's is one of the largest and most significant in the world. While. limestone structures are common, only in a humid, tropical environment. can there be enough movement of water to create such dramatic change,. and form structures which have earned the South China Karst recognition. as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. But. just as with an iceberg, what can be seen in these photographs is only. the tip. The flowing water has not only carved up the landscape above. the ground, but has also transformed it below. South. China is home to some of the largest caves in the world, which even now. are still being mapped and explored by researchers from around the. world. Heading the charge. is a team led by Andy Eavis, the chairman of the British Caving. Association who has been traveling to China for more than 30 years. Otherworldly: The landscape was formed by water in the humid region seeping in through cracks in porous rock and gradually opening up sinkholes, fissures and caves. All work and no play...: Those pictured have devoted their careers to exploring and mapping the hostile cave landscape down below - but do come up for air occasionally. Map: Beneath southern China's landscape researchers have discovered some of the largest underground chambers in the world. In 2013 a British-led expedition used a laser scanner to map the Miao Room of Gebihe, pictured, whose maximum height is 627 feet. A passenger jet is shown for scale. The images are from the July issue of National Geographic magazine. He and his explorers have used. pioneering laser scanners to map the complex, unstable systems in. unprecedented detail, including the Miao Room of the Gebihe cave system -. since confirmed as the second-largest known cavern in the world. Despite. its entrance from the outer world comprising just a narrow, unobtrusive. gap in stone in the forest, it has a maximum height of 627 feet. The. cavern must be explored in hostile conditions - including high humidity. and a lack of any natural light - using a mixture of computer. technology and old-fashioned caving bravery. With. fissures and sharp points of rock, a wrong step could mean injury or. death, and the cavern is so large it could fit a fleet of jumbo jets. with plenty of room to spare. Other. caves are less formidable. In one part of the region, an entire village. of 21 homes - with no need for rooves - is situated inside a cavern. together with a primary school, a basketball court, and an increasing. stream of tourists. More still have been made safe for people to explore without the risk of losing their hats. It. is not all work and no play for the explorers. Some feature in these. photos, where they take time off from their caving work to ascend the. other side of China's fantasy landscape. That. is despite there being far more tourist-friendly ways to ascend the. limestone structures, which are mainly in China's Yunnan, Guizhou and. Guangxi provinces. One, the. Great Arch in Ziyun Getu He Chuandong National Park, includes a glass. elevator which delivers the less intrepid to the foot of the arch so. they do not have to climb. It is a vision of the future - and it's predicted the caves will be next. With. China becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,. tourists from other parts of the vast nation are already streaming. underground - though how long it will take to install a glass lift there. remains to be seen.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. Now, I have a new situation: Students working on their thesis for graduate school decide that they will write about the differences between two identical plants, but they will infect one of the plants with a fungus. This fungus will create a mycorrhizal association between one of the plants and the fungus. After caring for the plants, the students have grown fond of them and given them names. They have named one of them Audrey and the other Baudrey. They flip a coin to decide which plant will be infected with the fungus, and fate has decided that Audrey will have the fungus grow on it. Baudrey will be left to grow naturally. Answer this question please: Which plant's roots will have more surface area? Answer:","completion":"Audrey, the plant with the mycorrhizal association due to the fungus, will have more surface area in its roots. This is because the mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant's root system, allowing for improved water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. In comparison, Baudrey will be left to grow naturally without the mycorrhizal association, resulting in a lesser surface area for its roots."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

The reporter indicates that Sarah was an activist from Chicago involved in helping refugees from the Chilean government and that her death may cast new light on the movement. Fielding is completely distraught over hearing this news and the movie begins.The first 3/4 of the movie unfolds on parallel timelines in the 70s and early 80s: the progression of Fielding & Sarah's complicated, volatile relationship and Fielding's ascension into power as an upcoming politician dealing with the recent loss (and haunting memories) of Sarah.Fielding meets Sarah as he is returning, in uniform, from duty in the Coast Guard and meeting up with his brother, who is a editor. The brother, Fielding and Sarah all go to lunch where Fielding is very ouspoken in his political ideals about current events. Sarah and Fielding are both immediately intrigued by each other, Fielding's attraction being more sexual and blatant and Sarah's attraction more of curiousity and intrigue. A few dates quickly lead to a sexual relationship despite an obvious difference in political thinking between the two. Sarah asks why Fielding wants to be a senator and his very serious reply is that he doesn't- he wants to be president. Sarah is later quoted as saying \\"Ambition is the ice in the lake of emotion.\\" And when Fielding tries to comfort Sarah's fear of his Coast Guard duty leading to a Vietnam tour, she replies \\"but if you go over there, you'll be shooting at the guys that I want to win.\\" Their intense love outweighs their differences, though, and their relationship quickly becomes serious.Meanwhile Fielding is a young politician being groomed to be congressman by the current govenor because of a scandal involving Jerry Carmichael 's (Ed Harris in a cameo role) resignation due to his homosexuality.

Input: Entomologist James Atherton (Julian Sands) searches the Amazon rainforest with the hope of discovering new species of insects and arachnids. Descending into an enormous sinkhole, his team sets up collectors on the ground below a large tree, then blow smoke up into the canopy of the tree. A large number of bugs fall into the collector, including a very aggressive new species of spider. The spider is captured and chloroformed for research; and is later revealed to be lacking sex organs, thus making it a drone, or soldier, highly unusual in an arachnid species. A nature photographer, Jerry Manley (Mark L. Taylor), who has been suffering a fever while traveling with the team, unknowingly has a fertile (non-drone) male spider of the same species jump into his backpack, that night sneaking into his sleeping bag and biting him. Manley has a massive seizure from the venom and dies. The remaining scientists takes his body back to the United States, blaming Manley's death on the preexisting fever. The spider follows the crew, jumps into the stretcher carrying Manley's body, and is sealed into a box with the corpse.Manley's body arrives at the funeral home in his small town of Canaima, California, and mortician Irv Kendall (Roy Brocksmith), stunned at the body's greenish color (from the spider's digestive fluids) does not notice the spider inside the coffin when he opens it. The spider sneaks outside and is picked up by a raven, but before the raven gets back to its nest, the raven is bitten by the spider and it falls dead to the ground in front of the barn of the Jennings family. Ross Jennings (Jeff Daniels) is a family physician who had moved to the town from San Francisco and who faces a lack of patients due to elderly rival Sam Metcalf (Henry Jones), who was supposed to retire and shift his patients to Ross, but decided to maintain his practice.The Amazonian spider mates with a female domestic house spider and makes a nest in Jennings' barn, producing hundreds of infertile drone offspring, all of which have their father's lethal bite. Ross, along with his son Tommy, has arachnophobia, making them targets of ridicule to wife Molly (Harley Jane Kozak) and daughter Shelly (Marlene Katz).Ross' first patient, Margaret Hollins (Mary Carver), dies after being bitten. The town's residents believe that she died from a heart attack, despite Ross' suspicions that something else was at work since her body appeared to have had a seizure instead. After a spider also kills a football player, a death that is attributed to a football injury, Ross is known to the town as \\"Dr. Death\\", having all his patients dying after having seen him. When Doc Metcalf is bitten and dies, Ross suspects that deadly arachnids could be infesting the town.Ross and county coroner Milton Briggs (James Handy) perform an autopsy on the victims and confirm Ross' suspicion that the deaths were caused by spider bites. Atherton arrives in town with his assistant Chris Collins (Brian McNamara), joining Briggs, Sheriff Lloyd Parsons (Stuart Pankin) and exterminator Delbert McClintock (John Goodman) in the spider investigation. They discover that the killer spiders have a short life expectancy due to being a mixed breed. Atherton tells them that the spiders are soldiers, sent out to eliminate potential threats for the general male spider. He also learns that the general spider produced a queen, which it likely mated with to produce a second nest someplace, guarded by the queen, which could produce fertile offspring. Atherton elaborates that, unlike the sinkhole of the spider's original habitat, which limited its territory, the transplanted spiders can progressively expand their territory, possibly culminating in their worldwide dispersal. The group sets out to destroy both nests and kill the queen and general, but Atherton plans to capture the general alive for his agenda after discovering where the first nest is located. Atherton plucks at the web to lure the general out, but gets caught by surprise as the general leaps from his hiding place and fatally bites Atherton.Ross, Chris, and Delbert eventually discover that the nest is in Ross's barn, and Ross sends Delbert to destroy it, where the exterminator finds Atherton dead before destroying the nest. Chris gets the Jennings family out of their infested house, but Ross falls through the floor into his wine cellar, which turns out to be the spiders' second nest, containing fertile offspring. After electrocuting the queen, Ross battles the general while also attempting to burn the second egg sac. He becomes trapped underneath fallen debris, with the general about to deliver the killing strike when Ross flings the general into the fire.As the egg sac hatches, the general jumps out of the fire. Ross shoots him with a nail gun and the projectile sends the burning spider into the egg sac, destroying the nest with fire and ending the plague.Having enough of the countryside along with the near-death experience, the Jennings family immediately moves back to San Francisco, appreciating city life once more, despite minor earthquakes disrupting them., Question: WHo jumped out of the fire?

A former cheerleading captain at a suburban Minneapolis high school was sentenced today to three years in prison for prostituting a younger squad member and keeping the money for herself. Montia Parker, 18, of Minnesota, previously pleaded guilty to three prostitution-related counts. She was immediately ordered into custody, and must spend at least two years behind bars before she's eligible for release. She must also register as a sex offender. Female pimp: 18-year-old Montia Parker, left and right, will serve at least two years in prison before being eligible for release. 'You were the leader of an attempted. high school prostitution ring,' Hennepin County District Court Judge. William Koch said at the sentencing hearing. 'And you did it all for a. pair of sneakers.' Parker. admitted that last March she told a 16-year-old fellow cheerleader at. Hopkins High School that the girl could earn money through prostitution. After the younger. girl agreed, Parker placed an ad for her online, then took her to an. apartment where the girl was paid to perform oral sex. The girl gave 60. to Parker, who kept the money. The. next day, Parker drove the girl to another apartment, but the girl. didn't do what the man asked her to do - vaginal sex - and offered oral. sex instead. The client declined and no money was exchanged. The. victim's sister told Koch that Parker manipulated a girl with a. learning disability, and that she had trusted Parker whom she considered. a friend. Skipping classes: The crime was reported when the victim's mother was notified about unexcused absences and read the text message conversations between the two girls. She asked the judge to make an example of Parker, saying her sister's life had been destroyed. Her sister has since isolated herself, switched schools, and quit cheerleading, she said. Prosecutor. Joshua Larson asked that Parker be sentenced to up to five years in. prison, saying Parker was the'\\"instigator, designer, manager and CEO of. pimping this child.' Parker's. attorney, Leon Trawick, argued for time in the workhouse and probation,. saying his client was an honor student with no criminal history and a. bright future ahead of her. Parker apologized in a letter to the judge, which was not read in court. But Koch said the crimes demanded time in prison, calling her actions peer pressure of the worst kind. 'This took planning. It took preparation. It took follow through,' Koch said. It. was revealed in court that Parker had become familiar with online sex. ads after a former boyfriend tried to pressure her into selling herself. for sex. Koch said that because of that, Parker should have known better and should have protected the victim instead of exploiting her. The victim's family left the courtroom without saying anything. Parker's family declined comment. According to the criminal complaint, Parker posed as the girl's mother and took her out of school. The. girl's mother called police after she noticed changes in her daughter's. behavior and checked the girl's cellphone, finding messages between. Parker and the girl. Hopkins. High School has said it took immediate action when it heard of the. charges and followed its disciplinary policy, which includes permanently. removing a student from campus.","completion":"An 18-year-old girl named Montia Parker, who was a cheerleading captain at a school near Minneapolis, was sent to prison for three years. She did a very bad thing by making a younger cheerleader become involved in something called prostitution and took the money the younger girl was given. The judge was very upset with Montia because she was supposed to be a friend and leader to the younger girl but she made her do things for a pair of sneakers. Montia will have to stay in prison for at least two years before she can leave, and she has to register as a sex offender, which means people will know she did something wrong.

Question: Who does Pillai propose the killer is? Movie title: Andha Naal Movie plot: On the night of 11 October 1943, the Japanese bombed the Indian city of Madras (now known as Chennai), causing commotion all over the city. In Triplicane the next morning, Rajan (Sivaji Ganesan), a radio engineer and communications researcher, is found murdered with his own hand gun. His neighbor Chinnaiah Pillai (P. D. Sambandam) hears the gunshot and complains to the police. A local Police Inspector named Purushothaman Naidu arrives and investigates the scene. He is joined by C.I.D. officer Sivanandam (Javar Seetharaman)there. He concludes that the killer is some petty thief who must have shot Rajan for the lump of money found in the same room of the crime scene. However, Sivanandam states that to be of a bad solution, as the amount of money matches exactly with the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room, without a single rupee's difference. Nonetheless, it was clear Rajan was making plans to leave Chennai, in anticipation of the bombings. Rajan's wife Usha (Pandari Bai) is almost dumbstruck and unable to speak during any inquiries. Sivanandam and Naidu feel reluctant and embarrassed to do any questioning to her.The two decide to investigate the case by questioning the people in and around the house, who are the family members or friends of Rajan. They first do their inquiry with Chinnaiah Pillai, the neighbour as he is the first to inform them. He tells that the killer could probably be Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother (T. K. Balachandran). He recounts an incident (as flashback), in which Pattabi confronts Rajan at the house's garage to ask for his share of the family property to be apportioned and given to him. Rajan, in good faith, denies to give Pattabi his share, feeling that he and his wife might squander it. Chinnaiah concludes that this would have kindled Pattabi to kill Rajan.Sivanandam and Naidu decide to inquire Pattabi. However, Pattabi had rushed to the Beach before their arrival, probably to commit suicide. They rush there themselves to inquire him. When questioned,... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Andha Naal,\\" Pillai proposes that the killer is Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother. He suggests this due to a previous incident where Pattabi confronts Rajan to ask for his share of the family property, which Rajan refuses, fearing that he and his wife might squander it.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust? ? A Late Preclassic tomb has been excavated, believed to be a royal burial. This tomb has been designated Burial 1; it was found during excavations of Structure 7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure. The burial is also associated with Stela 13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure 7A. These ceramics date the offering to the end of the Late Preclassic. No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts. The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring 1 by 2 metres (3.3 by 6.6 ft), which was probably made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece jade necklace, two earspools coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from iron pyrite, one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved greenstone fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD 100–200.In October 2012, a tomb carbon-dated between 700 BC and 400 BC was reported to have been found in Takalik Abaj of a ruler nicknamed K'utz Chman (\\"Grandfather Vulture\\" in Mam) by archaeologists, a sacred king or \\"big chief\\" who \\"bridged the gap between the Olmec and Mayan cultures in Central America,\\" according to Miguel Orrego.

Summarize this article: Obama calls Boehner, urges him to allow vote on Senate payroll tax cut bill By Amie Parnes - President Obama called Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on Wednesday and urged him to allow a vote on the two-month payroll tax extension, calling it \\"the only option\\" to ensure taxes don't go up. In a phone call made late Wednesday morning, Obama urged Boehner to take up the Senate's bill, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. In the call, Obama told the Speaker he was committed to working with Congress on extending the payroll tax for the entire year. He also reminded Boehner that \\"the short-term bipartisan compromise passed by almost the entire Senate is the only option to ensure that middle-class families aren't hit with a tax hike in 10 days and gives both sides the time needed to work out a full-year solution,\\" according to a White House readout. Boehner, however, urged Obama to call on Senate Democrats to appoint negotiators to a conference committee and said Republicans remain in Washington and are “ready to work,\\" according to a readout provided by an aide to the Speaker. “Let’s get this done today,” the Speaker told the president, the aide said. Boehner reminded Obama that the House was the only body “that had done what he asked for by providing a full year of payroll tax relief and extended unemployment benefits.” “He urged the President to call on Senator Reid to appoint negotiators so that we can produce a full-year bill by the end of the year that provides a tax cut of 1,000 rather than only 166,” the aide said. “The Speaker told the president that his conference was elected to change the way Washington does business and that we should not waste the next ten days simply because it is an inconvenient time of year.” The differences between the House GOP and the Senate, Boehner told the president, “are not so great that we cannot pass a full-year bill by December 31st,” the aide said. Responding to Boehner's remarks on the call, which became public in the middle of the daily press briefing, Carney stood his ground and restated the administration's position saying the \\"opportunity\\" to pass the Senate legislation \\"is there.\\" \\"Just take it,\\" Carney said. The spokesman added that the \\"sudden insistence\\" by the Speaker to pass a one-year extension \\"doesn't ring true.\\" Asked if there was a stalemate happening, Carney replied, \\"There is a stalemate in that the speaker will not act.\\" Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) chimed in late in the day, rifling off a letter to Boehner urging him and the GOP conference “not to walk away from the American people again.” “There is still time to call the House back and pass the short-term extension bill that received 89 bipartisan votes in the U.S. Senate,” Pelosi wrote. “I am hopeful that reason will prevail in your conference and that we can secure a bipartisan, long-term bill after the first of the year.” Obama also called Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) earlier Wednesday and \\"applauded\\" him for reaching the bipartisan compromise with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Carney said. In that conversation, Reid \\"reaffirmed his commitment to secure a bipartisan yearlong tax cut after the House passes the two-month extension,\\" according to the White House readout. \\"The ball is in the House's court,\\" Carney said, adding that they should \\"do the right thing and pass the bipartisan compromise.\\" \\"They should just get it done,\\" Carney said. Asked about Obama's plans to join his family in Hawaii, Carney said, \\"I don't have any scheduling updates to give you.\\" Obama left the White House Wednesday afternoon for a shopping trip in Northern Virginia. At the same time, Carney said that there would not be any more negotiating done. Obama \\"made clear\\" to Boehner that the House needs to take up the Senate bill. \\"The negotiating has happened already,\\" Carney said. \\"It is not at all the case that the president is saying, 'Here's what I want, and do it.' \\" — Russell Berman contributed. — This story was last updated at 3:58 p.m. ||||| “I have an 11- and 13-year-old at home, and I would love to be at home with them for the holidays and with my wife,” said Rep. Thomas Reed (R-N.Y.), one of the conference committee members. “But the American people deserve that we do our work and this Senate bill, 60 days, it’s just bad, reckless policy.” Boehner appeared to shake off the scathing editorial from The Wall Street Journal, which declared that the Republicans “thoroughly botched the politics” of the payroll tax cut debate and put President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats in a better position to win reelection in 2012. Text Size - + reset “We are the party of lower taxes for the American people,” Boehner said when asked about the editorial. “We have fought for lower taxes for the 21 years that I have been in this Congress, and we will continue to be the party of lower taxes. The fact is that we can resolve the differences between the two parties and give the American people a real Christmas present.” The Ohio Republican later added that it would be “helpful” if senators — both Republicans and Democrats — were in the Capitol to help negotiate a deal. But there were no signs — at least publicly, that the Senate is going to help. Several moderate Senate Republicans who are up for reelection next year have criticized House Republicans for not passing the Senate’s two-month extension. And on Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) joined in, declaring that the tax cut fight was “harming the Republican Party.” “It is harming the view, if it’s possible anymore, of the American people about Congress,” McCain told CNN. “And we’ve got to get this thing resolved.” McCain also tweeted Wednesday morning that the Journal’s editorial page was “right on the mark.” And Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) — who earlier this week said Reid should call the Senate back to Washington to work out a deal with House Republicans — said in a Wednesday morning television interview that the Journal editorial was “right.” “One more public policy blunder, but just get it over with and move on because now it’s been framed as a tax increase, which it’s not,” Corker said on CNBC. “Probably at this point, the best thing to do is to figure out a way to get this behind us and move on and hopefully at some point, figure out a way to begin dealing with the real issues that our country needs to deal with.” Clearly sensing a political advantage on the payroll tax debate, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters on a conference call that Boehner’s decision to block a vote on the Senate bill was “backfiring.” “When the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal has turned on the top elected Republican in the United States, that tells you something,” said Schumer, who heads the Senate Democrats’ messaging operation. “It shows how quickly the politics and the substance of this issue have turned against the speaker.” Asked whether Democrats were engaging in partisan gamesmanship of their own, Hoyer — who earlier had called the GOP conference committee a “gimmick” and a “political charade” — pushed back. “This is democracy,” Hoyer said. “We’re not playing a game.” Scott Wong contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Once upon a time, President Obama called Speaker John Boehner. He asked him to let people vote on a bill about payroll tax cuts. This bill was important because it would stop taxes from going up for some people. But John Boehner wanted President Obama to talk to some other people in the government to make a different plan. He said they could still try to finish this problem before the end of the year. In the end, they were trying to find a way to agree on the best way to help people with their taxes. Some other people, like Nancy Pelosi, also shared their opinions and asked them to work together."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The film then goes back one year before the massacre, to Jerusalem where Zachariah is a rabbi and making an offering, when he gets told by the Archangel Gabriel that his wife will bear a son by a vision. He states that he is too old, and is told by Gabriel that he will be unable to speak until the boy is born. It then goes to the town of Nazareth, where a teenaged girl named Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is farming, and soldiers come to collect taxes, one man, who is unable to pay, has a third of his land seized and his daughter pressed into debt slavery to pay his debt. Mary is then, betrothed to marry Joseph of Judaea (Oscar Isaac), is visited by the Angel Gabriel and told that she will become pregnant with God's son, whom she is to name \\"Jesus\\". He then tells that her God has blessed her cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo) with a child despite her old age. Mary asks her parents and Joseph could she visit with Elizabeth before the harvest, where she witnesses the birth of John the Baptist to Elizabeth and her husband the priest Zachariah (Stanley Townsend), who regains his speech after he refused to believe the Angel Gabriel's news that he would have a son. Mary returns from the visit pregnant, to the shock of Joseph and her parents, who fear that Joseph will accuse her of fornication, a sin punishable with death by stoning according to the Mosaic Law. At first Joseph does not believe Mary's explanation that she was visited by the angel Gabriel, but decides not to accuse her. Although he is still shocked and angry, Joseph is later visited in a dream by the Angel Gabriel, who tells him of God's plan for Mary's son. Joseph then believes Mary, and is ashamed for his earlier doubts. Meanwhile, Caesar Augustus, the Roman emperor, has demanded that every man and his...

Alice Paul was born on January 11, 1885, at Paulsdale in Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey. She was the eldest of four children of William Mickle Paul I (1850-1902) and Tacie Paul (nee Parry), and a descendant of William Penn, the Quaker founder of Pennsylvania. Her siblings were Willam, Helen, and Parry. She grew up in the Quaker tradition of public service; her ancestors included participants in the New Jersey Committee of Correspondence in the Revolutionary era and a state legislative leader in the 19th century. Paul attended Moorestown Friends School, where she graduated at the top of her class. In 1901, Paul went to Swarthmore College, an institution co-founded by her grandfather. While attending Swarthmore, Paul served as a member on the Executive Board of Student Government, one experience which may have sparked her eventual excitement for political activism. Alice graduated from Swarthmore College with a bachelor's degree in biology in 1905. Partly in order to avoid going into teaching work, Paul completed a fellowship year at a settlement house in New York City after her graduation, living on the Lower East Side at the College Settlement House. While working on settlement activities taught her about the need to right injustice in America, Alice soon decided that social work was not the way she was to achieve this goal: \\"I knew in a very short time I was never going to be a social worker, because I could see that social workers were not doing much good in the world... you couldn't change the situation by social work.\\" Paul then earned a master of arts from the University of Pennsylvania in 1907, after completing coursework in political science, sociology and economics. She continued her studies at the Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre in Birmingham, England, and took economics classes from the University of Birmingham, while continuing to earn money doing social work. She first heard Christabel Pankhurst speak at Birmingham. When she later moved to London to work, she joined the militant suffrage group the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) led by Christabel and her mother, Emmeline Pankhurst. She was arrested repeatedly during suffrage demonstrations and served three jail terms. After returning from England in 1910, Paul continued her studies at the University of Pennsylvania, earning a Ph.D. in sociology. Her dissertation was entitled \\"The Legal Position of Women in Pennsylvania\\"; it discussed the history of the women's movement in Pennsylvania and the rest of the U.S., and urged woman suffrage as the key issue of the day. Paul later received her law degree (LL.B) from the Washington College of Law at American University in 1922, after the suffrage fight was over. In 1927, she earned a master of laws degree, and in 1928, a doctorate in civil law from American University. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article. One interesting aspect is Alice Paul's transition from social work to political activism, as she believed that social work was not the best way for her to achieve change and fight injustice. Another interesting aspect is her involvement with the militant suffrage group, the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), in England, which led to her arrest and serving jail terms during suffrage demonstrations. Additionally, it is noteworthy that Paul had a strong educational background, earning multiple degrees in various fields including biology, political science, sociology, economics, and law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

Osman's son, Orhan, captured the northwestern Anatolian city of Bursa in 1324, and made it the new capital of the Ottoman state. This Ottoman conquest meant the loss of Byzantine control over northwestern Anatolia. The important city of Thessaloniki was captured from the Venetians in 1387. The Ottoman victory at Kosovo in 1389 effectively marked the end of Serbian power in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into Europe. The Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, widely regarded as the last large-scale crusade of the Middle Ages, failed to stop the advance of the victorious Ottoman Turks.

We want to find the value of 'i' (imagine 'i' as an ice cream) in this equation: -15*i + 13*i - 10 = 0 1. First, let's combine the ice creams: -15 ice creams (negative because someone took them away) and 13 ice creams (positive because you have them now). So: -15 ice creams + 13 ice creams = -2 ice creams Now the equation looks like this: -2*i - 10 = 0. 2. Let's add 10 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -10: -2*i - 10 + 10 = 0 + 10 -2*i = 10 3. Now, we just have -2 times the ice creams equal 10: -2*i = 10. We want to know how many ice creams 'i' is, so we need to divide both sides of the equation by -2: (-2*i) / -2 = 10 / -2 When we divide, we get: i = -5 So, the solution is that 'i', which represents the number of ice creams, equals -5.

Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \\"Cougars\\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday, as well as expelling players due to honor code violations. Beginning in the 2011 season, BYU football competes in college football as an independent. In addition, most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference. Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men's volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Water is absorbed through roots - Chloroplast cells in leaves contain chlorophyll - Chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight - Energy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen gets released into atmosphere - Hydrogen and carbon dioxide used to create glucose - Glucose is food for plants. The answer is:","completion":"The missing first step of the given process is: \\"Roots take in water and essential nutrients from the soil.\\" Justification of the steps: 1. Roots take in water and essential nutrients from the soil: The roots act as the plant's water and nutrient delivery system. They absorb water as well as essential nutrients and minerals from the soil. 2. Water is absorbed through roots: After the intake, roots transport water upwards to the rest of the plant, which eventually reaches the leaves. 3. Chloroplast cells in leaves contain chlorophyll: Chloroplast cells are specialized plant cells containing chlorophyll, the green pigment that traps sunlight to power photosynthesis. 4. Chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight: The chlorophyll in the chloroplasts absorbs the energy from sunlight, providing the necessary energy for the photosynthesis process. 5. Energy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen: The energy absorbed by chlorophyll is used to break the water molecules absorbed in step 2 into hydrogen and oxygen. 6. Oxygen gets released into the atmosphere: The oxygen byproduct created in the previous step is released into the atmosphere as a waste product. 7. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide used to create glucose: Hydrogen from step 5 and carbon dioxide from the environment are used in the Calvin cycle to create glucose, a simple sugar. 8. Glucose is food for plants: Glucose serves as a source of energy for the plant's metabolic processes and growth, completing the photosynthesis process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. expels Venezuelan diplomat in Miami By the CNN Wire Staff updated 12:33 PM EST, Sun January 8, 2012 Washington (CNN) -- Venezuela's consul general in Miami has been declared to be persona non grata and must leave the United States, a State Department spokesman said Sunday. Spokesman William Ostick declined to comment on specific details behind the decision to expel Livia Acosta Noguera, who has headed Venezuela's consulate in Miami since March 2011. The Venezuelan Embassy in Washington was informed of the decision Friday, the spokesman said in a written statement, and the State Department said Acosta must depart the United States by Tuesday. It was unclear Sunday whether she remained in the United States. Last month, a group of American lawmakers said they had \\"grave concerns\\" about Acosta and called for an investigation after the Spanish-language TV channel Univision aired a documentary alleging that she was among a group of Venezuelan and Iranian diplomats who expressed interest in an offer from a group of Mexican hackers to infiltrate the websites of the White House, the FBI, the Pentagon and U.S. nuclear plants. The evidence that the plot was real, according to Univision, are secret recordings with diplomats who ask questions about what the hackers can do and promise to send information to their governments. Univision interviewed a purported Mexican whistle-blower -- a student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico named Juan Carlos Munoz Ledo. The student told Univision he was recruited by a leftist professor who wanted to wage cyberattacks on the United States and its allies. Munoz told Univision he secretly recorded a meeting in 2008 with Acosta, who was then the cultural attache of the Venezuelan Embassy in Mexico. According to a recording Univision aired as part of its report, Acosta is heard saying that she can send the information gathered by the hackers straight to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Chavez has called the report \\"lies.\\" One of the Iranian diplomats told Univision that although he, indeed, was presented with a hacking plot by the Mexican group, he turned it down, in part because he thought they were CIA agents. In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last month, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Rep. David Rivera, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart and Rep. Albio Sires asked the State Department to require Acosta's \\"immediate departure\\" from the United States if the Univision report proved true. Last month a State Department spokesman said the United States did not know about the alleged plot, but that it found the Univision allegations \\"very disturbing.\\" However, \\"we don't have any information, at this point, to corroborate it,\\" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. CNN's Jill Dougherty, Juan Carlos Lopez and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.

Museum's for me tend to be something a tourist visits when discovering a new city. We had a work function here and it was quite delightful to visit this neat little museum tucked into the corner right adjacent to Old Montreal. We started off the day with a light breakfast in the upstairs cafeteria which consisted of eggs, fruit and some french toast. After you could go out on their balcony and get some views of the old port. On our day there was a cruise ship within eye's view! They have done an admirable job in keeping some of the history and original rock and brick of the past. Artifacts behind glass are nice to gaze at to think of how time was many hundreds of years ago! Next was a Pirate ship and tour and explanation for the kids which was done in interesting and curious fashion. Finishing off the trip was a visit to their 2-D theatre in which you get an 18 minute history lesson of Montreal (available in French, English and Spanish)! It's a nice finishing touch to make you leaving with a positive impression of Montreal. I'd recommend this as a tourist attraction but some may be disappointed as it's a small museum.

Tommy returns with his friend Allen Hawes, hoping to cremate Jason's body and stop his hallucinations. At the cemetery, they dig up Jason's corpse, but seeing it causes Tommy to snap, and he stabs Jason's body with a metal fence post. As he turns his back on Jason, two lightning bolts strike the post and revive the now-undead killer. Tommy tries to light the gasoline in which he has soaked Jason, but a sudden downpour prevents it. When Hawes tries to attack Jason with a shovel, the shovel breaks on impact and his heart is punched out. Tommy makes his way to the sheriff's office, when he panics and attempts to grab weapons, it gets him put into a jail cell. His warning that Jason has returned goes unheeded by Sheriff Garris, who is aware of Tommy's mental problems and thinks he is imagining Jason. On the road, camp counselors Darren and Lizbeth get lost looking for the camp and run into Jason. After they fail trying to frighten Jason off the road, he impales them both with the metal rod that resurrected him. The next morning, Garris' daughter Megan and her friends Sissy, Cort and Lizbeth's sister Paula ask him to search for Darren and Lizbeth. Tommy warns them about Jason, but as he is now considered an urban legend they ignore the warnings, though Megan finds herself attracted to him.

Tommy, along with Megan, head to the camp and find that Jason has already killed Paula, Sissy, and Cort. Realizing the danger the children at the camp are in, Tommy and Megan rush to protect them. As they do this, Jason suddenly appears and bursts through a window, but Tommy successfully lures him away from the children. Tommy plans to trap Jason in the lake, where he originally drowned, by tying a chain attached to a rock around his neck, effectively weighing him down to the bottom of the lake. Jason and Tommy face off on the lake's surface, engaging in a fierce battle with one another. Sheriff Garris also gets involved, trying to protect his daughter and the campers, but Jason kills him in the process. While Tommy struggles with the seemingly unstoppable killer, Megan comes to his assistance, managing to retrieve the chain and attach it to Jason's neck. With the heavy rock and chain weighing him down, Jason slowly sinks to the bottom of the lake, unable to escape. Tommy, injured by their battle, begins to drown as well, but Megan dives in to save him, slashing Jason's neck in the process. The distraction allows Megan to pull Tommy out of the water and bring him to safety. The two survivors watch as Jason writhes and struggles underwater, ultimately unable to break free from his watery prison. Despite the horrors they have experienced and the lives they have lost, Tommy and Megan now believe that Jason Voorhees is truly and finally defeated. As they recover from the ordeal, they look upon the lake, which will serve as an eternal tomb for the undead killer. However, as the camera pans to the depths of the water with Jason still restrained by the chain, the movie leaves an eerie hint that this might not be the end of Jason Voorhees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Deviating from standard practice, the US patent office has a policy of refusing to grant a patent without a working model for what type of device?","completion":"The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) deviates from standard practice and enforces a policy of refusing to grant patents without a working model for a specific type of device, known as a perpetual motion machine or a \\"free energy\\" device. This policy has been adopted as a means to prevent the grant of patents for unfeasible inventions that violate the fundamental laws of physics and perpetrate scientific fraud. Perpetual motion machines are hypothetical devices that operate indefinitely without an energy source or violate the laws of thermodynamics. Specifically, they defy the first law of thermodynamics, which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed; it can only change forms, and the second law of thermodynamics, which states that in any energy transfer or transformation, the total entropy of a closed system will always increase over time. As a result, these machines are considered impossible as they imply the creation of energy from nothing or the existence of a perpetual energy cycle that has zero energy loss, contrary to accepted scientific principles. Understanding that many inventors have made unsubstantiated claims regarding the invention of perpetual motion machines, the USPTO has implemented strict requirements when examining patent applications related to such devices. Inventors are required to submit a working model along with their patent application for review. This working model must be replicable and demonstrate that the proposed device operates as claimed, proving that it satisfies its perpetual motion claims. Providing a working model allows the USPTO to thoroughly review and analyze the device's functionality according to established scientific principles. By examining the model, patent examiners can verify if the invention merits a patent grant or if it simply defies accepted scientific theories. This policy serves to uphold the integrity of the patent system by ensuring that patents are only granted to inventions that demonstrate scientific plausibility and practical utility, conforming to the United States Code, Title 35, Section 101, which outlines criteria for patentable subject matter. Requiring a working model to accompany patent applications for perpetual motion machines ensures that the USPTO does not endorse the patenting of unproven, scientifically implausible, or fraudulent inventions that could undermine public trust in the institution and the broader scientific community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The given sentence in German states: \\"Neue Neuronen folgen dem Fluss der Cerebrospinalflüssigkeit im erwachsenen Gehirn.\\" In English, this translates to: \\"New neurons follow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the adult brain.\\" To provide a detailed explanation of the translated sentence: New neurons, also known as nerve cells, are the primary components of the nervous system that include the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. The process of new neuron generation is called neurogenesis, which predominantly occurs during embryonic development. However, in recent years, studies have shown that neurogenesis can also continue, to some extent, in specific regions of the adult brain. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless fluid that circulates within the ventricles (cavities) of the brain, the central canal of the spinal cord, and the subarachnoid space, which is a space between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It acts as a \\"cushion\\" for the brain and spinal cord, providing mechanical support, and plays a crucial role in maintaining the physiological homeostasis of the central nervous system. The statement that new neurons follow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the adult brain highlights the potential guidance and influence of this fluid on the migration and distribution of newly generated neurons. The flow of CSF may create a pathway for these cells to navigate or provide essential nutrients and signaling molecules that help regulate neuronal development and integration into existing neural networks. This migration of new neurons is a vital process for maintaining the proper functioning of specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation and learning. Furthermore, research exploring the relationship between neurogenesis and cerebrospinal fluid may provide valuable insights into the potential for enhancing cognitive function and developing new treatment strategies for neurological disorders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: There are many choices you can make to keep your nervous system healthy. One obvious choice is to avoid using alcohol or other drugs. Not only will you avoid the injury that drugs themselves can cause, but you will also be less likely to get involved in other risky behaviors that could harm your nervous system. Another way to keep the nervous system healthy is to eat a variety of healthy foods. The minerals sodium, calcium, and potassium, and vitamins B 1 and B 12 are important for a healthy nervous system. Some foods that are good sources for these minerals and vitamins include milk, whole grains, beef steak, and kidney beans (shown in Figure below ). Your brain also needs healthy fats like those in nuts and fish. Recall that fats insulate the axons of neurons. These fats help build new connections between nerves and brain cells. These fats may improve memory and increase learning and intelligence. Water is also important for the nervous system, so drink plenty of water and other fluids. This helps prevent dehydration, which can cause confusion and memory problems. And get plenty of rest. Your brain requires plenty of rest so it can strengthen circuits that help with memory. A good night’s sleep will help keep your brain functioning at its best. Q: Why is water important for the nervous system?

I always have stayed away from hospitals. People died or were born. But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time.

The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs.

Question: Does Stacie wish to keep the home after Laurel's death, or sell it? Movie plot title: Freeheld Movie plot: The film opens at a meeting of the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Ocean County, New Jersey in 2005. Ocean County resident and New Jersey police officer Lieutenant Laurel Hester, a 23-year veteran of the police force, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and expected to live only one year, she wishes to pass on her pension to her domestic partner of five years, Stacie Andree. Although New Jersey counties have the option to extend pension benefits to domestic partners, Ocean County Freeholders will not do this. In protest, the state's LGBT civil rights organization, Garden State Equality, organizes hundreds of people to speak out at each of the Freeholders' meetings. The crowds Garden State Equality organizes get bigger and more vociferous at each meeting.Among those speaking out are Laurel's police colleagues and Ocean County residents, describing Laurel's 25 years of exemplary work for the police department, and petitioning the Freeholders to allow her to pass on her pension to Stacie. Laurel's first police partner, Dane Wells, speaks about her and compares the situation to separate drinking fountains and seats at the back of the bus. Freeholder Joseph Vicari says that although they are \\"anguished\\" by Laurel's case, they are unable to change things because of state legislature and moves for an adjournment. The members of the public present are unhappy with this decision and some begin to chant \\"It's in your power\\".Outside the administration building, news reporter Ida Siegal explains the background to the case. In 2004 New Jersey passed the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act which allows all gay and lesbian state employees to pass on their benefits, including the pension, to their domestic live-in lovers/partners. According to Siegal, all New Jersey counties can choose whether or not to allow their employees to pass on benefits to their partners.

While Western states have allowed it for more than 50 years; eastern states amended their traffic laws to allow it in the 1970s as a fuel-saving measure in response to motor fuel shortages in 1973. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 required in §362(c)(5) that in order for a state to receive federal assistance in developing mandated conservation programs, they must permit right turns on red lights. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have allowed right turns on red since 1980, except where prohibited by a sign or where right turns are controlled by dedicated traffic lights.

No Sign Prohibiting the Turn: Ensure there is no sign explicitly prohibiting a right turn on red at the traffic signal. If a sign marked \\"No Turn on Red\\" or similar wording is displayed, you must abide by it and wait for a green signal. 2. Yield to Traffic and Pedestrians: Before proceeding with a right turn on a red light, you must come to a complete stop, yield to any oncoming traffic, and check for pedestrians crossing the street. Only when it is absolutely safe and clear should you initiate the turn. 3. Dedicated Right Turn Signal: In cases where a dedicated right turn signal is present, you must wait for the specific green arrow or signal to appear before initiating the right turn. Turning on a red arrow or red light in such instances is not permitted. 4. Right Turns on Red Arrows: While uncommon, some traffic signals operate with red arrows for right turns. Although turning right on a red arrow is generally prohibited, California law does allow it in specific situations. You must first stop and yield to oncoming traffic, then proceed with caution after ensuring no signs prohibit such a maneuver.

Clarke said he was 'a week ahead of schedule' with his recovery. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Mitchell Johnson and Michael Clarke's Injury Updates: A Tale of Two Hamstrings Recently, it has been announced that pace bowling powerhouse Mitchell Johnson will miss the fourth Test match due to a minor hamstring complaint. Fortunately, the injury does not appear to be serious, and Johnson is expected to make a full recovery in time for the One Day International (ODI) tri-series. Meanwhile, Australian cricket team captain Michael Clarke has had to withdraw from the Test series against India due to his ongoing hamstring injury, but is actively working on his recovery in hopes of participating in the early stages of the World Cup. Mitchell Johnson, a key player in the Australian bowling line-up, has been experiencing some hamstring discomfort and has decided to skip the upcoming fourth Test match to ensure his performance remains uncompromised during the ODI tri-series. As Johnson's injury is not considered severe, it is believed that a period of rest and recuperation will be enough to resolve the issue and see him fit and ready for the next cricket event. On the other hand, Michael Clarke has not had such a smooth journey towards recovery. The Australian captain suffered a significant hamstring injury during the first Test against India, and ever since then, there has been a constant struggle to manage and rehabilitate it. Being ruled out of the Test series against India was a blow for both Clarke and the Australian team, but the focus has now shifted to ensure that the star player can make a strong and successful return to international cricket. Clarke's presence and contribution on the field are invaluable, and his recent update on his fitness progress was a sigh of relief for the fans and the team. In a statement, Clarke mentioned that he is currently \\"a week ahead of schedule\\" with his recovery, which brings hope that he will be able to return to play in the early stages of the prestigious World Cup event. However, rushing his recovery might be disastrous; taking a cautious approach while aiming to be fit as soon as possible seems to be the best course of action. Both Johnson's and Clarke's injuries underline the risk and strain that professional cricket can put on the athletes. Although they are examples of different severities and stages, their situations showcase the importance of proper injury management, timely intervention, and ensuring that the players receive optimal rest and medical support. In conclusion, Mitchell Johnson's absence from the fourth Test match due to hamstring issues appears to be a precautionary measure, and fans can expect to see him in action during the upcoming ODI tri-series. As for Michael Clarke, his road to recovery is ongoing, with the captain optimistically hoping to return to the field during the early stages of the World Cup. The Australian cricket team will undoubtedly miss the prowess of these two key players, but their long-term health and readiness for future events must be the priority."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. The institution of marriage is unique. It is the one institution that binds women and men together to form a family, and this serves broad societal purposes. In California, a U.S. District Court Judge last week overturned Proposition 8, the California Marriage Protection Act. It was passed in November 2008 by California voters to recognize \\"only marriage between a man and a woman.\\" The majority of Californians, including two-thirds of the state's black voters, have just had their core civil right -- the right to vote -- stripped from them by an openly gay federal judge who has misread history and the Constitution to impose his views on the state's people. The implicit comparison Judge Vaughn Walker made between racism and opposition to same-sex marriage is particularly offensive to me and to all who remember the reality of Jim Crow. It is not bigotry, it is biology that discriminates between same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples. A marriage requires a husband and a wife, because these unions are necessary to make new life and connect children to their mother and father. Judge Walker's decision will not stand the test of time and history. Congress and the Supreme Court must act to protect all Americans' right to vote for marriage. Advocates of making same-sex marriage a legally recognized right claim that this will have no impact on traditional marriage -- that it can peacefully coexist alongside traditional marriage. On the contrary, it will have profound impacts. It will create a conflict for people of faith (and nonreligious people as well) who fervently believe in traditional man-woman marriage and the law. The Bible is so clear in its support of heterosexual marriage there is little need for us to go through an exhaustive definition of biblical marriage versus the types of unions allowed by law today. The Scriptures say in Genesis 2:24 that a man is to leave his family and cleave to his wife. This concept is repeated in Matthew 19:5 and Mark 10:7. All the scriptures in the Bible concerning marriage presuppose heterosexual marriage. We can teach our kids that there are important spiritual and societal reasons to believe in traditional marriage and oppose same-sex marriage. But if same-sex marriage becomes legally recognized across the country, our kids will be told that gay marriage is a civil rights issue and that those who oppose it are akin to the racists of history who opposed interracial marriage and supported slavery. We can teach our children at home that marriage is between a man and a woman, but our children's public schools will teach them that marriage includes same-sex couples. Both would be \\"equal marriages\\" under the law. What might this look like? In Massachusetts, where a ruling legalized same-sex marriage in 2004, kids in public schools are reading books depicting same-sex families. At a California charter school in 2008, kindergartners' parents objected when a school newsletter alerted them to \\"National Coming Out Day;\\" a parent told a local ABC-TV affiliate that a teacher at the school screened a film to kindergartners the previous year showing gay families. These kinds of ill-advised social experiments may produce a host of unexpected consequences. If gay marriage is allowed, the nation will soon begin to experience an increased degradation of the nuclear family -- resulting in fewer kids being raised by both a mom and a dad. Beyond that, those of us who believe in traditional marriage and are in a regulated profession -- such as counselor, physician, attorney or accountant -- and act in concert with our beliefs, may be vulnerable to losing our professional license and our livelihood. We can be a religious charity faithfully fulfilling our mission by serving our community, such as by providing adoption and other services, but if we refuse to provide those services to a same-sex couple, we have the choice of abandoning our beliefs or ending our mission. In 2003, Adoption.com was sued by two California homosexual men, who claimed illegal discrimination because the agency refused to serve homosexual couples. The agency lost the lawsuit and no longer serves adoptive parents in California. An even more substantive danger lies in the consequences of gay marriage on the next generation. Redefining marriage redefines family. Changing the concept of family will change both the definition and the pattern of parenting. What will the landscape of America look like if same-sex marriage is legalized across our nation? Social scientists report what most Americans have always known: Both boys and girls are deeply affected in biological and psychological ways by the presence of their fathers. If the American family loses the presence of the birth dad in the home, there will be huge consequences to the growth and stability of the next generation of children in that family. For example, repeatedly, scholarly studies focused on adolescence show that early onset of puberty in girls is associated with negative psychological, social, and health problems including depression, alcohol consumption, and higher teenage pregnancy. An eight-year study of girls and their families showed that a father's presence in the home, with appropriate involvement in his children's lives, contributed to daughters' reaching puberty at a later age. Despite the incredible adaptability of children, our entire culture should advocate for family structures that promote the most positive environments for coming generations. In addition to fighting the marriage redefinition, leaders from all sectors of our culture, including our churches, must work hard at improving heterosexual marriages. Counseling, modeling, and interventions are needed to help ailing marriages. Both battles must be fought if our families, which are the incubators of future societal greatness, are to be protected. Let's set our sights high. Let's not fall victim to the circling argument of our opposition.

The investing genius made an eye-popping 37 million a day in 2013 - that's 1.5 million an hour - simply watching the shares in his conglomerate soar by more than 25 per cent. The Berkshire Hathaway boss' net worth bounced 12.7 billion to 59.1 billion over the period, making him the billionaire who made the most cash this year, according to a new survey. Battling it out: Warren Buffett, left, made 37million a day in 2013 - that's 1.5million an HOUR - bringing his eye-popping net worth to 59billion but Bill Gates, right, still tops the list of the world's richest people. But even with his staggering money-making, Buffett, who lives a notoriously humble existence despite his billions, only came second on the list of the world's Top 10 richest people, compiled by Wealth-X. Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates took the top spot for another year, with a total net worth of 72.6 billion, up from 61.1 billion in 2012. Gates' impressive gain saw him come second to Buffett in the gains stakes, and in third place was casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who's worth an estimated 35.3 billion this year after raking in 11.4 billion from his gambling houses in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore.

This period marked a series of experiments in conservation, reforestation, and efforts to increase rainfall on the island. These environmental interventions were closely linked to the conceptualization of the processes of environmental change and helped establish the roots of environmentalism. Saint Helena, a remote island located in the South Atlantic Ocean, experienced significant deforestation due to human activities, such as the introduction of non-native species and the overexploitation of natural resources. This led to a decrease in rainfall and a decline in the island's biodiversity, raising concerns among scientists and officials about the long-term sustainability of the island. To address this issue, multiple artificial rainfall enhancement techniques were explored. One technique was cloud seeding, which involved dispersing particles or chemicals into the atmosphere to encourage the formation of rain clouds. Another method was the construction of fog fences to capture water droplets from the fog and channel the captured moisture into the ground to irrigate plants and replenish groundwater supplies. In addition, the island's reforestation efforts aimed to restore native vegetation. The reestablishment of healthy ecosystems could promote a more favorable microclimate, leading to an increase in local precipitation. These projects aimed at reversing the island's desertification and transforming it into a more sustainable habitat. The experiments conducted on Saint Helena laid the groundwork for environmentalism and the understanding of human-induced environmental change. It provided valuable insights into the complex relationship between ecosystems, climate, and human activity. Through these efforts, scientists and environmentalists developed new strategies for environmental management and conservation, contributing to a broader awareness of the importance of sustainable land use and preservation of our planet's resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Kyphosis is a medical condition that affects the human spine, specifically the thoracic region, which is the upper and middle part of the back. This condition is characterized by an exaggerated forward rounding or curvature of the spine, often referred to as a \\"humpback\\" or \\"dowager's hump\\" appearance. In a healthy spine, there is a natural curve in the thoracic region that allows for flexibility, balance, and shock absorption. However, when this curvature becomes more pronounced than normal, it results in kyphosis. There are several types and causes of kyphosis, including: 1. Postural kyphosis: This is the most common form of kyphosis, often seen in adolescents and young adults, and is primarily caused by poor posture and slouching. In most cases, it is mild and can be corrected through physical therapy and practicing good posture. 2. Scheuermann's kyphosis: This type of kyphosis occurs in adolescents during growth spurts and is thought to be caused by abnormal growth of the vertebrae, leading to a more rigid and exaggerated curvature. Bracing or surgical intervention may be required in severe cases. 3. Congenital kyphosis: This rare form of kyphosis is present at birth and is caused by abnormal development of the spinal column during pregnancy. Depending on the severity, infants may require surgical intervention to prevent complications and developmental issues. 4. Osteoporosis-related kyphosis: As people age, their bone density can decrease, resulting in osteoporosis. This can lead to compression fractures in the vertebrae, causing the spine to curve forward progressively. Treatment often includes medications to improve bone density and bracing to support the spine. 5. Degenerative kyphosis: This form of kyphosis results from wear and tear on the spine over time due to aging or conditions like arthritis that cause gradual degeneration of the intervertebral discs and facet joints. Treatment varies depending on the severity and may include pain management, physical therapy, or surgery. Kyphosis can have various effects on the body, ranging from mild discomfort and cosmetic concerns to more severe issues like chronic pain, reduced mobility, and difficulty breathing. Treatment for kyphosis is primarily based on the severity of the condition and the underlying cause. In mild cases, conservative treatment options like physical therapy, postural training, and pain management are often sufficient. In more severe cases or when the condition is progressive, more aggressive treatments such as bracing or surgical intervention may be necessary. Diagnosis of kyphosis typically involves a thorough physical examination, assessment of medical history, and imaging tests like X-rays, CT scans, or MRI to evaluate the degree of curvature and potential causes. Early detection and intervention are essential for addressing the underlying issues and preventing long-term complications that can be associated with this spinal deformity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lieutenant Commander Ken White orders the submarine Tiger Shark to dive to evade an aerial and surface attack. Crewman Boyer begs him to wait for the captain, Commander Josh Rice, still topside, but White refuses, and Rice (his good friend) and the quartermaster are lost. When they resurface shortly afterward, they discover that the war is over. No one other than Boyer, not even the captain's widow and father, blames him. White marries Carol and remains in the Navy after the war. Everything is fine, until one day he is assigned to show a reporter around who is doing a story about the mothballed Navy.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Tatchell was born in Melbourne, Australia. His father was a lathe operator and his mother worked in a biscuit factory. His parents divorced when he was four and his mother remarried soon afterwards. Since the family finances were strained by medical bills, he had to leave school at 16 in 1968. Context: To avoid conscription into the Australian Army, Tatchell moved to London in 1971. He had accepted being gay in 1969, and in London became a leading member of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) until its 1974 collapse. During this time Tatchell was prominent in organising sit-ins at pubs that refused to serve \\"poofs\\" and protests against police harassment and the medical classification of homosexuality as an illness. With others he helped organise Britain's first Gay Pride march in 1972. In 1973, he attended the 10th World Youth Festival in East Berlin on GLF's behalf. His actions triggered opposition within and between different groups of national delegates including the Communist Party of Great Britain and National Union of Students. He was banned from conferences, had his leaflets confiscated and burned, was interrogated by the secret police (the Stasi) and threatened and assaulted by other delegates, mostly communists. Tatchell later claimed that this was the first time gay liberation politics were publicly disseminated and discussed in a communist country, although he noted that, in terms of decriminalisation and the age of consent, gay men had greater rights in East Germany at the time than in Britain and much of the West. Describing his time in the Gay Liberation Front, he wrote in The Guardian that: [The] GLF was a glorious, enthusiastic and often chaotic mix of anarchists, hippies, leftwingers, feminists, liberals and counter-culturalists. Despite our differences, we shared a radical idealism - a dream of what the world could and should be - free from not just homophobia but the whole sex-shame culture, which oppressed straights as much as LGBTs. We were sexual liberationists and social revolutionaries, out to turn the world upside down. [...] GLF's main aim was never equality within the status quo. [...] GLF's strategy for queer emancipation was to change society's values and norms, rather than adapt to them. We sought a cultural revolution to overturn centuries of male heterosexual domination and thereby free both queers and women. [...] Forty years on, GLF's gender agenda has been partly won. [...] Girlish boys and boyish girls don't get victimised as much as in times past. LGBT kids often now come out at the age of 12 or 14. While many are bullied, many others are not. The acceptance of sexual and gender diversity is increasing. Question: What was the ideology of the GLF?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The Gay Liberation Front (GLF)'s ideology was much more than simply seeking legal rights for gay individuals. It was a radical movement aimed at societal transformation to challenge and overturn deeply ingrained norms, biases and systemic patterns of discrimination about sexuality and gender roles. The GLF was a diverse assembly of people, including anarchists, hippies, left-wingers, feminists, liberals, and counter-culturalists, all united in their shared idealistic vision of a world free from sexual shamings and oppressions that impacted not just LGBT+ individuals but also straight people. The main aim of the GLF, as described by Tatchell, was not merely equality within existing societal paradigms, but rather it was about causing a cultural revolution, challenging and changing the basic values and norms of society. The members did not just want to adapt to existing societal norms but wished to fundamentally transform them. This transformative ideology of the GLF was focused on ending centuries of male heterosexual domination so that all sexual orientations and genders could experience freedom and equality. In essence, the GLF sought liberation through liberation; it aimed at creating a society where sexual orientation and gender identity were no longer sources of shame or discrimination. It strove for attitudinal and institutional changes, changing the way people thought about and treated homosexuality, advocating for acceptance of sexual and gender diversity, and, crucially, working towards the rights and safety of 'girlish boys and boyish girls', as well as LGBT+ kids in general. This ideology of the GLF would succeed in accomplishing considerable progress over the years—a fact that is apparent from the increased acceptance of sexual and gender diversity in present times compared to past eras. It is notably visible in the greater freedom with which LGBT+ kids now come out and the lower rates of victimisation they face. However, Tatchell did mention that their goal had only been \\"partly won\\", indicating there's still work to do."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Movie plot: The story is told in flashback by a villager, played by Mervyn Johns, as though to a person visiting after the war. He recounts: one Saturday during the Second World War, a group of seemingly authentic British soldiers arrive in the small, fictitious English village of Bramley End.[1] It is the Whitsun weekend so life is even quieter than usual and there is almost no traffic of any kind. At first they are welcomed by the villagers, until doubts begin to grow about their true purpose and identity. After they are revealed to be German soldiers intended to form the vanguard of an invasion of Britain, they round up the residents and hold them captive in the local church. The vicar is shot after sounding the church bell in alarm. In attempts to reach the outside world, many of the villagers take action. Such plans include writing a message on an egg and giving them to the local paper boy for his mother, but they are crushed when Mrs Fraser's cousin runs over them. Mrs Fraser then puts a note in Cousin Maude's pocket, but she uses it to hold her car window in place; her dog, Edward, then chews it to shreds after it blows onto the back seat. Mrs Collins, the postmistress, manages to kill a German with an axe used for chopping firewood, and tries to telephone elsewhere. The girls on the exchange see her light and decide that she can wait. Mrs Collins waits until she is killed by another German who walks into the shop moments afterwards. The girl at the exchange then picks up the phone, getting no reply. The civilians attempt to escape to warn the local Home Guard, but are betrayed by the village squire, who is revealed to be collaborating with the Germans. Members of the local Home Guard are ambushed and shot by the Germans. They begin to bow in until a young boy, George, succeeds in escaping; despite being shot in the leg, he alerts the army. British soldiers arrive, and â aided by some of the villagers, including a group of Women's Land Army girls, who have managed to escape, barricade themselves in, and arm...

The choice of adjectives used to describe the film - \\"kind,\\" \\"unapologetic,\\" and \\"sweetheart\\" - all point towards a favorable review. These descriptors suggest that the movie left a warm and positive impression on the critic. To dissect the review further and better understand the critic's positive outlook, we can analyze each adjective individually: 1. \\"Kind\\": This adjective implies that the movie had a gentle and caring nature to it. The film may have shown characters who treat each other with respect and understanding, or it could have illustrated a nurturing environment or theme. Overall, the critic likely found the movie's kind-heartedness to be a positive aspect. 2. \\"Unapologetic\\": This term suggests that the movie did not shy away from expressing its message or portraying its characters and story authentically. The critic may have appreciated the film's boldness in tackling certain themes or issues without holding back or trying to please every viewer. Unapologetic movies often resonate with their audience and are memorable for their commitment to their vision, which the critic seems to recognize. 3. \\"Sweetheart\\": This term, often reserved for those we find endearing or charming, indicates that the movie might have had an emotional impact on the critic. It suggests that the critic felt a connection with the story or characters and found the overall experience to be quite lovely. The use of \\"sweetheart\\" as a descriptor shows a strong affinity for the film. In summary, the critic thought positively of the movie. The review highlights the film's kind nature, its unapologetic approach to storytelling, and the charm that it exuded, which together create a heartwarming and positive impression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article using the following points: 'They could triple the national debt on these programs and it would still be impossible to challenge them,' complains a Republican congressional aide. Food stamp program paid out 2.4 billion is shouldn't have between October 2013 and August 2014. National School Lunch Program doled out 1.7 billion extra. National School Breakfast Program spent 923 million unnecessarily – accounting for more than one-quarter of its expenses. The popular Women, Infants and Children nutrition assistance program also misspent 206 million.","completion":"Title: The Issue of Misspent Government Funds in Nutrition Assistance Programs Introduction Nutrition assistance programs play a crucial role in alleviating food insecurity, poverty and malnutrition across the United States. However, in recent years, there have been increasing concerns about the effective utilization of public resources dedicated to these programs. Critics argue that the government's poor oversight and management practices have resulted in considerable wastage of taxpayers' money, undermining the effectiveness and sustainability of these essential public services. This article examines the scale and nature of this problem, focusing on four major federal initiatives – the Food Stamp Program, the National School Lunch Program, the National School Breakfast Program, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) nutrition assistance program. Food Stamp Program Between October 2013 and August 2014, the Food Stamp Program - now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - misspent a staggering 2.4 billion. This raises serious questions about the efficiency, accountability, and appropriateness of resource allocation in this vital initiative designed to enhance access to healthy food for millions of low-income families. National School Lunch Program The National School Lunch Program (NSLP), another major government effort to combat hunger, also exhibited questionable financial practices. In the same period, an extra 1.7 billion was doled out by the program. This level of over expenditure is concerning, especially considering the program's fundamental objective of providing nutritious, affordable meals to school-going children from disadvantaged backgrounds. National School Breakfast Program The National School Breakfast Program (NSBP) has shown comparable financial mismanagement and inefficiencies. The program spent an unnecessary 923 million during the specified timeframe, accounting for more than one-quarter of its expenses. As a program aimed at promoting healthy eating habits among children during their early years, it is disheartening to see such a significant amount of resources being wasted. Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Assistance Program Lastly, the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which targets low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women, as well as infants and children up to the age of five, misspent an additional 206 million. Like the other programs mentioned, WIC was established with the noble intention of improving the nutritional and health status of vulnerable groups in society. However, the improper distribution of resources threatens to derail its progress and compromise its overall effectiveness. Conclusion As one Republican congressional aide lamented, \\"They could triple the national debt on these programs, and it would still be impossible to challenge them,\\" highlighting the magnitude of the problem faced by these nutrition assistance programs. The misspent funds are not only a burden on taxpayers but also an impediment to delivering vital services to individuals and families who depend on them to maintain their health and well-being. Addressing the issue of financial mismanagement and waste in these initiatives should be a top priority for policymakers and administrators. This calls for rigorous evaluations, appropriate oversight, and transparent budgeting processes to ensure that public resources are allocated efficiently and effectively. The success and sustainability of these programs depend on our ability to eradicate financial inefficiencies and direct every dollar toward the betterment of those in need."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter.

Samuel Cook (January 22, 1931 - December 11, 1964), known professionally as Sam Cooke, was an American singer, songwriter, and entrepreneur. Influential as both a singer and composer, he is commonly known as the King of Soul for his distinctive vocals and importance within popular music. He began singing as a child and joined The Soul Stirrers before moving to a solo career where he scored a string of hit songs like \\"You Send Me\\", \\"Wonderful World\\", \\"Chain Gang\\", and \\"Twistin' the Night Away\\". Cooke was born Samuel Cook in Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 1931. In 1957 he added an \\"e\\" at the end of his name to signify a new start to his life. He was the fifth of eight children of the Rev. Charles Cook, a minister in the Church of Christ (Holiness), and his wife, Annie Mae. One of his younger brothers, L.C. (1932-2017), later became a member of the doo-wop band Johnny Keyes and the Magnificents. The family moved to Chicago in 1933. Cooke attended Doolittle Elementary and Wendell Phillips Academy High School in Chicago, the same school that Nat \\"King\\" Cole had attended a few years earlier. Sam Cooke began his career with his siblings in a group called the Singing Children when he was six years old. He first became known as lead singer with the Highway QC's when he was a teenager, having joined the group at the age of 14. During this time, Cooke befriended fellow gospel singer and neighbor Lou Rawls, who sang in a rival gospel group. In 1950, Cooke replaced gospel tenor R. H. Harris as lead singer of the gospel group the Soul Stirrers, founded by Harris, who had signed with Specialty Records on behalf of the group. Their first recording under Cooke's leadership was the song \\"Jesus Gave Me Water\\" in 1951. They also recorded the gospel songs \\"Peace in the Valley\\", \\"How Far Am I from Canaan?\\", \\"Jesus Paid the Debt\\" and \\"One More River\\", among many others, some of which he wrote. Cooke was often credited for bringing gospel music to the attention of a younger crowd of listeners, mainly girls who would rush to the stage when the Soul Stirrers hit the stage just to get a glimpse of Cooke. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How did he get his career started?","completion":"Sam Cooke got his career started by singing as a child and initially joining a group called the Singing Children when he was six years old.

Pay attention to the girl's body language and facial expressions while you are speaking. If she leans in towards you, maintains eye contact, and smiles frequently, these can be signs that she is interested in what you have to say. She may also react positively with a nod or laugh when you say something amusing. Step 2: Notice if she initiates conversations or tries to spend time with you. Girls who like you may try to engage in conversation with you more often than others. If she frequently starts conversations with you, asks for your opinion, or tries to spend time with you during breaks or after school, these can be signs that she is interested in you. Step 3: Observe how she interacts with others. To make sure that her attention to you is not just friendly behavior, compare her interactions with you to her interactions with others. If she appears to give you more attention or seems more enthusiastic when talking to you compared to others, it can be a sign that she likes you. Step 4: Look for any signs of flirting. Girls may flirt with someone they like by teasing them, engaging in playful banter, or making subtle physical contact. They may also give compliments or make subtle attempts to show their interest. Step 5: Ask for a friend's opinion. Sometimes it can be helpful to consult a friend that who knows the both of you to give their insight on whether they believe the girl likes you. A third-party perspective can help to provide additional information and context. Step 6: Get to know her better. If you suspect that she may like you, spend more time getting to know her on a personal level. Discover her interests, hobbies, and values to find common ground and build a stronger connection. This will also help you gauge her interest in you. Step 7: Observe if her behavior changes over time. If her attention towards you remains consistent or even increases over time, it is more likely that she likes you.

The law had never been able to break up the Preacher's drug operation, even though it was notorious as the biggest in Texas. \\"How'd they do it?\\" \\"It's very hush-hush,\\" he said, steam from his coffee making his hair seem to ripple. \\"They squelched the story at the papers, hoping to pull in a couple more fish, I guess.

Avoid low cut or skin-revealing clothing. Go for close-toed shoes with good support.","completion":"Title: Building A Professional Wardrobe for School: Dressing Appropriately and Comfortably Introduction: Creating a professional wardrobe for school doesn't have to be a daunting task. With a bit of research and some smart decisions, you can achieve a trendy and comfortable look that adheres to your school's dress code. This article will guide you through the essential steps and offer advice for building an efficient wardrobe that proves both stylish and appropriate. Step 1: Discover Your School's Dress Code Before you start shopping, it's important to understand the specific dress code set by your school. Find out if there are any restrictions or specific requirements that you need to adhere to. This information can usually be found in the school handbook, on the school's website, or by asking a guidance counselor or teacher. Step 2: Invest in Staple Items Once you know the guidelines, focus on building your wardrobe around a few staple items. A pair of comfortable dress pants and a versatile blazer are essential for any professional wardrobe. These can be mixed and matched with a variety of tops to create different looks that are appropriate for school. Step 3: Choose Breathable Fabrics As you'll be wearing these clothes for extended periods, it's crucial to opt for breathable and comfortable fabrics. Look for dress shirts and tops made from materials like cotton, linen, or moisture-wicking synthetic blends. These fabrics will help to keep you cool and dry throughout the day. Step 4: Easy Washing and Cleaning Select clothing that is simple to wash and maintain, as you'll need to keep your professional wardrobe in tip-top condition. Avoid items that require dry cleaning or special care, and instead, go for machine-washable and wrinkle-resistant options. Step 5: Abide by Modesty Guidelines While you may see many fashionable and trendy clothing options available, it's critical to keep your school's dress code in mind. Avoid any low cut, skin-revealing, or provocative clothing. Stick to conservative and modest options, as they will ensure that you adhere to the dress code and project a professional image. Step 6: Opt for Supportive Shoes Footwear is often overlooked, but it plays a significant role in your overall comfort and professional appearance. Opt for close-toed shoes with good support, such as loafers, flats, or Oxfords. Avoid high heels, as they can be uncomfortable and cause health issues in the long run. Always consider the school's specific dress code when selecting footwear. Conclusion: Building a professional wardrobe for school may seem challenging, but by adhering to your institution's dress code and focusing on comfort, you can create an efficient and stylish wardrobe. By following these steps and prioritizing investable staple items, breathable fabrics, easy-to-clean clothes, modesty, and supportive shoes, you'll be ready to tackle any school day feeling confident and comfortable in your professional attire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Contract talks are not scheduled and none have been held since June when new city manager Jeff Fielding arrived","completion":"This situation is about the contract negotiations between London's outside workers, who are employees responsible for various public services such as maintenance, waste management, and transportation services, and the city officials. The workers' contract expired eight months ago, but they have not yet been able to secure a new deal. This has led to a prolonged period of uncertainty for the workers, as they are unsure of their job security, benefits, and future prospects within their current roles. The primary reason for the lack of progress is the absence of any scheduled contract talks between the two parties. In fact, no contract negotiations have taken place since June, which is when the new city manager, Jeff Fielding, took office. It is likely that Fielding is focused on other pressing issues or has different priorities in his new role, which has led to the contract dispute with outside workers being pushed to the side. This situation has several implications for both the outside workers and London as a city. Without a new contract in place, there could be potential impacts on employee morale, their motivation to continue working in their current roles, and an increased likelihood of labor disputes or strike actions, which could disrupt essential services. For the outside workers, not having a new contract in place means that they are not receiving any negotiated pay increases, benefits, or improved working conditions that they may have been anticipating. This can create a sense of frustration among employees, who may feel that their work is undervalued and that their needs are not being considered or respected by city officials. Additionally, employees may be concerned about job security in the absence of a contract. They may worry that their positions are not guaranteed and that they could be subject to sudden changes in their employment status or working conditions. This uncertainty can lead to a decrease in job satisfaction and overall well-being, as well as negatively affecting the climate within the workplace. For the city of London, the lack of a new contract for outside workers could pose several risks. First and foremost, there is the potential for disruptions to essential city services if workers were to go on strike as a result of the ongoing contract dispute. These disruptions could impact the daily lives of London residents, affecting public transport, waste management, and maintenance of public spaces, among other services. Furthermore, with the contract negotiations stalled, London may struggle to attract and retain the best talent in these roles, as potential employees may be deterred by the job insecurity and the perceived lack of investment in employee well-being. This could result in a shortage of skilled outside workers, negatively impacting London's ability to provide high-quality public services to its residents. In conclusion, this situation involves contract negotiations between London's outside workers and city officials, specifically the new city manager, Jeff Fielding. The workers have been without a new contract for eight months, with no scheduled contract talks in sight. This lack of progress could have negative implications for employee morale, job security, and service disruptions, which could ultimately affect the quality of public services delivered to the residents of London. It is in the best interest of both parties to prioritize resolving this issue and establish a new contract that benefits both the outside workers and the city as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505.

The Discovery Expedition of 1901–04, known officially as the British National Antarctic Expedition, was the first official British exploration of the Antarctic regions since James Clark Ross's voyage sixty years earlier. Organized on a large scale under a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), the new expedition carried out scientific research and geographical exploration in what was then largely an untouched continent. It launched the Antarctic careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, including Robert Falcon Scott who led the expedition, Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, Tom Crean and William Lashly. Its scientific results covered extensive ground in biology, zoology, geology, meteorology and magnetism.

In a petri dish, marked Cell X, Gary sees that substances inside the cell are spreading apart from each other making it less concentrated. In the dish marked Cell Y, Gary sees substances coming together and moving into close proximity to one another. and a hint : Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy. The energy comes from the molecule named ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The energy allows special transport proteins called pumps to move substances to areas of higher concentration. An example is the sodium-potassium pump. Please answer this question : Is cell Y moving up or down the concentration gradient? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Cell Y is moving up the concentration gradient. This is because substances in Cell Y are coming together and moving into close proximity to one another, resulting in a higher concentration. This process requires extra energy and is the opposite of diffusion, which is moving down the concentration gradient. In this case, energy from ATP is used to power transport proteins, like pumps, to move substances to areas of higher concentration, such as in Cell Y."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the first names of the people who travelled extensively in Europe? ? In February 1953 Vaughan Williams and Ursula were married. He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London. It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of \\"O taste and see\\" from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey. Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as \\"like a musical state occasion\\".Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata Hodie (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the Ten Blake Songs (1957) for voice and oboe, \\"a masterpiece of economy and precision\\". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, Thomas the Rhymer. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled Sinfonia antartica—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli. The Ninth, premiered at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert...

As more details regarding the incident come to light, it becomes apparent that the horrific accident was even worse than initially reported. This article will delve into the circumstances of the accident, the history of the waterslide, and the testimonies of park visitors who have faced similar dangers on the ride. The Incident Caleb Schwab ─ son of Kansas lawmaker Scott Schwab ─ was among the riders on the 168-foot \\"Verruckt\\" slide at the Schlitterbahn park. Early investigations revealed that he died from a \\"fatal neck injury.\\" However, lately, a source informed the Associated Press (AP) that the young boy was actually decapitated during the accident. Although the authorities have launched an investigation, the cause of the accident remains unexplained. Previous Concerns and Issues Following the tragic event, several park visitors have come forward with their experiences on the Verruckt waterslide. The Kansas City Star reported a range of problems faced by riders, including loose restraints and flying rafts. Dawn Gentry shared that on July 27, she and her daughter were on the slide when their raft flew off the tracks during the ride's second drop, causing the lifeguards to panic. Gentry stated that she had the impression that it had happened before. Another visitor, Sara Craig, recounted her experiences after the park reopened, stating that when she went down the slide a few weeks ago with her son and his friend, she found the ride to be \\"very, very rough.\\" She mentioned that her Velcro shoulder restraint had come off during her first trip down the slide. Craig also shared that operators allowed her group to use the waterslide with a combined weight of 393 pounds, below the 400-pound minimum required for a safe ride. Calls for Safety and Accountability The tragic death of Caleb Schwab has raised an ongoing discussion about the safety and oversight of amusement park rides. Safety experts and the concerned public are now demanding stronger regulations and a more comprehensive examination of existing safety protocols both at the Schlitterbahn park and other amusement parks nationwide. While the investigations continue, families and park enthusiasts alike are left wondering what powers they have to hold park operators accountable for maintaining the ride safety and preventing further tragedies from occurring. Conclusion The heartbreaking incident involving Caleb Schwab is a stark reminder of the potential dangers associated with amusement park rides. It alerts park operators, local authorities, and the public about the critical importance of prioritizing safety measures, establishing a strong regulatory framework, and creating a culture of vigilance and accountability. It is only through these combined efforts that we can prevent such unspeakable tragedies from recurring in the future and ensure that our amusement parks remain a source of fun and excitement instead of fear and loss."},{"prompt":"The swinging doors slammed open.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many more people are there than housing units?","completion":"Title: The Surplus of People: A Closer Look at the Growing Gap Between Population and Housing Units Introduction The global population has seen a continuous surge over the past few decades, resulting in an increased demand for housing units. However, this demand has not always been met with an equal supply of adequate housing solutions. This article aims to explore the disparity between the number of people and available housing units and to answer the question: How many more people are there than housing units? Step 1: Collecting Data To begin this analysis, it would be essential to gather accurate data on both the global population and housing units from reliable sources. Databases such as the World Bank, Worldometer, or the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) can provide current numbers on population, while statistics on housing units may be found from national housing ministries, the International Housing Partnership (IHP), or the World House Price Index (WHPI). Step 2: Analyzing the Data With reliable data at hand, we can proceed to compare the numbers. Comparing the total number of people with the total number of housing units will give us an overall perspective of the existing gap. To accentuate this understanding, we could compute the ratio of people to housing units – a higher ratio would suggest that there are more people than housing units. It is essential to consider factors such as urbanization and population density when interpreting this ratio. Moving beyond a global level, a country or regional analysis would offer detailed insights into the disparity between population and housing units, taking factors such as income distribution, affordability of housing, and migration into account. This ensures a more accurate and holistic perspective. Step 3: Identifying Causes It's important to understand the factors contributing to this disparity. Possible reasons could include a lack of investment in infrastructure, slow housing construction rates, or regulatory restrictions that hinder the availability of residential land for development. Furthermore, population growth could be contributing to the lack of housing units, putting a strain on already limited resources. Identifying the causes allows us to understand how the gap between people and housing units arises and persists. Step 4: Addressing the Situation As the disparity between population and housing units directly affects the quality of life for millions and exacerbates issues like homelessness and overcrowding, it is vital to work towards viable solutions. Governments, local bodies, and the private sector can collaborate to implement policies and initiatives that address the housing crisis. This could include increasing investment in affordable housing, streamlining building regulations, and promoting sustainable construction practices that can keep up with the growing population. Conclusion While it is difficult to provide a precise numerical difference between the number of people and housing units worldwide without access to real-time data, the gap undoubtedly exists and continues to grow. Governments and other stakeholders must urgently address this issue to ensure that everyone has access to a safe, secure, and affordable place to call home."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Next, I focused on the specific elements related to the main question: Did the author speak continually while eating? 3. I found two relevant pieces of information in the text: The author mentioned that they ate dinner with their parents and that they never stopped when they talked with their friend. 4. I then reasoned that the phrase \\"never stopped\\" when they talked with their friend implies that there was a continuous conversation between the author and their friend throughout the evening. 5. However, the text does not specifically mention if the author continued talking while eating, as it only mentioned dinner with the parents. 6.

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is nucleotide that stores genetic information. DNA contains deoxyribose (so-called because it has one less atom of oxygen than ribose) plus one phosphate group and one nitrogen-containing base. The “choices” of base for DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic code as protein. RNA contains ribose, one phosphate group, and one nitrogen-containing base, but the “choices” of base for RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil. The nitrogen-containing bases adenine and guanine are classified as purines. A purine is a nitrogen-containing molecule with a double ring structure, which accommodates several nitrogen atoms. The bases cytosine, thymine (found in DNA only) and uracil (found in RNA only) are pyramidines. A pyramidine is a nitrogen-containing base with a single ring structure Bonds formed by dehydration synthesis between the pentose sugar of one nucleic acid monomer and the phosphate group of another form a “backbone,” from which the components’ nitrogen-containing bases protrude. In DNA, two such backbones attach at their protruding bases via hydrogen bonds. These twist to form a shape known as a double helix (Figure 2.29). The sequence of nitrogen-containing bases within a strand of DNA form the genes that act as a molecular code instructing cells in the assembly of amino acids into proteins. Humans have almost 22,000 genes in their DNA, locked up in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which lose their nuclei during development).

After pulling the engine apart, he will have likely discovered the specific issues that led to the engine malfunction. His next steps will involve carefully examining each component to identify any damage, wear, or faults that need to be addressed. To repair the engine effectively, Alex will need to carry out the following steps: 1. Clean and inspect all the parts: To ensure a thorough repair, Alex should clean each part of the engine to remove any dirt, debris, or build-up that could be affecting its functionality. He will also inspect each component for signs of damage or wear, making note of any parts that will need to be replaced or repaired. 2. Replace or repair damaged parts: Depending on the extent of damage, Alex may be able to repair certain components, such as grinding down a worn shaft or re-threading a stripped bolt hole. However, severely damaged or worn parts should be replaced entirely to ensure reliable engine performance. 3. Check and adjust clearances: While reassembling the engine, Alex needs to ensure the correct clearances for components such as valves, pistons, and connecting rods. Proper clearances are essential to prevent unwanted friction, component wear, and other issues. 4. Inspect and replace gaskets and seals: Alex should inspect all the gaskets and seals, which play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of individual components by preventing fluid leaks and maintaining pressure. If any gaskets or seals appear to be damaged, brittle, or worn, Alex will need to replace them before reassembling the engine. 5. Reassemble the repaired engine: With all necessary components replaced or repaired, and clearances established, Alex can begin reassembling the engine. He must ensure that each part is reinstalled correctly and in the right order. Tightening all bolts and fasteners to the appropriate torque specifications is critical during this process. 6. Test the engine: Once the engine is fully reassembled, it's crucial that Alex tests its functionality before reinstalling it in the car. He needs to verify that all repairs have been successful, and the engine performs efficiently and effectively. 7. Reinstall the engine in the car: After confirming that the repairs were successful, Alex can reinstall the engine into the car. He will need to reconnect all wires, hoses, and components before attempting to start the vehicle. To summarize, Alex's primary objective now would be to repair the engine so the car would work again. This process will involve several crucial steps, including cleaning and inspecting all the engine components, replacing or repairing damaged parts, adjusting clearances, reassembling the engine, testing its functionality, and reinstalling it back into the car. By completing these steps thoroughly, Alex can ensure that his vehicle returns to a reliable and optimal-performing state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: The 37-year-old Liverpudlian, who first joined Crewe a decade ago, returned to the Alex on loan in November. Boss Steve Davis hoped to make the move a more permanent one in January. But it is understood a 'gentleman's agreement' has now been reached for Lowe to re-join relegated Crewe. Davis first tried to bring the much-travelled marksman to Gresty Road when he first took over at Crewe four years ago. And he hinted that the vastly experienced Lowe would not be the only 'old head' to be brought in this summer to strengthen his predominantly young side. \\"The team's got a lot of potential,\\" Davis told BBC Radio Stoke. \\"It's a very young squad. But they need to learn how to win. They need to find a way to win games. \\"Old heads would certainly help in terms of situations within games. Those characters within the squad who have come into it this season could really help.\\" After starting at non-league Burscough, boyhood Liverpool fan Ryan Lowe did not make his Football League debut until he was almost 22. He made his name with Shrewsbury Town as a winger before the first of two spells with Chester City, during which he went out on loan to Stockport, followed by moves to Crewe, Bury, Sheffield Wednesday, MK Dons, Tranmere Rovers and then back to Gigg Lane. Ryan Lowe hit 17 goals in 74 games in two seasons at Gresty Road from 2006 to 2008. He then scored two more in six appearances - which included two of Crewe's six wins this season - when he returned on a six-week loan in November. But he has been used a lot more by Bury since Christmas, adding four more goals to a career tally that reached 200 on Saturday when he netted in the Shakers' 3-1 home defeat by Millwall.

Meanwhile, at the Tremaine mansion, Cinderella's stepsisters Anastasia and Drizella are bitterly doing Cinderella's old chores. Anastasia wanders off to avoid work and stumbles upon the picnic. When the Fairy Godmother drops her wand, Anastasia takes it to her mother. In the ensuing struggle, Anastasia inadvertently turns the Fairy Godmother into a garden gnome. Lady Tremaine, reveling at yet another chance to ruin Cinderella's life, uses the wand to go back in time to the day the Grand Duke fitted the glass slipper on Cinderella.

Several copies of the Atlas robot are being provided as Government Furnished Equipment for the DARPA Robotics Challenge program with delivery scheduled in the summer of 2013. ||||| Published on Sep 5, 2012 Cheetah Robot is a fast-running quadruped developed by Boston Dynamics with funding from DARPA. It just blazed past its previous speed record, getting up to 28.3 mph, about 0.5 mph faster than Usain Bolt's fastest 20 meter split. This version of the Cheetah Robot runs on a treadmill with offboard power. Testing on an untethered outdoor version starts early next year. For more information about Cheetah or the other robots we develop, visit www.BostonDynamics.com. ||||| As you hide behind a tree, your heart races. You breathe shallow so they don’t hear you. But you know you’re running in vain. The robots are coming and this forest won’t hide you for long. When the robot uprising happens, you’ll have Google—or Alphabet, as its parent company is soon to be called—to thank for those robots’ ability to track through the world. Its subsidiary Boston Dynamics has taught its Atlas robot, which was the backbone for many of the robots at the recent DARPA Robotics Challenge, how to find its way out in the world. According to Popular Science, the engineers sent the Atlas robot out into the world for the first time, trailed by someone carrying a power pack tethered to the robot. In the future, however, it will be able to wander on its own, Boston Dynamics founder Marc Raibert said at a recent conference hosted by the Fab Foundation. Atlas, initially appearing to look like a drunk person stumbling home through the woods after an exceedingly heavy night, seems to have perfected the ability to walk, and even jog, in the woods. Raibert said that Atlas’ mobility is “in shooting range” of a human’s, but not quite up to that standard yet. YouTube/Michael Campbell Terrifying. And if that’s not terrifying enough, the engineers at Boston Dynamics—seemingly taking inspiration from the evil kid in the first “Toy Story” movie—have made a robot dog with an arm for a head. Raibert added that the team took Atlas to see how it fared in uncertain conditions. Atlas uses a laser radar system to “see” the world, similar to Google’s self-driving cars. “Out in the world is just a totally different challenge than in the lab,” he said in the video. ”You can’t predict what it’s going to be like.” While Atlas is still acclimating to the outside world, it’s good to see that it didn’t react to the being outside for the first as other robots have this year. Perhaps we’ll yet be able to contain any potential robot uprising. ||||| This is a set of web collections curated by Mark Graham using the Archive-IT service of the Internet Archive.

Atlas is an “agile, anthropomorphic robot” (who apparently is also fond of alliteration). Atlas was created by Boston Dynamics, the Google-owned robotics company also famous for its speedy robotic cheetah and its swimming, snow-climbing BigDog. And recently, Atlas went for its first-ever walk in the woods. The impressive — and perhaps mildly alarming — footage of Atlas staggering around like the less-coordinated cousin of a Transformers character has been making the rounds online after it was shown at the Fab Lab 11 conference and symposium in Cambridge, Mass., earlier this month. It was the first time the company had shared video of one of its humanoid robots on an outdoor excursion. (Though its quadrupeds have been frequently filmed running in the wild.) But Atlas wasn’t simply gripped by a Thoreauvian yen to experience nature. According to Boston Dynamics founder Marc Raibert, the hike was an opportunity to test the robot’s balance and ability to respond to an unpredictable environment. “Out in the world is just a totally different challenge than in the lab,” he said at the conference. According to the Boston Globe, much of the company’s research is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is trying to develop robots that can perform tasks in military and disaster-related situations that would be unsafe for humans. And the company originally began as a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, according to its Web site. Atlas still isn’t quite ready to venture out on its own — in the video shown at Fab 11, the robot remained tethered to a power source as it tramped around the woods. “I’m not saying it can do everything you can do,” Raibert said, “but you can imagine if we keep pushing we’ll get there.” It’s not clear whether anyone has informed Atlas that the streets of America are not necessarily safe for wandering robots — look at the violence inflicted on the friendly hitchhiking Hitchbot in Philadelphia earlier this month. Then again, Hitchbot was Canadian. And it had pool noodles for arms. And it looked like a character from a PBS kids show. [Hitchhiking robot’s cross-country journey comes to a tragic end in Philadelphia] On second thought, Atlas should be fine. RELATED: ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Atlas is a robot made by Boston Dynamics, a company owned by Alphabet. Atlas was designed to move easily on rough terrain and walk using two feet. This allows its arms to be free to lift and move around its environment. Atlas can also climb using its hands and feet to move through narrow spaces. It has a sensor head with two cameras and a laser range finder to help it see where it is going. For now, Atlas needs a power supply from a person, but in the future, it will be able to walk and explore on its own. Boston Dynamics is working on improving Atlas's walking and balance skills to make it more like a human. The robot could be used in military and disaster situations in the future where it might not be safe for humans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"So you did.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"You absolutely did not.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"So you did,\\" we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"You absolutely did not\\" is true. To analyze this, we should evaluate the given premise, look into possible interpretations, and understand contradictions and logical fallacies. Firstly, let's examine the premise: \\"So you did.\\" This statement implies an affirmation, meaning that the subject (which is you) completed or achieved a particular action or task. The very structure of this statement suggests agreement with the idea that the action has taken place, whether it be an observation, a response, or even a confirmation. Possible interpretations of this premise could signify that: 1. The speaker is expressing a positive response, confirming that \\"you\\" indeed performed the task or action being discussed. 2. The speaker has found evidence implying that \\"you\\" did something or experienced something relevant to the conversation. 3. The speaker is using the phrase as an informal rhetorical device, implying that the truth or the conclusion of the matter is that \\"you\\" did it. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"You absolutely did not\\" contradicts the premise directly. This hypothesis is a negation of the action or task being associated with the subject. It emphasizes that the subject has not completed or achieved the action or task at all, and this assertion is regarded as definitive given the term \\"absolutely.\\" The contradiction in these statements can also be analyzed using formal logic. In formal logic, a contradiction occurs when two propositions cannot both be true at the same time. In this case: Premise: \\"So you did.\\" -> P Hypothesis: \\"You absolutely did not.\\" -> ¬P By stating that \\"you did\\" (P) and \\"you absolutely did not\\" (¬P), we have a contradiction, as both statements cannot be true simultaneously. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise provided. Additionally, assuming the hypothesis is true based on the initial premise is an example of the \\"appeal to contradiction\\" logical fallacy. In this fallacy, one assumes that because two statements are contradictory, one must be true, and the other must be false. However, without further information or context, we cannot determine the truthfulness of either statement independently. In conclusion, given the premise \\"So you did,\\" we cannot determine that the hypothesis \\"You absolutely did not\\" is true. The statements contradict each other, and drawing a conclusion based on this contradiction would involve committing logical fallacies. To establish the accuracy or validity of either claim, we would require additional information, clarification, or context to assess which statement is correct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Opponents warn the administration is set to be packed with tycoons who will do nothing to fulfil his promise of helping working-class Americans The appetisers were young garlic soup with thyme and sautéed frogs’ legs, diver scallops with caramelized cauliflower and caper-raisin emulsion. Donald Trump ate a prime sirloin with citrus glazed carrots; Mitt Romney chose lamb chops with a mushroom bolognese sauce. At Jean-Georges, a three-star Michelin restaurant in the Trump International Hotel in New York, it’s a rich man’s world, and one where the US president-elect feels at home. This has also been evident in his appointments so far, as the so-called “blue-collar billionaire” looks set to preside over the wealthiest administration in modern history. Trump's conflicts of interest: a visual guide Read more Trump, a former host of reality TV show The Apprentice, is surrounding himself with the 1%: billionaires and millionaires, investment bankers and venture capitalists, Wall Street insiders and family fortune heirs, many educated at elite schools. It is the most brazen embrace of big money since the 1980s era of Ronald Reagan, Tom Wolfe’s Masters of the Universe and Oliver Stone’s Gordon Gekko. “It is a throwback to the ‘greed is good’ mentality,” said Marge Baker, executive vice-president of the liberal pressure group People For the American Way. “It’s also alarming that the president-elect said he believes what’s good for his business is good for America. That’s not how you want the leader of your country to be making decisions.” Baker added: “When you’ve got Wall Street billionaires setting the agenda it’s not likely to benefit average Americans. Research shows that the wealthy have different priorities and policy priorities, for example on healthcare and the minimum wage.” The Trump cabinet’s emphasis on tax cuts and deregulation is also likely to echo the Reagan era. Election rival Hillary Clinton warned during the campaign: “Trump is trickledown economics over and over again. I called it trumped-up trickledown economics.” Igor Volsky, deputy director of a pro-Clinton thinktank, the Center for American Progress Action Fund, said: “The same trickledown policies we saw in the 80s [that] didn’t help ordinary Americans are going to be put forward again. If you look at large parts of the cabinet it does feel like going back in time.” The very people who heard Trump’s blunt, populist message about unrigging the system would be the ones to suffer its betrayal, Volsky added. “He’s going to perpetuate a system that helps the very richest Americans at the cost of programmes that help middle and lower-income Americans.” Andrew Mellon, one of the richest Americans of the early 20th century, served as treasury secretary in three administrations. George W Bush’s first cabinet was criticised for containing high rollers in 2001. But Trump has taken the mix of democracy and plutocracy to a whole new level. The Politico website suggested the new president’s team could be worth 35bn – some have made political donations worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The median household income in the US is about 55,000. Trump’s supporters have said they welcome the fact he is a businessman, not a politician beholden to special interests, and hope he will run America like an efficient corporation. But several members of the administration could face accusations of a conflict of interest – that they are forming policy with at least one eye on their own businesses, or those of their cronies. Neil Sroka, spokesman for the liberal organisation Democracy for America, said: “You’ve got a group of entitled, out-of-touch billionaires who are going to be bossed around by a bigoted, out-of-touch billionaire. It is beyond credibility that they are going to be able to accurately reflect the needs of working-class citizens who rely on leaders in Washington to fight for them.” The appointments were self-serving, Sroka added. “What this rogues’ gallery of billionaires that Trump is trotting shows is that he isn’t interested in protecting working people. He wants to curry favour with a millionaire and billionaire class that he’s always sought the approval of. “This is a class that dines on lobster steak and caviar every night. They’re not figuring out how to put food on the table. They’re figuring out how to make a few more millions before they go home at night.” Trump’s picks so far Facebook Twitter Pinterest Betsy DeVos, Trump’s nominee for education secretary.

This collection of wealth is greater than that of the 43 million least wealthy American households combined—over one third of the 126 million households total in the US. Affluence of this magnitude in a US presidential cabinet is unprecedented. The household data on which we based our comparison is from the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances. Collected by the Federal Reserve, this survey is the most recent comprehensive data source on American wealth. The estimates were adjusted for inflation and an increase in the number of American households. It is possible that the wealth of low-income Americans has changed since 2013, but trends over the last several decades suggest a large change is unlikely. It is worth noting that almost 13% of American households have zero or negative wealth because of debt, so we are adding together these households with those that have at least some wealth. Even if we just compare the wealth of Trump’s cabinet to the median household, it is still an impressive concentration of riches. It would take about 120,000 households with the the United States median net worth of about 83,200 to match the wealth of just the four richest members of Trump’s cabinet—Betsy DeVos, Wilbur Ross Jr., Linda McMahon, and Rex Tillerson. ||||| \\"It matters that government as a whole is representative of America,\\" said Republican strategist Sara Fagen, former White House political director for George W.

While Obama put together the most diverse Cabinet ever, some women in his White House still felt marginalized. The concerns reached the president himself during his first year in office, leading him to hold a dinner with senior female advisers to discuss his administration's boys-club image. Some of Trump's most powerful aides are women. Kellyanne Conway served as his third and final campaign manager and remains a senior adviser. Trump's daughter Ivanka consults on most major decisions and is expected to continue doing so once her father is in the White House.

The primary source of income for the townspeople is the old sawmill, owned and operated by the local prominent farmer, Charles McIntyre, and his wife, Eliza McIntyre. Eliza had been a city girl and journalist who decided to start a new life in the countryside with her husband. Their love story is well-known and admired by the townspeople, but whispers of hidden secrets and discontent in their marriage have started to circulate. Charles, burdened by a familial predisposition to drinking, often disappears and indulges in alcohol. In contrast, Eliza remains compassionate and throws herself into her charity work and other activities to help the town prosper. Despite her husband's failings, Eliza is loved and respected by the community. Act II: One day, Eliza receives a letter from an anonymous source, hinting that the town's sawmill rests on a dark, untold secret. Intrigued, she decides to investigate and starts by researching the sawmill's history. Her journalistic instincts come alive, and she begins interviewing elderly townspeople to collect any relevant information. Through the interviews, Eliza discovers the town was founded on the booming lumber business but goes through cycles of enrichment and impoverishment. Legend has it that the sawmill is cursed, as a terrible tragedy occurs every few decades, leading to the closing of the sawmill for a time. Unsatisfied with the information and disbelieving of curses, Eliza decides to unravel the mysteries of the sawmill itself. One evening, while her husband is out, she sneaks into the sawmill to continue her investigations. As she explores the building, she comes across a hidden room with rotten floorboards. Carefully, she walks towards the room when suddenly, the floorboards give in, plunging her into the abyss below. Act III: The townspeople are shocked to discover Eliza's lifeless body the next morning. Charles, heartbroken and guilty, dedicates himself to finding out the truth about his wife's death. A bright and determined city detective, Sarah, is dispatched to Millwood to assist in the investigation. As Sarah and Charles follow Eliza's clues, they unearth long-forgotten documents that reveal a dark history surrounding the sawmill's construction. The sawmill, it turns out, was built on an ancient burial ground. The townspeople, desperate to attract wealth and prosperity, made a pact with a malicious spirit residing in the burial ground. Every few decades, a member of the community vanishes without a trace, and in return, the town prospers, and the sawmill continues to operate. The community tries to keep this truth hidden, stubbornly sticking to assumptions of a natural accidental death. Together, Sarah and Charles work through obstacles and threats from the shadowy town council, determined to expose the truth and break the town's deadly pact. In the climax, they perform a ritual involving Eliza's spirit to cleanse the curse and confront the malicious spirit. With Eliza's aid and the reluctant support of the townspeople, the curse is lifted, resulting in the closure of the sawmill. In the aftermath, the town of Millwood starts rebuilding its future, and its residents confront their morally fraught legacy. Meanwhile, Charles, finding solace in his journey to uncover the truth, opens up a small farm-to-table restaurant, including Eliza's name in its title, as a tribute to his late wife and their love. The movie closes with Charles and Sarah sharing a quiet moment, reminiscing about Eliza's courage and intelligence, as the town begins to forge a new, more honest chapter in its history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – More controversy for the NFL: Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice got into a fight with fiancee Janay Palmer at an Atlantic City casino early Saturday and knocked her out cold, ESPN reports by way of a court summons. A video posted to TMZ yesterday shows Rice dragging an apparently unconscious Palmer from an elevator, then laying her on the ground as he attempts to clear her legs from the elevator doors, in a scene said to have occurred after the fight. Rice's lawyer notes that though the video is authentic, it \\"is not the complete event, but is merely the end result of what transpired.\\" Both Rice and Palmer \\"struck each other with their hands\\" and were arrested for simple assault, police say. The pair then \\"returned home together after being detained,\\" the Baltimore Ravens told USA Today. The NFL will review the incident under its personal conduct policy, and commissioner Roger Goodell has \\"wide discretion\\" regarding punishment, the Baltimore Sun reports. It notes Goodell suspended Ben Roethlisberger for six games—later reduced to four—after he was investigated for sexual assault, though he was never charged. Rice is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday. Article:","completion":"Once upon a time, there was a big strong football player named Ray Rice, who played for the Baltimore Ravens team in the NFL. He got into big trouble one weekend when he got into a fight with his fiancée, Janay Palmer. The fight happened at a big building called a casino, and Ray ended up knocking Janay out cold. People from a place called ESPN found out about the fight because it was written in a paper called a court summons. There was also a video, kind of like a movie, that showed people what happened. In the video, Ray was dragging Janay, who looked like she was sleeping, out of a small room called an elevator. It was a pretty scary scene that happened after their fight. Ray's lawyer, the person who helps him in court, said that the video did show the real thing, but it didn't show everything that happened. The police, who are like superheroes that keep people safe, said that both Ray and Janay hit each other with their hands, which is not a very nice thing to do. They both had to face the consequences and got arrested for something called simple assault. However, they went back home together after spending some time being detained, which means they were kept by the police for a little while. The big bosses of the NFL are going to look at what happened and make some decisions about what should happen to Ray. The NFL has a big, important person named Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has a lot of power to decide what sort of punishment is right. He has had to do this before when another football player named Ben Roethlisberger got into trouble. Now, Ray Rice has to go to a place called court on Tuesday, where he will find out if he will get into more trouble for his actions. Remember, kids: it's important to treat everyone with kindness and respect. Fighting is not the right way to handle our problems, and everyone should try to be kind and gentle to those around them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I can use this background: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. Now, I have a new situation: A waitress sets down two cups of water at a table and then takes the table's order. She leaves to place the order and the diners begin chatting and sipping on their water. Kim remarks that her water is room temperature and she wishes that it was cooler. Janet states that her water is so cold it hurts her teeth and wishes hers was warmer. They agree to mention it to the waitress when she returns. Answer this question please: Which person's water has molecules moving faster? Answer:","completion":"Kim's water has molecules moving faster. Step 1: Understand the given information In the background information, we learn that as water cools, its molecular motion slows down. This means that colder water has slower-moving molecules, while warmer water has faster-moving molecules. Step 2: Analyze the new situation In the new situation, we have two cups of water with different temperatures. Kim's water is room temperature and she wishes it was cooler, while Janet's water is so cold that it hurts her teeth and she wishes it was warmer. Step 3: Compare the molecular speeds Since Kim's water is at room temperature, which is warmer than Janet's very cold water, the molecules in Kim's water will be moving faster than those in Janet's water. This is because the molecular motion in warmer water is faster than that in colder water, as stated in the background information."},{"prompt":"Answer the question based on the following text.

Disney theme parks make up four of the world’s top 20 tourist attractions, according to new research. Disney World’s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Park in California and Tokyo DisneySea registered a total of more than 66 million visitors last year. The destinations are among 15 theme parks included in a list of the world’s top 50 tourist attractions compiled by tourism website Travel + Leisure. The most popular tourist destination across the globe last year was Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar, which recorded 91.25m visitors in 2013. The most popular destination across the globe was Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar, which recorded 91.25m visitors in 2013. The 15th century market is famous for its hand-painted ceramics, lanterns, intricately patterned carpets, and Byzantine-style jewelry. Mexico City’s The Zócalo - the ceremonial Atzec plaza - came in second place with 85 million visitors, while New York’s Times Square was third in the list with 50 million. The Zocalo hosts military parades, cultural and political events, concerts, exhibitions, fairs, and public art installations, while Times Square is known for it lively entertainment, Broadway shows and many shops. Disney World’s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida recorded 18.6 million visitors last year making it the 12th most visited tourist attraction in the world. Other attractions that made up the top ten were New York's Central Park, and Union Station in Washington D.C. which both attracted 40m visitors. The Las Vegas Strip came in sixth position followed by Tokyo's Meiji Jingu Shrine and Sensoji Temple. Niagara Falls was in ninth place while New York City's Grand Central Terminal was in tenth position with 21.6m visitors. There was no place on the list for any British attractions, and the least visited place in the top 50 most popular tourist destinations was the Taj Mahal, which still recorded between seven and eight million tourists. It means the British Museum in London (6.7 million), the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (6.3 million), and the Roman Colosseum (5.1 million) narrowly missed the cut. Nevada's Las Vegas Strip attracted 30.5m annual visitors in 2013, making it the sixth most popular destination. The figures were compiled from data supplied by government agencies and industry reports including the Global Attractions Attendance Report. The attractions themselves also supplied their own data when ticket sales weren’t available. Travel + Leisure defined tourist attractions as ‘cultural and historical sites, natural landmarks, and officially designated spaces’. It meant that while destinations such as the Las Vegas Strip made the list, popular spots such as malls and shopping centres were not included, despite often attracting tens of millions of visitors each year. Beaches and religious sites were also omitted. Niagara Falls in New York and Ontario registered 22m visitors, placing it ninth in the top 50 tourist attractions. Bourbon Street in New Orleans was 45th in the list of the world's top 50 destinations with 7,470,000 visitors. The publication of the list comes shortly after the World Tourist Organisation published their annual report earlier this year detailing the state of global tourism. It revealed there was a five percent growth in international tourism in 2013, which amounted to an additional 52 million tourists and which brought the total up to 1.087 billion. The growth defied predictions that the global economic downturn would slow tourism. Regions that showed the biggest growth in international tourism in 2013 were Asia, Africa and Europe. Of these areas, Southeast Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and North Africa were the most popular places to visit. The Taj Mahal in India recorded between seven and eight million visitors in 2013 putting it in 50th position. The Great Wall of China had 10.7m visitors in 2013, making the historic attraction the 26th most popular site. The Palace of Versailles, in France just made it onto the list with 7,527,122 tourists visiting the site last year. The Forbidden City in Beijing attracted an astonishing 15,340,000 in 2013, making it the 16th most popular tourist attraction in the world last year. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee had 9,345,695 in 2013. Europe currently remains the most visited region in the world, welcoming an extra 29 million visitors last year to attract a total of 563 million tourists – 52 percent of the entire tourist market. Northern, Southern and Central America saw an increase of six million visitors to reach a total of 169 million. Africa attracted three million more arrivals than 2012, reaching a new record of 56 million. Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mexico City, recorded 20 million tourists in 2013, putting it in 11th place. The list of top 50 travel destinations also revealed that South Korean theme parks Everland and Lotte World were among the most visited attractions, beating the Eiffel Tower with nearly seven million, the Great Pyramids with nearly four million and Stonehenge with one million. Travel + Leisure noted that accessibility can be a factor in determining how many visitors visit a particular attraction, adding that it takes extra effort to reach destination’s such as Yellowstone National Park, which recorded 3.2 million visitors, the Terracotta Army in Xi'an, China, which had 4.8 million, and Peru’s Machu Picchu, which has restricted tourism to 2,500 entries per day, or 912,500 per year. 1 Grand Bazaar, Istanbul.

Simon: You see, plastic takes a very, very long time to break down, or in other words, to disappear. It can harm animals and plants, and it can also make our Earth dirty. By using less plastic, we help keep our Earth clean and safe for everyone. Five-year-old: Oh, so glass bottles are better for Earth? Simon: Yes, they are! Glass bottles can be used over and over again, and they don't harm our environment like plastic does. So, by using a glass bottle like Pierrot, we're helping our planet stay clean and healthy.

The crash happened after a mother-of-three stopped her car on a level crossing north of the city. She was killed in the subsequent inferno along with five train passengers. Accident investigators also said there were no problems with the signals or barrier at the site of the collision. But they remain unaware why the driver, 49-year-old Ellen Brody, became stranded on the crossing at Valhalla, about 20 miles (32km) north of New York City. An official from the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency leading the probe, said on Thursday that a witness in a nearby car had seen Ms Brody stop on the crossing in the moments before the train approached. Investigator Robert Sumwalt said that the barrier was seen to come down on the rear of the car, a Jeep Cherokee, at which point Ms Brody got out and appeared to inspect the damage. He said that, according to both the witness and the train driver, after returning to the car she suddenly drove forward slightly - straight into the path of the oncoming train. Data retrieved from the train's recording device suggested it was travelling at 58mph (92km/h) an hour, added Mr Sumwalt - just below the 60mph speed limit for that section of track. In addition to the six deaths there were 15 injuries, seven of them serious. The electrified third rail of the track came through the front carriage of the train after the crash, setting it on fire. Passengers had to escape from the rear carriages. The line on which the accident happened, Metro-North, is the second-busiest rail system in the US, serving about 280,000 passengers a day in New York and Connecticut.

A disabled Iraqi war veteran is suing a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in the Bronx for refusing him service when he brought in his service dog. 50-year-old Charles Hernandez says he entered the location on Fordham Road and Jerome Avenue on February 26 to buy a two-piece chicken meal with fries in order to take some prescribed medication. But he was refused service when the employees behind the counter saw that he was accompanied by his service dog, Valor. Turned away: Charles Hernandez (second left) and his dog Valor (black) meet Senator Chuck Schumer (center). Hernandez filed a lawsuit yesterday against a KFC in the Bronx for refusing him and Valor service. 'Papi, there are no dogs allowed,' Hernandez recalls an employee saying. Hernandez tried to explain that Valor is a service dog and according to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Valor is allowed to accompany him anywhere. 'OK, but you still cannot have the dog in the store,' the employee responded. Hernandez even says that the store's manager, Sade Clark, saw the 'discrimination' happening and did nothing about it. 'I was frustrated, angry and more, depressed,' Hernandez told the New York Post. 'No one was helping. Rather than understanding the needs of a person, they shut me out.' So Hernandez is now suing the employee, Clark, the restaurant's owner and the company's principal owner for 1million. Sued: This KFC in the Bronx was slapped with a 1million lawsuit yesterday for refusing Hernandez and his dog Valor service last February. In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, Hernandez alleges that the KFC worker broke federal, state and city laws and caused him distress. Hernandez won a similar case in 2011 after being cursed out by a McDonald's store manager in Times Square for entering with his service dog. 'It's unfortunate that when disabled veterans return from war...they are confronted with ignorance and discrimination,' Hernandez's lawyer David Lackowitz told the New York Daily News. Hernandez was deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2006 and sustained multiple injuries to his shoulder and his back. A spinal chord injury led to his early retirement. Hernandez also worked at Ground Zero for three months after the September 11th attacks and was named 'City Council Veteran of the Year' in 2011. In 2010 he was given Valor to held him with balance and prevent his panic attacks.

There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished. On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes.

Article: As a teacher, my daily life includes driving to a new school so I'm usually unable to anticipate the day's events, good or bad! One day, I was teaching in a very difficult classroom. I was managing behavior all morning and by lunch time, I knew I needed coffee to even consider surviving the afternoon. So on my lunch break, I drove to a coffee shop nearby to get a cup of coffee. While returning to the car I realized I had locked my keys and my phone inside! I had about 15 minutes to get back to the school which was a good 4- or 5- minute drive away. I considered rushing back, but it being winter, I thought a fall on ice would only make the situation much worse. So I ran into a McDonald's and asked the man at the counter who happened to be the manager to please call me a taxi. I explained my situation to him, and I could tell by the look in his eyes, that he took pity. He hurried to the back to use the phone while I walked in the restaurant. I had less than 10 minutes to get back to my school at this point. The manager returned only to tell me that the taxi company had put him on hold and then the line got disconnected, and that he was now on hold again, but had not yet been able to ask for the taxi yet. Without a thought, he caught his coat and offered to drive me to the school. Immediately I followed him into his car and made it back into my classroom with 2 minutes left before the bell! While arriving at the school, I thanked this man endlessly. His calm behavior and kind nature made me think he was probably a wonderful manager to work for, and also a wonderful human being to have on his earth. This experience makes me realize that out of every hopeless situation, there is the chance for acts of kindness to happen, which can create an unimaginable impression to those who receive them.

Translate to English","completion":"Some others have clung to a miserable and doomed policy whereby the initiator of the conflict finances the costs resulting from the military forces. In this scenario, certain individuals or groups insist on maintaining a policy that has been proven to be ineffective and prone to failure. This policy dictates that the party responsible for instigating a conflict should cover the expenses arising from the deployment of military forces and the subsequent consequences of military action. This strategy is considered miserable due to its inherent flaws, as it may encourage instigators of conflict to take advantage of the fact that they can initiate a dispute with little to no financial repercussions, allowing them to exploit this policy for their gain. Additionally, it places the burden of financial responsibility on the perpetrators, which is an immense challenge and could eventually lead a nation towards economic decline. Moreover, the policy is doomed from the outset because it doesn't take into account the complex nature of international conflicts and the potential for a wide array of unforeseen consequences. It oversimplifies matters and ignores the many variables involved in political and military disputes which may, in turn, lead to further escalation and animosity between opposing parties. There are a few potential reasons why some people still cling to such a policy. First, they may be unaware of the historic failures and long-term effects of this strategy, and thus continue to advocate for the same flawed approach. Alternatively, they might believe that the approach is advantageous for their country or political stance. Another reason could be that they are unwilling to explore alternative, more humane, and fair ways of settling conflicts, such as diplomatic negotiations or international court proceedings. They may fear that these alternatives would not yield the desired outcomes or serve their interests entirely. Lastly, they could be influenced by a broader sense of nationalism or loyalty to their nation, which may cloud their judgment and lead them to support such policies. This could occur even in the face of evidence that demonstrates the inefficiency of the approach, as it often becomes tied to a sense of national pride and identity. In conclusion, the policy of having conflict initiators finance the costs resulting from military forces is a bleak and ill-fated strategy that has proven to be both detrimental and fruitless in the long run. While some individuals or groups may still cling to this approach due to various reasons such as ignorance, fear of alternative means, or even nationalistic loyalty, it is crucial for the international community to recognize the dangers and inefficiencies tied to this policy and strive to seek more constructive and effective ways of resolving conflicts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), for supremacy in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite \\"in the near future\\". The Soviet Union beat the US to this, with the October 4, 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1, and later beat the US to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. The Space Race peaked with the July 20, 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions, and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations. A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew.

Movie plot title: Mean Creek Movie plot: At a middle school in a small Oregon town, 14-year-old George Tooney sets up a camera on his school basketball court to record his free-throws. While he is shooting, shy student Sam Merrick picks up the camera to take a look. Defensive and angry, George beats Sam up. Sam confides in both his protective older brother Rocky and his budding girlfriend, Millie, who urges Sam to take a higher road.Sam's older brother Rocky confides in his friends, Clyde and Marty, who are also familiar with George's reputation as a bully (he previously mocked Clyde for having two gay dads). While they agree that they need to stand up for Sam, they have different approaches. Clyde, who is sensitive and a bit of an outsider himself within the group, is more sympathetic and passive. Marty, who has issues with anger and trauma stemming from his father's suicide, his mother's apathy and his older brother's abuse, favors a more righteous form of revenge.Eventually, they hatch a plan with Sam to invite George on a fake birthday party for Sam, which George all-too eagerly accepts. They plan to drive to a local creek where they will spend the afternoon on a boat and, in an orchestrated game of Truth or Dare, get George to strip his clothes and jump in the lake, leading him to hitch a ride home in the nude.When the gang consisting of Sam, Rocky, Marty, Clyde and Millie (who is not yet aware of the plan) arrive at George's house, he is working on his video diary for the day. He leaves without telling his mother where he will be, and gives Sam a present a large, high-end water gun. They run into Marty's obnoxious older brother at a convenience store on the way.Throughout the drive and the journey to the boat it becomes clear that George, while annoying and occasionally harsh, is truly desperate to fit in and resorts to aggression as a cover-up. He also admits to having a learning disability, which he hopes to be accepted for. En route to the boat, Sam tells Millie about the plan.

Some turn away or deny... convinced it doesn't really happen or couldn't be real..But the truth is.... many \\"Pfeffermann's\\" are living right near us. We just refuse to see them. The role that Jeffery Tambor plays is so touching and his portrayal truly open ups and educates an area that many may never except or understand. \\"Transparent\\" is just as real as many of the popular series that \\"prime time\\" fans watch every week. Some of the sexual scenes are a bit graphic but add to the reality of the theme. I enjoy the comic relief and sarcasm given to different actors personalities, in my opinion, it balances the drama, pain and makes the story line enjoyable. We all use comedy to balance pain and you cannot help but get into these characters lives. All the actors have been given challenaging roles. They all are able to bring the different, crazy personalities together. It cannot be easy to bring all these family dynamics into the plot and have them make sense, it is truly a great acting accomplishment. I can't wait for the next season.. We all have a little \\"Transparent\\" in our families. And as in all families, I'm sure comedy and chaos will continue...Transparent is extremely painful at times, but for some reason I have a feeling, Mura will hold her family together and she might even find a place for her own heart!

Who knows..you might even look at your own family in a different way? \\"Aunt Harvey is that you? ||||| Amazon Last April, Amazon dove into the original programming arms race. It made eight comedy pilots, put them on the Internet, and then selected the best two to expand into full series. The original batch of pilots all had a DIY, goofy, occasionally experimental vibe, excepting Garry Trudeau’s congressmen comedy Alpha House, which alone looked like a show that could air on a old-fashioned, broadcast-to-a-television network. (It was one of the shows Amazon picked up). Last week, Amazon unveiled five new pilots, and it’s clear they have learned an important lesson about original content in the interim, one Netflix has long since grasped: If you want to make a splash as a fledgling provider of must-see TV, make something that could be on HBO. Call it the House of Cards precept: Your brand may be all about originality, binge-watching, and fresh business models, but that only works if you give the people a show that looks like one they already happily pay for. Amazon has finally made one of those. Amazon’s new pilots are more professional and slick than the cute, homemade series it previously commissioned. The two dramas, Bosch, about a tortured LA cop named Hieronymus Bosch—yes, the show lays it on that thick—and The After, a post-apocalyptic drama from The X-Files’ Chris Carter that stars a French actress wholly unequipped to act in English, are both mediocre versions of network series, with additional cursing. They aren’t any good, but it’s easy to imagine some version of them airing in the summer on NBC. One of the comedies, The Rebels—if Major League were about a Los Angeles football team—is only better because it’s shorter. Mozart in the Jungle, created by Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman, and Alex Timbers and set in the world of New York classical musicians, is sweet and charming if a little unformed. It does, at least, feature Gael García Bernal as Rodrigo, a swashbuckling conductor with cockatoo hair, alongside television’s very first female oboist as a protagonist. Advertisement But towering above all of these shows is Jill Soloway’s Transparent, an honest to goodness great pilot that feels—and I mean this as a compliment—exactly like one of those HBO shows with a 1-to-1 ratio of viewers to think pieces. Ostensibly a half-hour comedy, Transparent is very much like Louie and Girls in its relationship to humor, which is conditional. It stars Gaby Hoffmann, Jay Duplass, and Amy Landecker as three grown, Los Angelino siblings and Jeffrey Tambor and Judith Light as their divorced parents—a cast that makes for as good company as it sounds like it should. The show’s title is a pun, but Soloway, who was a big part of Six Feet Under, is interested in transparency as more than a play on words. Tambor’s character tells Hoffman’s, “It’s so hard when someone sees something you do not want them to see,” and she shrugs him off, preferring to pretend she’s better at camouflaging her unhappiness than she actually is. Everyone in the family is hiding feelings they only think they are hiding, particularly about sex, desire, and gender, which, needless to say, are the most enticing kind of hang-ups. |||||","completion":"\\"Transparent\\" is a unique TV show about people who live very emotional and wonderful lives.

Answer a question about this article: Impermanence (Pāli: anicca) expresses the Buddhist notion that all compounded or conditioned phenomena (all things and experiences) are inconstant, unsteady, and impermanent. Everything we can experience through our senses is made up of parts, and its existence is dependent on external conditions. Everything is in constant flux, and so conditions and the thing itself are constantly changing. Things are constantly coming into being, and ceasing to be. Since nothing lasts, there is no inherent or fixed nature to any object or experience. According to the doctrine of impermanence, life embodies this flux in the aging process, the cycle of rebirth (saṃsāra), and in any experience of loss. The doctrine asserts that because things are impermanent, attachment to them is futile and leads to suffering (dukkha). What is the meaning of impermanence in Buddhism?","completion":"In Buddhism, the meaning of impermanence (Pāli: anicca) refers to the concept that all compounded or conditioned phenomena, including things and experiences, are inconstant, unsteady, and impermanent.

As these conditions and the things themselves continuously change, nothing has a fixed or inherent nature.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose composition implies \\"sadistic torture and occult sexual sorcery\\"? ? Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret illustrates a scene from book III of The Faerie Queene, a 16th-century allegorical epic poem by Edmund Spenser, in which Busirane, an evil sorcerer, abducts the beautiful Amoret (representing married virtue), and tortures her to the point of death. The heroic female warrior Britomart (representing both chastity and Elizabeth I) battles through obstacles to reach the chamber in which Amoret is being held, and slays Busirane moments before he is able to kill Amoret.Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was intended by Etty to illustrate the virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart as he prepares to kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she swings her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.In the original poem, Busirane had tortured and cut out the heart of the still-living Amoret by the time of her rescue. When he came to paint Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret Etty had created numerous scenes of combat and death, and would later achieve a degree of critical approbation when it became known that he visited mortuaries to sketch cadavers to ensure the accuracy of his depictions of bodies in varying stages of decomposition. However, he had an aversion to \\"the offensive and revolting butchery, some have delighted and even revelled in\\", and disliked the depiction of gratuitous violence. Consequently, in Etty's work Amoret is depicted as physically unharmed by...

The painful process often leads to a slow and agonizing death for the bear. The rescue marks the first time a large number of bears was relinquished on conscience. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Brave Bears Rescued from Unkind Farm in Vietnam Once upon a time, in far-off Vietnam, there were 14 moon bears who needed help. Moon bears are big, lovely bears with shiny black fur and a white patch on their chest that looks like a crescent moon. They love to frolic around, climb trees and munch on tasty fruits. But they were not living the happy, playful life a bear should live - they were living in a very unkind place called a bear bile farm. This place wasn't really a farm with open fields and happy animals. Instead, it was a sad, scary place where naughty people were hurting the bears to get something called bile. Bile is a liquid in the bear's tummy that helps them digest their food. Some people believe bear bile has special magic to cure sickness, even though it's not really true. To get this bile, the bad people were doing something very painful to the bears. This wasn't fair or nice and often made the bears very sick. Some poor bears even died from this terrible treatment, which is very, very sad. But guess what, kiddos? Our story takes a happy turn! One beautiful day, some brave helpers came and rescued all 14 bears from this mean farm. These helpers stopped the bad people from hurting the bears, and took the bears to a safer, kinder place where they can now live happily, playfully, just as all bears should. What's so extra special about this rescue? Well, this is the first time lots of bears were saved just because people felt it was the right thing to do. Some of the bad people realized how wrong they were, how much they were hurting the innocent bears, and willingly let the bears go to be happy and safe. It's like they finally listened to their heart that knew being good is better than being bad. From now on, these 14 moon bears will be free to do all the fun things they love - like munching on fruits, climbing trees, and of course, taking long naps under the big, shiny moon. Their rescue is a big reminder to all people to be kind to animals, to love them, and not hurt them in any way. After all, like us, animals too want to live happily and peacefully.

Question: \\"What may be described as \\"\\"a leguminous plant bearing pods that ripen underground, and contain seeds used for food and oil\\"\\"?\\" Answer:","completion":"The plant that may be described as \\"a leguminous plant bearing pods that ripen underground, and contain seeds used for food and oil\\" is the peanut, also known scientifically as Arachis hypogaea. The peanut is a fascinating plant, as it has several unique characteristics that truly set it apart from other leguminous plants and makes it an important agricultural crop worldwide. Peanuts belong to the family Fabaceae, which is a large family of flowering plants, commonly referred to as the legume, pea, or bean family. This family includes a wide variety of plants such as soybeans, chickpeas, lentils, and alfalfa, among others. However, unlike most other legumes that develop their seeds above ground, the peanut plant is unique in developing and maturing its pods underground, which is a process known as geocarpy. The peanut plant's growth starts when seeds are planted in well-drained, warm, and fertile soil. It germinates and emerges above the ground, initially appearing as a small seedling. The peanut plant grows to be approximately 1 to 1.5 feet tall and produces yellow, self-pollinating flowers. After pollination, the fertilized ovary begins to elongate and forms a specialized structure known as the \\"peg.\\" The peg continues to grow downward and is eventually pushed into the ground by the weight of the developing pod. It is in this soil-embedded state that the pod ripens and forms peanut seeds. The peanut seeds, often referred to as nuts due to their characteristics and culinary use, are rich in protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. Peanuts are a popular ingredient in various culinary dishes and snacks worldwide. They can be consumed raw, roasted, boiled, or made into spreads like peanut butter. Due to their high oil content (approximately 45–55%), peanuts are also used to produce edible oils, such as groundnut oil or peanut oil. Peanut oil is widely used in cooking and food manufacturing due to its flavor profile, stability, and high smoke point. It is considered a healthy oil option and a source of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are beneficial fats crucial for a balanced diet. Furthermore, peanuts play a significant role in animal feed and are used in the production of cosmetics, detergents, and biofuel. Overall, the peanut is an essential leguminous plant with immense agricultural, nutritional, and economic value, owing to its unique growth process and the versatile uses of its seeds and oil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: \\" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.\\" Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea. Question: Norwegian farmers and fishermen have an important influence because _ .

Yoga pants maker Lululemon reports annual sales of more than 2bn There’s a lot of money in yoga pants – even ones that not too long ago were found to be a little too revealing. Lululemon, the upmarket “athleisure” brand favoured by celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Cameron Diaz, on Wednesday reported annual sales of more than 2bn (£1.4bn). The surge in sales, up from 1.8bn the previous year, and the company’s prediction that sales could double to 4bn by 2020 sent Lululemon’s shares soaring on Wall Street. Lululemon shares, which had already increased by 16% so far this year, rose by 10.4% on Wednesday to 67.70 by lunchtime, valuing the 18-year-old Canadian company at 9.5bn. The financial success comes just two years after the company was plunged into crisis by an “unacceptable level of sheerness” in some of its up-to-98 black Luon pants, which led some yogis to display a little more than they intended while working out in their ashrams. In the wake of the see-through debacle, Lululemon withdrew 17% of its stock and its chief product officer, Sheree Waterson, resigned. However, Chip Wilson, Lululemon founder and Canada’s 17th richest person with a 2.3bn fortune, went on to blame women’s bodies for causing the problem. “Quite frankly, some women’s bodies just actually don’t work for [the pants],” Wilson told Bloomberg. “It’s really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there.” Now that women are once again happy doing a downward dogs in its pants, Lululemon is going after men with a target of 1bn in menswear sales by 2020. “The unification of men’s and women’s under one vision is really strengthening the brand, so when you think about selling global stories of functional materials and construction, we now have a platform that really is much larger than it was before,” Laurent Potdevin, Lululemon’s chief executive, said.

Steele In Their Spines In the summer of 2006, as Republican fortunes dimmed, one of the party's star Senate candidates sat down with reporters for an off-the-record lunch. Dana Milbank of The Washington Post recorded the unusually frank conversation for posterity. Far from towing the party line, the candidate blasted the Bush White House for its failures in Iraq and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. When asked if he'd want President Bush to campaign with him, the mystery man said, \\"To be honest with you, probably not.\\" As for the Congressional GOP, the candidate was harsher still. The party's most profound failure was, in his view, a failure to recognize where it had gone wrong. The candidate, we later learned, was Michael Steele, the then lieutenant governor of Maryland who eventually lost to veteran Congressman Ben Cardin in an overwhelmingly Democratic year. Milbank highlighted Steele's most striking remark from that lunch: The candidate called his Republican \\"R\\" a \\"scarlet letter.\\" Now, as the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, Steele has taken responsibility for rebuilding the Republican brand, which now stands in opposition to a popular president who is rolling up his shirtsleeves to fight the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Hailing from the heavily black middle-class suburbs of Washington, D.C., Steele is used to winning over hostile audiences. Though he lost to Cardin by a significant margin, Steele ran a shrewd campaign that was tailor-made to his state. On issues like public transportation and education, he reached out to voters who'd normally never give Republicans a hearing. On Iraq, the central issue in the campaign, he opposed withdrawal while calling for a serious rethink of U.S. strategy in the region. He came across as a results-oriented pragmatist without compromising his social conservatism, an approach that has also worked for much-lauded Republican governors like Mitch Daniels of Indiana and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. And as an African-American from a solidly Democratic state, he presented a marked contrast to the other candidates for RNC chair. Two of his most formidable opponents, Chip Saltsman and Katon Dawson, were southern conservatives who came across as racially tone-deaf if not worse. Saltsman, who helped lead Mike Huckabee's innovative campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and who served as Bill Frist's right-hand man, will forever be remembered for having included a song titled \\"Barack the Magic Negro\\" on a CD for members of the RNC. Dawson hastily resigned from an all-white South Carolina country club before entering the race for RNC chair. Whatever the intentions of either candidate, a victory for Saltsman or Dawson would have been a black eye for the party--an indication that the GOP's Big Tent was now a Pup Tent. Of course, Michael Steele can't transform the Republican party single-handedly. Fortunately, there are early indications that Republicans--even Congressional Republicans--are learning from their mistakes, and far sooner than beleaguered conservatives had any right to expect. House Minority Leader John Boehner, a man with all the charisma of a washed-up lounge singer, has emerged overnight as a conservative folk hero for uniting his party against President Obama's stimulus package. As David Brooks has ably described, the stimulus package represents an awkward marriage of long-term Democratic objectives, like pouring more money into higher education and green energy and big-ticket infrastructure projects, and short-term measures that governments at all levels will have an extremely difficult time absorbing. Many of these long-term objectives are very worthy ones that Republicans should embrace as well, particularly efforts to upgrade our physical infrastructure. Yet the speed with which this measure has been pursued means that spending discipline has gone out the window. State governments that receive billions of dollars will have no way to evaluate the efficacy of spending, and so we will find, two or three years hence, that vast sums were wasted, and indeed that vast sums fell into the wrong hands. Not only have Republicans opposed this ill-conceived free-for-all--they've actually floated a number of more attractive alternatives, including a steep payroll tax cut, a sharp increase in the child tax credit, and offering state governments loans instead of grants. The first would represent an immediate economic boon to all American workers and businesses, the second would benefit hard-hit families, and the third would force state governments to spend responsibly rather than shovel money out the door. If Republicans keep moving in this direction, by backing similarly smart policies on fighting climate change and rising health care costs, President Obama and Congressional Democrats will have a real fight on their hands. Reihan Salam is an associate editor at The Atlantic and a fellow at the New America Foundation. The co-author of Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream, he writes a weekly column for Forbes.com. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses Michael Steele's ascension to the Republican National Committee's chairman position in 2006.

Article: PolitiFact conceded GOP's plan would end Medicare's role in covering health care, but still accused Democrats of lying. Via Steve Benen, PolitiFact is hopping mad at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for its new ad calling out Republicans for voting to end Medicare, giving it the \\"dreaded\\" pants-on-fire designation. Specifically, PolitiFact says it's unfair to accuse Republicans of ending Medicare because their vote was merely an expression of a policy preference: The Republicans voted on a budget resolution that states policy preferences, but the vote did not actually change Medicare, much less end it. Uh, okay. Except the ad didn't accuse Republicans of actually accomplishing their goal of ending Medicare. It accused them of \\"voting to end Medicare.\\" In other words, it accused them of stating a policy preference. In addition, PolitiFact is ticked off that the ad claims the Republican plan would require seniors to pay 12,500 for health care coverage. That number is based on statistics compiled by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The ad doesn’t mention, though, that the number includes money that would go to Medicare in any case. The CBO estimates beneficiaries would contribute about 6,150 in premiums in 2022 if the program isn’t changed at all. So the extra money seniors need to pay under the Republican proposal is more like 6,350. So...PolitiFact agrees that the CBO estimated seniors would pay 12,500 under the GOP plan, as the ad asserted. They just think the ad should have gone the extra mile and explained that the report estimates seniors would only be paying 6,350 more than they would have otherwise. But the ad didn't say seniors would have to pay 12,500 more. It said they would have to pay 12,500 total, which is completely accurate. And finally, PolitiFact thinks it's unfair to describe the GOP proposal as being designed to \\"end Medicare.\\" But quoting from their own analysis: The Republican proposal will end the aspect of Medicare that directly covers specific services, such as hospital coverage. ... Democrats, including Obama, have said the plan would end Medicare \\"as we know it,\\" a critical qualifier. But the 30-second ad from the DCCC makes a sweeping claim without that important qualifier . I'm tempted to just leave it there, with no further explanation, but I can't resist. PolitiFact appears to be resting its entire case on a severe case of parsing and the fact that the GOP proposal wouldn't change Medicare's name. Still, even PolitiFact acknowledges that the GOP plan would fundamentally change what Medicare does, replacing it with subsidized private insurance administered by the Office of Personnel Management, a completely different agency than currently runs Medicare. According to their logic, if the FBI were replaced with a voucher program wherein citizens would receive subsidies for hiring private investigators to look into criminal activity, but the agency running the voucher program were still called the FBI, it would be unfair to say that the FBI had been ended. I guess it's their right to make that argument, but it's transparently absurd. To recap PolitiFact's case: Ending the essential services of Medicare and replacing them with subsidies administered by an entirely different agency is not the same as ending Medicare. Yes, it's true that CBO said the GOP plan would mean seniors would pay 12,500 in health care costs, but only 6,350 of that was incremental, and even though Democrats correctly stated the CBO's estimate, and even though seniors would have to pay the full amount of that estimate, they should have only focused on the incremental cost. It would be unfair to say the GOP actually ended Medicare because they merely voted to end it. Of course, that's what the ad says. All I can say to that is, I hope the GOP defends itself using PolitiFact's line of argument. It would be an electoral bonanza for Democrats. ||||| By Steve Benen The fact-checking website PolitiFact has announced its “Lie of the Year” for 2011. It made a poor, credibility-killing choice. Republicans muscled a budget through the House of Representatives in April that they said would take an important step toward reducing the federal deficit. Introduced by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the plan kept Medicare intact for people 55 or older, but dramatically changed the program for everyone else by privatizing it and providing government subsidies. Democrats pounced. Just four days after the party-line vote, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a Web ad that said seniors will have to pay 12,500 more for health care “because Republicans voted to end Medicare.” […] PolitiFact debunked the Medicare charge in nine separate fact-checks rated False or Pants on Fire, most often in attacks leveled against Republican House members. Now, PolitiFact has chosen the Democrats’ claim as the 2011 Lie of the Year. This is simply indefensible. Claims that are factually true shouldn’t be eligible for a Lie of the Year designation. It’s unnerving that we have to explain this again, but since PolitiFact appears to be struggling with the relevant details, let’s set the record straight. Medicare is a single-payer health care system offering guaranteed benefits to seniors. The House Republican budget plan intended to privatize the existing system and replace it with something very different — a voucher scheme. It would still be called “Medicare,” but it wouldn’t be Medicare. It seems foolish to have to parse the meaning of the word “end,” but if there’s a program, and it’s replaced with a different program, proponents brought an end to the original program. That’s what the verb means. I’ve been trying to think of the best analogy for this. How about this one: imagine someone owns a Ferrari. It’s expensive and drives beautifully, and the owner desperately wants to keep his car intact. Now imagine I took the car away, removed the metallic badge off the trunk that says “Ferrari,” I stuck it on a golf cart, and I handed the owner the keys. “Where’s my Ferrari?” the owner would ask. “It’s right here,” I’d respond. “This has four wheels, a steering wheel, and pedals, and it says ‘Ferrari’ right there on the back.” By PolitiFact’s reasoning, I haven’t actually replaced the car — and if you disagree, you’re a pants-on-fire liar. Indeed, reading through PolitiFact’s defense of its dubious honor, the explanation is effectively a semantics argument — its Lie of the Year, the editors argue, didn’t include the caveats and context that would make it more accurate. But let’s not forget, there were actual, demonstrable, unambiguous lies among the finalists for Lie of the Year. PolitiFact overlooked all of them. When an outlet puts “fact” in its name, the standards for accuracy are especially high. When it’s selecting a Lie of the Year, standards dictate that the falsehood should be overwhelmingly obvious and offensive. Today, PolitiFact, which relies exclusively on its credibility to affect the political discourse, ought to be ashamed of itself. Update: I’ve seen some suggestions that Paul Ryan influenced the process by stuffing the ballot box. Here’s some additional analysis on this point. Second Update: I didn’t realize this until later, but my friend John Cole used a similar car analogy two weeks ago. I guess great minds do think alike. ||||| Here’s a long, sad story about how Democrats’ basically true claim that House Republicans voted to end Medicare ended up “winning” PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year award — a development that will help the right and the GOP create their own reality as the future of the social safety net becomes a defining issue of the 2012 campaign. Back in April, House Republicans passed a budget that included a plan to phase out Medicare over several years and build in its place a subsidized, private insurance marketplace for seniors. Democrats called this a vote to “end Medicare.” You can quibble. It wasn’t a vote to end Medicare — BLAM! — all at once. But under the GOP plan, within a couple decades, the current health retirement program for old people would be gone and in its place would be an entirely different one. It would just, by political design, have the same name: Medicare. Ignoring policy in favor of process, and with an eye toward political balance, PolitiFact rated this basically true Democratic claim “Pants on Fire.” Liberals, economists, health policy experts, and yours truly objected strongly to PolitiFact’s conclusion. But instead of rethinking their conclusion, the PolitiFact turned the opprobrium into a badge of honor: The claim itself became a candidate for PolitiFact’s “Lie of the Year” contest; Paul Ryan — the House GOP budget chairman who authored the plan — engaged in a modest ballot stuffing campaign; and the Democrats’ true “lie” came in third place, just behind the GOP claim that the stimulus created zero jobs, and Sen. Jon Kyl’s claim that abortion services are “well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.” But you can’t be a fact checking organization and leave epistemic questions up to voters. So PolitiFact made a choice. And of those three frontrunners, they selected the only one with any truth behind it. The reaction from Republicans has been muted so far — a sign, perhaps, that they don’t want to reopen this old wound. But back in their districts, when constituents grill them, Republicans will now have a compelling citation. It just happens to be a sham. ||||| Republicans muscled a budget through the House of Representatives in April that they said would take an important step toward reducing the federal deficit. Introduced by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the plan kept Medicare intact for people 55 or older, but dramatically changed the program for everyone else by privatizing it and providing government subsidies. Democrats pounced. Just four days after the party-line vote, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a Web ad that said seniors will have to pay 12,500 more for health care \\"because Republicans voted to end Medicare.\\" Rep. Steve Israel of New York, head of the DCCC, appeared on cable news shows and declared that Republicans voted to \\"terminate Medicare.\\" A Web video from the Agenda Project, a liberal group, said the plan would leave the country \\"without Medicare\\" and showed a Ryan look-alike pushing an old woman in a wheelchair off a cliff. And just last month, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sent a fundraising appeal that said: \\"House Republicans’ vote to end Medicare is a shameful act of betrayal.\\" After two years of being pounded by Republicans with often false charges about the 2010 health care law, the Democrats were turning the tables. PolitiFact debunked the Medicare charge in nine separate fact-checks rated False or Pants on Fire, most often in attacks leveled against Republican House members. Now, PolitiFact has chosen the Democrats’ claim as the 2011 Lie of the Year. It’s the third year in a row that a health care claim has won the dubious honor. In 2009, the winner was the Republicans’ charge that the Democrats’ health care plan included \\"death panels.\\" In 2010, it was that the plan was a \\"government takeover of health care.\\" A complicated and wonky subject with life-or-death consequences, health care is fertile ground for falsehoods. The Democratic attack about \\"ending Medicare\\" was a pervasive line in 2011 that preyed on seniors' worries about whether they could afford health care. Even when explained accurately, the Republicans’ Medicare plan was not particularly popular with the public, nor with some independent health policy analysts. But the plan was distorted and attacked again and again. \\"In terms of creating a national conversation about fiscal reform, the last thing we need is demagoguing attacks against people who have put forward serious policy proposals,\\" said Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \\"It’s very worrying.\\" A persistent falsehood With a few small tweaks to their attack lines, Democrats could have been factually correct, said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \\"I actually think there is no need to cut out the qualifiers and exaggerate,\\" he said. At times, Democrats and liberal groups were careful to characterize the Republican plan more accurately. Another claim in the ad from the Agenda Project said the plan would \\"privatize\\" Medicare, which received a Mostly True rating from PolitiFact. President Barack Obama was also more precise with his words, saying the Medicare proposal \\"would voucherize the program and you potentially have senior citizens paying 6,000 more.\\" But more often, Democrats and liberals overreached: • They ignored the fact that the Ryan plan would not affect people currently in Medicare -- or even the people 55 to 65 who would join the program in the next 10 years. • They used harsh terms such as \\"end\\" and \\"kill\\" when the program would still exist, although in a privatized system. • They used pictures and video of elderly people who clearly were too old to be affected by the Ryan plan. The DCCC video that aired four days after the vote featured an elderly man who had to take a job as a stripper to pay his medical bills. \\"Both parties use entitlements as political weapons,\\" Ryan said in an interview with PolitiFact. \\"Republicans do it to Democrats; Democrats do it to Republicans. So I knew that this would be a political weapon that the other side would use against us.\\" Liberal bloggers and columnists contend it's accurate to say Republicans voted to end Medicare. Left-leaning websites such as Talking Points Memo, Daily Kos, and The New Republic said PolitiFact's analysis was wrong, as did New York Times columnist Paul Krugman. \\"According to (PolitiFact's) logic, if the FBI were replaced with a voucher program wherein citizens would receive subsidies for hiring private investigators to look into criminal activity, but the agency running the voucher program were still called the FBI, it would be unfair to say that the FBI had been ended,\\" wrote Jed Lewison for Daily Kos. \\"I guess it's their right to make that argument, but it's transparently absurd.\\" In a blog post, the DCCC stood by its claim, saying the ad accurately stated Ryan's plan would \\"abolish\\" Medicare. But PolitiFact was not alone. Other independent fact-checkers also said the claim was false. \\"Medicare would remain an entitlement program, but it would also be more costly to future beneficiaries. It would not end,\\" noted FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker concluded that while there’s \\"a worthwhile debate\\" about whether Ryan’s proposal should be adopted, \\"it is not true to claim Republicans are trying to ‘kill’ Medicare.\\" The Democratic attacks struck a chord. Polls showed voters were skeptical of the Ryan plan and want Medicare to remain largely the way it is now. That may be why the plan has virtually no prospects of passing the Senate, which voted to shelve the plan. President Obama has indicated he would veto any changes to Medicare that would privatize the program and substantially shift costs to beneficiaries. How the Ryan plan would work Under the current Medicare system, the government pays the health care bills for Americans over age 65. Under the Ryan plan, future beneficiaries would be given a credit and invited to shop for an approved plan on a Medicare health insurance exchange. It received overwhelming support from Republicans in a House vote on a budget blueprint. Starting in 2022, beneficiaries would receive \\"premium support payments\\" from the government to help pay for the private insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money, and high earners would get a little less. The plan has some guarantees for coverage, although seniors would have to pay more to get the benefits they receive today, according to an analysis completed earlier this year by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The guarantees: Ryan's plan requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would comply with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the health plans of federal employees. The Medicare eligibility age would rise from 65 to 67, an idea that has received some bipartisan support in the past. The CBO found that it would save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for the same benefits. Ryan says the plan would offer more choice for Medicare participants and increase competition among private insurers to drive down cost. \\"I’m a big believer in patient-centered choice, where the beneficiary is the prime decision-maker, which drives competition and innovation, and that’s missing from the status quo, to a large degree,\\" he said. It’s not the first time it’s been suggested that Medicare be changed from its current fee-for-service, where the government pays all the bills, to one that uses private insurers. In the past, some Democrats have even favored such proposals, especially if -- unlike the Ryan plan -- the support was linked to medical inflation, or there were an option for traditional Medicare, or there were more explicit protections for consumers. Just last week, Ryan agreed to a new framework with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. Their proposal uses Ryan’s idea for private insurers and exchanges, but it leaves traditional Medicare as an option. Private insurers already offer Medicare plans under the program Medicare Advantage, though those plans have proven more expensive than traditional Medicare, not less. The partisan split on health care reveals the contradictions of congressional debate. Republicans were staunchly against the insurance exchanges in the federal health care law. But they endorsed them in the Ryan proposal, even as Democrats switched to oppose the plan. \\"Ryan basically proposed the Affordable Care Act for future seniors,\\" said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who advised both President Obama and Republican Mitt Romney on health care. \\"I don't understand how you can like it for future seniors but not like it for today's needy uninsured. That doesn't make any sense.\\" 'Scaring 85-year-olds' Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert on campaign advertising who directs the Annenberg center at the University of Pennsylvania, says Democrats have been using falsehoods and exaggerations about Medicare and Social Security since at least 1952. She calls it the longest-running \\"Democratic deception.\\" It fits with a core theme from Democrats that they will use government to protect seniors and needy people, while Republicans supposedly want to cut those programs, she says. It is a scare tactic that works. \\"If you're reliant on Medicare, a suggestion your benefits are going to be cut in any way is a direct, visceral threat,\\" said Jamieson. Republicans actually used a version of the attack in 2010, claiming Democrats cut 500 billion from Medicare to pay for Obama's health care law; the law actually sought to reduce the growth of future spending with a series of efficiency measures. But historically, attacks about Medicare have come from Democrats. In the 1950s and 1960s, Democrats used images of Social Security cards being torn in half to suggest that Republicans wanted to cut the program. In 1995, Democrats said House Speaker Newt Gingrich's plan to restructure Medicare would force seniors to pay more and would \\"wreck\\" Medicare. President Bill Clinton vetoed the Republicans' Medicare bill, and used the issue to pummel GOP nominee Bob Dole in the 1996 campaign. Gingrich complained at the time that \\"Medicare is the one issue the left believes they can lie about and demagogue.\\" He described the Democrats as \\"totally morally bankrupt\\" and said, \\"They are reduced to scaring 85-year-olds.\\" The scare tactics are effective because seniors worry about being able to pay their medical bills and Medicare is a vital program for them. Also, seniors represent a large, up-for-grabs voting bloc. Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said, \\"If you can scare seniors that something is going to happen to those programs, there is potentially a huge payoff in votes.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"PolitiFact, a fact-checking website, has accused the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) of lying in their recent ad that claims Republicans voted to end Medicare. However, the ad accuses Republicans of \\"voting to end Medicare\\", which PolitiFact itself acknowledges as a policy preference, leading many to argue that there is no lie. Furthermore, PolitiFact also agrees with the ad's assertion that seniors would have to pay 12,500 for health care under the GOP plan but is unhappy that the ad does not mention that the amount includes funds that would go to Medicare regardless. In conclusion, PolitiFact's case seems to rest on semantics rather than substantial inaccuracies, and its claims that the ad is a \\"lie\\" may actually benefit the Democrats since it could lead to an electoral advantage if Republicans attempt to use PolitiFact's argument as their defense."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"The process of dieting refers to the management or alteration of food intake in order to control body weight. During dieting, you may consume less food, adopt a specific type of nutrition plan, or even intermittently fast. Different types of diets can have varying effects on digestion. Now let's see how dieting may influence digestion, and especially the second effect you mentioned - the role of the tongue in pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth: 1. Less Food Consumption: When you eat less food while dieting, there will naturally be less material for the digestive system to process. Thus, overall digestion would likely be less intense as there is less food to break down. Regarding the specific role of the tongue, its job of moving food around during chewing would be 'less' affected. The tongue would still push food around while chewing, but there may be less food to move around and, therefore, the action may be less frequent or less intensive. 2. Specific Nutritional Plans: Some diets emphasize specific types of food (e.g., high-fiber, low-carb, etc.). These might influence digestion depending on which nutrients are emphasized or minimized. For instance, a high-fiber diet could actually stimulate digestion by promoting the movement of food through the digestive tract. On the other hand, a low-carb diet might slow it. In these instances, the tongue's role in moving food around when chewing could be 'more' or 'less' affected depending on the type of diet and consistency of the eaten food. 3. Fasting: In the case of intermittent fasting (not eating for a certain number of hours each day), digestion could be affected in various ways. On fasting periods, less food would be processed, decreasing the activities of digestion, including the tongue's action. While on eating periods, the tongue could work 'more' intensively as one might tend to eat larger meals within the limited eating time frame. Therefore, it is evident that dieting could result in both 'more,' 'less,' or 'no change' to the tongue's activity due to the complex influence of different diet types on the process of digestion. It’s difficult to identify a universal effect of dieting on this aspect of digestion, as this depends on the specific dieting strategy and the individual’s response to it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: 100 Days Movie plot: The film opens with a young woman, Devi (Madhuri Dixit), who gets sudden vision (usually accompanied with a mild panic attack) of incidents and accidents that are yet to happen.[2] Devi has a vision of her sister Rama (Moon Moon Sen) being murdered. Her college friends Sudha Mathur (Sabeeha) and Sunil (Javed Jaffrey) try to help her sort through her visions but to little avail. Devi is relieved after she talks to her sister and finds that she is alive. However, just some time later, Rama is murdered in the same way as Devi had pictured. The murderer hides Rama's body in a mansion's wall. Rama is reported missing. Devi firmly believes Rama is dead. Five years later, Devi moves to her uncle (Ajit Vachani)'s home where she eventually meets and is courted by millionaire businessman Ram Kumar (Jackie Shroff). Sunil, who was secretly in love with Devi, is deeply disappointed. Devi and Ram marry and enter his family mansion, which he has re-earned after a legal battle. Little known to anybody, this is the same mansion where Rama was buried. When Devi starts having the visions again, Rama's skeleton is not the only thing that will come tumbling out. Devi sees a wall in the mansion being torn down. Devi tears down the wall, only to find a skeleton tumbling out of it. Devi knows whose skeleton it is: it's Rama's, since she had a necklace similar to Devi's. Also, the dead woman's skeleton is roughly same height as that of Rama. The Inspector (Shivaji Satam) quickly points out that since the mansion was closed when Rama disappeared, anyone could have hidden a dead body in there and nobody would know the truth.

San Diego (CNN)As you're driving along the highway, wouldn't you like to know if there's a police car up ahead so you can slow down and avoid getting a ticket? You'd also probably like to know if there's a speed trap around the next corner, so you don't wind up spending your weekend at traffic school. Well, there's an app for that. Police chiefs, sheriffs and law enforcement groups wish there wasn't. They say they want to protect the lives of police officers, but what if they're just trying to protect the revenue that flows into government coffers due to speeding tickets? Waze is a new and controversial mobile app that tracks cars moving through traffic in real time and shares that information so users can get around traffic jams. This sounds harmless. But there is more. The app also uses a small icon of a tiny face in a police hat to warn users if police are nearby, either in speed traps or parked on the side the road. It obtains that information when other users who are driving further up the road input data into the system. It's ingenious -- and for law enforcement personnel, also frustrating. Police chiefs and sheriffs are not amused at this high-tech example of information-sharing. In fact, they're determined to put a stop to it. Law enforcement leaders claim to be concerned about officer safety. After all, lately, officers have been gunned down simply for wearing a uniform. They say they're worried about everyday citizens keeping track of the comings and goings of officers, and they insist that the app is a high-tech \\"police stalker.\\" They claim that this technology -- while helpful to motorists -- turns officers into \\"sitting ducks\\" for criminals. The folks at Waze, for their part, insist that the app improves the safety of roadways because most users tend to drive more carefully when they think police are nearby. That sounds reasonable. It also sounds as if police doth protest too much, and that they're not telling us the whole truth as to what they're really concerned about. It's not as if motorists can't often times spot police cars and adjust their speed without the help of an app; often, the patrol cars are in plain view on the side of the road. Likewise, those who want to harm law enforcement officers will find a way to do so regardless of what app is or isn't on the market. It's easy to see why Waze -- which was purchased by Google in 2013 for 966 million -- is so popular. There is a huge appetite for this technology. Potential customers include anyone who hates speed traps -- and that probably covers most Americans. In fact, there have been cases where individuals have tried to warn motorists about an oncoming speed trap and the police have come down hard on the good Samaritans. Luckily, the courts have, in turn, come down hard on the police, citing a First Amendment right to alert others as to the presence of police. In February 2014, for example, a county judge in Frisco, Texas, about an hour north of Dallas, reportedly dismissed a complaint against 33-year-old Ron Martin who was arrested for holding a sign warning drivers of a speed trap. The sign read: \\"Police Ahead.\\" The charge was ridiculous but creative: a misdemeanor count of violating the city's sign ordinance. It's not just signs that are protected speech. Signals are covered too. A few days before the Texas ruling, in St. Louis, a federal judge ruled that motorists \\"have a First Amendment right to flash their headlights to warn\\" fellow drivers that police are nearby or setting a speed trap. In 2012, Michael Elli flashed his headlights to warn oncoming vehicles that police were waiting with radar just up the road. A police officer pulled over Elli, citing him for \\"flashing lights on certain vehicles...warning of RADAR ahead.\\" The city dropped the charge, but the American Civil Liberties Union decided to sue on Elli's behalf, charging that his First Amendment rights were violated. The judge agreed. Let's hear it for common sense. Speed traps are, by their very nature, a form of cheating. Law enforcement officers are bending the rules to hand out tickets. Worse, they're also an example of government-sponsored thievery. Cash-strapped cities and counties have come up with new ways of generating revenue. One of the first places they look are unsuspecting motorists who are in a poor position to complain because -- the authorities are likely to claim -- they wouldn't have received a ticket in the first place if they weren't guilty of speeding. But what are the authorities guilty of? If police have a quota to meet, or a sheriff's substation is competing with other substations as to the number of tickets it hands out, discretion will suffer. People who might not normally get a citation are going to be written up. That's not right. It's one thing for police officers to come across someone speeding in the course of their normal duties, and write that person a ticket. It's another for them to lie in wait for motorists to make mistakes so the government agency they work for can fleece the citizenry. That's not right either. When police set up a speed trap where motorists are likely to be driving over the speed limit -- say, at the bottom of a hill -- and then wait for drivers to meander into their web so they can write tickets that generate revenue for a city, county or state, they're violating a social contract. Those who have sworn an oath to protect us aren't supposed to prey upon us. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Q:Shortly after five, the hospital called. More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Sam McKeon for the following movie plot: After witnessing gangster Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes to death in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without being provoked, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in the bathroom, and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane.

Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman receive their draft cards and Frank Zappa tells them to seek advice from Herb Cohen, Zappa's manager and Kaylan's cousin, to avoid being drafted in the Vietnam War. Cohen advises Kaylan to show up to the draft board intoxicated from drug use, not to bathe or sleep, and to behave so obnoxiously that the Army will not draft him, leading Kaylan and Volman to engage in a sleepless night of marijuana smoking before their draft review, which they fail due to being high while taking the tests, and Kaylan pretending to be homosexual in front of the physician and expressing psychotic views to the psychiatrist. Because they avoid the draft, the Turtles fly to England where Graham Nash and Donovan play them an advance reel to reel recording of the unreleased Beatles album Sgt.

Recommendation: Congressional oversight for intelligence-and counterterrorism-is now dysfunctional. Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.

WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

Apple: Bring us your weird, 3rd-party and counterfeit chargers FORTUNE — The news media had a field day last month reporting the death by electrocution of a Chinese flight attendant, apparently after she answered her iPhone while it was still plugged into a third-party charger. A Google Search for “Chinese iPhone electrocution” turned up more than 3 million results. Let’s see what the press does with the USB Power Adapter Takeback Program that Apple AAPL announced on Tuesday. Recent reports have suggested that some counterfeit and third party adapters may not be designed properly and could result in safety issues. While not all third party adapters have an issue, we are announcing a USB Power Adapter Takeback Program to enable customers to acquire properly designed adapters. Customer safety is a top priority at Apple. That’s why all of our products — including USB power adapters for iPhone, iPad, and iPod — undergo rigorous testing for safety and reliability and are designed to meet government safety standards around the world. Starting August 16, 2013, if you have concerns about any of your USB power adapters, you can drop them off at an Apple Retail Store or at an Apple Authorized Service Provider. We will ensure that these adapters are disposed of in an environmentally friendly way. If you need a replacement adapter to charge your iPhone, iPad, or iPod, we recommend getting an Apple USB power adapter. For a limited time, you can purchase one Apple USB power adapter at a special price — 10 USD or approximate equivalent in local currency. To qualify, you must turn in at least one USB power adapter and bring your iPhone, iPad, or iPod to an Apple Retail Store or participating Apple Authorized Service Provider for serial number validation. The special pricing on Apple USB power adapters is limited to one adapter for each iPhone, iPad, and iPod you own and is valid until October 18, 2013.

Goldstein Historic Devices for Hearing Collection Speculation about a supposed time traveller talking on her cell phone at a 1928 Hollywood film premiere has sped across the Internet faster than a DeLorean time machine. But a less mind-bending possibility is that she was just hard of hearing, experts say. The story first surfaced in a YouTube video that includes film footage showing the 1928 premiere of the Charlie Chaplin film \\"The Circus\\" at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Cali. Irish filmmaker George Clarke points out a woman in the old footage holding what he describes as a cell phone against her ear. The shape implies the woman is a time traveler using a modern mobile device rather than an ear trumpet, Clarke said. What Clarke didn't consider was that a simple ear trumpet could still explain it all, said hearing device historians, who provided LiveScience with images of sample ear trumpets for comparison. [See the ear trumpets] \\"As you can tell from these, old-fashioned mechanical or resonating hearing aids were not necessarily long and rounded,\\" said Philip Skroska, an archivist at the Bernard Becker Medical Library of Washington University in St. Louis. \\"Short, compact rectangular forms were not unusual.\\" In other words, they could look something like a cell phone to imaginative YouTube viewers in the 21st century. [Time Travel Machine Outlined] Listen to this 19th-century resonator hearing aids such as ear trumpets were still made in large numbers well into the first decades of the 20th century, Skroska explained, and the basic designs didn't change much aside from incorporating newer, plastic-like materials. \\"Besides, I would expect this woman to be over 50 years old, so using a late 19th century design in 1928 would not be a stretch I think,\\" Skroska said. Electronic hearing aids also existed before World War II, but in fewer numbers. \\"Now, I can't really explain why the woman appears to be talking (other than yelling at the man who quickened his pace ahead of her),\\" Skroska said in an e-mail. \\"But I think it's fair to say it would be a hasty judgment to dismiss the possibility that it was a hearing aid she was holding up to her ear.\\" This explanation might be less exciting than the time travel theory, but it avoids a huge number of theoretical and practical problems associated with sending someone into the past. Time travel issues Theorists have kicked around a few scenarios for how people might travel to the past, said Brian Greene, author of the bestseller, \\"The Elegant Universe\\" (Vintage Books, 2000) and a physicist at Columbia University, during a past LiveScience interview. \\"And almost all of them, if you look at them closely, brush up right at the edge of physics as we understand it. Most of us think that almost all of them can be ruled out.\\" One theory focuses on wormholes – hypothetical tunnels that connect two regions of space-time that could represent two parts of the same universe, or even completely different universes. But creating a wormhole that punches through space-time looks far beyond anything humans can accomplish with today's technology, said Michio Kaku, author of \\"Hyperspace\\" (Anchor, 1995) and \\"Parallel Worlds\\" (Anchor, 2006), and a physicist at the City University of New York, in a past interview. Humans would need to somehow harness the energy of a star or possibly matter with negative energy density – an exotic and hypothetical form of matter with the energy of less than nothing. Even if such matter exists, there would likely not be enough of it for a time machine to harness. Another time travel theory relies upon cosmic strings – narrow tubes of energy that span the entire length of the expanding universe. Predictions suggest that such regions could contain huge amounts of mass and warp space-time in a way that allows for time travel. The cosmic strings either run on infinitely or form loops \\"like spaghetti or SpaghettiO's,\\" said Richard Gott, author of \\"Time Travel in Einstein's Universe\\" (Mariner Books, 2002) and an astrophysicist at Princeton University. Two such strings parallel to one another could perhaps bend space-time enough to make time travel possible – but it's a challenge that only a \\"super civilization\\" might try, Gott explained in a past interview. Not what it seems Any pathways that could theoretically allow for time travel between points in space-time have never been seen, according to Charles Liu, an astrophysicist at the City University of New York, College of Staten Island, and co-author on the book \\"One Universe: At Home in the Cosmos\\" (Joseph Henry Press, 1999). Besides being \\"very unlikely to exist at all,\\" such pathways are \\"even less likely to be able to transport anything larger than a subatomic particle intact,\\" Liu said. People of the present also have a track record of trying to fit what they see to known patterns, Liu pointed out. He added that it was no surprise for 21st-century people to see what they think is a cell phone in 1928, just as people claimed to see faces on Mars or the Virgin Mary in toast. \\"So I'm going to bed tonight confident that the person was not a time traveler from the future,\\" Liu said in an e-mail yesterday. ||||| Search Famecrawler: writes a humor blog, called The Mommyologist , all about the changes in life that go along with being a parent.

Information: - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. - Japyx is a genus of diplurans belonging to the family Japygidae . These eyeless , predatory hexapods largely shun direct sunlight , remaining under stones and among detritus , where they use pincer - like cerci to catch their tiny prey . - Earwigs make up the insect order Dermaptera and are found on all continents except Antarctica. With about 2,000 species in 12 families, they are one of the smaller insect orders. Earwigs have characteristic cerci, a pair of forceps-like pincers on their abdomen, and membranous wings folded underneath short forewings, hence the scientific order name, \\"skin wings\\". Some groups are tiny parasites on mammals and lack the typical pincers. Earwigs rarely use their flying ability. - The japygids (family Japygidae) are a taxon of hexapods, of the order Diplura. In this family, the paired cerci at the end of their abdomens are pincer-like (superficially similar to the unrelated earwigs) and are used to catch their tiny prey. Seventy genera are recognised, divided among seven subfamilies. - The order Diplura is one of the four groups of hexapods, alongside insects, springtails and Protura. They are sometimes called \\"two-pronged bristletails\\". Around 800 species have been described, of which around 70 occur in North America, 12 in Great Britain and two in Australia.

Erin's grandfather had served in the army during World War II, and Elena's father was a retired Marine. They both understood the importance of honoring and remembering those who had sacrificed their lives for the freedom and safety of their country. As they walked through the vast, hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery, they were struck by the sheer magnitude of the number of small white tombstones that stretched for miles, each intricately adorned with the symbols, names, and details of the fallen soldiers. It was a sight that evoked a strong feeling of reverence and respect, combined with a somber reminder of the great cost of war. Continuing further into the cemetery, they stumbled upon the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a monument dedicated to the unidentified and unaccounted-for service members throughout the years. They watched in awe as the precisely coordinated Changing of the Guard ceremony took place, led by the stoic members of the elite 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, known as The Old Guard. Erin and Elena couldn't help but feel emotionally stirred by the grace and solemnity of the ritual, which was a powerful symbol of the undying commitment to honor those who had given their lives in service. As they ventured deeper into the memorial park, they came across the Arlington House, the former home of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The historic mansion now stood as a museum and a testament to the complexities of American war history, housing artifacts, and exhibits detailing the lives of the people who once occupied its rooms. Erin and Elena spent hours exploring the house, soaking in the wealth of information, and contemplating the many layers of history and sacrifice that surrounded them. After leaving Arlington House, they wandered towards the Women in Military Service for America Memorial. This extraordinary exhibit honored the role of women in the armed forces, dating back to the American Revolution. As they browsed the countless displays and tributes to groundbreaking female military leaders, they were reminded of the strength and courage that women have displayed throughout the years, often in the face of extraordinary adversity. As the sun began to set over the Arlington National Cemetery, Erin and Elena decided to pay their respects to the victims of the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon. At the memorial site, they were greeted by 184 illuminated benches, each bearing the name of a person lost, suspended gracefully over tranquil pools of water. In the stillness of the evening air, they shared a moment of silence, letting the reality of the tragedy and the sacrifices made on that day wash over them. With heavy hearts and an immense sense of gratitude, Erin and Elena left the Arlington Veterans Memorial that day, their lives forever touched by the stories and spirit of the brave men and women they had come to honor. They resolved to make their trip to the memorial an annual tradition, not only to pay their respects to those who had fallen but to remind themselves of the power and resilience of the human spirit, and the sacrifices made by countless individuals in their pursuit of a better world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As he, a few friends, and his younger brother Randy (Ian Petrella) look into the display window of a local store, Ralphie has his eyes set on the only item he wants for Christmas; an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle, with a compass in the stock and \\"this thing which tells time\\" (a sundial).Knowing full well that he could never request this item openly to his parents, Ralphie sneaks advertisements for the gun into his parents' magazines the next morning. At the breakfast table, he fails to bring up the subject in casual conversation, and with less subtlety than was intended. He then accidentally lets slip his desire to his mother (Melinda Dillon) who immediately rejects the idea with the dreaded phrase: \\"you'll shoot your eye out.\\"Disappointed, Ralphie enjoys a reverie about how he alone, armed with his gun, stands between his family and a gang of stripe-shirted ruffians in a Western-style standoff. Meanwhile his grouchy father (Darren McGavin) is forced to battle the temperamental house furnace in the basement amid a slur of inaudible curses.While walking through the frozen, snow-covered neighborhood on his way to school, Ralphie meets up his two friends, Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R.D. Robb), while Randy lags behind, heavily bundled under a thick, wool snow jumper that leaves his arms sticking straight out. Before class, Flick and Schwartz argue over what would happen should someone stick their tongue to a frozen flag pole, engaging in a delicate nuance of phrase during which Schwartz dares Flick to stick his tongue to the pole. Upon the dreaded triple-dog-dare, Flick puts his tongue to the pole to find it stuck tight. He starts screaming but the others run into school as the bell rings. Their...

The hip-hop star is up for album of the year for To Pimp A Butterfly, a dense, detailed trawl of black music, US politics and his personal demons. His competition comes from Taylor Swift, whose pop smash 1989 is finally nominated, a year after its release. It came out too late to be eligible for last year's awards, a fate which has befallen Adele's 25 this time around. Swift ties with R&B star The Weeknd for second place, with seven nominations apiece, while Ed Sheeran and James Bay represent the UK. Sheeran is up for two of the major prizes - song of the year and record of the year - for his emotive ballad Thinking Out Loud. The former award goes to the writers (in this case Sheeran and Amy Wadge), while the record of the year category takes into account the performance and production of a hit song. Other nominees for song of the year include The Weeknd's breakthrough hit Can't Feel My Face and Mark Ronson's global smash Uptown Funk. Swift is nominated for the tongue-in-cheek single Blank Space, as is Lamar for Alright, the hope-filled centrepiece of his album. The shortlist for the four main categories is as follows: Best album Song of the Year Record of the Year Best new artist See the full list on Grammy.com Lamar's domination of the shortlist is \\"a testimony to his artistry,\\" said Neil Portnow, head of the Recording Academy. \\"He's someone that's very serious about his art and about his craft, and has been working it for quite some time. And this is one of those instances where the work pays off.\\" The hip-hop artist's other nominations include best rap album and best pop duo/group performance for Bad Blood - a remix of one of the tracks on Swift's 1989. He is also shortlisted twice for best rap song, including Kanye West's All Day, which he co-wrote - along with 18 other credited performers, which could make an interesting moment on stage if West wins. Among the most prestigious awards in music, the Grammys feature an exhaustive 83 categories in 30 genres, including the likes of best tropical Latin album and best jazz improvisation. Outside the main categories, the late Amy Winehouse is up for her seventh Grammy thanks to Asif Kapadia's revealing documentary on her life; while a deluxe reissue of The Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers is up for best box set. Justin Bieber, who had been considered a contender for some of the main prizes, only gets one nomination, for best dance recording; while Rihanna also misses out, despite her Paul McCartney duet FourFiveSeconds being tipped as a nomine for song of the year.

Sergeant Blackman is said to have been devastated by the death of his wheelchair-bound father shortly before the tour of Afghanistan that was to end in shame. Brian Blackman, 73, was suffering from Parkinson’s disease and died in January 2011. A friend said it had a huge impact on his son, who tragically had been caught in traffic and unable make it to his father’s bedside to be with him as he died. It was against this emotional backdrop of regret and grief that the commando deployed to Afghanistan. Those close to him believe this played a part in the ‘moment of madness’ that ended in the execution of a Taliban fighter – and murder conviction more than two years later. Scroll down for video. Emotional: Alexander Blackman with his wheelchair-bound father Brian who died shortly before his tour of duty. Footage: The incident in which Blackman killed a Taliban militant was caught on camera by another Marine. Ironically, Blackman was a model soldier, a war hero with an exceptional record who had served in a number of conflicts. He proved his courage on six gruelling tours of duty in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. And in 2001 he was part of the hunt for Bin Laden. He was among Marines flown in to help Special Forces as they fought Al Qaeda gunmen in Bora Bora. Blackman’s closest brush with death came on his tour to Iraq, when he miraculously survived being hit by a grenade during the assault on Basra. Identified: Sergeant Alexander Blackman has been revealed as the Royal Marine who was last month convicted a murdering an Afghan insurgent. Fighting had been intense, with an. officer describing the area as a scene from Dante’s Inferno. While. leading the assault on Basra, Iraq’s second city in a military vehicle,. his rucksack containing ammunition, water and rations was hit by the. warhead of a rocket propelled grenade in an ambush on his vehicle. Marines dived for cover as bullets and RPGs raining down on them, and one rocket smashed into his kit bag diverting it just past his head while bullets burst around them. After the attack, his fellow commandos could not believe that Blackman had not been killed. Despite the difficult campaign – which saw Marines locked in some of the fiercest fighting experienced by British forces – his combat report is said to have been ‘exemplary’ and he was recommended for promotion. His family in Brighton – his father, a former porter and lorry driver, his mother Frances, 74, a former hairdresser, brother and two sisters knew his love of the Marines and the lifestyle they offered. Blackman, a keen cyclist, runner and golfer, excelled while studying sports and physical education at Lewes Tertiary College in East Sussex. He had ambitions of representing Great Britain at canoeing until, aged 17, he was knocked down by a car while cycling. Desperate to challenge himself, he enlisted in the Royal Marines in 1998, passing the arduous tests with flying colours. Tours of Northern Ireland were followed by training in the US and Oman, and in November 2007 he deployed to southern Afghanistan. After returning from that tour he married Claire Warner, 38, an assistant director of operations with the National Trust in Somerset and Gloucestershire, and they settled in Taunton. Incident: The footage filmed by Marine B's helmet camera formed part of the court martial hearing. Revealed: Footage of the incident with Blackman's face uncensored has just been released for the first time. Highly regarded by senior officers,. Blackman had joined 42 Commando and J [Juliet] Company, known for its. discipline, fortitude and bravery – and members were tested to the full. during their six-month spring tour in spring 2011. He had previously seen some action in Afghanistan during the quieter winter months. But this deployment – later named the ‘Tour from hell’ by his colleagues – them attacked almost daily. Despite this hostility, the imposing 6ft 3in Blackman was credited with fostering ‘hearts and minds’ of the local population and helping oversee projects such as the building of a school. But the gruelling impact of losing friends and colleagues was to take its toll. During the proceedings leading up to his conviction for murder, Blackman said around 20 of his friends had been killed or maimed during the tour, including a popular young officer and a marine who had previously won a Military Cross for courage under fire. Film: The Marine could be heard quoting Shakespeare as he shot the Taliban prisoner. Trauma: Friends of Blackman have blamed the incident on the horrors he experienced while on duty. He said other comrades had suffered ‘life-changing’ injuries and described the effect the deaths had on commandos after the body parts of friends were hung in trees by insurgents. ‘It’s not a nice thing for the lads,’ he said. ‘Close friends they have lived with have been killed and parts of their bodies are displayed as a kind of trophy for the world to see.’ The Marines returned home as heroes, with Blackman earmarked for promotion to Colour Sergeant. It would have remained that way had a commando not been arrested by civilian police more than a year later and chilling head camera footage of the Helmand execution discovered on his laptop.

Plot title: Shaitani Ilaaka Movie plot: A grotesque brougham stops in a dark forest and its cowled driver, Lalbai the sorceress, beckons to the bewitched passenger, a newly wed bride. Lalbai leads the bride to the shaitani ilaaka (devil's domain) where she is roused from her spell. The bride is sacrificed, screaming and kicking, at the altar of her aka (the Shaitan, or great devil). Shaitan is an ancient and fearsome demon. Years ago, he roamed free and indiscriminately terrorized the local townsfolk. But he was ultimately defeated, reduced to a formless soul, and held, by a magic charm, to remain imprisoned forever within the shaitani ilaaka. Lalbai brings him a fresh bride every Amavasya night. Shaitan consumes the blood of this bride, and grows stronger with each offering, until he can break the charm, restore all his evil powers and ravage the world again. At the affluent home of rich industrialist Thakur, he has a wife, Roma, and their six-year old daughter, Anju. They have retained a governess, Shalaka, for Anju. Anju seems to be a happy child with one exception. She experiences strange convulsions and horrible nightmares every Amavasya night. Thakur decides to bring her to Dr. Yograj, a medical man who has attained Siddhi through rigorous spiritual training. Dr. Yograj examines Anju from a medical standpoint, but also notices strange telekinetic events when Anju is in his office. Later, at the home, he observes phenomena that strongly indicate a poltergeist. When he talks to Shalaka, she firmly snubs him. (Unbeknownst to the family however, Shalaka practices voodoo with Anju as the target.) Dr. Yograj refers Thakur to a famed Tantrik Baba (wise man), recently returned from Tibet after an extended spiritual course, for help. Baba visits the home, inspects Anju's room, and immediately identifies it as the work of a malevolent aatma (soul).

The film follows the lives of four childhood friends: Joon-seok, the leader of the group and whose father is a powerful mob boss; Dong-su, whose father is an undertaker; class clown Jung-ho; and Sang-taek, who was an exemplary student. As children they play together, sell sexually explicit pictures cut from a magazine, and wonder if a South Korean Olympic swimmer could outrace a sea turtle. Jung-ho also showed the rest of them a VCR that his mother had, and this film he found on it. It turns out to be a pornographic movie, and the boys are entranced while arguing over what a \\"menstruation\\" was, with them believing that it was the word that adults used to describe the \\"vagina\\".Fast forward to high school, where they are reunited after separating during middle school. They become smitten with the lead singer of a band of girls their age. Joon-seok invites the band to a party at his house, where each boy pairs off with one girl (though not after some tension over how to do so). Sang-taek receives his first kiss from the lead singer, Jin-sook.Back in school, Joon-seok and Dong-su get in trouble after a confrontation with a teacher; After their friends convince them to go apologize, they are only off with a light suspension. During an outing to the movies, where Sang-taek catches the eye of another school kid whom he had picked a fight with earlier, Joon-seok and Dong-su fend off a whole rival school while Jung-ho protects Sang-taek. Dong-su, after the fight, returns with a steel rod and smashes the school's glass cases with its awards and trophies, dropping out of school and warning anyone who bumps into him on the street will \\"pay\\". Sang-taek is suspended from the affair. After graduation, Sang-taek and Jung-ho go to college but the others do not.A few years later Sang-taek and Jung-ho return to find Joon-seok married to Jin-sook, the singer from the band. He is seriously ill and abusive towards his wife as a result of being addicted to philopon; he also appears depressed that his father is dying. Later he recovers from his illness, divorces his wife, and mourns his father. He assumes his father's role as a crime lord. Dong-su also becomes a mobster with a rival organization, and becomes similarly powerful.Joon-seok, Sang-taek, and Jung-ho remain close, drinking, singing karaoke, and eating galbi together during reunions. After Dong-su causes Joon-seok's boss to be imprisoned, an assassination attempt is led on Dong-su, souring relations and leading to a mob war between the two friends' opposing ganges. After an attack on his men, Joon-seok visits Dong-su at his headquarters. Joon-seok talks to Dong-su as if nothing has happened, and asks if he would like to accompany him to see Sang-taek off, since he was heading to the United States. Dong-su, however, does not want to, and Joon-seok becomes serious. Joon-seok asks Dong-su as a friend to leave for Hawaii for a few years until things cooled down, Dong-su, however, refuses and tells Joon-seok to leave. Joon-seok leaves to say farewell to Sang-taek.What Dong-su did not realize was that Joon-seok asked him to leave as a friend.

Jung-ho explains how during Sung-taek's absence Joon-seok's gang sent him into hiding abroad. After a two years, he was unable to stand the hiding any longer and had a mental breakdown. He was caught after attempting to kill himself in a foreign bar.

When the time comes for Joon-seok to leave to go back to his jail cell, Sung-taek asks why he pleaded guilty in court. Joon-seok simply replies, \\"Humiliation. Me and Dong-su are mobsters. Mobsters shouldn't be humiliated.\\" Sang-taek and Joon-seok then part ways, with Sang-taek promising to visit every month. The film ends with Joon-seok walking back to his cell, in a hallway with a white bright light in the end, with Joon-seok reflecting on the past when they were all children, wondering who would win in a race, the South Korean Olympic swimmer or a sea turtle, when they were all still friends.","completion":"Question: Who are the four childhood friends in the movie?

But all these human tendencies and phenomena are as yet still embryonic Add punctuation","completion":"Indeed, all these human tendencies and phenomena are, as yet, still embryonic. This statement suggests that there are many aspects of human behavior, cognition, emotion, and social organization that are currently in the early stages of development or understanding. While some tendencies and phenomena are well-established and thoroughly understood, there is still an immense amount of uncharted territory waiting to be discovered and studied. In particular, human cognition and the brain – our most complex and intricate organ – continue to elicit fascination and inquiry from researchers around the world. As advancements in neuroimaging and other techniques unfold, we are beginning to uncover new information about how the brain functions, processes information, and adapts to change. Despite these advances, there is still much to learn about the intricacies of the brain and the true scope of our mental capacities. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological progress in recent years has led to new paradigms in the realm of human communication, interaction, and learning. We now have access to a wealth of knowledge and resources at our fingertips through the internet, which has proven to be both empowering and overwhelming. Our ability to navigate this digital landscape and adapt to changes in technology is, in many ways, still at an early stage of development. Similarly, our understanding of human emotions and their influence on our decision-making and behavior is continually evolving. While we have identified basic emotions and some of their impacts on our lives, neuroscientists and psychologists are still exploring more nuanced emotions, their interrelationships, and effects on the human psyche. Recent advances in emotional intelligence research have provided insights into managing emotions effectively to improve relationships, decision-making processes, and overall well-being. However, many facets of our emotional landscape remain underexplored. Furthermore, as our world becomes increasingly interconnected, we are continually exposed to different cultures, languages, beliefs, and social norms. Understanding and embracing this diversity can contribute to global harmony and prosperity. This, too, is a process that is in its infancy, with significant obstacles and misconceptions still hindering our progress in fostering cross-cultural understanding and collaboration. Lastly, the looming threat of climate change and environmental issues provide another area where human behavior, mentality, and awareness need significant growth and development. We are beginning to understand the implications of our actions on the environment, but the pace of change in our behaviors, policies, and technologies has yet to catch up with the urgency of the situation. In conclusion, the statement that \\"all these human tendencies and phenomena are, as yet, still embryonic\\" highlights the immense potential for growth and development in various aspects of our lives. As we continue to expand our knowledge and understanding of ourselves and the world around us, we must seize the opportunity to evolve and adapt. By doing so, we can overcome the myriad challenges facing humanity and strive to create a better world for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In which organisms could evolution occur most rapidly?","completion":"To determine in which organisms evolution could occur most rapidly, we must consider key factors that drive and accelerate the process of evolution. Let's break this down step by step: Step 1: Characteristics of organisms with rapid evolution - Short generation times: Faster reproduction rates lead to quicker genetic changes across generations, allowing for rapid adaptation. - Large population sizes: Organisms with larger populations have greater genetic diversity, which can increase the chances of beneficial mutations. - High mutation rates: Organisms with higher mutation rates experience a higher frequency of genetic variation, which helps drive evolution. - Strong selective pressures: Environments with strong selective pressures can induce faster evolutionary adaptation to survive challenging conditions. Step 2: Identifying organisms with these characteristics - Bacteria: Bacteria have short generation times, large population sizes, relatively high mutation rates, and often face strong selective pressures (e.g., antibiotics). They can evolve quickly, developing resistance to drugs and adapting to various environments. - Viruses: Viruses, including RNA viruses like influenza and HIV, have high mutation rates and evolve rapidly to escape immune responses or adapt to new hosts. - Some insects: Insects, such as fruit flies (Drosophila), have fast reproduction rates and large population sizes, which contribute to their ability to evolve quickly. - Small plants and fungi: Some small plants, like the common waterweed, can reproduce quickly and adapt to new environments. Fungi, such as yeast, have relatively short generation times and thus can undergo rapid evolution as well. Step 3: Conclusion Based on the factors that contribute to rapid evolution, it can be concluded that organisms such as bacteria, viruses, certain insects, small plants, and fungi are the ones in which evolution could occur most rapidly. Their short generation times, large population sizes, high mutation rates, and frequent exposure to strong selective pressures collectively accelerate the process of evolution in these organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Sun Ra (born Herman Poole Blount, legal name Le Sony'r Ra; May 22, 1914 - May 30, 1993) was an American jazz composer, bandleader, piano and synthesizer player, and poet known for his experimental music, \\"cosmic\\" philosophy, prolific output, and theatrical performances. For much of his career, Ra led \\"The Arkestra\\", an ensemble with an ever-changing name and flexible line-up. Born and raised in Alabama, Blount eventually became involved in the Chicago jazz scene during the 1940s. He soon abandoned his birth name, taking the name Sun Ra (after Ra, the Egyptian God of the Sun) and developing a complex persona and mythology that would make him a pioneer of Afrofuturism: he claimed he was an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace, and throughout his life he consistently denied any ties to his prior identity. Context: In 1934 Blount was offered his first full-time musical job by Ethel Harper--his biology teacher from the high school, who had organized a band to pursue a career as a singer. Blount joined a musicians' trade union and toured with Harper's group through the US Southeast and Midwest. When Harper left the group mid-tour to move to New York (she later was a member of the modestly successful singing group the Ginger Snaps), Blount took over leadership of the group, renaming it the Sonny Blount Orchestra. They continued touring for several months before dissolving as unprofitable. Though the first edition of the Sonny Blount Orchestra was not financially successful, they earned positive notice from fans and other musicians. Blount afterward found steady employment as a musician in Birmingham. Birmingham clubs often featured exotic trappings, such as vivid lighting and murals with tropical or oasis scenes. Some believe these influenced the elements Sun Ra incorporated in his later stage shows. Playing for the big bands gave black musicians a sense of pride and togetherness, and they were highly regarded in the black community. They were expected to be disciplined and presentable, and in the segregated South, black musicians had wide acceptance in white society. They often played for elite white society audiences (though they were typically forbidden from associating with the audience). In 1936, Whatley's intercession led to Blount's being awarded a scholarship at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University. He was a music education major, studying composition, orchestration, and music theory. He dropped out after a year. Sun Ra soon left college because, he claimed, he had a visionary experience as a college student that had a major, long-term influence on him. In 1936 or 1937, in the midst of deep religious concentration, Sun Ra claimed that a bright light appeared around him, and, as he later said: My whole body changed into something else. I could see through myself. And I went up... I wasn't in human form... I landed on a planet that I identified as Saturn... they teleported me and I was down on [a] stage with them. They wanted to talk with me. They had one little antenna on each ear. A little antenna over each eye. They talked to me. They told me to stop [attending college] because there was going to be great trouble in schools... the world was going into complete chaos... I would speak [through music], and the world would listen. That's what they told me. Sun Ra said that this experience occurred in 1936 or 1937. According to Szwed, the musician's closest associates cannot date the story any earlier than 1952. (Sun Ra also said that the incident happened when he was living in Chicago, where he did not settle until the late 1940s). Sun Ra discussed the vision, with no substantive variation, to the end of his life. His trip to Saturn allegedly occurred a full decade before flying saucers entered public consciousness with the 1947 encounter of Kenneth Arnold. It was earlier than other public accounts: about 15 years before George Adamski wrote about contact with benevolent beings; and almost 20 years before the 1961 case of Barney and Betty Hill, who recounted sinister UFO abductions. Szwed says that, \\"even if this story is revisionist autobiography... Sonny was pulling together several strains of his life. He was both prophesizing his future and explaining his past with a single act of personal mythology.\\" In October 1942 Blount received a selective service notification that he had been drafted into the Military of the United States. He quickly declared himself a conscientious objector, citing religious objections to war and killing, his financial support of his great-aunt Ida, and his chronic hernia. The local draft board rejected his claim. In an appeal to the national draft board, Blount wrote that the lack of black men on the draft appeal board \\"smacks of Hitlerism.\\" Sonny's refusal to join the military deeply embarrassed his family, and many relatives ostracized him. He was eventually approved for alternate service at Civilian Public Service camp in Pennsylvania--but he did not appear at the camp as required on December 8, 1942. Shortly after, he was arrested in Alabama. In court, Blount said that alternate service was unacceptable; he debated the judge on points of law and Biblical interpretation. Though sympathetic, the judge ruled that Blount was violating the law and was at risk for being drafted into the U.S. military. Blount responded that if inducted, he would use military weapons and training to kill the first high-ranking military officer possible. The judge sentenced Blount to jail (pending draft board and CPS rulings), and then said, \\"I've never seen a nigger like you before.\\" Blount replied, \\"No, and you never will again.\\" In January 1943 Blount wrote to the United States Marshals Service from the Walker County, Alabama jail in Jasper. He said he was facing a nervous breakdown from the stress of imprisonment, that he was suicidal, and that he was in constant fear of sexual assault. When his conscientious objector status was reaffirmed in February 1943, he was escorted to Pennsylvania. He did forestry work as assigned during the day and was allowed to play piano at night. Psychiatrists there described him as \\"a psychopathic personality [and] sexually perverted,\\" but also as \\"a well-educated colored intellectual.\\" In March 1943, the draft board reclassified Blount as 4-F because of his hernia, and he returned to Birmingham, embittered and angered. He formed a new band and soon was playing professionally. After his beloved great-aunt Ida died in 1945, Blount felt no reason to stay in Birmingham. He dissolved the band, and moved to Chicago--part of the Second Great Migration, southern African Americans who moved north during and after World War II. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, there are several other interesting aspects about this article. Some of these include: 1. Sun Ra's early life and work in the Chicago jazz scene, where he developed his unique persona and mythology that made him a pioneer of Afrofuturism. 2. The influence of Birmingham clubs' exotic trappings, which possibly shaped Sun Ra's stage shows later in his career. 3. Sun Ra's visionary experience of visiting Saturn and being told by the beings there that he would speak through music, and the world would listen. 4. The discussion about how Sun Ra's Saturn vision might be a form of revisionist autobiography, with Sun Ra connecting various aspects of his life through a single piece of personal mythology. 5. Sun Ra's struggle to declare himself as a conscientious objector during World War II and his experiences in prison and Civilian Public Service camp before being reclassified as 4-F due to his hernia. These aspects showcase Sun Ra's ardent commitment to his beliefs, the evolution of his persona, and the unique experiences that contributed to his life and artistic legacy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Matthew Staton Bomer (born October 11, 1977) is an American actor, producer and director. He made his television debut with Guiding Light in 2001, and gained recognition with his recurring role in the NBC television series Chuck. He played the lead role of con-artist and thief Neal Caffrey in the USA Network series White Collar from 2009 to 2014. Bomer won a Golden Globe Award and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his supporting role as Felix Turner, opposite Mark Ruffalo, in the HBO television film The Normal Heart (2014). Matthew Staton Bomer was born on October 11, 1977 in Webster Groves, Missouri, to Elizabeth Macy (nee Staton) and John O'Neill Bomer IV, a Dallas Cowboys draft pick. His father, John Bomer, played for the Dallas Cowboys from 1972 to 1974. He has a sister Megan Bomer and a brother Neill Bomer, who is an engineer. Bomer credits his own parents for being understanding when they sensed their young child was a little different from other kids. \\"I've always had an active imagination,\\" says Bomer. He is a distant cousin to American singer Justin Timberlake, with whom he starred in the movie In Time in 2011. Timberlake and Bomer share common descent from Edward Bomer, who was born in 1690. Bomer's ancestry includes English, as well as Welsh, Scots-Irish, Scottish, Irish, Swiss-German, and German. In 1995, at age 17, Bomer made his professional stage debut as Young Collector in a production of Tennessee Williams A Streetcar Named Desire (1947) staged by Alley Theatre, a company in the Downtown, Houston, at the Texas. A few years later he returned to the stage in 1998 in a re-presentation of the play Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice in the play he lived Issachar - who was represented at the Utah Shakespeare Festival in Cedar City, Utah. Speaking about his first role in a production, Bomer said: I started acting professionally when I was 17. I quit the team and did a production of A Streetcar Named Desire at the Alley Theatre in Houston. I used to drive down at the end of the school day, do the show, do my homework during intermission and drive an hour back to Spring to go to school the next day. He grew up in Spring, Texas, a suburb of Houston, and attended its Klein High School in 1996, where he was a classmate of future actor Lee Pace and actress Lynn Collins. Pace and Bomer both acted at Houston's Alley Theatre, a non-profit theatre company. Bomer was nurtured throughout middle school by a theater arts teacher who taught him to improvise and give life to the characters he had created in his mind. His senior year, Bomer received a scholarship for some of his monologue performances, which led to his acceptance at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Where he graduated in 2001, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, along with his friend and also actor Joe Manganiello.

Los tres cerebros. Como resolver problemas\\" can be translated to English as, \\"7. The Three Brains. How to Solve Problems.\\" This sentence appears to be a title or heading that introduces a section or chapter discussing the concept of the three brains and how they can be utilized to approach problem-solving. To further elaborate on this concept, the idea of having three brains is based on the Triune Brain model proposed by Dr. Paul MacLean, a neuroscientist from the United States. According to his theory, the human brain consists of three distinct but interconnected sections, each with its own specialized functions: 1. The Reptilian Brain (brainstem and cerebellum) - This is the oldest and most primitive part of the brain, responsible for basic survival instincts, such as self-preservation, territorial defense, and reproduction. It is also in charge of autonomic functions, including heart rate, breathing, and body temperature regulation. 2. The Mammalian Brain (limbic system) - Also known as the emotional brain, it is responsible for processing and regulating emotions, forming memories, and managing basic social behaviors. Key structures within the mammalian brain include the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and thalamus. 3. The Neocortex (cerebral cortex) - The neocortex is the most evolved and largest part of the human brain. It is responsible for complex cognitive functions, such as perception, awareness, decision-making, reasoning, language, creativity, and problem-solving. The neocortex is further divided into four distinct lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital), each responsible for specific functions. In the context of \\"The Three Brains. How to Solve Problems,\\" the idea is to understand the functions of each part of the triune brain and learn how to harness their capabilities effectively to approach and solve problems. This involves recognizing the roles that instinct, emotions, and higher cognitive processes play in decision-making and problem-solving, and learning strategies to integrate these different aspects of the brain to achieve optimal outcomes. Some approaches may include mindfulness practices, emotional intelligence training, or cognitive reframing techniques, among others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Lieutenant Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson), a top Chicago Police Department hostage negotiator, is approached by his partner Nate Roenick (Paul Guilfoyle) who warns him that according to an informant (whom he refuses to name), members of their own unit are embezzling large sums of money from the department's disability fund, for which Roman is a board member. When Roman goes to meet with him again he finds Roenick murdered seconds before other police arrive, pinning him as the prime suspect. Things only get worse for Roman when Internal Affairs investigator Terence Niebaum (J. T. Walsh), whom Roenick's informant suspected of involvement in the embezzlement, is assigned to investigate the murder. After the gun that killed Roenick is linked to a case Roman had worked on, Niebaum and other investigators search Roman's house and discover papers for an offshore bank account with a deposit equal to one of the amounts of money embezzled. Roman is made to surrender his gun and badge and his colleagues are doubtful of his protests of innocence. With murder and embezzlement charges pending, Roman storms into Niebaum's office and demands answers about who set him up. When Niebaum stonewalls, Roman takes Niebaum, his administrative assistant Maggie (Siobhan Fallon), police commander Grant Frost (Ron Rifkin), and two-bit con man Rudy Timmons (Paul Giamatti) as hostages. With the building evacuated and placed under siege by his own CPD unit and the FBI, Roman issues his conditions: finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lt. Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), another top negotiator. Roman believes he can trust Sabian because he negotiates for as long as possible and see using force as a last resort, and being from another precinct eliminates him as a suspect in the disability fund scheme. Sabian clashes with the CPD but is given temporary command of the unit after they hastily attempt a breach that goes poorly, resulting in additional officers becoming Roman's hostages.

This practice is crucial for understanding your business's cash flow and managing it effectively. Monitoring your bank account regularly helps you in several ways: 1. Identifying patterns: By evaluating your cash balance at the beginning of each month, you will be able to observe trends in your cash flow, such as peak sales periods or times when expenses are higher. 2. Allocating resources: Regular check-ins on your cash balance will allow you to make more informed decisions about where to allocate resources. If your balance is frequently low, you might cut non-essential expenses, negotiate better payment terms with suppliers, or improve your customer payment collection process to maintain a healthier cash flow. 3. Planning for the future: A consistent understanding of your business's cash flow can help inform your decisions on hiring, marketing, and investing in new equipment or inventory. Knowing when your cash reserves are typically at their highest and lowest will enable you to time these expenses effectively. 4. Maintaining solvency: Gaining a solid grasp of your business's cash flow is vital for ensuring that you always have enough money to meet your financial obligations, such as payroll, rent, and supplier payments. Regularly assessing your cash situation will help you avoid unexpected shortfalls and potential financial crises. 5. Cash flow forecasting: By regularly checking your bank account, you can gather historical data and use it to create forecasts for future cash flow. This can help you anticipate potential issues and make adjustments to your business strategy accordingly. In conclusion, checking your bank account is a key step in managing your business's cash flow, and it helps you make more informed decisions about how to allocate resources and plan for your company's financial future."},{"prompt":"Q:April 1, 2006 Walter died today.

CHAPTER XXXVI THE CHARLATAN UNMASKED There seemed for the next few minutes to be a somewhat singular abstention from any desire to interfere with the two people who stood in the centre of the little group, hand-in-hand. Saton, after his first speech, and after Lois had given him her hands, had turned a little defiantly toward Rochester, who remained, however, unmoved, his elbow resting upon the broad mantelpiece, his face almost expressionless. Vandermere, too, stood on one side and held his peace, though the effort with which he did so was a visible one. Lady Mary looked anxiously towards them. Pauline had shrunk back, as though something in the situation terrified her. Even Saton himself felt that it was the silence before the storm. The courage which he had summoned up to meet a storm of disapproval, began to ebb slowly away in the face of this unnatural silence. It was clear that the onus of further speech was to rest with him. Still retaining Lois' hand, he turned toward Rochester. \\"You have forbidden me to enter your house, or to hold any communication with your ward until she was of age, Mr. Rochester,\\" he said. \\"One of your conditions I have obeyed.

Is \\"In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to minority nationalities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui nationalities, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"The quote provided discusses the minority population in Nanjing in 1999; however, it does not address the overarching ethnic majority in the city. The overwhelming ethnic majority in Nanjing is Han Chinese. Han Chinese make up more than 90% of the population in China and are the world's largest ethnic group. Nanjing, being one of the prominent cities in China, reflects this demographic pattern. In the context of the quote provided, it is important to note that the Hui nationality mentioned is one of China's recognized minority ethnic groups, rather than the city's largest ethnic majority. The Hui people are distinct from the Han Chinese, with their own unique culture, language, and religious practices, predominantly adhering to Islam. The quote specifies that in 1999, 83.76% of the minority population in Nanjing were Hui nationalities, highlighting their significance within the city's broader minority communities. In summary, the overwhelming ethnic majority in Nanjing is Han Chinese, not the Hui nationality as the quote might suggest.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: My Left Foot (1989) Imagine being a prisoner of your own body, unable to make any movements except to move your left foot. The main character in My Left Foot, based on the real story of cerebral palsy sufferer Christy Brown, can barely move his mouth to speak, but by controlling his left foot, he's able to express himself as an artist and poet. For his moving performance of Brown, Daniel Lewis won his first Academy Award for best actor. Shine (1996) Do you have a talent you're afraid to share with the world? David Helfgott seemed meant from childhood to be \\"one of the truly great pianists,\\" but the pressures of performing (and pleasing his father) resulted in a complete breakdown. Ten years in a mental institution didn't weaken Helfgott's musical gift: When he was rediscovered, he was playing concertos in a bar. Shine received s even Oscar nominations , and Geoffrey Rush won best actor for his performance of Helfgott. Life Is Beautiful (1997) Nothing's more powerful than the love between a parent and a child. In this heartbreaking Italian film, a father (Roberto Benigni) makes an unbelievable sacrifice for his 4-year-old son: trapped in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, the Jewish man convinces his boy that they are playing a complicated game. He manages to spare him the horror of the terrible war, and even in his final moments of life, keeps his son smiling and hopeful. Benigni won the best actor Oscar. Stand and Deliver (1988) Few people can inspire us more than a good teacher. Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos got Oscar nomination for best actor) is a great one. Employed at a high school where kids are expected to fail, Escalante challenges his math students to struggle for better things, like getting good grades in the AP exam. Despite the obstacles in their lives, the classmates accomplish their goals, thanks to Mr. Escalante's support. The real Jaime Escalante, the Best Teacher in America, says that Stand and Deliver is \\" 90% truth, 10% drama.\\" Question: What do the four movies have in common? Options: A: They are all based on real stories. B: The main characters all won Academy Award for Best Actor. C: They are all inspiring stories that make a difference. D: The main characters are all sick to some degree but succeed.","completion":"The four given movies are: My Left Foot (1989), Shine (1996), Life Is Beautiful (1997), and Stand and Deliver (1988). Let's analyse each option one by one: Option A: All four movies are indeed based on real stories. So, this could be a possible answer. Option B: The main characters of My Left Foot, Shine, and Life Is Beautiful won Academy Award for Best Actor, but in Stand and Deliver, Edward James Olmos got an Oscar nomination for best actor but did not win. Hence, this option is incorrect. Option C: All the movies indeed tell inspiring stories that make a difference. So, this could be another possible answer. Option D: In My Left Foot, the main character has cerebral palsy. David Helfgott in Shine has a mental breakdown. In Life Is Beautiful, the main character isn't physically sick, but he faces a horrific situation and in Stand and Deliver, Jaime Escalante is not shown as sick. Therefore, this option is incorrect. So, based on the elimination method, the two possible correct answers could be either option A: They are all based on real stories or option C: They are all inspiring stories that make a difference. However, option C is a more encompassing and profound commonality that incorporates Option A as well, given that all the movies are not only real stories but also very inspirational.

In architecture Durer cites Vitruvius but elaborates his own classical designs and columns. In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

A:","completion":"Title: Decent App, Could Use Some Improvement Review: I've been using the FrostWire Android app (com.frostwire.android) for a few months now, and I overall think it's a good app that's worth three stars. It does have its perks and offers some convenient features that make downloading torrents and playing media easier. However, there are areas where the app could improve as well. One of the major positive aspects of the FrostWire Android app is its user-friendly interface. Navigating through the app is easy enough, and the search function is quite helpful! I appreciate the ability to search for torrents and access a selection of quality downloads in just a few clicks. Additionally, the app has a built-in media player, which is a great feature for playing videos and music effortlessly. I find this particularly useful, as it saves me from switching between multiple apps. Despite these advantages, the app comes with a few drawbacks. Firstly, I experience occasional crashes, which can be frustrating, especially when I'm in the midst of torrent downloading. It would be great if the developers could iron out these stability issues. Another area that could use some improvement is the inclusion of intrusive ads. I understand that in-app ads are necessary for generating revenue, but sometimes they go overboard and hamper my user experience. It would be great if they could reduce the amount of ads displayed without limiting the app's features. Lastly, one of my concerns is the speed of downloads. Sometimes, it can get incredibly slow, even with a steady internet connection. I don't know if it's because of the app or the torrent sources, but an enhancement in this aspect would be helpful. In conclusion, the FrostWire Android app serves its purpose relatively well and offers some useful features. However, if the developers could address the stability, ad intrusion, and download speed issues, it has the potential to climb up to a more impressive rating. As it stands, I give the app three stars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Write an article based on this \\"Germany's Bayer has raised its offer for Monsanto to 65bn (£49bn), or 127.50 a share, in a bid to create a global seeds and pesticides giant.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Bayer Increases Offer for Monsanto to 65 Billion, Aiming to Create Global Agricultural Powerhouse Following a series of negotiations, German pharmaceutical and chemical juggernaut Bayer has upped its bid for American seed and pesticide corporation Monsanto to an astounding 65 billion (£49 billion), equivalent to 127.50 a share. This strategic move serves to establish a worldwide agrochemical empire that could significantly transform agriculture on a global scale. Step 1: Begin with an introduction that outlines the news and its significance The world of agribusiness and crop biotechnology is on the verge of a tectonic shift, as Germany's Bayer announced its higher offer for US-based Monsanto, valuing the company at 65 billion. This announcement comes amidst an increasing wave of consolidation in the agricultural industry, with major players seeking to join forces and capture a greater market share. Bayer's acquisition of Monsanto, if successful, will propel the combined group firmly to the forefront of the global seeds and pesticide business. Step 2: Detail the history of the deal between Bayer and Monsanto In their quest to dominate the international agricultural market, Bayer has upped the ante by increasing its previous offer of 125 per share to 127.50 a share, which represents a total value of 65 billion. This latest development follows months of negotiations, during which time both companies explored the possibility of an all-cash transaction. With this new proposal on the table, Bayer has shown its determination to successfully secure the deal and establish a thriving partnership with Monsanto. Step 3: Explain the implications of the deal for the global agriculture industry The potential merger between Bayer and Monsanto is projected to create an unparalleled seeds and pesticides giant, with an estimated annual revenue exceeding 25 billion. This new enterprise could dramatically transform agricultural practices worldwide, as the combined entity would possess a significant market share and an extensive portfolio of products that include herbicides, insecticides, and genetically modified seeds. This strong position would enable the merged company to exercise considerable influence over agricultural policy and practices, fostering the adoption of new technologies and the implementation of vertically integrated approaches to farming. Step 4: Address potential concerns regarding the merger While the prospect of a unified Bayer-Monsanto powerhouse may seem appealing to investors, there are concerns that such a colossal agribusiness combination could lead to monopolistic practices, reduced competition, and increased prices for farmers. Industry critics argue that the consolidation of the agrochemical market may limit farmers' choice of suppliers and hinder innovation in the sector. It is crucial that regulatory authorities closely examine the implications of this merger, ensuring that it is in line with antitrust regulations and promoting an environment that fosters fairness, transparency, and growth. Step 5: Conclude with a summary and outlook for the future In conclusion, as Bayer raises its offer for Monsanto to an impressive 65 billion, the agricultural landscape is set for a significant metamorphosis. Should the deal come to fruition, the combined entity could reign supreme as a global seeds and pesticides colossus, wielding consequential influence over the future direction of agriculture. The road ahead, however, is laden with uncertainty, as regulatory and public scrutiny will play a vital role in determining the implications of this merger, and ultimately, its success or failure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who kidnaps Elizabeth? Movie title: Young Sherlock Holmes Movie plot: The film opens in late 19th century London one evening. A hooded figure raises a blowpipe and shoots a dart into an older businessman named Bentley Bobster (Patrick Newell) outside a restaurant. He shakes the sting off thinking it an insect. After ordering dinner, however, he suffers a terrifying hallucination in which his dinner, a roasted bird, attacks him. He shakes this off, and returns to his third-floor flat. Another hallucination appears, however, leading him to believe that his apartment is on fire. He throws himself out the window and is killed when he hits the ground in an apparent suicide. The credits roll.The scene switches to a boy's school in London were the teenage John Watson (Alan Cox) is a new student at the Brompton Academy. As he moves into the dorm he finds the next bunk over is occupied by the teenage Sherlock Holmes (Nicholas Rowe). The two become friends and Holmes introduces Watson to Professor Waxflatter (Nigel Stock), a retired teacher with rooms and a laboratory in the school's attic. Waxflatter is bit of a mad inventor who is constantly testing a human-powered flying machine. Holmes also introduces Watson to Elizabeth (Sophie Ward), Waxflatter's teenage niece who shares his rooms and has a budding romantic relationship with Holmes.As we follow Holmes and Watson we see them attend a fencing class. The teacher, Professor Rathe (Anthony Higgins), chooses Holmes as his opponent in a demonstration match. Though Holmes does well, Rathe eventually defeats him. Rathe complements Holmes on the match, but warns him that he lets his emotions get the best of him and it leads him to make rash moves and ultimately lose.We see a second attack take place: The hooded figure enters a church and shoots a dart into the sole occupant, the Reverend Duncan Nesbitt (Donald Eccles). The reverend hallucinates that the stained glass figure of a knight jumps from its window and chases him down the aisle. He runs through the front doors and out into the street where he is run over by a horse-drawn carriage... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Young Sherlock Holmes,\\" the person responsible for kidnapping Elizabeth is not explicitly mentioned in the provided plot summary. However, it's reasonable to assume that the main antagonist or one of his henchmen might be behind the kidnapping, as this would create a conflict for the main characters and further drive the plot. From the given plot, it appears that the main antagonist is the hooded figure who has been causing people to hallucinate and ultimately meet their demise. This person utilizes a blowpipe and darts to induce terrifying hallucinations in their victims, which has led to the deaths of Bentley Bobster and the Reverend Duncan Nesbitt. As the movie focuses on the teenage Sherlock Holmes and his new-found friendship with John Watson, it is highly likely that the duo will work together to solve the mystery surrounding these hallucination-induced deaths. The kidnapping of Elizabeth, who has a budding romantic relationship with Holmes and is the niece of Professor Waxflatter, would serve as a strong motivation for both Holmes and Watson to find the kidnapper and uncover his motives. Considering Elizabeth's close relationship with Sherlock Holmes and given that the main antagonist appears to be targeting prominent individuals in society, it is probable that the hooded figure or one of his associates is responsible for her abduction. Holmes and Watson's investigation will likely lead them to unveil the true identity of this hooded figure and their connection to the victims. They will also need to race against time to save Elizabeth and prevent further harm from befalling London. As they delve deeper into the case, the duo may uncover a much wider conspiracy at play, potentially involving some of the other characters like Professor Rathe, who have been introduced in the plot. In conclusion, although the kidnapper of Elizabeth is not explicitly mentioned in the provided plot, the hooded figure or one of his henchmen is the most likely suspect given the overall storyline. The adventures of Young Sherlock Holmes and John Watson as they try to save Elizabeth and uncover the mystery behind the hallucination-inducing darts will propel the film's plot forward, making for an exciting and engaging movie experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When an animal is woken up during hibernation, it can disrupt the carefully maintained physiological state that conserves energy and resources. The sudden arousal would require the animal to use up stored energy to increase its heart rate, breathing, and body temperature. This could potentially deplete the animal's energy reserves, making it difficult for it to survive the rest of the hibernation period. Additionally, repeated disturbances could also cause stress and weaken the animal's immune system, increasing its vulnerability to illnesses and diseases.

Summarize this article: In a 12-minute exchange last year, one disapproving shareholder gave Rupert Murdoch, the company’s chairman and chief executive, a copy of “Man Bites Murdoch,” an autobiographical book about an editor’s clashes with the media giant, and asked if he would be attending the comedian Jon Stewart’s “Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear” in Washington. Mr. Murdoch said he would be in Australia. But that incident might seem tame once this year’s meeting ends Friday afternoon in Los Angeles. The gathering is expected to be the company’s most contentious in years, with frustrated shareholders taking the microphone to demand accountability after a phone-hacking scandal in Britain that has embarrassed the company. Investors will also have the chance to vote on the company’s board members, including Mr. Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan. While the family’s 40 percent stake virtually guarantees they will be re-elected, the chorus of discontent has put the company in an uncustomary defensive position. The most forceful, and potentially most ominous protest is likely to come from Tom Watson, the British Labour Party legislator who has led the investigation into phone-hacking at News Corporation’s British newspaper unit. Mr. Watson, who acquired nonvoting proxy shareholder status to attend the meeting, said he planned to accuse the company of engaging in further criminal wrongdoing involving surveillance techniques that extend beyond the phone hacking. He did not discuss potential evidence. “A lot of institutional investors do not know the scope nor the implications of what’s happening in the U.K.,” Mr. Watson said in a phone interview. “You can delegate power but not responsibility, and Rupert Murdoch for whatever reason has failed to put in corporate governance arrangements that prohibit crimes from being committed.” A News Corporation spokeswoman, Teri Everett, declined to comment. The company has done its part to carefully orchestrate the gathering. For the first time, News Corporation, citing security concerns, has made attendees register and R.S.V.P. before the event. Rather than holding the meeting at its usual venue, the Hudson Theater in New York, it will take place at the 476-seat Darryl F. Zanuck Theater on the gilded Art Deco-style Fox Studios lot near Beverly Hills, Calif. News Corporation said attendance would be similar to previous years and that it was not uncommon for companies to change locations for annual meetings. The Los Angeles venue was chosen because the company’s entertainment division, which makes shows like “Modern Family” and movies like “Avatar,” is a major contributor to its financial growth, News Corporation said. Some shareholders will get up to 15 minutes to speak directly to Mr. Murdoch, according to people who have attended previous meetings. “That can be a pretty long 15 minutes,” said Digby Gilmour, head of telecommunications and media research at C.L.S.A. Australia. Stephen Mayne, a director at the Australian Shareholders’ Association, and the person who presented Mr. Murdoch with the book last year, said he planned to travel from Sydney to attend. A former News Corporation employee and longtime shareholder, Mr. Mayne has attended 12 annual meetings. Mr. Murdoch has in recent years grown increasingly impatient with shareholder speeches, Mr. Mayne said. “I got 40 minutes of back and forth in 1999,” he said, adding: “But he’s gotten a lot tougher as he’s gotten older.” Mr. Mayne’s advice for shareholders standing up to confront Mr. Murdoch? “He’ll shut you down. You’ve got to be quick and polite but firm at the same time.” Any dissent will largely be symbolic. Mr. Murdoch owns nearly 40 percent of voting shares, and 7 percent belong to Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who has expressed his support for the board. As many as 30 percent of shareholders are expected to cast votes against Murdoch family members, several analysts estimated. Shareholder activists will dominate the meeting, since large institutional investors do not typically air grievances in such a public forum, analysts said. “There will be a lot of noise, but at the end, not a lot of change,” Mr. Gilmour said. The meetings typically begin with Mr. Murdoch opening the floor to questions, Mr. Mayne said. At the end of the exchanges, he gives a state-of-the-company address. That talk could become a more prominent part of the presentation as Mr. Murdoch lays out the shareholder-friendly actions News Corporation has recently taken, said a Deutsche Bank Securities analyst, Doug Mitchelson. One of them is a 5 billion stock buyback program currently under way, which has countered some investors’ concerns about News Corporation’s decision in July to withdraw its 12 billion bid for the British Sky Broadcasting Group. Chase Carey, chief operating officer, has said he would pursue additional stock buybacks on top of the 5 billion program. “As much as we thought Sky was a good deal, buying back stock is a better deal,” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Nomura Securities. Company executives are sure to point out on Friday that even as most media companies struggle, News Corporation shares are up about 14 percent with a 52-week high of 18.35. The stock closed at 17.05 on Thursday. Last year, before the revelations of widespread phone-hacking, Mr. Mayne questioned Mr. Murdoch about allegations of hacking in 2006 involving two News of the World journalists, Clive Goodman and Andy Coulson. “There has been two parliamentary inquiries, which have found no further evidence or any other thing at all,” Mr. Murdoch responded, according to a transcript. “If anything was to come to light, we challenge people to give us evidence, and no one has been able to do so.” In the end, the meeting will most likely give a platform to critics of the company’s corporate governance and not be a referendum on its financial performance. ||||| Tom Watson, the Labour MP who has been a leading figure in parliament's investigation into the News of the World phone-hacking scandal, plans to make dramatic allegations about News Corporation's use of surveillance at the company's annual shareholder meeting. Watson, who sits on the Commons culture, media and sport committee which has investigated the scandal, said he would be giving News Corp's shareholders details of previously undisclosed surveillance methods used by the firm that were technologically quite distinct from the phone hacking carried out by NoW staff. He refused to go into details about the allegations he would be making or to offer any evidence to corroborate them. He said: \\"I want to leave investors in no doubt that News Corporation is not through the worst of this yet and there are more questions for the Murdochs to answer.\\" Watson has flown to Los Angeles to attend the shareholders meeting, which he will gain access to having been given a proxy vote by the US trade union umbrella group, the AFL-CIO. News Corporation is bracing itself for independent shareholders to vote in considerable numbers at the meeting against the reappointment of Rupert Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. The scale of the protest outside the Murdoch family is expected to be substantially over 20% of independent shareholders, with several expected to raise questions at the meeting at Fox studios. But their protest will not be enough to topple the family, because Rupert Murdoch controls 40% of the voting shares. Nevertheless, before the meeting there were clear signs of tension at the upper levels of News Corp, with particular emphasis on security at the event and worries about what sort of tone the 80-year-old media mogul will strike in front of those who, alongside him, have a stake in the empire he built. Murdoch's opening address is expected to show less of the contrition than in London in July, when he told MPs: \\"This the most humble day of my life.\\" Instead he is expected to strike a more combative tone, although there are worries that this will alienate some investors and outsiders. The language is understood to reflect the sentiments expressed 10 days ago in a stock exchange filing in which News Corp, in response to the growing army of concerned shareholders, accused its critics of having a \\"disproportionate focus on the News of the World matter\\" which was in turn \\"misguided\\". That approach has unsettled some in the company who believe there is a risk that Murdoch's rhetorical defiance will play badly. Murdoch is frustrated that for all the considerable political and legal problems News Corp faces, the company continues to perform well, with operating profits up by 12% by almost 5bn (£3.2bn), after legal costs, helped by the box office success of the film Rio and the continued growth of US TV channels such as Fox News. Set against that is the £20m settlement fund promised to phone-hacking victims. There was an unwelcome reminder of the difficulties in the print sector with a separate announcement that News Corp would cut 150 editorial posts at the loss-making Times and Sunday Times, through compulsory and voluntary redundancies and cuts to casual staff. A critical indicator in LA will be whether more than half of the non-family shareholders will vote against the reappointment of the Murdochs. The family is likely to receive support from the Saudi investor Prince Alwaleed – whose Kingdom Holdings has a further 7% of the voting shares and who is close to James Murdoch. News Corp expects something of a circus at the event, with shareholders and press being bused into the venue - which the company says is aimed to \\"ease the security issues of getting onto a studio lot\\". Watson joins some of the most critical investors, such as Calpers, which manages money for California's public employees. News Corp chose to hold the meeting in LA, rather than New York where the business has its headquarters, in the hope that it would reduce the attendance of critical fund managers. Calpers is particularly unhappy with the two-tier voting structure, – which it calls a \\"corruption of the governance system\\" which means that about a third of News Corp shares have voting rights. The Murdochs control 40% of the votes by owning about 12% of all shares.. In the runup to the meeting, News Corp has had to endure growing speculation about rifts at the top of the company. with the New York Times reporting several disputes between Rupert and his heir apparent James, and even talk that James, the deputy chief operating officer, had briefly considered stepping down. But despite Rupert's advancing years, and the pressure mounting on James as the phone-hacking crisis continues, neither is prepared, nor will they be forced, to step aside as a result of tomorrow's meeting. |||||","completion":"News Corporation's annual shareholder meeting is expected to be highly contentious as frustrated shareholders demand accountability after the phone-hacking scandal in Britain.

Here is an article: Ohio high school senior Ryan Chester became the inaugural winner of a new college scholarship on Sunday night, winning 250,000 for his 7-minute film that uses simple props and hand-drawn graphics to explain Einstein’s special theory of relativity. Besides winning that money for himself, Chester also won 100,000 for a new science lab at his school in the Cleveland suburbs, North Royalton High, and 50,000 for his physics teacher, Richard Nestoff. “This is awesome,” Chester, 18, said in an interview Monday, the day after he accepted the award. The scholarship means he can apply to a bunch of colleges he hadn’t considered before because of their cost, he said: “A ton of possibilities are open. Before, I was worried about graduating with debt, and I don’t have to worry about that now,” he said. The scholarship is the newest award in the family of Breakthrough Prizes, which are meant to celebrate the importance of science and recognize brilliance in the fields of math, biology and physics. Founded three years ago by Silicon Valley giants, including Google’s Sergey Brin and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, the Breakthrough Prize offers awards ranging from 100,000 for promising early-career achievements to 3 million for scientists who have made fundamental discoveries about the world. The Breakthrough Junior Challenge asked young people between ages 13 and 18 to create short videos that communicated a big idea in science. More than 2,000 students from dozens of countries applied. Zuckerberg’s wife and partner in education philanthropy, Priscilla Chan, presented the award to Chester in an Oscar-style presentation that was broadcast live Sunday night on the National Geographic Channel. “With the Breakthrough Prize and Junior Challenge, we want to inspire more young people to study science and math, and pursue careers that change all our lives,” Chan said in a statement. Chester’s film takes on one of the biggest ideas in science, Einstein’s theory of relativity. With cartoonish graphics drawn by hand and props from everyday life, like a bowl of popcorn and a moving minivan, Chester explains what Einstein’s famous theory is all about — and why it means that people traveling close to the speed of light age slowly compared to people on Earth. “This is the kind of thing that we’re exposed to all the time in pop culture and films and science shows on TV, but in the video I use physical demonstrations that anyone can think through to have it make sense,” Chester said in an interview posted online. In an interview with The Washington Post on Monday, Chester said the challenge was a chance for him to marry science and film-making, two of his passions. He plans to major in film in college, and perhaps minor in engineering. “I’ve been making movies for over 10 years now. You wouldn’t believe how much film-making equipment I have in my basement,” he said. “You can make movies about anything. It never gets old, you’re always learning something new, you’re always making something unique.” Chester could have chosen any teacher to benefit from his prize. He chose Nestoff, his A.P. Physics teacher, because he is inspiring. “He’s a great teacher. He’s different than any teacher I’ve had — he’s not really afraid to say anything or do anything as long as it makes class more entertaining and helps teach what he’s teaching,” Chester said. “Every day in physics class, you never know what to expect, and that’s an exciting way to learn science.” Nestoff said Chester is an outstanding student, not just because of his ability to understand complex physics concepts or his impressive ACT scores, but because of the easy way he gets along with — and often helps — his classmates. “Ryan is the perfect person to be involved in something like,” Nestoff said in an interview. “He’s such a well-rounded kid. He’s so pleasant.” Nestoff said Monday morning that he was “still on cloud nine” after the awards ceremony, made surreal by the number of Silicon Valley celebrities and great scientific minds in attendance. He said he isn’t sure what he’ll do with the 50,000 prize. He doesn’t want to just throw it into his retirement fund or buy a car, he said. He wants to do something special — maybe start taking some interesting vacations after spending many summers teaching at various camps. But while the money turns heads, he said, what means more to him is the fact that his student appreciates him. “The fact that he thinks a lot of me, that’s the part that’s very gratifying,” Nestoff said. “Do I deserve it? “I don’t think so. But I’m glad he thinks so.” Emma Brown writes about national education and about people with a stake in schools, including teachers, parents and kids.

Q:Answer the following question given this paragraph: Epistasis is when a gene at one location (locus) alters the phenotypic expression of a gene at another locus. Epistasis takes place when the action of one gene is modified by one or several other genes. These genes are sometimes called modifier genes . The gene whose phenotype is expressed is said to be epistatic , while the phenotype that is altered is said to be hypostatic . Sometimes hypostatic phenotypes are completely suppressed. Epistatic genes are not dominant over the genes they alter or suppress. Dominance refers to an interaction between alleles of the same gene, not different genes.

My then-teenage daughter and I went to a new restaurant. It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived—so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there. We did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month. Good riddance! Question: What is probably true about the restaraunt manager? === The answer to the above question is","completion":"that the restaurant manager was likely inexperienced, disorganized, and unable to manage the restaurant effectively. There are several factors that point towards this conclusion: 1. Lack of staff: The restaurant was empty except for the manager, and the lone waitress arrived late and had to change clothes in the restroom. This indicates poor management, as there should have been enough staff to take care of customers efficiently. 2. Poor customer service: The manager told you to find your own table, and it took 10 minutes for any staff member to even check on you. A well-managed restaurant would have had someone to greet and seat you promptly. 3. Misuse of space: The manager reserved the attractive stage-like area, then asked you to move from your table even though the special group did not show up during your visit. This shows a lack of foresight and poor decision-making, as the table could have accommodated your party. 4. Inability to handle problems: The manager did not offer any apology or solution when it was clear that your experience was less than satisfactory. A competent manager would have acknowledged the issues and tried to rectify the situation in some way. 5. Slow service: It took too long to receive your order even after your late waitress eventually took it. This further indicates poor management and disorganization on the part of the restaurant. 6. Ultimately, the restaurant's closure within a month indicates that these problems were not isolated incidents, but rather symptomatic of larger issues within the establishment. The poor customer experience and management evidently led to its financial failure, pointing towards an overall lack of effective oversight and management by the restaurant manager. In summary, the restaurant manager was probably inexperienced, disorganized, and unable to provide customers with a satisfactory dining experience. The combination of long wait times, inadequate staffing, and poor decision-making contributed to the restaurant's rapid closure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's an example to show how honorable actions create happiness. Say a store clerk fails to charge us for an item.If we keep silent,and profit from the clerk's mistake,we would drive home with a sense of sneaky excitement.Later we might tell our family or friends about our good fortune.On the other hand,if we tell the clerk about the uncharged item,the clerk would be grateful and thank us for our honesty.We would leave the store with a quiet sense of honor that we might never share with another soul.

A Vote for the East Village Last summer the building was sold. Ms. Gang, a 2001 graduate of New York University, was suddenly faced with a rent increase to 2,900 a month from 1,400, as well as construction noise as the new owners undertook renovations. The need to move, she said, constituted “my own New York sob story, but it was good because it motivated me.” Ms. Gang, 33, is a jazz singer with a standing Wednesday-night gig at the Plaza. She had received an inheritance from her grandparents, and knew it was prudent to spend the money on a home. “My grandparents saved for the express purpose of creating a better quality of life for their children,” she said. “I am remarkably lucky.” Her budget for an apartment, preferably in a prewar walk-up co-op building, topped out at 500,000. Having spent several years in drizzly London, she also wanted a high floor, for the light. “I thought I was the only person crazy enough to enjoy walking up” so many flights, she said. She was in the habit, however, of limiting grocery purchases so she wouldn’t have to carry too much at once. She knew she could get more space for the money in Morningside Heights than in the East Village. The neighborhood felt more adult, too. “The musicians that I know who live on the Upper West Side are much more mature,” she said. “They have families, they have kids, they have strollers, they go shopping at Fairway.” Ms. Gang e-mailed an inquiry to an agent who had a listing for a large studio on the top floor of a co-op on West 109th Street. The price was 425,000; maintenance was in the mid-700s. She was delighted when the agent turned out to be Nina Hennessey of Halstead Property, the wife of a drummer she knew. That studio was already in contract, so Ms. Hennessey showed Ms. Gang another top-floor place — not a walk-up — on the 20th floor of a 1988 condominium tower at the northwest corner of Central Park. The asking price was 469,000; monthly charges were around 800. “The views meant a lot to her,” Ms. Hennessey said. True. But the building was the wrong kind. The neighborhood — with Central Park in one direction and a gas station in another — felt isolated and dull. Ms. Gang realized she did not want to leave the East Village after all: “I walk down the street and see people I know, which is awesome and it made me feel I was part of a community, and I didn’t want to leave that.” Or as Ms. Hennessey put it, “She wasn’t going to feel at home anywhere else.” Now the hunt focused on the slice between 14th and Houston Streets. Many places Ms. Gang saw were in disrepair, but she loved a small studio on East 12th. It was on the top floor of a sixth-floor walk-up, with a pretty brick wall and a beamed ceiling. The listing price was 297,000, with monthly maintenance in the mid 300s. But with inventory low, Ms. Hennessey said, “the little postage stamp of an apartment went to multiple bids.” Ms. Gang’s offer of 306,000 was rejected. The apartment sold for 336,000. Ms. Gang also loved a one-bedroom on the fifth floor of a walk-up on East 11th. The place was listed for 550,000, with monthly maintenance in the high 600s. But if she spent so much money, Ms. Hennessey pointed out, “she wouldn’t have the assets-after-closing picture that is attractive to co-op boards.” In any event, Ms. Gang’s offer of 515,000 was declined. She was disappointed. “That’s what you get when you start looking outside of your price range,” she said. “Don’t do it.” She ignored her own advice when it came to another fifth- and top-floor co-op on East Fourth Street. Two apartments had been beautifully combined into a three-bedroom. “It was an embarrassment of riches,” Ms. Gang said. “I’d never seen anything like it.” She thought the price — 550,000, with maintenance of 700 — was low for the apartment’s size. But the block made the decision for her: she found it unprepossessing, and moved on. Finally, she visited a spacious four-room apartment in a six-story walk-up co-op building on East Second Street. It was on a low floor but had a roof deck, “so I could still walk up if I chose to,” she said. The asking price was 432,000, with monthly maintenance in the low 200s. Ms. Gang decided to go for it, and bought the place for 420,000 in cash. She and her cat, Jezebel, arrived this winter. She is aware of being surrounded by neighbors now that she no longer lives on the top floor. She rents rehearsal space elsewhere, so she doesn’t make noise. Lacking as much light she might like, she treks to the roof every day, even in the cold, for at least some time in the sun. Though her apartment is spacious, it has no closets, and Ms. Gang’s work wardrobe includes floor-length gowns. “When I was looking at apartments with closets,” she said, “that was something I would consider. Could I fit all my dresses?” Now the question is moot. She bought a portable hanging rack. The difference between renting and owning? As an owner, “you will be stopped in the hallway by your neighbors,” she said. “They will say, ‘You want to see how I did mine?’ and invite you into their apartment, which I love.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article tells the story of Ms. Gang, a jazz singer, who faced a substantial rent increase and decided to use an inheritance from her grandparents to purchase a home in New York City. She initially considered Morningside Heights for more space and a more mature atmosphere, but eventually realized she did not want to leave the East Village and its sense of community. After several rejected offers and disappointments, Ms. Gang purchased a spacious four-room apartment in a walk-up co-op building on East Second Street for 420,000 in cash. She now enjoys her new apartment, getting to know her neighbors, and visiting the shared roof deck for sunlight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The reviewer expresses disappointment with the lack of Strong's Hebrew and Greek dictionaries in the NIV Bible and shares their intention to return it in favor of the NAS version, which includes the desired features. The review begins by acknowledging a positive aspect of the product, stating that the NIV is a \\"wonderful Bible for better understanding.\\" However, the central issue raised by the reviewer is that they want their children to access the original words in Hebrew and Greek for a comprehensive understanding and truth in the scripture. Unfortunately, the NIV Bible lacks the Strong's dictionaries, having instead Kohlenberger's version, which is not as detailed, according to the reviewer. The dissatisfaction about the lack of detail in the included dictionaries overshadows any positive points made earlier in the review, leading the reviewer to decide to send the Bible back and purchase a different edition: the NAS (most literal translation) with Strong's Hebrew and Greek Keyword dictionaries. Overall, while there is some praise for the NIV's better understanding, the primary focus of the review is on the disappointment experienced due to the absence of Strong's dictionaries. The fact that the reviewer plans to return the product and purchase a different version demonstrates that their dissatisfaction is significant, ultimately creating an unflattering portrayal of the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is known for his contributions to the fields of cosmology and quantum gravity , especially in the context of black holes. He experienced extreme difficulties and obstacles in his life, which only made him stronger. Finally he contributed much to the careers he devoted to and became one of the most famous scientists in the world. Hawking was outstanding in his school life. After a successful period of education at St. Albans School, the entrance of Oxford opened to him. In March 1959, at the age of 17, Hawking took the scholarship examination with the aim of studying natural sciences at Oxford. Then Hawking went to Cambridge to do research in cosmology. When Stephen Hawking was dreaming about his future, he faced extreme difficulties and obstacles. Symptoms of disorder first appeared while he was enrolled at Cambridge; he lost his balance and fell down a flight of stairs, hitting his head. The diagnosis of motor neuron disease came when Hawking was 21, shortly before his first marriage, and doctors said he would not survive more than two or three years. Hawking gradually lost the use of his arms, legs, and voice, and is now almost completely paralyzed . Despite his disease, he describes himself as \\"lucky\\" --- not only has time to make influential discoveries, but also has, in his own words, \\"a very attractive family\\". As someone has said, when we meet frustration, someone fights, someone cries, someone escapes, someone tries. Hawking succeeds because he tries. Question: What's the main idea of the passage?

Given the below context: After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday.

Article: Once upon a time,the animals decided that they must do something heroic to meet the problems of\\" a new world\\".So they organized a training school. They adopted an activity curriculum consisting of running,climbing,swimming and flying.To make it easier to manage the curriculum,all the animals took all the subjects. The duck was excellent in swimming,in fact,better than his instructor,but he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running.Since he was slow in running,he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running.This was kept up until his webbed feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming.But average was acceptable in school,so nobody worried about that except the duck. The rabbit started at the top of the class in running,but had a nervous breakdown because of so much make-up work in swimming. The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down.He also developed a \\"Charlie horse\\" and then got a C in climbing and a D in running. The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely.In the climbing class he beat all the others to the top of the tree,but insisted on using his own way to get there.

Other technical dictionaries followed Harris' model, including Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia (1728), which included five editions, and was a substantially larger work than Harris'. The folio edition of the work even included foldout engravings. The Cyclopaedia emphasized Newtonian theories, Lockean philosophy, and contained thorough examinations of technologies, such as engraving, brewing, and dyeing.\\", answer the following question.

(March 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Skeeter Bronson (Adam Sandler) is a hotel handyman who was promised by his father, Marty Bronson (Jonathan Pryce), to be the manager of the family hotel. A mysophobe named Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths) agreed to keep that promise when the Bronson family sold their hotel to himâthen built a new hotel instead. Thirty years later, when the story begins, Skeeter is the hotel's handyman while management is held by Kendall (Guy Pearce). Barry's new hotel, the Sunny Vista Nottingham Hotel, is a hit, but he's got plans to build an even more elaborate hotel, one designed around a theme that he's keeping secret. Skeeter's sister and principal of Webster Elementary School, Wendy (Courteney Cox), asks Skeeter to watch her kids, Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) and Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heit), while she goes out of town.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: If you really want to go green, here's good news: eating green is good for you. The very foods with a high carbon cost---meat, pork, dairy products, processed snacks---also tend to be filled with fat and calories. A green diet would be mostly vegetables and fruits, whole grains, fish and lean meats like chicken---a diet that's eco- and waistline-friendly. Eating green can be healthier and beneficial to the climate. It may be hard to believe that a meal at McDonald's produces more carbon than your trip to a far away place. More than 37% of the world's land is used for agriculture, much of which was once forested. Deforestation is a major source of carbon. The fertilizer and machinery needed on a modern farm also have a large carbon footprint, as does the network of ships and trucks that brings the food from the farm to your plate. The most efficient way to reduce the carbon footprint of your menu is to eat less meat, especially beef. Raising cattle takes a lot more energy than growing the equivalent amount of grains, fruits or vegetables. What's more, the majority of cattle in the U.S. are fed on grain and loads of it---670 million tons in 2002---and the fertilizer used to feed that creates separate environmental problems. Focus on eating lower on the food chain, with more plants and fruits and less meat and dairy. It's simple. We can change today what goes into our bodies for the health of our planet and ourselves. A:","completion":"Which of the following statements is true about adopting a green diet according to the article? A) A green diet is high in meat, pork, and dairy products. B) Eating green mainly consists of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and lean meats like chicken, which is beneficial for both health and the environment. C) Raising cattle for meat has a lower carbon footprint compared to growing grains, fruits, or vegetables.

Article: Have you seen a historical film recently? Do you think it was accurate? Some say that there is no such thing as a historical film. In many cases, Hollywood film-makers simply change the facts. Just look at these supposedly \\"historical\\" films. 1. The Patriot The film was released in 2000 and was directed by Ronald Emmerish and starred Mel Gibson. It is set near Charleston, South Carolina, during the American Revolutionary War(1775--1783) and follows the story of Benjamin Martin and his fight for American freedom against the British. The film was criticized for inventing and exaggerating British cruelty. The most criticized scene was one showing the burning of a church containing people of the town, of which there is no historical record. Another historical inaccuracy was the description of American-owned slaves being freed to serve with the American forces. In reality, many slaves ran away from their American owners and fought with the British against the Americans. 2. Brave Heart The film(1995) starred Mel Gibson was directed by Toby Reisz. It is based on the life of Scottish national hero William Wallace and his fight against English rule in Scotland during the 13th century. The film includes an affair between William Wallace and Princess Isabella (based on Isabella of France). The film implies she is a mother-to-be when William Wallace will be killed. However, historically, the real Isabella was a child of nine still living in France at this time, never having met Wallace. The film also caused controversy because of its anti-English nature. Apparently, when the film was shown in Glasgow, there was a loud noise made by happy American audience. 3. U-571 This 2000 film was directed by Jonathan Mostow and starred Mathew MacConaughey, Havey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi. It took place during the Second World War(1939--1945). In the film, a German submarine(warship underwater) is boarded in 1942 by American soldiers who made themselves up as Germans. They took away the German submarine's code-language machine, which,...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? James Watt (30 January 1736 (19 January 1736 OS) - 25 August 1819) was a Scottish inventor, mechanical engineer, and chemist who improved on Thomas Newcomen's 1712 Newcomen steam engine with his Watt steam engine in 1781, which was fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both his native Great Britain and the rest of the world. While working as an instrument maker at the University of Glasgow, Watt became interested in the technology of steam engines. He realised that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder. Watt introduced a design enhancement, the separate condenser, which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of steam engines. From an early age Watt was very interested in chemistry. In late 1786, while in Paris, he witnessed an experiment by Berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. He had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles, and had published his findings, which aroused great interest among many potential rivals. When Watt returned to Britain, he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process. He discovered that a mixture of salt, manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine, which Watt believed might be a cheaper method. He passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali, and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties. He soon communicated these results to James McGrigor, his father-in-law, who was a bleacher in Glasgow. Otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret. With McGrigor and his wife Annie, he started to scale up the process, and in March 1788, McGrigor was able to bleach 1500 yards of cloth to his satisfaction. About this time Berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process, and published it so it became public knowledge. Many others began to experiment with improving the process, which still had many shortcomings, not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product. Watt's rivals soon overtook him in developing the process, and he dropped out of the race. It was not until 1799, when Charles Tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) that it became a commercial success. By 1794 Watt had been chosen by Thomas Beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce, clean and store gases for use in the new Pneumatic Institution at Hotwells in Bristol. Watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years, but by 1797 the medical uses for the \\"factitious airs\\" had come to a dead end.

Please answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Great for a SHORT TERM replacement... Review: I bought this to replace my 'falling apart' original charger. Worked like a charm for 3 months, then I found my computer dying on me. The charging signal would change frequently from charging to not etc.. I ordered a new battery, as i thought it was on its way out. I downloaded coconutbattery, and that explained all i needed it to. It showed the charger as connected, BUT not charging. I scrounged up my old charger, hooked it up, and sure enough, connected AND charging. It is without a doubt the macally charger. So i recommend it if you only plan on using it for 3 months or less. So not only am I out a charger, i ordered a battery for no reason.
