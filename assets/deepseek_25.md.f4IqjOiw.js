Movie title: Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa Context: The movie starts in the past, in an African reserve, when Alex the Lion was just a little cub, being tutored in the art of being a lion, by his doting father, Zuba, who is also the Alpha Lion. Alex is full of life and more interested in playing the fool, by dancing around and doing the \\"happy face/angry face\\" gag with his paw. Zuba shows him his paw, which has an Africa-shaped birthmark on it, which Alex also has on his paw. Just then, Makunga (Alec Baldwin), a scheming lion who wants to be Alpha Lion, challenges Zuba. Leaving Alex alone for a while, Zuba kicks the pride out of Makunga. As the fight is going on, Alex notices a piece of rope moving on the ground and follows it. He goes off the reserve and is captured by poachers, who dump him in a crate and put him in the bed of their truck. Zuba notices that his son is missing. He sees the truck moving along the fence of the reserve and hears his son, crying out for help. He runs and jumps on the truck. He manages to free the crate of its binds, when one of the poachers shoots him, causing him to fall off the truck. He doesn't notice that Alex's crate has fallen out of the truck-bed and into a nearby river. Despite the painful hole in his ear, he mourns the loss of his son.Meanwhile, in the box, Alex sits timidly. Finally, he reaches New York City and is fished out and put in the New York City Zoo. When he sees all the people looking at him, he starts to dance around, much to the audience's pleasure. As he vamps for the people, behind him, a young Marty the Zebra tells a young Gloria (the Hippo) and Melman (the Giraffe) that Alex is a show-off. Years later, Alex is still a huge hit with the zoo spectators. Marty (Chris Rock) tells Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman (David Schwimmer) that he still thinks he's a show-off.

Temperley writes: \\"After 1855 [Bennett] was spurred by belated honours, and occasional commissions, to compose a respectable number of significant and substantial works, though it was too late to recapture his early self-confidence.\\" Works from his later years included the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti; a pastoral cantata, The May Queen, Op. 39, for the opening of the Leeds Town Hall in 1858; an Ode (Op. 40) with words by Alfred, Lord Tennyson for the opening of the 1862 International Exhibition in London; an Installation Ode for Cambridge University (Op. 41) with words by Charles Kingsley, which included a lament for the late Prince Albert; a symphony in G minor (Op. 43); a sacred cantata,The Woman of Samaria for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1867; and finally a second Piano Sonata (The Maid of Orleans, Op. 46). Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa, who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct anything by Bennett. Eventually it was conducted by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber also commissioned for the occasion. The affair leaked into the press, and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour.In March 1856 Bennett, while still teaching at the RAM and Queen's College, was elected Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge. He modernised the system of awarding music degrees, instituting viva voce examinations and requiring candidates for doctorates to first take the degree of Bachelor of Music. Two years later on 8 June 1868 the newly formed (later Royal) College of Organists awarded him an Honorary Fellowship.In 1858 came yet another clash involving Costa, when the autocratic Earl of Westmorland, the original founder of the RAM, saw fit to arrange a subscription concert for the Academy to include a Mass of his own composition, to be conducted by Costa and using the orchestra and singers of the Opera, over the...

But Swedish entrepreneur Oscar Dios thinks they can be persuaded otherwise and he has created a new kind of hostel to prove it. Dios says it is the world's first jumbo (unusually large) jet hostel, an actual jet-plane at Sweden's main airport outside Stockholm which has been changed into a 25- room guesthouse that sleeps as many as 72 people. \\"I learned about this plane that was standing deserted at Arlanda airport and I've been trying the concept of hostels in many different houses and buildings,\\" he told Reuters. \\"I thought, 'Why not a plane?'\\" Jumbo Hostels opened for business on Thursday, giving customers the chance to check in and sleep in a room that can best be described as comfortable.\\" \\"The most challenging part with this project is trying to build something inside a metal hull - it's just really, really tight.\\" The jet, which was originally produced for Singapore Airlines, was taken out of service in 2002. It is held on a concrete foundation with the landing gear secured in steel cradles. One feature of the hostel is its price - a room starts at 350 Swedish crowns (about 41), which is a lot less than hotel rooms outside of major airports. Another feature is that customers can get married on the wing of the plane and stay in the plane's more luxurious honeymoon suite . Instead of walking down the aisle in the church, lovebirds can take what Jumbo Hostels calls the \\"wing walk,\\" where they can be joined in great happiness at the wing tip. The hostel has someone ready to perform the ceremony. But in some respects this hostel remains a plane - most customers have to share the jet's nine bathrooms and the staff only wear air host and hostess outfits. The only room that has its own bathroom is the honeymoon suite. Question: One of the features of the plane hostel is that _ . - customers can sleep in comfortable rooms - air hostesses can offer good service - a wedding ceremony can be held on the wing - the staff can have a \\"wing walk\\" Answer:","completion":"One of the features of the plane hostel is that a wedding ceremony can be held on the wing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Ted Skjellum (born 4 March 1972), also known by the stage names Nocturno Culto, Nocturno or Kveldulv, is a Norwegian musician best known as the vocalist, lead guitarist, and partial bassist (shared with Fenriz) of the influential black metal band Darkthrone. He has been with the band since 1988. He is also the vocalist of the band Sarke. He currently works in Norway as a school teacher, and has a son and a daughter. He has also released a documentary film called \\"The Misanthrope\\" in which he deals with black metal music and life in Norway. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Gylve Fenris Nagell (born 28 November 1971), better known as Fenriz, is a Norwegian musician and politician who is best known as being one half of the metal duo Darkthrone. Although primarily a drummer, he has also performed bass, guitar and vocals for Darkthrone and a number of other metal bands. Fenriz is known for his refusal to play live, his obsessiveness about music listening, supporting other underground bands and his lack of interest in the mainstream music business in general. Fenriz has had three solo projects: the folk metal project Isengard, the dark ambient project Neptune Towers and the doom metal project Red Planet. - Darkthrone is a Norwegian black metal band. It formed in 1986 as a death metal band under the name Black Death. In 1991, the band embraced a black metal style influenced by Bathory and Celtic Frost and became one of the leading bands in the Norwegian black metal scene. Their first three black metal albums\\"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\\", \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\" (sometimes dubbed the \\"Unholy Trinity\\") are considered the peak of the band's career and to be among the most influential albums in the genre. For most of this time, Darkthrone has been a duo of Nocturno Culto and Fenriz, who have sought to remain outside the music mainstream. Since 2006, their work has strayed from the traditional black metal style and incorporated more elements of traditional heavy metal, speed metal and punk rock, being likened to Motörhead. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Lovecraftian horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (and in some cases, unknowable) more than gore or other elements of shock, though these may still be present. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890 1937). - A Blaze in the Northern Sky is the second studio album by Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone. It was released on 26 February 1992 by Peaceville Records. It contained the band's first black metal recordings, and is considered a classic within the genre. It was the first album of what fans dub the \\"Unholy Trinity\\", the other albums being \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\". The last album to feature bassist Dag Nilsen. - Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on lead guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums. - Necrophilia, also called thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act involving corpses. The attraction is classified as a paraphilia by the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\" (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association. The term was coined by the Belgian alienist Joseph Guislain, who first used it in a lecture in 1850. It derives from the Greek words \\"\\" (\\"nekros\\"; \\"dead\\") and \\"\\" (\\"philia\\"; \\"love\\"). - Peaceville Records is a British independent heavy metal record label. The label was founded by Paul \\"Hammy\\" Halmshaw (of the bands Instigators and Civilised Society) in Dewsbury, England in 1987, who was also a one-time drummer of Sore Throat. Originally a tape label releasing anarcho punk, the releases moved towards metal through crust punk and similar forms of metal-influenced English hardcore punk. Halmshaw started running the label full-time in 1988, although the original tape label incarnation was founded in 1981 as a vehicle for releasing Instigators demo cassettes. - Ivar Enger , also known as \`\` Zephyrous '' , is a guitarist who played for black metal band Darkthrone . He is credited as featuring on the band 's first three albums ; Soulside Journey , A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon , as well as the Goatlord album ; the rehearsal tapes of what was originally intended to be their second album ( with later added vocals ) . He is said to have left due to delving into misanthropy , instead of generally leaving , as Darkthrone never had touring stress and he did n't leave prior because of the swift change from death metal to black metal , like other former member Dag Nielsen did . The band maintains that Zephyrous went into a forest and never returned . However , in a 2006 interview with the German website Voices From The Dark Side , Nocturno Culto claims he still has contact with Zephyrous and would like him to join the band as a guest on a few songs at some point . Very little information about Zephyrous is known , as Darkthrone have always maintained mystery about themselves , let alone past members . In two interviews in 2001 and 2002 with Nocturno Culto , he stated that Zephyrous left Darkthrone partly because he felt \`\` left out '' by N.Culto and Fenriz , who were very close at the time , and partly because he was an alcoholic and had a black out while driving his car . \`\` He woke up in the hospital with much strings attached to him '' . \`\` He left Darkthrone in much anger '' .

A dog running with a toy could be engaged in various activities and contexts, not always involving another person or its owner. First, it's essential to recognize the potential interpretations or scenarios for a dog running with a toy: 1. The dog could indeed be playing fetch with its owner, retrieving a thrown toy and returning it to the person who threw it. 2. The dog might be playing by itself, having found a toy lying around or carrying its own toy and running around for fun, without any external involvement. 3. A dog may also engage in playtime with other animals, like another dog or a pet from a different species. In this case, the dog could be running with a toy as part of the game with another animal, but not necessarily with its owner. 4. Another possibility is that someone else, like a friend, a neighbor, or a dog walker, is participating in a game with the dog. In this scenario, the dog's owner may not be involved in the playtime at all. Due to these multiple plausible explanations, it is not possible to tell whether a dog running with a toy indicates that it is playing fetch with its owner.

Article:A crowd of 66,014 in Miami on Saturday watched goals from Lionel Messi and Ivan Rakitic give Barca an early lead before Mateo Kovacic and Marco Asensio pulled Real level. The spectators at the Hard Rock stadium were then treated to a prolonged half-time break with music, lights and fireworks more akin to the Super Bowl. When the game eventually restarted, Gerard Pique steered in a Neymar free-kick to give last season's Copa del Rey winners victory over the reigning Spanish and European champions. Brazil forward Neymar played for 72 minutes as speculation continues about a world record 220m euros (£197m) move to Paris St-Germain. The 25-year-old was left clutching an ankle in the opening minutes of the game. However, he recovered to set up Rakitic after just seven minutes, before delivering a pin-point free-kick for Pique in the second half. \\"I don't want to speculate about Neymar,\\" said Barcelona head coach Ernesto Valverde after the match. \\"I always try to talk about things that happen rather than things that might happen. \\"We are going to wait. From my perspective, we have Neymar in our team, we count on him and we have to see.\\" PSG full-back Dani Alves, a former Barcelona team-mate of Neymar, has urged his compatriot to \\"be brave\\" when making a choice about his future. \\"It's an important decision for him and it's the kind of decision men have to make,\\" said Alves. \\"I helped him come to Barcelona.

Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples. and a hint : Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. Please answer this question : In which sample less rocks would have chemical reactions, sample A or sample B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Sample B. Step 1: Understanding the relationship between rainfall and chemical reactions in soil. The hint provided states that rainfall influences the rate of weathering (breakdown of rocks) in an area. More rain causes more rainwater to pass through the soil, which results in increased chemical reactions between the water and the particles in the soil. Step 2: Identifying the amount of rainfall in sample A and sample B. Sample A, from the Amazon Rainforest, has one of the highest amounts of rainfall in the world. In contrast, sample B, from the Atacama Desert, has one of the lowest amounts of rainfall in the world. Step 3: Comparing the potential for chemical reactions in both samples. Since high rainfall leads to increased amounts of rock experiencing chemical reactions, we can conclude that sample A with its high rainfall will have more chemical reactions occurring in its soil. On the other hand, sample B, with its low rainfall, will have fewer chemical reactions taking place. In conclusion, less rocks would have chemical reactions in sample B, due to the significantly lower amount of rainfall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

So I used to do highland dancing with my brother. I'd compete, do shows, etc. But after 2-3 years of dancing I started to hate it. My dance teacher didn't like me, I had no friends at the studio, and my younger brother was actually better than me, so I felt like a failure. Anyways, I had told my parents and my dance teacher that I was not going to compete anymore. I said I will keep dancing to stay active and do some little shows for fun. I emphasized this a lot. Only for fun, and only small shows. I still wasn't liking it though. I had awful balance, was darker-skinned and shorter than all the others and I overall just didn't fit in. So one day my mom is telling me about this show my brother and the other girls are doing at some boating club or something. I felt like the tone was weird, and I was right. She told me a girl had gotten sick with the stomach flu and they wanted a replacement. I said no, I told you I wanted to stop and it was stressing me out. She said she TOLD THE TEACHER I WOULD ANYWAYS. WITHOUT ASKING ME. I burst into tears, freaked the fuck out, and basically had an anxiety attack. she told me this the literal night before by the way. I didn't even know the dances and routines, like AT ALL. I go in for extra classes that night and the next day and get a shaky grasp of the routine. I go to the show, sweating, hyperventilating, etc. We do the dances and stuff pretty well. I think me and another girl both made a few mistakes. The dance teacher singled me out after and got upset at only me. I was sad and felt unappreciated. I go home that night, cry, fall asleep. The next day I post a pic of my dance shoes on my instagram story with the caption \\"ur supposed to ask the backup dancers before u make them backup dance lol\\". I know I fucked up. I know it was awful and mean and I was a terrible person. I didn't mean for anyone to see it, I was just sad and upset and felt betrayed. So the next week my fam and I go out for a nice dinner. My brother then says, AT THE DINNER TABLE that my dance teacher told him that she hated me. SHE TOLD MY BROTHER AND NOT ME, IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE DANCE CLASS. She had somehow seen the story, but she didn't have insta, so somebody showed it to her. I knew they didn't like me but I didn't think they'd do that. I almost cried at the dinner table, and when we got home I went upstairs and cried. I was scared and angry and sorry for what I did, so I right away delete it, email my dance teacher and the girl I filled for that I was really sorry, I didn't want to offend them, and that it was kinda a jab at my mom. I never went back to dance. The girl seems to have forgiven me, and she is honestly the sweetest person. i think she was the only one who didn't hate me there. I then basically hid from my dance teacher for a few months, never going to pick up my brother, never going to his shows or comps. My mom forced me to come see her at the studio christmas party. I bought her some cookies from Scotland in a cute highland dancer-patterned tin. She seemed to have forgiven me, kind of. I've seen her a few times since. my question is, did I do something wrong? Everyone is siding with her, but i was literally forced into something I didn't want nor know how to do, then berated when i fucked it up. What the fuck?

This suggests that not only are the falls and the plantation near each other, they might be part of the same property or geographical area. There's no information provided within the premise that shows any type of physical or temporal separation between the YS Falls and the old plantation. On the contrary, the details suggest a direct link or association between the two. The old plantation serves as a historical marker that might provide more contextual understanding of the location and significance of YS Falls. It's important to remember that hypotheses should be formed based on evidence or clues presented in the premise or data set. In this case, the premise directly contradicts the hypothesis that \\"The YS Falls are nowhere near the old plantation.\\" Without further information or context suggesting a significant change in the relationship between the two geographical locations, the hypothesis holds no validity based on the given premise. Lastly, it's worth noting that \\"nearby\\" is a subjective term that can vary based on individual perspectives. However, usually in geographical or historical contexts, \\"nearby\\" generally insinuates walking or short travel distance, which challenges the hypothesis pointing towards a far or non-existing proximity between YS Falls and the old plantation that dates back to 1684."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The ace will represent 1 for this trick and will be the very top card on your pile. The cards can be any suit or color. Do this before your audience arrives. The rest of the deck can be in any order. Avoid shuffling after you put the cards on top, though, so you don’t mess them up. Be careful not to jumble the cards as you put them in your pocket. You want the ace, 2, 4, and 8 to stay on top. Remember which side of the deck is the top when you hide the cards. If you don’t have a pocket, hold the cards under a table or anywhere hidden where the audience can’t see them. They can choose 15, but it can’t be any number larger than that. Have them tell you their number out loud. You can have them write down the number on a piece of paper, too, if you need a visual. Every number between 1 and 15 can be formed by adding up some or all of the 4 top cards in your pocket. The collection of numbers that sum up to the number your audience gave you is known as its binary decomposition. Instead of trying to add different numbers using trial and error, start by subtracting the largest of your 4 cards from the audience’s number. Then subtract the next largest number and so on, until you reach 0. Don’t use a calculator or paper to do your calculation. You have to do it mentally for the trick to be impressive. You should know where each card is because you set them on the deck in the order of 1 (ace), 2, 4, and 8. Carefully remove the correct cards.

Once you pull out the cards, arrange them in your hand so that the numbers are visible. Then flip them around so your audience can see them. Explain that the numbers add up to their chosen number.

Answer:","completion":"The governor of Colorado in 2009 was Bill Ritter. William Edward \\"Bill\\" Ritter Jr. was born on September 6, 1956, in Denver, Colorado. He is an American politician, lawyer, and a member of the Democratic Party. Ritter served as the 41st Governor of Colorado from January 9, 2007, to January 11, 2011. Before serving as Governor, Ritter was the District Attorney of Denver from 1993 to 2005. He pursued a career in public service after working as a private practice attorney. As District Attorney, Ritter was recognized for his work in fighting against domestic violence, child abuse, and general crime in the city of Denver. In 2006, he announced his candidacy for the Governor of Colorado. Ritter won the Democratic primary unopposed and later defeated the Republican candidate Bob Beauprez in the general election, winning 56.9% of the total vote. During his tenure as governor, Ritter focused on various issues such as renewable energy, job creation, economic development, health care, and education. Under Ritter's administration, Colorado saw significant progress in clean energy development. He introduced the \\"New Energy Economy\\" initiative to create jobs, reduce the state's dependence on fossil fuels, and enhance energy security. This initiative led to multiple investments in renewable energy sources and research, including solar, wind, and biofuels. Ritter also promoted job growth and economic development during his tenure as Governor. He invested in workforce training programs to prepare Colorado residents for future job markets and worked with businesses, entrepreneurs, and educational institutions to focus on technology, energy, and healthcare industries. When it came to healthcare, Ritter aimed at expanding access to affordable healthcare for Colorado residents, including children. He expanded the eligibility criteria for the Child Health Plan Plus (CHP+) to provide coverage to more children in low-income families and laid the groundwork for the establishment of a health insurance exchange in Colorado. Additionally, Ritter implemented education reforms focused on advancing academic achievement, closing achievement gaps, and raising the high school graduation rate. Under his leadership, Colorado became a national leader in innovation, with programs focused on turning around struggling schools and boosting student success. Ritter decided not to run for re-election in 2010 and was succeeded by fellow Democrat and former Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper. Since leaving political office, Ritter has remained engaged in promoting clean energy, sustainability, and environmental causes. He currently serves as the Director of the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University, where he works on energy policies at the state and federal levels. In conclusion, Bill Ritter was the Governor of Colorado in 2009. As the 41st Governor, he focused on a wide range of issues including renewable energy, job growth, healthcare, and education. Though he served only one term, Ritter's achievements continue to have a lasting impact on the state of Colorado."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Having signed a contract with the Houston Texans on the evening before the draft, Mario Williams, a defensive end from North Carolina State, became the drafts first pick. The selection surprised many commentators, who predicted that the Texans would draft Southern California running back Reggie Bush or Texas quarterback Vince Young. Ohio State produced the most first round selections (five), while Southern California produced the most overall selections (eleven).

Write a title for this article: James Vincent slotted in a late goal as 10-man Inverness Caledonian Thistle won the Scottish Cup for the first time. The Premiership side took the lead after 38 minutes when Marley Watkins ran on to a clever Aaron Doran pass to round goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald. Peter Grant nodded in an equaliser with 10 minutes to go as Falkirk rallied, shortly after Carl Tremarco was sent off for hauling down Blair Alston. But, with the Championship side in the ascendancy, Vincent scored a winner. Inverness broke from defence and MacDonald, Falkirk's semi-final hero, failed to hold a tame Watkins shot, leaving Englishman Vincent a simple tap-in. It meant that, having lost out in last season's League Cup final, the Highland club celebrated the first major trophy of the 21-year history. And it caps a season in which John Hughes' side secured their highest ever top-flight placing - third - and qualified for the Europa League. But they were pushed all the way by a club Hughes previously played for and managed. Falkirk dominated the second half as their boss, Peter Houston, attempted to become just the third manager to win the Scottish Cup with two different clubs after triumphing with Dundee United in 2010. But the 14,000 Caley Thistle fans were the ones celebrating, along with those of St Johnstone, whose fourth-place league finish is now good enough to earn a place alongside Hughes's team in Europa League qualifying. Inverness had looked comfortable going in at the interval in front thanks to Watkins' goal, which he converted with aplomb, gliding away from Grant and MacDonald to slide Doran's pass into the net. But Falkirk were a changed side after the break and, when Tremarco was dismissed for hauling down Alston and denying him a goal-scoring opportunity, they really turned the screw. Alston's free kick was headed in at the back post by Grant and the underdogs suddenly became favourites to win the cup for the first time since 1957. But Vincent dashed their dreams as he fulfilled those of the Caley Thistle fans, who celebrated with their heroes as the full-time whistle sounded.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two questions aren't exactly paraphrases of each other; they probe into distinct aspects of the deaf experience related with sound and its perception. 1. \\"What do deaf people hear internally when they read?\\" This question is about the mental experiences of deaf individuals when they are reading. In particular, it's asking whether, and if so, how deaf people \\"hear\\" the words in their mind when they're reading. In the context of understanding this, it's important to distinguish between people who are born deaf or become deaf before learning language (prelingual deafness), and those who lose their hearing after they have learned language (postlingual deafness). People with postlingual deafness have experienced sound and language, and thus, they might \\"hear\\" internally when reading based on their remembrance of those sounds. It's like when hearing persons read, they often subvocally pronounce the words, leading to an internal auditory experience, also recognized as the \\"inner voice.\\" In contrast, persons with prelingual deafness have no memory of sound to \\"hear.\\" Instead, it is suggested they might visualize the signs corresponding to what they are reading if they primarily communicate using sign language, or they may experience a sort of visual or kinetic internal imagining of the text. They could also use contextual clues to create an understanding in their mind. Each individual's experience may vary and would be subject to their personal cognitive and perceptual strategies. 2. \\"What do deaf people imagine hearing sound is like?\\" This question, on the other hand, is seeking to comprehend how deaf people conceptualize sound. If an individual has been deaf since birth or before they had the chance to experience sound, what form would their understanding of sound take? This is a challenging question, given the subjective and personal nature of sensory experiences. For someone who has never heard, creating a conceptual schema for sound might be based on their other sensory experiences like vibrations, rhythms, visual and haptic sensations. The interpretation of hearing or sound could be distantly analogous to feeling a heavy bass sound, feeling surfaces vibrate or noticing ripple effects on liquids caused by sound waves. Nevertheless, the deaf person's understanding of sound is inherently unique and can't be stereotyped. To conclude, while both questions deal with the perception of sound-related phenomena in deaf individuals, they are exploring different aspects. The first one is about their internal experience when reading and the second seeks to understand their conceptualization of what sound might be. These distinct queries help us gain a slightly broader insight into the complexity and diversity of the deaf perceptual universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices?","completion":"A. Intensive surveillance and monitoring B. Smallpox vaccination campaigns C. Quarantine protocols D. Antiviral medications The correct answer to the question is B. Smallpox vaccination campaigns. Smallpox, caused by the variola virus, was a highly contagious and deadly disease with a mortality rate of around 30%. In the past, it affected millions of individuals worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) certified the eradication of smallpox in 1980, marking it as the first disease to be eradicated by human effort, and this success is primarily due to the widespread use of smallpox vaccination campaigns. Vaccination campaigns against smallpox were instrumental in preventing the spread of the disease and eventually leading to its eradication. These campaigns used the smallpox vaccine, which contains a live virus known as vaccinia, which is closely related to the variola virus. Once an individual receives the vaccine, their immune system develops a response that protects them against smallpox, creating herd immunity that prevents the spread of the disease within communities. Edward Jenner, an English physician, is credited with the discovery of the smallpox vaccine (smallpox and cowpox material) in 1796. By the early 20th century, several countries implemented mandatory smallpox vaccination programs, which were later expanded to other countries with the support of international organizations. In 1967, the WHO initiated an Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program that aimed to eradicate smallpox globally by utilizing vaccination campaigns. The program involved surveillance and containment strategies, in addition to mass vaccination of entire populations in affected areas. The last known natural case of smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977, and after careful examination and investigations, WHO declared the eradication of smallpox in 1980. While other measures like intensive surveillance, monitoring, quarantine protocols, and antiviral medications also have a role in controlling infectious diseases, it is the smallpox vaccination campaigns that were the most responsible for preventing future pandemics of smallpox. Although smallpox no longer exists in the natural environment, efforts are being made to maintain high biosafety procedures in laboratories possessing variola virus stocks to ensure that the virus is not accidentally released. The success of the smallpox vaccination campaigns is a testament to the power of vaccines and serves as a motivating example for the eradication of other infectious diseases, such as polio and Guinea worm disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Henry Gustav Molaison (February 26, 1926 - December 2, 2008), known widely as H.M., was an American memory disorder patient who had a bilateral medial temporal lobectomy to surgically resect the anterior two thirds of his hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, entorhinal cortices, piriform cortices, and amygdalae in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. Although the surgery was partially successful in controlling his epilepsy, a severe side effect was that he became unable to form new memories. H.M. was widely studied from late 1957 until his death in 2008. His case played an important role in the development of theories that explain the link between brain function and memory, and in the development of cognitive neuropsychology, a branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to specific psychological processes. Henry Molaison was born on February 26, 1926, and experienced intractable epilepsy that has sometimes been attributed to a bicycle accident at the age of seven. (This accident was initially reported to have occurred at age nine, but was corrected by the patient's mother at a later stage.) He had partial seizures for many years, and then several tonic-clonic seizures following his 16th birthday. In 1953, he was referred to William Beecher Scoville, a neurosurgeon at Hartford Hospital, for treatment. Scoville localized Molaison's epilepsy to his left and right medial temporal lobes (MTLs) and suggested surgical resection of the MTLs as a treatment. On September 1, 1953, at the age of 27, Molaison's bilateral medial temporal lobe resection included the removal of the hippocampal formation and adjacent structures, including most of the amygdaloid complex and entorhinal cortex. His hippocampi appeared entirely nonfunctional because the remaining 2 cm of hippocampal tissue appeared to have atrophied and because the entire entorhinal cortex, which forms the major sensory input to the hippocampus, was destroyed. Some of his anterolateral temporal cortex was also destroyed. After the surgery, which was partially successful in its primary goal of controlling his epilepsy, Molaison developed severe anterograde amnesia: although his working memory and procedural memory were intact, he could not commit new events to his explicit memory. According to some scientists, he was impaired in his ability to form new semantic knowledge, but researchers argue over the extent of this impairment. He also had moderate retrograde amnesia, and could not remember most events in the one- to two-year period before surgery, nor some events up to 11 years before, meaning that his amnesia was temporally graded. However, his ability to form long-term procedural memories was intact; thus he could, for example, learn new motor skills, despite not being able to remember learning them. The case was first reported in a paper by Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. Near the end of his life, Molaison regularly filled in crossword puzzles. He was able to fill in answers to clues that referred to pre-1953 knowledge. For post-1953 information he was able to modify old memories with new information. For instance, he could add a memory about Jonas Salk by modifying his memory of polio. He died on December 2, 2008. Did he learn any tricks to deal with this?","completion":"Yes, Henry Molaison was able to learn new motor skills, despite not being able to remember learning them. As mentioned in the article, \\"his ability to form long-term procedural memories was intact; thus he could, for example, learn new motor skills, despite not being able to remember learning them.\\" This suggests that he developed tricks or techniques to cope with his memory issues by relying on his procedural memory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Tiny monitoring devices have become an increasingly common way for scientists to study elusive animals that are difficult to track on a day-to-day basis. However, now it seems that smart. seals have caught on to the trick and are using it to their advantage to catch fish! To find out if that is true, a team of researchers from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland selected a group often young grey seals that had neither encountered the ocean nor been exposed to any kind of acoustic tags. The researchers then placed the seals one at a time, inside a pool that contained 20 foraging boxes, only two of which housed fish -- one with tags and the other without. Each seal was allowed to explore the boxes twenty separate times. In order to ensure that mammal was not depending on its memory, the fish were moved to different boxes each time. At first, there was no difference in the amount of time it took the seals to discover the tagged and untagged fish. However, after they had been in the pool a few times, they started locating the tagged fish much faster. To confirm that this indeed was the case, there searchers conducted a second experiment using two boxes -- one with pieces of fish and the other with just acoustic tags. Sure enough, the seals were all attracted to the one that was sending out signals. While this experiment involved only seals, the researchers believe that other marine mammals may also be using the information to catch prey. Sadly, predators like sharks that have been tagged by scientists may be negatively affected, as pings they emit could warn their prey of their presence. Besides potentially messing up nature's food chain, the \\"dinner bell\\" effect of the acoustic tags could also mean that the conclusions reached by previous fish studies may not be correct. Now that the secret is out, scientists will have to come up with another way to conduct their studies -- one that is not detectable by the crafty marine animals. Question: The researchers seem to believe that sharks tagged by scientists _ . Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The researchers seem to believe that sharks tagged by scientists may be negatively affected by the acoustic tags they carry. These tags emit pings or signals that can potentially warn their prey of their presence, making it more difficult for the sharks to successfully catch their prey. This could have consequences for the sharks' survival and behavior, as well as for the balance of the marine food chain. Moreover, the \\"dinner bell\\" effect of the acoustic tags may also lead to questioning the validity of conclusions reached by previous fish studies that used such tagging methods. Therefore, the researchers imply that there is a need to develop new, undetectable methods for studying marine animals, without impacting their natural behaviors or the overall marine ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? George Wright (January 28, 1847 - August 21, 1937) was an American baseball player. He played shortstop for the original Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first fully professional team, when he was the game's best player. In 1868, Wright won the Clipper Medal for being the best shortstop in baseball. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937. Harry Wright was hired to organize a new team in Boston, where he signed three teammates including George for 1871. He brought along the nickname, too; if the nickname is the tenth man or the player-manager counts double, Harry thereby composed half the team that just missed winning the first National Association pennant. George suffered a broken leg and missed half the season; one more win at the right time would have been decisive in Boston's favor. With some personnel changes, the Boston Red Stockings won the other four NA pennants, dominating so severely in 1875 that they helped provoke a new league. The team trailed badly in the first National League season, after the defection of its Big Four western players to Chicago, but rebounded to win again both 1877-78. George Wright had played an even decade for Harry's teams, beginning with the First Nine and closing with six league championships in seven. (Another 1869 hire, Andy Leonard, was present for all but the 1871 second-place finish.) The Providence Grays, new in the NL for 1878, hired George to lead the team in 1879. He did as well as possible, wrestling the championship for himself from older brother Harry; for Providence and Rhode Island from older and regionally dominant Boston and Massachusetts. But Wright & Ditson Sporting Goods was growing, so George returned to Boston for business reasons. He remains the only man to win the pennant in his lone season as manager. Meanwhile, the National League introduced the reserve list system, and Providence listed George, so he was not free to sign with Boston. (Until the 1879-80 off-season, every professional baseball player was a \\"free agent\\" for every season.) During the next two seasons he played only a few games.. When Boston changed managers for 1882, Harry signed to lead Providence and inherited the right to sign his brother. George agreed to play another season full-time, retiring after the 1882 season with a .302 batting average in the major leagues from 1871. In 1882 George Wright took up cricket seriously again with the Longwood Cricket Club of Boston where he dominated local cricket sides with Isaac Chambers, the Longwood cricket pro and greenskeeper, holding up the other bowling end. In 1891 George Wright captained the Longwood Cricket Club against Lord Hawke's visiting English side. Wright's side surprised the visiting English first-class players with accurate bowling which kept the tourist in check. In 1892 George Wright donated cricket gear to British Guianese (Guyana) cricket players thereby starting a century old tradition of West Indian cricket in New England.","completion":"This text is about George Wright, an American baseball player who played shortstop for the original Cincinnati Red Stockings and was one of the best players of his time.

I call it \\"the George Zimmerman trial\\" because that's what it is, but the more I watch, the more I wonder: Should it be renamed \\"the Trayvon Martin trial?\\" I'm not just talking about some of the media's tabloid-like focus on Martin's background, his personal history, his school records and -- outside the courtroom -- the toxicology report. I'm talking about an aspect of the case that never comes up in the media coverage, one that I would argue is key. This murder trial, in and out of the courtroom, has been boiled down to one question: Was Zimmerman in fear for his life and thus justified in defending himself by shooting and killing Martin? It has been framed this way -- in terms of Zimmerman's mortal fear -- since the shooting in 2012. Zimmerman's assumptions led to death, prosecutor argues. Some people have forgotten that Zimmerman was not even arrested initially. It took more than a month for the special prosecutor to bring the second-degree murder charge. And if not for mass protests across the country, he might not be the defendant in a murder trial at all. The question that has not surfaced in the courtroom -- the elephant in the room -- is this: Did Martin fear for his life after being followed and confronted by a stranger while going to the store to buy candy and a soft drink? Was he, Martin, justified in standing his ground and defending himself when this stranger, an apparent stalker, approached him in a threatening manner? Zimmerman didn't identify himself and never said he was part of the neighborhood watch group. Think about it: We're told over and over that if Zimmerman was afraid of Martin, according to Florida law, he had the right to put a bullet in the chamber of his concealed handgun, get out of his car after being told not to by the 911 dispatcher and follow and confront Martin and shoot him to death. At the same time, we are told that Martin, who had far greater reason to fear Zimmerman, practically and for reasons of American history, did not have the right to confront his stalker, stand his ground and defend himself, including by using his fists. We are told that this was entirely unjustified and by doing so, Martin justified his own execution. Running updates from the Zimmerman trial. The phrases \\"stand your ground\\" and \\"self-defense\\" have been repeated endlessly by anchors, pundits, analysts and experts, but rarely applied to Martin. How could this be? Why is this other question ignored? Surely it will come up as we approach the trial, I thought. But it hasn't. What's going on here? How can the Florida law apply only to Zimmerman and not to Martin? I remembered the sharp, sometimes bitter commentary provoked by Spike Lee's 1989 film \\"Do the Right Thing,\\" particularly in reaction to its climactic scenes, when the police murder a black teenager and Lee's character throws a trash can through the window of the white-owned pizza place. Years after the movie came out, Lee told an interviewer, \\"White people still ask me why Mookie threw the can through the window. ...Twenty years later, they're still asking me that.\\" \\"No black person ever, in 20 years, no person of color has ever asked me why,\\" he said. This speak volumes about race and power relations in this country. Opinion: Zimmerman trial - it's about race. Here's what I think: Assuming Martin did engage Zimmerman physically, perhaps if the teen had hit back a little bit harder, perhaps if he had been able to prevent Zimmerman from grabbing his concealed and loaded gun and perhaps if witnesses had come to Martin's aid, then maybe he would be alive today. That's speculation. One thing I feel sure of is that if Martin, in fear for his life, had used Zimmerman's own gun to shoot and possibly kill his attacker, when the police arrived on the scene, they would not have failed to charge him with murder. Why hasn't the prosecution team used Florida law to argue strongly for Martin's right of self-defense, his right to stand his ground against a stalker? Why not turn the tables on Zimmerman's exclusive claim to that argument? It will be interesting to see whether this question even gets posed for the jury at all. It certainly will be front and center as this case is tried by the jury of history. And future generations will likely puzzle over how the term \\"racial profiling\\" could have been banned by the judge before the trial even began. This country's racial history, the list of names, like Sean Bell, Amadou Diallo, Oscar Grant and other victims of \\"deadly force\\" by the policeâ€”these represent an even bigger Elephant in the Room. They may have been ruled irrelevant in the courtroom, but they are certainly relevant to those who seek justice in this society. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Miller Francis. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The author discusses the George Zimmerman trial and raises the question of whether Trayvon Martin was justified in standing his ground and defending himself against Zimmerman.

Would \\"Although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years, their average life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"Answer: No, the information provided in the statement, \\"Although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years, their average life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years,\\" does not directly answer the question regarding the number of babies in a typical raccoon litter. Instead, this statement discusses the average life expectancy of raccoons in both captive and wild environments. To answer the question at hand, a typical raccoon litter consists of 2 to 5 kits (baby raccoons), with 3 or 4 being the most common number. However, litter size can vary based on factors such as the raccoon's age, health, and environmental conditions. In some cases, raccoon litters can have up to 7 kits, but this is relatively rare. After a gestation period of about 63 to 65 days, the mother raccoon, called a sow, gives birth to the litter in a safe den. The kits are born blind, but they tend to develop quite quickly, opening their eyes after about 3 weeks and becoming more independent by 12 weeks. By the time they reach 8 to 12 months of age, the raccoons will usually leave their mother's care to start their own lives. During the first year of their lives, raccoon kits are relatively vulnerable, with high mortality rates due to factors such as predation, disease, accidents, and human activities. This is one of the reasons behind the low average life expectancy of wild raccoons, as mentioned in the original statement. On the other hand, captive raccoons face fewer threats and benefit from a controlled environment with limited exposure to predators, diseases, and accidents. This explains the significant difference in the average life expectancy between captive and wild raccoons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

News article: Sam Smith hints that he will perform next James Bond song Grammy- and Brit award-winning singer Sam Smith has dropped the biggest hint yet that he could be recording the theme tune to the new James Bond film Spectre – by posting a photo of a ring emblazoned with the organisation’s logo. The 23-year-old star shared an image of the ring on his finger, featuring the symbol of an octopus with blade-like tentacles, which is associated with the fictional terrorist organisation in the 007 universe. While the In the Lonely Hour singer left the picture uncaptioned, fans were quick to speculate about his involvement with the Spectre theme song. The singer’s clue comes days after he denied he would be joining the ranks of Adele, Tina Turner, Madonna and Shirley Bassey by recording a Bond theme. He told BBC Radio 2 about his busy schedule, saying: “That’s not me. That’s definitely not me. “I’ve still got loads to do, I’ve got an Australia tour, but I kind of finish in December which is great, it gives me a chance to be in London, be in my home and go out with my friends.” Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, Paloma Faith and Lana Del Rey have also been linked to the Spectre theme song, although Sheeran claimed he was “too wet” for the gig and Faith said she had chased it too avidly.

Choose your answer from: [-] Clean the sponge in the microwave. Make sure the sponge is wet and microwave on high for one minute to kill bacteria. [-] Clean the sponge in the microwave. Make sure the sponge is dry and microwave on high for one hour to kill bacteria.","completion":"The better solution to make a sponge last longer by killing the germs in it would be to: Clean the sponge in the microwave. Make sure the sponge is wet and microwave on high for one minute to kill bacteria. This is the better solution for various reasons, such as: 1. Effectiveness in killing germs and bacteria: Microwaving a wet sponge for one minute on high has been proven to kill around 99.9% of bacteria, according to a study published in Scientific Reports. The heat and steam generated from a wet sponge can effectively eliminate the majority of pathogenic microorganisms, ensuring a cleaner and longer-lasting sponge. 2. Safety: Microwaving a dry sponge for an extended period, such as one hour, could potentially lead to a fire hazard due to the excessive heat without any moisture to dissipate the energy. On the other hand, a wet sponge being microwaved for a minute would not pose such risks, ensuring a safer method of cleaning while achieving the desired outcome of killing germs. 3. Energy efficiency: Microwaving a wet sponge for one minute is a more energy-efficient method compared to microwaving a dry sponge for one hour. By using less energy and accomplishing the goal in a shorter time frame, this solution is not only more environmentally friendly but also more cost-effective in the long run. 4. Preservation of sponge material: Microwaving a wet sponge for a shorter duration prevents the sponge from drying out and becoming brittle. A dry sponge subjected to one hour of microwaving could experience degradation of its materials, reducing its effectiveness and overall lifespan. 5. Mold and odor prevention: A wet sponge left sitting on the kitchen counter is an excellent breeding ground for fungi and bacteria that cause mold and unpleasant odors. Cleaning the sponge regularly using the one-minute microwaving method helps to keep it fresh and prevent the growth of mold and bad odors. In conclusion, the best and most efficient solution to make a sponge last longer and kill germs is to clean the sponge in the microwave, ensuring that it is wet and microwaving on high for one minute. This method is not only effective in eliminating bacteria but also in ensuring safety, energy efficiency, preservation of sponge material, and mold and odor prevention."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what does michael vick do?\\" Answer:","completion":"Michael Vick is a former professional American football player, who played as a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL).

Summarize the following: Before attempting to remove a broken lens, make sure to wash your hands well. Wash them for thirty seconds, and make sure to remove any dirt or oils under your fingernails. Dry them with a lint-free towel. Use a soap that is free from perfumes to reduce the risk of irritation. Get close to a mirror and use your thumb to hold your lower eyelid open and your index finger to hold your upper eyelid open. Try to locate the bits of contact lens in your eye with your other seeing eye. You might need a helper to direct you, especially if your eyesight prevents you from clearly seeing the lens fragments. Your helper should stick to giving direction and should not put their fingers in your eye or attempt to remove it themselves. Remove any large or easy to find pieces first as you would an intact lens. Move these pieces to the white of your eye. Carefully pinch them with the tips of your thumb and index finger (don't use your nails). Don’t throw any pieces away. Keep them in your contact lens case so they can help you determine if you’ve located and removed all fragments from your eye. Carefully move your eye up and down and side to side in order to locate smaller pieces. Try to hold your eyelids open as widely as possible in order to avoid scratching the surface of your eye. Small, jagged fragments might cause damage if they rub in between your eyelid or fingers and eye surface, so be very gentle in removing them. Check the label of your contact lens disinfectant to ensure that it’s safe to use for flushing your eye, or saline eye drops if you have them handy. Flush your eye with the solution, and try to let the liquid guide any remaining tiny pieces out of your eye. Continue to hold your eyelids wide open to let the solution and any leftover fragments drip out from your eye and socket. You may still feel like you have pieces stuck in your eye, since the fragments could have caused irritation. Use the pieces that you recovered and stored in your lens case to try to judge whether or not any pieces actually remain. If you’re unable to remove lens fragments using pinching or flushing techniques, you might have to visit your eye doctor. Making a quick visit to the doctor might seem like a hassle, but it’s certainly preferable to doing yourself harm by trying to get the broken lens out yourself. Your doctor will have more sensitive tools than you have at your disposal, and will more than likely be able to quickly and easily remove the pieces for you. See your doctor right away if your lens has scratched your eye. Summary:","completion":"To remove a broken lens, first wash and dry your hands properly with perfume-free soap.

Megamind tells Damien to soak the cube in water to get her back to normal, but unknown to Megamind, Damien decides not to do it and instead revels in his freedom from his mother. After the auction is over, Megamind reveals a suit he created that contains all of Metro Man's powers, which he will wear to protect Metro City. Minion finds a seemingly harmless button that had also not had been sold. Not knowing what the button does, Megamind pushes the button, and it reveals a giant robot called the Mega-Megamind, which Megamind put his evil self in. The robot thinks that Megamind is Metro Man, and starts attacking him. Megamind fights the robot with his new powers, but is defeated. He and Minion hide in the Invisible Car.

Translate this to English?","completion":"Translation: Molybdenum is a xanthine oxidase / aldehyde dehydrogenase and a sulfite oxidase, making it a known essential trace element for humans, animals, and plants. Molybdenum is an important micronutrient required for the proper functioning of various enzymes in the human body, as well as in animals and plants. Among these, molybdenum is an essential component of xanthine oxidase (also known as xanthine dehydrogenase), crucial for the metabolism of purines, which are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. Another key enzymatic function of molybdenum is its role in aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme that oxidizes aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids. This process is particularly important in the detoxification of various endogenous and exogenous aldehydes, including ethanol-derived acetaldehyde, which is a highly toxic substance. By assisting in the detoxification process, molybdenum contributes to cellular protection and overall health. Moreover, molybdenum functions as a cofactor in sulfite oxidase, an enzyme responsible for the conversion of sulfites to sulfates. This reaction is critical for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, such as methionine and cysteine, which are essential components of proteins. Sulfur compounds are also vital for the synthesis of numerous molecules, including coenzyme A, glutathione, and biotin. Consequently, molybdenum plays a significant role in overall metabolic health and the synthesis of vital biomolecules. Deficiency of molybdenum is quite rare, given its low dietary requirements and widespread availability in various food sources, such as legumes, nuts, whole grains, and leafy vegetables. Nonetheless, deficiency may lead to problems like impaired sulfur metabolism, an increased risk of certain cancers, and neurological disorders. In conclusion, molybdenum serves as a vital trace element for humans, animals, and plants due to its essential roles in multiple enzymatic reactions. This micronutrient contributes significantly to various metabolic processes and the synthesis of essential biomolecules, highlighting its indispensability to life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nina Simone (; born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21, 1933 - April 21, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger, and activist in the Civil Rights Movement. Simone employed a broad range of musical styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop. Born in North Carolina, the sixth child of a preacher, Waymon aspired to be a concert pianist. In an interview for Jet magazine, Simone stated that her controversial song \\"Mississippi Goddam\\" hurt her career. She claimed that the music industry reprimanded her by boycotting her records. Hurt and disappointed, Simone left the US in September 1970, flying to Barbados and expecting Stroud to communicate with her when she had to perform again. However, Stroud interpreted Simone's sudden disappearance, and the fact that she had left behind her wedding ring, as an indication of a desire for a divorce. As her manager, Stroud was in charge of Simone's income. Simone recorded her last album for RCA, It Is Finished, in 1974, and did not make another record until 1978, when she was persuaded to go into the recording studio by CTI Records owner Creed Taylor. The result was the album Baltimore, which, while not a commercial success, was fairly well received critically and marked a quiet artistic renaissance in Simone's recording output. Her choice of material retained its eclecticism, ranging from spiritual songs to Hall & Oates' \\"Rich Girl.\\" Four years later Simone recorded Fodder on My Wings on a French label. During the 1980s, Simone performed regularly at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London, where she recorded the album Live at Ronnie Scott's in 1984. Although her early on-stage style could be somewhat haughty and aloof, in later years, Simone particularly seemed to enjoy engaging her audiences sometimes by recounting humorous anecdotes related to her career and music and by soliciting requests. In 1987, the original 1958 recording of \\"My Baby Just Cares for Me\\" was used in a commercial for Chanel No. 5 perfume in Britain. This led to a re-release of the recording, which stormed to number 4 on the UK's NME singles chart, giving her a brief surge in popularity in the UK. When Simone returned to the United States, she learned that a warrant had been issued for her arrest for unpaid taxes (as a protest against her country's involvement with the Vietnam War), and returned to Barbados to evade the authorities and prosecution. Simone stayed in Barbados for quite some time and she had a lengthy affair with the Prime Minister, Errol Barrow. A close friend, singer Miriam Makeba, then persuaded her to go to Liberia. Later, she lived in Switzerland and the Netherlands, before settling in France in 1993. During a 1998 performance in Newark, she announced, \\"If you're going to come see me again, you've got to come to France, because I ain't coming back.\\" Simone published her autobiography, I Put a Spell on You, in 1992. She recorded her last album, A Single Woman, in 1993, where she depicted herself as the \\"single woman\\". She continued to tour through the 1990s but rarely traveled without an entourage. During the last decade of her life, Simone had sold more than one million records, making her a global catalog best-seller.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What happened later in 1993?","completion":"Later in 1993, Nina Simone settled in France after having lived in Switzerland and the Netherlands.

Write an article with the title: \\"Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama both wrong\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama both wrong Introduction: In the world of politics, disagreements and differing opinions are inevitable. Even within a political party, members may not always see eye-to-eye on every issue. This statement holds true for prominent Democratic figures Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State, and Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States. In this article, we will explore instances where both Clinton and Obama have been wrong in their views or decisions, and evaluate the impact of their missteps. 1. Healthcare Reform In 2008, during the Democratic primaries, Clinton and Obama debated on healthcare reform. Clinton championed an individual mandate requiring every citizen to have health insurance, while Obama wanted to focus on reducing costs to make insurance more affordable. As President, Obama adopted the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of which Clinton once argued. However, he failed to address the increasing premiums and high deductibles that emerged from the legislation, leaving many Americans still struggling to afford coverage. Both Clinton's and Obama's approaches to healthcare fell short of adequately addressing the issue, demonstrating that even well-intentioned policies can possess critical flaws. 2. Military Interventions While serving as Secretary of State during Obama's presidency, Clinton advocated for military interventions in Libya, leading to the overthrow of dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The intervention and the subsequent vacuum of power led to instability and havoc in the region, contributing to the rise of extremist groups such as ISIS. Similarly, Obama's decision to withdraw troops from Iraq between 2010 and 2011 led to the resurgence of violence and further empowered extremist groups. Both Clinton and Obama misjudged the consequences of their respective decisions, showing that even experienced politicians may not always choose the best course of action. 3. Financial Crisis of 2008 In response to the 2008 financial crisis, Obama implemented the controversial Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and Clinton voiced her support for it. The program ultimately bailed out large financial institutions with taxpayer money, igniting significant criticism as it was perceived by many to prioritize corporate interests over citizens in need. While the initial intent may have been to stabilize the economy, TARP left a residue of distrust between the public and the government. Consequently, Obama and Clinton's support for the program can be seen as a misstep in adequately addressing the financial crisis. Conclusion: Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, despite being key figures in the Democratic Party, have not always made the right decisions. In areas such as healthcare, military interventions, and financial management, both politicians have demonstrated shortcomings. It is important to remember that no political figure is infallible and that constructive criticism is vital in a democratic society. By recognizing and examining past mistakes, we can move forward with a more informed perspective and make better decisions for the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With a slender waist and curves in all the right places, Marilyn Monroe’s physique has long been coveted by women – and admired by men. But it seems the classic hourglass figure that the star epitomised could be on borrowed time. The waist size of the average British woman has increased by more than seven inches since the 1950s, research has found, giving her more in common with a rectangle than an hourglass. Marilyn Monroe's physique has long been coveted by women - and admired by men. But it seems the classic hourglass figure that the star epitomised could be on borrowed time. Christina Hendricks is famed for her curvy hourglass physique, but British women are getting further and further away from this ideal, with waist sizes increasing by 7in since the 1950s. The hourglass figures of Man Men characters January Jones, left, Elisabeth Moss, centre, and Christina Hendricks, right, are now largely a thing of the past in the UK, with waist sizes ever increasing. For a perfect hourglass figure, a. woman’s hip and bust must be of equal size, with a narrow tapered waist. But a study has found that this shape is becoming increasingly rare. In 1951, the average woman’s waist was 27 inches, with her bust and hips around ten inches larger. But researchers who surveyed 5,500. women found the average waist now measures 34 inches. Hip and bust. dimensions, meanwhile, have grown by only an inch, leaving them just. four inches larger than the waist. As a result, almost half of British. women are now classed as a ‘rectangle’ – with little difference between. bust, waist and hip measurements. The data compiled for women's sizes. showed that while the average waist size has increased by more than 25. percent, women's hips and busts haven't seen increases on the same scale. This. has led to a change in women's figures from svelte hourglass to a. more rotund, stout shape. - and 38 per cent of women in Britain being classed as overweight. Women. in the UK now weigh 7.5 lbs more than they did in 1951 - and even though. they are 1.5in taller this still shows a general trend to higher. BMI and greater levels of obesity nowadays. Audrey Hepburn had a figure typical of the 1950s, while Kelly Brook has a body typical of 2013. The changing shape of British women: As well as larger wasitlines they have grown by 1.5in and are an average of 7.5lb heavier than women in 1951. Since Mad Men season six - a series. based on the 1960s world of advertising - premiered on 7 April, one. Harley Street clinic has reported a 40 per cent increased interest in. body-sculpting waistline-reduction treatments from women wishing to. emulate Hendricks' shape. Donnamarie McBride, beauty director at LoveLite, said:. 'Our most popular treatment with our Lipoglaze system is the \\"Mad Men. waistline\\" and since the show came back on to TV we've been inundated. with bookings. 'The reason why it's in such demand is because the waistline is one of the hardest areas to shift weight. 'Even with regular work-outs and a good diet this is often the last area that a women will lose fatty tissue.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The article discusses the changing body shapes of British women since the 1950s, highlighting the increase in waist sizes and the move away from the classic hourglass figure exemplified by Marilyn Monroe. Researchers found that the waist size of the average British woman has increased by more than seven inches since the 1950s, while hip and bust dimensions have only grown by an inch. Consequently, the hourglass figure has become less prevalent in British women, with 50% now classified as having a \\"rectangle\\" shape, where there is little difference between bust, waist, and hip measurements. The increase in waist size has also contributed to a rise in women being classified as overweight in the UK, with women in the country now weighing 7.5 lbs more than they did in 1951. This general trend towards higher BMI and higher levels of obesity is viewed with concern. The return of the popular TV show Mad Men, set in the 1960s, has sparked renewed interest in the hourglass figure, with a Harley Street clinic reporting a 40% increase in interest for body-sculpting waistline reduction treatments. This suggests that despite the apparent trend away from the hourglass shape, many women are still seeking to achieve the classic figure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(B) Nick gave up because he didn't care if his girlfriend won.","completion":"Task: Choose an end sentence (A or B) that makes the story incomplete and incoherent. Sentences: 1. Nick was challenged to a volleyball match. 2. His girlfriend bet him five dollars she could beat him. 3. Nick did not intend to let her win! 4. He played hard and mercilessly. End sentence choices: A) Nick beat his girlfriend and she gave him the five dollars. B) Nick gave up because he didn't care if his girlfriend won. Solution: To make the story incomplete and incoherent, we need to choose the end sentence that does not connect well with the rest of the story. In sentences 1-4, the story is about Nick's determination in a volleyball match against his girlfriend, who has bet him five dollars. He has a strong will to win and plays hard. End sentence A connects well with the story and provides a coherent ending, as Nick's determination pays off, and he wins the bet. End sentence B, however, contradicts Nick's determination shown in sentences 3 and 4, making the story incomplete and incoherent. Therefore, the solution is end sentence B: Nick gave up because he didn't care if his girlfriend won."},{"prompt":"The answer to the question: What is the full name of the character whose wife separates from him after learning of his infidelity? is inside the article: Lady Patricia, a London socialite engaged to another aristocrat, shocks her father and social class by marrying the poor Italian violinist Paul Gherardi.

SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

At that time, a Parisian ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a \\"Bohemian\\" group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would \\"acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes\\". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure\\". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: \\"Couldn't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ...

Information: - Charles Thomas Kowal (November 8, 1940 November 28, 2011) was an American astronomer known for his observations and discoveries in the Solar System. As a staff astronomer at Caltech's Mount Wilson and Palomar Mountain observatories between 1961 and 1984, he found the first of a new class of Solar System objects, the centaurs, discovered two moons of the planet Jupiter, and discovered or co-discovered a number of asteroids, comets and supernovae. He was awarded the James Craig Watson Medal for his contributions to astronomy in 1979. - Asteroids are minor planets, especially those of the inner Solar System. The larger ones have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet. As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered and found to have volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets, they were often distinguished from asteroids of the asteroid belt. In this article, the term \\"asteroid\\" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System including those co-orbital with Jupiter. - The Apollo asteroids are a group of near-Earth asteroids named after 1862 Apollo, discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth in the 1930s. They are Earth crossing asteroids that have an orbital semi-major axis greater than that of the Earth (> 1 AU) but perihelion distances less than the Earth's aphelion distance (q < 1.017 AU). - 2063 Bacchus ( / bæks / BAK - s ) is an Apollo asteroid and Venus - and Mars - crosser asteroid . It was discovered on April 24 , 1977 , by Charles T. Kowal at the Palomar Observatory . In March 1996 radar observations were conducted at the Goldstone Observatory under the direction of JPL scientists Steven Ostro and Lance Benner , allowing the construction of a model of the object . Optical observations were conducted by Petr Pravec , Marek Wolf , and Lenka Šarounová during March and April 1996 . Bacchus is about 2.6 × 1.1 × 1.1 km in size and has a bilobate shape . Its spectral type is Sq. Its name derives from the Roman god Bacchus . On 31 March 1996 , Bacchus passed 0.0677525 AU ( 10,135,630 km ; 6,297,990 mi ) from Earth .

Choose the suitable option: In this case, we have two options - (1) Use some sandpaper over the painted wood to induce a scuffed up and rustic look, and (2) Use some sandpaper before painting the wood to induce a scuffed up and rustic look. Option (1) is the better choice, as sanding the painted wood will create a more authentic rustic appearance by exposing some of the wood grain and allowing the paint to wear in a natural-looking way. 2. Gather materials: To get started, gather the necessary materials including sandpaper (medium and fine grit), paint, paintbrush, and a soft cloth. 3. Prep the wooden furniture: Ensure the furniture is clean and free of dirt or dust. If it is painted, make sure the paint is dry before beginning. 4. Apply option (1) - Sand the painted wood: Using medium-grit sandpaper, gently scuff up the surface of the painted wood in a random pattern, focusing on areas that would naturally show wear and tear over time such as corners, edges, and raised details. The goal is to create an uneven and distressed look, allowing the wood to show through in some areas. 5. Smooth the surface: After distressing the painted wood with medium-grit sandpaper, use fine-grit sandpaper to smooth out any rough patches and blend the distressed areas with the surrounding paint. 6. Clean the surface: Wipe the furniture with a soft cloth to remove any dust and debris from sanding. 7. Apply a topcoat if desired (optional): If you want to protect the distressed finish and add additional depth, consider applying a clear topcoat, such as a wax or polyurethane finish. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and drying time. By following these steps and selecting option (1), you will successfully add a rustic look to your wooden furniture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: A police escort for the following movie plot: Susan Selky is a well-known English professor at Columbia University. She lives in a Brooklyn brownstone with her 10-year-old son Alex (Danny Corkill). One March morning, Susan sees Alex off to school, which is only two blocks away. Alex turns to wave to his mother, then disappears around the corner. Susan returns home after work, and becomes increasingly alarmed when Alex is late. She calls her friend and neighbor Jocelyn Norris, whose daughter is a classmate of Alex's, and learns Alex never went to school. She immediately calls the New York City Police Department, and officers descend on the townhouse, led by Lieutenant Al Menetti. Susan is questioned closely on all aspects of her life and her son's, and initially suspect her estranged husband, Graham, a professor at New York University, but he produces an alibi. Susan's case generates attention from the local media, and citizens help in the search by distributing posters. Susan is initially criticized for allowing her son to walk to school by himself. Susan takes a polygraph test that clears her as a suspect. Numerous leads are checked out, including several reports that Alex may have been seen in the back seat of a blue 1965 Chevy. A psychic is also called in, but each lead fizzles. The investigation drags on, and Graham is at odds with Menetti after budget cuts force Menetti to dismantle the command center in Susan's apartment and run the case from the precinct. Menetti's attention is soon diverted to other cases, but the Selky case is always a priority. At one point, Graham takes matters into his own hands after he receives a ransom call. Given a beating, he requires a hospital stay. A break in the case finally happens on the Fourth of July, when Susan's housecleaner, Philippe, is arrested as a suspect. A pair of Alex's bloody underpants was found in his apartment, where the gay Philippe was picked up with a 14-year-old male prostitute. Susan visits Philippe in jail, and he tells her that the bloody underpants came about when he used them to stop...

Answer the following question: Two scientist, Pete and Gill, studied the Earth's crust and geology. Pete studied earthquakes, while Gill studied mantles and volcanos. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person studied less about volcanoes in an island arc? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Pete is the person who studied less about volcanoes in an island arc. Pete focused his research on earthquakes, while Gill directed her studies towards mantles and volcanoes. Island arc volcanoes are formed due to the subduction of one tectonic plate beneath another, which leads to the formation of a chain of volcanic islands. This geological phenomenon is closely related to the study of the Earth's mantle, as well as the processes that drive volcanic activity. Gill's area of expertise in mantles and volcanoes makes her more knowledgeable about the complexities and mechanisms behind island arc volcanoes. On the other hand, Pete's specialization in earthquakes provides him with a solid understanding of the seismic activity associated with tectonic plate movements and interactions. Earthquakes are indeed a crucial aspect of the Earth's geological processes, and their study may offer valuable insights into the forces that shape our planet. However, it does not specifically focus on the details of volcanic activity, particularly in the context of island arc systems. In conclusion, Pete's research on earthquakes, while essential for understanding broader geological processes, does not delve as deeply into the study of island arc volcanoes as Gill's work on mantles and volcanoes. As a result, Pete is the person who studied less about volcanoes in an island arc compared to Gill."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Domestic violence survivors in Jackson, Vicksburg, Hattiesburg, Oxford and Pascagoula can all get help. Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost. Because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation.\\" Crockett said the program, funded by a 300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department, has no economic restrictions on who can get help. Legal services typically helps the poor. Gladys Bunzy, who said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years, said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent relationships. \\"When I finally made up my mind to leave, I had a restraining order put against him and that was 50 but that was 50 well spent to me,\\" said Bunzy, 40. \\"For people who can't afford it, this will be a godsend ...

To get a protective order you need to be represented by an attorney.\\" Crockett said the pilot program was launched in 1998 at the Haven House Family Shelter Inc., a domestic violence shelter for women and children in Vicksburg.

Context: Hubertus \\"Huib\\" Wilton (12 March 1921 in Rotterdam – 29 October 1959) was a Dutch tennis player. He was on the 1953 Netherlands Davis Cup team which also included among others Hans van Swol (his partner in the men's doubles), Boebi van Meegeren and Ivo Rinkel. In 1950 Wilton reached the second round at Wimbledon, losing to Henry Billington of Great Britain 6–1 7–5 11–9. Hypothesis: Hubertus \\"Huib\\" Wilton is an athlete.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the following hypothesis from the given context: Hypothesis: Hubertus \\"Huib\\" Wilton is an athlete. The detailed explanation behind this hypothesis can be based on the following evidence mentioned in the context: 1. Huib Wilton is a Dutch tennis player: This statement directly indicates that Wilton is, indeed, an athlete, as tennis is a competitive sport that requires physical activity and skill. 2. He was on the 1953 Netherlands Davis Cup team: The Davis Cup is a prestigious international tennis competition, where teams represent their respective countries. Being a part of this team not only further establishes Wilton as an athlete but also suggests that he was a high-performance one, as his talent must have been significant enough to be chosen for the Dutch national team. 3. He had partners in tennis events like Hans van Swol in men's doubles: Participating in a doubles tennis event requires collaboration and coordination with a partner. This adds another dimension to Wilton's athletic abilities, highlighting his teamwork and gelling capabilities within a tennis context. 4. In 1950, Wilton reached the second round at Wimbledon: Wimbledon is one of the four Grand Slam tournaments in tennis, demonstrating once again that Wilton was a competitive and skilled athlete as he managed to compete and progress in such a widely renowned event. 5. Losing to Henry Billington 6–1 7–5 11–9: The mention of Wilton's highly competitive match at Wimbledon, where he battled it out against Billington in multiple sets, gives us an insight into the athlete's endurance and their ability to strategize in this physically demanding sport.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You can't go into a presentation sweating bullets or stuttering because you're so nervous that you can barely see straight. Instead, take a breather at least a few hours before a presentation, whether it means drinking a cup of camomile tea, meditating, or going for a walk. If you want to relax, then you have to prepare well in advance -- you won't be able to relax if you're perfecting and practicing your speech minutes before you have to present. Remember that the more relaxed you are, the easier it will be for your audience to connect to you, and the more fun you'll have. Drink a tall glass of water to lubricate your vocal chords before you go on stage. Keep a glass or bottle of water with you on stage if it helps you relax and to pause occasionally. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f2/681016-07b01.jpg/v4-460px-681016-07b01.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/f/f2/681016-07b01.jpg/aid681016-v4-728px-681016-07b01.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Arrive early to feel comfortable in the space where you'll be presenting. If you're presenting in an auditorium or another large building, then walk around the place or even sit in the audience to get a feel for it. If you want to help yourself relax, then remember that your aim is connection, not perfection. You want to connect with your audience instead of giving a bullet-proof presentation, and it's much easier to connect if you feel like you're being yourself. Kill 'em with confidence before you even say your first word. If you look like you're confident about who you are and believe in what you're saying, then the audience will be much more likely to have faith in you. So, look sharp, have a big smile on your face, and make eye contact with your audience to show them that you're unafraid and know your stuff. Even if you're not feeling very confident, giving off confident vibes will help you feel at ease, and will make people more likely to believe in you. Don't slouch. Keep your head high and your spine straight. Don't fidget or play with your hands. You can use your hands occasionally to gesture for emphasis, but don't do it too much or you'll look even more nervous. Be able to laugh at yourself. If you've made a little mistake, laugh it off and the crowd will laugh along with you instead of feeling awkward. Use forceful words and speak as if everything you say is a fact. Don't say, \\"I think that San Francisco may be a better city than LA\\" if the goal of your presentation is to prove that San Francisco is vastly superior to its southern cousin city; say, \\"San Francisco is a better city than LA, hands down,\\" and your audience will be more likely to agree with you. You have to wow your audience from the get-go. If you have them hooked from the first word, then they'll be more likely to follow along the rest of the way. Start with a shocking or relevant fact, a funny and engaging anecdote, or with an inspiring quote. Whatever you start with, make sure that it's conducive to your presentation and isn't just there for the entertainment value. Whatever you do, do not apologize for having to give the presentation, even if it's a required presentation for work or school. Nothing will make your audience zone out faster than if you say, \\"Sorry to bore you guys with all this technical mumbo-jumbo, but I've gotta do it…\\" Being articulate is the key to improving your presentation skills. You can plan the most fascinating presentation of all time but your audience won't get a thing out of it if you're speaking too quietly or too fast or are rambling on so much that they don't get your main point. Focus on speaking clearly and slowly, and loudly enough for everyone to hear you. Let your expression match your words and people will be more likely to understand your words and to connect with you. Pause between sentences for emphasis, and work on eliminating as many \\"ums\\" and \\"uhs\\" as possible without freaking out if you use a few of them -- after all, even President Obama has been known to use a healthy dose of \\"ums\\" when getting his point across. Keep it concise. Work on trimming down any extra words and focus on what's important. You don't need a million adjectives to get your point across -- just one perfectly-chosen adjective will do. Read as much as you can to improve your knowledge base and vocabulary. This, in turn, will make you sound more intelligent and articulate. If you want to fully articulate your points, then you'll need to use stories, anecdotes, statistics, and facts to support your ideas. If you tell your audience that a healthy diet is the key to a happy life but have no evidence to back it up, why should they believe you? Even if you're charming and funny, if there's no substance to your speech, your audience will be able to tell. Stories are a great way to create a human connection and to illustrate a point effectively without slowing down your momentum. You don't need a million facts and statistics, either; one or two carefully-chosen facts or statistics can really blow your audience away. A story or a statistic can be an effective, engaging way to open a presentation. You can also return to it at the end to wrap things up. \\" Though you should avoid the second person when you're writing a formal essay, the word you is crucial to connecting to your audience during a presentation. You want to make each and every person feel that you're talking to them so that the person feels that your presentation can actually benefit them. You should say, \\"You can learn to manage conflict effectively in under an hour with five simple points,\\" instead of \\"Any person can learn to manage conflict…\\" Though you're essentially saying the same thing, using you whenever it's appropriate will get your audience more involved in your presentation. Connect through your emotion. Nobody likes a boring speaker so infuse some energy into your gestures, inflect your voice as you would when talking to someone one-on-one, attempt self-deprecating humor and don't be afraid to show your failures as an example to learn from. Though every word in your presentation should count, undoubtedly there will be at least two or three points that you want your audience to walk away with. It's okay to remind your audience of these points by repeating them for emphasis; you can even do so without getting boring or repetitive. If you use a story or anecdote to illustrate a point, remind your audience of what the point is, and return to it later in your presentation, if not at the end. Let your audience see that some of the points you've made are more important than others. Another way to emphasize your important points is to slow down when you want your audience to really home in on your words. Use your hands to gesture for emphasis if it's necessary. Having a question and answer period can help your audience really understand your material, connect with you and your presentation, and feel like they have gotten the full story on the subject you presented about. If you feel that your presentation calls for a question and answer period and that you can effectively make time for one without derailing your presentation, then you should plan for having a question and answer period after you've given the body of your presentation -- but before the closing. You should give a time limit for questions, say, 5-10 minutes. Tell your audience that you're going to make this much time for questions so that you don't get off track by answering so many questions that your audience has forgotten the gist or your presentation. Make sure you have a conclusion after the question period. You don't want to give a stellar presentation and then have it peter off into a series of irrelevant questions. End your presentation on a solid note. Don't let your presentation taper off or wrap things up when you or the audience looks bored. Give a firm conclusion that continues to engage your audience while reminding them about the most important points of the presentation. It's okay to \\"tell 'em what you told them,\\" as a reminder about the central message of the presentation. Stay confident up until the very end, keep your head high, and even thank your audience for their participation if it's necessary. Avoid looking bored with your own presentation or eager to get off stage. Don't say something like, \\"Well, that about covers it,\\" or \\"That's all I've got\\" -- be confident that you've given a great presentation and be excited about wrapping it up with a nice little bow.","completion":"To give a good presentation, relax, be confident, speak clearly, use stories and facts, and engage with your audience by using \\"you\\" and answering their questions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Trailing varieties of Lantana are pretty robust and will tolerate drought but do need plenty of light. They will tolerate a small amount of shade for some of the day but you’ll see them grow leggy (with long stems rather than compact bushy growth) and produce fewer blooms if they aren’t getting enough sun and water. You can encourage bushy growth to make good ground cover by pinching the plant back. To do this, remove the stem tips just above where each stem branches into two stems. This will encourage more side branches to form. Although Trailing Lantana tolerates drought, it will bloom better if it doesn’t get too dry. Water once or twice a week during dry periods. Removing spent flowers will encourage new ones to form so don’t be shy about trimming the bush during the growing season. You should try to trim just above a leaf set.

Consider including a pocket calendar if you want to track your period.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Essentials for a Healthy and Prepared Menstruation Care Kit\\" Introduction Dealing with menstruation can be a challenge for many women worldwide, as it comes with a variety of physical and emotional stages, ranging from abdominal pain and bloating to mood swings and anxiety. While the experience of menstruation varies for each individual, one factor that can make managing these monthly occurrences easier is having a thoughtfully created menstruation care kit. A well-prepared kit helps deal with irregularity, discomfort, and promotes a healthier outlook throughout the menstrual period. In this article, we will discuss some essentials to include in your menstruation care kit, aiming to alleviate discomfort, keep you hygienic, and help track your periods more efficiently. 1. Dark Chocolate Including a piece of dark chocolate in your care kit can be a delicious and satisfying way to combat period cravings while providing health benefits. Dark chocolate with a high cocoa content (above 70%) is rich in magnesium, which can help alleviate muscle cramps and reduce mood swings associated with the menstrual cycle. It also contains flavonoids that are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which can help improve mood and overall well-being. 2. Over-the-counter (OTC) Pain Relievers Aside from satisfying a sweet craving, it's also essential to address physical discomfort during menstruation. A small package of ibuprofen or naproxen can be a helpful addition to your care kit, as these over-the-counter medications can relieve cramps and reduce inflammation. However, consult with a healthcare professional before adding such medication to your care kit if you have existing health conditions or are taking prescription drugs, as some may interfere with other medications or cause complications. 3. Hand Sanitizer Maintaining proper hygiene is crucial during menstruation, as it can help prevent infections and discomfort. Including a travel-sized container of hand sanitizer in your care kit ensures that you will always have a means of cleaning your hands on the go, especially when you need to change sanitary products and don't have immediate access to soap and water. Opt for hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol, as they effectively kill harmful bacteria and viruses on your hands. 4. Pocket Calendar Keeping track of your menstruation helps monitor any irregularities and predict when your upcoming period may arrive. This information is beneficial to both personal and medical reasons: understanding personal patterns can help you prepare better or identify whether any triggering factors contribute to irregularities. A pocket calendar is a convenient way to track your periods, as it provides both visual and tactile input. By marking the days you are menstruating and consistently maintaining a record, you can better understand your body and identify any potential irregularities. Conclusion Creating a customized menstruation care kit not only helps maintain daily activities and routines during menstruation but also promotes a sense of self-awareness and understanding of one's body. By including a piece of dark chocolate, a small package of ibuprofen or naproxen, hand sanitizer, and a pocket calendar, we can address the cravings, pain, and cleanliness associated with periods. Through this proactive preparation, we can feel empowered and gain essential tools for managing menstruation and promoting overall wellness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Archie wins a race with a bullying farmhand, Les McCann (Harold Hopkins), Archie running bare-foot and Les riding his horse bareback. Frank Dunne (Mel Gibson) is an unemployed ex-railway labourer who has run out of money. He's an accomplished sprinter and hopes to win the prize money at the athletics carnival, he also bets a lot of money on himself winning. Archie and Uncle Jack journey to the athletics carnival. Frank is surprised when Archie defeats him and is bitter at first and he feels robbed of his bet. Eventually Frank approaches Archie in a cafe after getting over his loss and they both decide to travel to Perth to enlist. Before leaving, Archie gives all the prize money he won at the race to Jack and tells him that he will not be coming home for he had decided to enlist. As Archie and Frank are penniless, they secretly hop on a freight train, then walk across the desert and stop for the night at a cattle station. Upon arriving in Perth, they arrange to stay with Frank's father, an Irish immigrant. Due to Frank's Irish heritage and general cynicism, he has little desire to fight for the British Empire. However, Archie persuades him to try to enlist in the Light Horse. Failing to ride a horse, Frank enlists in the infantry with three co-workers from the railway: Bill (Robert Grubb), Barney (Tim McKenzie), and Snowy (David Argue). Many of the motivations for enlistment are revealed: wartime ultra-nationalism, anti-German propaganda, a sense of adventure and the attraction of the uniform. All soldiers embark on a transport ship bound for Cairo. Frank and Archie are separated and embark on different troopships. Some months later, Frank and his fellow soldiers train near the Pyramids and spend their free time in Cairo, drinking and visiting...

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person studied less about the biosphere? Hint: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.

Which sister had the same disease as the royal families of Europe did? Two twin sisters were taken to the doctor's office by their parents. It turned out that Mary had hemophilia while Ann didn't have any blood disease. Hint: Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: how do you get rid of chicken pox? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? Pick from: - scratch them off until they're all gone.. - don't scratch them until they heal on their own..","completion":"The goal of getting rid of chickenpox can be achieved through several methods focused on alleviating the symptoms, as there is no cure for the viral infection itself. Among the two choices provided, the option that makes much more sense to accomplish this goal is \\"don't scratch them until they heal on their own.\\" Scratching chickenpox blisters can lead to scarring, bacterial infection, and may prolong the healing process. Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, and while not everyone's experience with the virus is the same, generally, symptoms like fever, headache, and an itchy rash are shared by most sufferers. The rash often develops into fluid-filled blisters that can become very itchy. However, scratching them is not recommended and should be avoided for the reasons mentioned above. Instead, multiple approaches should be taken to ensure safe and effective recovery from chickenpox: 1. Rest and hydration: Getting enough rest and staying hydrated is crucial in the recovery process, as it allows the body to focus on fighting off the virus. 2. Antiviral medication: In some cases, your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications, such as acyclovir, within the first 24 hours of developing symptoms. This can help to reduce the severity and duration of the illness, especially in high-risk patients. 3. Anti-itch remedies: To reduce the urge to scratch, apply calamine lotion, which can help soothe the itchiness. Taking cool baths with colloidal oatmeal or baking soda may also help relieve itchiness. Over-the-counter antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, can help relieve itching as well. 4. Fever and pain management: Paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen may be used to reduce fever, headaches, or body aches. However, avoid using aspirin in children due to the risk of Reye's syndrome. 5. Nail care: Keep nails short and clean to minimize the risk of skin infections if scratching inadvertently occurs. 6. Dress comfortably: Wear lightweight, loose-fitting, and breathable clothes to avoid further irritation of the skin. 7. Bacterial infection prevention: If any of the blisters become infected, you may need antibiotic ointments or oral antibiotics to treat the infection. Consult your doctor if you notice any signs of bacterial infection, such as increased redness or pus. Keep in mind that while you're contagious, it's important to stay away from people who may be more vulnerable to the virus, such as newborns, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems. Ultimately, allowing the chickenpox to heal on its own, in combination with the methods listed above, will provide the safest and most effective route to recovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Select from: (I) negative; (II) positive; TEXT:When I began watching The Muppets Take Manhattan, the choppy presentation and dialogue had me convinced I was watching something recent, so you can imagine my surprise when I came to the IMDb and read that it was made in 1984. Jim Henson may have ended The Muppet Show when it was at its peak, but spin offs like this and Muppet Babies (which apparently is based upon a very terrible sequence in this film) are the absolute nadir of all things Muppet. I used to wonder why Muppets attracted such derision from such film reviewers as Mr. Cranky, so I am glad that The Muppets Take Manhattan (henceforth: TMTM) set me straight on that one. Of course, many series have had a massive drop off in quality when the third episode came around: Aliens, RoboCop, The Evil Dead, even Night Of The Living Dead. So while it is no surprise that TMTM is less than The Muppet Movie or The Great Muppet Caper, the surprise lies entirely in how much less than the awesome debut or its slightly lesser follow-up TMTM is. Not only is the music far less satisfying, the scenes that link it all together are utterly terrible. There are, of course, some redeeming and genuinely funny moments, but they are few and far between. The Swedish Chef is great in any scene he inhabits, so thank the spirit of small mercies that he appears in one sequence where his eccentricity is exploited to the fullest. The problem is that there are just no scenes that work. The story, such as it is, revolves around a Broadway musical Kermit is attempting to get produced. He goes through many trials and tribulations along the way, including the sneaking suspicion the viewer has that we have seen this all before. The biggest problem is that Kermit does not have a decent antagonist to work off this time. Charles Durning was cinematic gold as Doc Hopper, the proprietor of a fast food chain who wants to exploit Kermit for his business. Charles Grodin was dynamite as Nicky Holiday, a jewel thief the Muppets must fight in order to save Miss Piggy from a lifetime in prison. The saying is that a hero is only as good as his antagonist, and these two are at least half responsible for the greatness of the previous two films. Charles Grodin also highlights what is wrong with TMTM. Namely, the music sucks. The opening number of the Manhattan Melodies show that is at the centre of TMTM, to put it nicely, makes the drivel that now dominates the airwaves seem coordinated. I might just be letting my peculiar sensitivity to the sounds of words and phrases getting to me, but songs like The Rainbow Connection inspired tears of joy, not irritation. Grodin's big solo during The Great Muppet Caper, while not having the same resonation, he lifts the tone of the film eight steps on his own. He is all class. And if there is one thing TMTM could use, it is rising eight steps in addition to attaining a semblance of class. TMTM also feels severely time-compressed, with the story leaping from scene to scene without any consideration for making sense or giving the story cohesion. Maddox himself pointed out that transition and cohesion make a film feel like a coherent whole rather than a mess of thrown-together pieces. See if you can find them in TMTM. While TMTM does have its guest stars, they are either poorly utilised (Brooke Shields and John Landis), or totally out of their element (Liza Minelli, Dabney Coleman). To call this a waste of time for puppeteer and actor alike is flattery. The absence of an end credits routine is especially sore here, after Animal's \\"go home\\" postscript for The Muppet Movie in particular. Which highlights another problem. The characters are poorly written at best, with none of their individual quirks to be seen or heard. Animal shouts singular words at times, but they have nothing to do with the plot, or the conversation going on around him. Say what you will about set pieces designed to show off characters, but think of Animal's moment after eating the instant growth pills, or his \\"sowwy\\" after the incident when he pulled the window down on top of his fellow Muppets. Now see if you can remember a single memorable moment with an individual Muppet other than Swedish Chef's hilarious misunderstanding of three-dimensional film involving popcorn. Give up? Then you have proved my point. Given that Labyrinth, one of the Henson company's best and most timeless products outside of the Muppets, arrived some two years later, it makes TMTM all the more puzzling. Perhaps this misfire convinced Jim Henson to rethink his strategy regarding character development and usage. Or perhaps the misfire can be attributed to Frank Oz, who at the time had just finished working with George Lucas on what many would agree is the most childish episode in the original Star Wars saga. The writers were also involved with The Great Muppet Caper, so I will let them off the hook for this in spite of the fact that a script is one of the most essential pieces of a film. The production is also substantially improved here, with Muppets appearing capable of moving in ways that were previously beyond them. Had the story and script been better thought-out, TMTM might have been at least comparable to The Great Muppet Caper. As it stands now, it is a great answer to the question of whether Muppets write under the influence, or excrete. For that reason, I gave The Muppets Take Manhattan a three out of ten. Two to denote its actual quality, and a bonus for the Swedish Chef's moments. Without him, this film would be unwatchable.","completion":"The correct sentiment for this text is: (I) negative.

This is a great concern to you, but it has nothing to do with me; I cannot be bothered by it.\\" The mouse turned to the pig and told him, \\"There is a mouse trap in the house.\\" \\"I am so very sorry, Mr. Mouse,\\" said the pig, \\"but there is nothing I can do about it but pray; you are always in my prayers.\\" The mouse turned to the cow, who said, \\"A mouse trap; am I in great danger, huh?\\" So the mouse had to face the farmer's mouse trap alone. That very night a sound was heard through the house, like the sound of a mouse trap catching its prey. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see that it was a poisonous snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital. She returned home with a fever. It is said that drinking fresh chicken soup will help treat fever, so the farmer took his sharp knife to the farmyard for the soup's main ingredient. His wife's sickness continued so that friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them, the farmer killed the pig.

If we do that, the -12 and +12 on one side will cancel out, so we won't see it anymore. On the other side, 6 plus 12 equals 18. Our new, simpler equation will be: 18 = -6 * u. Next step: we'll get rid of that '-6' multiplying 'u'. It might be a negative number, and that can be a tricky concept. Remember when you share 18 toys among 6 friends, each friend gets 3 toys. This time it is -6 friends, but let's just forget about the negative for a moment. Pretend we have 18 stickers and we share them among 6 friends, each friend would get 3 stickers, right? So we could say u is 3. But wait, we forgot about that negative concept! In this case, it's like saying you owe 3 stickers to each friend instead of giving to them.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: When will fresh skin cells ready for treatment occur when cleansing skin?

I'm not a Gackt fan by any means, though he is talented, despite the weird pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball. I always thought Hyde was talented though, Faith is an interesting album. But on topic here folks. This movie is ridiculous. It's so over the top and nonsensical it's almost like a parody of supernatural action films. The movie has almost no plot here, except it's just about vampires with gangster friends. In a way, this film almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, with how there were too many ideas, which resulted in not enough time to pay attention on one of them. The action scenes were laughable. Quickly edited, almost hard to understand, with choreography that's so laughably bad. Though Hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes, but that's this film's only such redemption. I'm a sucker for good action movies, but the action was horribly done. Though the final shootout was OK and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie. It keeps jumping between genres, not a good thing. It wants to be a drama, or an action flick, or a horror, or a romance... what the hell. If this review is making you mad, why?

In this snippet, there are two characters: Ridmark and Joram. They seem to be old friends with a history together. Joram is described as a solid knight but not someone to take the lead in a crisis. The conversation indicates that Ridmark is asking Joram about his current position, and Joram responds that he's just a caretaker of Dun Licinia instead of the Comes (a title of nobility). Step 2: Maintain the tone and style of the original text. The text has a casual, conversational tone between the two friends. The writing style is fairly simple, and I'll ensure the continuation is consistent with that. Step 3: Develop the conversation between the characters while adding relevant details. The next part of the conversation should focus on Joram's role as a caretaker, elaborate on how he feels about it, and establish what led him to become one. This would allow the reader to learn more about Joram's life experiences and emotions. Step 4: Write the continuation of the text. Ridmark raised an eyebrow. \\"A caretaker? How did that come to pass?\\" Joram sighed, a hint of melancholy in his voice. \\"After the last battle, I sustained a wound that never quite healed properly. My days as a frontline knight were over.

Information: - The is an 8-bit handheld video game device with interchangeable cartridges developed and manufactured by Nintendo, which was first released in Japan on , in North America on and in Europe on . It is the first handheld console in the Game Boy line and was created by Satoru Okada and Nintendo Research & Development 1. This same team, led by Gunpei Yokoi at the time, is credited with designing the Game & Watch series as well as several popular games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Redesigned versions were released in 1996 and 1998 in the form of Game Boy Pocket and Game Boy Light (Japan only), respectively. - A board game is a tabletop game that involves counters or moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or \\"board\\", according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill. - The action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges, including handeye coordination and reaction-time. The genre includes diverse subgenres such as fighting games, shooter games and platform games which are widely considered the most important action games, though some real-time strategy games are also considered to be action games. - Shooter games are a subgenre of action game, which often test the player's speed and reaction time. It includes many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar using some sort of weapon. Usually this weapon is a gun, or some other long-range weapon. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition. Most commonly, the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying. A shooting game is a genre of video game where the player has limited spatial control of his or her character, and the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character's enemies using long-range weaponry. - The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari, Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All of the machines in the family are technically similar, and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw. \\"Star Raiders\\" is widely considered the platform's killer app. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development the process and related disciplines of creating video games. A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc. Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support. Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games. - , sometimes transliterated Gumpei Yokoi, was a Japanese video game designer. He was a long-time Nintendo employee, best known as creator of the Game & Watch handheld system, inventor of the Control Pad (whose plus-shaped design nearly all video game controllers attempt to mimic today), the original designer of the Game Boy, and producer of a few long-running and critically acclaimed video game franchises, such as \\"Metroid\\" and \\"Kid Icarus\\". - Atari Corporation was an American manufacturer of computers and video game consoles from 1984 to 1996. Atari Corp. was founded in July 1984 when Warner Communications sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari, Inc. to Jack Tramiel. Its chief products were the Atari ST, , Atari 7800, Atari Lynx, and Atari Jaguar. The company reverse merged with JTS Inc. in 1996, becoming a small division, which itself closed when JTS liquidated the IP to Hasbro Interactive in 1998. - The Nintendo Entertainment System (commonly abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Cross-promotion is a form of marketing promotion where customers of one product or service are targeted with promotion of a related product. A typical example is cross-media marketing of a brand, for example Oprah Winfrey's promotion on her television show of her books, magazines and website. Cross-promotion may involve two or more companies working together in promoting a service or product, in a way that benefits both. For example, a mobile phone network may work together with a popular music artist and package some of their songs as exclusive ringtones; promoting these ringtones can benefit both the network and the artist. Some major corporations, for example Burger King, have a long history of cross-promotion with a range of partners (see Burger King advertising). The Disney Channel has also made extensive use of cross-promotion. Movie tie-ins are good examples of cross-promotion. On occasion, badly planned cross-promotions can backfire spectacularly such as 1992 Hoover free flights promotion fiasco. - A tie-in work is a work of fiction or other product based on a media property such as a film, video game, television series, board game, web site, role-playing game or literary property. Tie-ins are authorized by the owners of the original property, and are a form of cross-promotion used primarily to generate additional income from that property and to promote its visibility. - The megabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. Its recommended unit symbol is MB, but sometimes \\"MByte\\" is used. The unit prefix \\"mega\\" is a multiplier of (10) in the International System of Units (SI).

This definition has been incorporated into the International System of Quantities. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games where the game does not progress incrementally in turns. - Dundee, officially the City of Dundee, is Scotland's fourth-largest city and the 51st-most-populous built-up area in the United Kingdom. The mid-year population estimate for 2015 was 148,210 which gave Dundee a population density of 2,477/km or 6,420/sq mi, the second-highest in Scotland. It lies within the eastern central Lowlands on the north bank of the Firth of Tay, which feeds into the North Sea. Under the name of \\"Dundee City\\", it forms one of the 32 council areas used for local government in Scotland. - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use. - The Game Boy line is a line of handheld game consoles developed, manufactured, and marketed by Nintendo. The product line has sold 200 million units worldwide. - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over 85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners. - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory. - Ocean Software Ltd (also known in the United States as Ocean of America, Inc.), commonly referred to as Ocean, was a British software development company, that became one of the biggest European video game developers/publishers of the 1980s and 1990s. It was acquired by a French holding company, Infogrames in 1996 and renamed to \\"Infogrames UK\\" in 1998, and again in 2004 to Atari UK, and once again in 2009 now known as Atari, Inc. - A fighting game is a video game genre in which the player controls an on-screen character and engages in close combat with an opponent, which can be either an AI or controlled by another player. The fight matches typically consist of several rounds and take place in an arena, while each character has widely differing abilities but each is relatively viable to choose. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into \\"combos\\". Since the early 1990s, most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player. - The Addams Family is the title of a video game released for the original Game Boy , as well as differing versions for the Amiga , Amstrad CPC , Atari ST , Commodore 64 , Game Gear , Genesis , NES , SNES , and the ZX Spectrum . The games are a tie - in with the 1991 movie , The Addams Family . It was published and developed in 1992 by Ocean Software . It is a platform side - scrolling action game . - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64. - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre. - The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The initial ST model, the 520ST, saw limited release in the spring of 1985 and was widely available in July. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US1. - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor. - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Doctor Seuss was born in 1904. By the middle 1950s, he had become one of the best-loved and most successful children's book writers in the world. His books are very popular with young readers. They enjoy the invented words and the pictures of unusual funny animals and plants. In 1954, life magazine published a report about school children who could not read. The report said many children's books were not interesting. Doctor Seuss strongly hoped to help children and decided to write books that were interesting and easy to read. He used words with the same ending sound, like fish and wish. He did not receive training in art. Yet, he drew the pictures for most of his books. In 1957, Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat. He used less than 230 words to write the book and even a six-year-old should be able to read it. It was a fun story and easy to read. Children loved it. Their parents loved it, too. Today it is still one of the stories they like best. The success of The Cat in the Hat made him want to write more books for children. In 1960, he wrote a book using less than fifty words. The book is called Green Eggs and Ham. In 1984, Doctor Seuss won a Pulitzer Prize . He was honored for the education and enjoyment his books provided American children and their parents. He died at the age of 87, but his influence remains. Millions of his books have been sold worldwide. People say his books helped change the way American children learned to read. Yet, his books are loved by people of all ages. Doctor Seuss once said, \\"I do not write for children. I write for people.\\" Question: People like his books because the books _ .

Add spaces: Settinguptwo-factorauthenticationonOffice365","completion":"Setting up two-factor authentication on Office 365 Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a vital security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your Office 365 account. By requiring two different types of identification before granting access, 2FA makes it more difficult for hackers to compromise your account even if they have your password. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up 2FA for your Office 365 account step by step. 1. Sign in to your Office 365 account: First, go to the Office 365 website (https://www.office.com/) and sign in with your account credentials (email address and password). 2. Access the Security and Privacy settings: Once logged in, click on your profile picture or initials in the top right corner of the screen. From the dropdown menu, select \\"My Account.\\" In the My Account page, navigate to the \\"Security and Privacy\\" tab. 3. Enable two-factor authentication: Under the \\"Security and Privacy\\" tab, select \\"Additional security verification.\\" Then click on \\"Set up two-factor authentication\\" or \\"Update your settings.\\" This will take you to the 2FA setup page. 4. Choose your preferred verification method: Office 365 offers several verification methods for 2FA, including phone calls, text messages, and authenticator apps. Select the method you prefer, and follow the on-screen instructions to set it up. For example, if you choose to use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, you'll need to download the app to your smartphone and scan a QR code provided by Office 365 during the setup process. 5. Complete the setup process: After configuring your preferred verification method, Office 365 will ask you to verify your chosen method. Complete the verification process by following the on-screen instructions. This may involve entering a code sent to your phone, scanning a QR code with your authenticator app, or answering a phone call. 6. Generate app passwords (optional): Some older or third-party apps may not support 2FA. In these cases, you'll need to create an app-specific password to use in place of your regular account password. To create an app password, go to the \\"Additional security verification\\" page and click \\"Create and manage app passwords.\\" Follow the prompts to create, label, and generate an app-specific password. Use this password when required by the application. 7. Verify your email or phone number (optional): Office 365 may also prompt you to add or confirm secondary contact information, such as an alternate email address or phone number. This can be useful for account recovery purposes if you ever lose access to your primary email or phone. Follow the on-screen instructions to add or verify this information. 8. Update your Office applications (recommended): To ensure seamless integration with 2FA, it's a good idea to update your Office applications to the latest versions. These updates typically include support for newer security features and improvements. 9. Test your two-factor authentication: To ensure 2FA is working as intended, sign out of your Office 365 account and sign back in using your updated security settings. You should be prompted for a second verification factor after entering your password. By following these steps, you have successfully set up two-factor authentication for your Office 365 account. This added layer of security will help protect your valuable data, emails, and personal information from potential threats."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Answer the following question: Two brothers went to the doctor for their yearly examination. Liam found out he has high cholesterol, while Rudy found out his triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters. Which brother was more at risk for heart disease? Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.

Sir Henry Irving (6 February 1838 - 13 October 1905), born John Henry Brodribb, sometimes known as J. H. Irving, was an English stage actor in the Victorian era, known as an actor-manager because he took complete responsibility (supervision of sets, lighting, direction, casting, as well as playing the leading roles) for season after season at the Lyceum Theatre, establishing himself and his company as representative of English classical theatre. In 1895 he became the first actor to be awarded a knighthood, indicating full acceptance into the higher circles of British society. Irving is widely acknowledged to be one of the inspirations for Count Dracula, the title character of the 1897 novel Dracula whose author, Bram Stoker, was business manager of the theatre. After a few years' schooling while living at Halsetown, near St Ives, Cornwall, Irving became a clerk to a firm of East India merchants in London, but he soon gave up a commercial career for acting. On 29 September 1856 he made his first appearance at Sunderland as Gaston, Duke of Orleans, in Bulwer Lytton's play, Richelieu, billed as Henry Irving. This name he eventually assumed by royal licence. When the inexperienced Irving got stage fright and was hissed off the stage the actor Samuel Johnson was among those who supported him with practical advice. Later in life Irving gave them all regular work when he formed his own Company at the Lyceum Theatre. For 10 years, he went through an arduous training in various stock companies in Scotland and the north of England, taking more than 500 parts. his delineations of the various characters (...) were admirably graphic, and met with repeated rounds of applause. Possesed of a fine voice, which he modulated with great taste and judgment, he was able to mark the depth or frivolity of the character he was representing with remarkable facility. He gained recognition by degrees, and in 1866 Ruth Herbert engaged him as her leading man and sometime stage director at the St. James's Theatre, London, where she first played Doricourt in The Belle's Stratagem. One piece that he directed there was W. S. Gilbert's first successful solo play, Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack (1866) The next year he joined the company of the newly opened Queen's Theatre, where he acted with Charles Wyndham, J. L. Toole, Lionel Brough, John Clayton, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Wigan, Ellen Terry and Nellie Farren. This was followed by short engagements at the Haymarket Theatre, Drury Lane, and the Gaiety Theatre. Finally he made his first conspicuous success as Digby Grant in James Albery's Two Roses, which was produced at the Vaudeville Theatre on 4 June 1870 and ran for a very successful 300 nights. In 1871, Irving began his association with the Lyceum Theatre by an engagement under Bateman's management. The fortunes of the house were at a low ebb when the tide was turned by Irving's sudden success as Mathias in The Bells, a version of Erckmann-Chatrian's Le Juif polonais by Leopold Lewis, a property which Irving had found for himself. The play ran for 150 nights, established Irving at the forefront of the British drama, and would prove a popular vehicle for Irving for the rest of his professional life. With Bateman, Irving was seen in W. G. Wills' Charles I and Eugene Aram, in Richelieu, and in 1874 in Hamlet. The unconventionality of this last performance, during a run of 200 nights, aroused keen discussion and singled him out as the most interesting English actor of his day. In 1875, again with Bateman, he was seen as the title character in Macbeth; in 1876 as Othello, and as Philip in Alfred Lord Tennyson's Queen Mary; in 1877 in Richard III; and in The Lyons Mail. During this time he became lifelong friends with Bram Stoker, who praised him in his review of Hamlet and thereafter joined Irving as the manager for the company.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What is an example of a job Henry Irving held early in his career?","completion":"An example of a job Henry Irving held early in his career is when he \\"became a clerk to a firm of East India merchants in London.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By the middle 1950s, he had become one of the best-loved and most successful children's book writers in the world. His books are very popular with young readers. They enjoy the invented words and the pictures of unusual funny animals and plants. In 1954, life magazine published a report about school children who could not read. The report said many children's books were not interesting. Doctor Seuss strongly hoped to help children and decided to write books that were interesting and easy to read. He used words with the same ending sound, like fish and wish. He did not receive training in art. Yet, he drew the pictures for most of his books. In 1957, Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat. He used less than 230 words to write the book and even a six-year-old should be able to read it. It was a fun story and easy to read. Children loved it. Their parents loved it, too. Today it is still one of the stories they like best. The success of The Cat in the Hat made him want to write more books for children. In 1960, he wrote a book using less than fifty words. The book is called Green Eggs and Ham. In 1984, Doctor Seuss won a Pulitzer Prize . He was honored for the education and enjoyment his books provided American children and their parents. He died at the age of 87, but his influence remains. Millions of his books have been sold worldwide. People say his books helped change the way American children learned to read.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the mother of the girl that the professor of French Literature is attracted to? ? In 1947, Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged European professor of French literature, travels to the United States to take a teaching position in New Hampshire. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze, largely because he is romantically attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \\"Lo\\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \\"nymphets\\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and gets married to Charlotte only just to be near her daughter. Charlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed. Her death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \\"Lolita\\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending an all-girls Catholic school. However, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty, who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name. Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography. Quilty abandoned her after she refused to be in one of his films. The answer is:","completion":"Charlotte Haze."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Translate this to English?","completion":"Aggressive behaviors that can be seen in some television programs have a negative psychological effect on children. This statement brings attention to the potential impact of television content on children's mental health and well-being. Aggressive behaviors depicted in various television programs, such as violence, confrontations, and negative communication, may influence children's behavior and psychological development in different ways. Firstly, children's repeated exposure to aggressive behavior on television may desensitize them to violence, making it seem more acceptable and normal in their everyday lives. Consequently, they may become more likely to engage in violent actions or adopt aggressive communication styles with their peers and family members. Secondly, watching aggressive behaviors on television may lead to a distorted perception of reality. Children may develop an inaccurate understanding of social norms and fail to recognize appropriate ways to resolve conflicts or express emotions effectively. This can result in forming unhealthy relationships, engaging in inappropriate behaviors, and struggling in social situations. Thirdly, the continuous exposure to violent content may increase children's anxiety and fear levels. Psychological studies have demonstrated that children who watch violent television shows are more prone to nightmares, diminished self-confidence, and heightened anxiety. Such persistent emotional distress may significantly impede their emotional and mental development as they grow. Moreover, the portrayal of aggression in television programs may contribute to the development of aggressive attitudes or stereotypes. Children who watch these programs may start to categorize individuals based on the violent tendencies they observe on screen, leading to judgmental attitudes or prejudices. In turn, this could foster a hostile environment, isolating children and negatively affecting their potential for personal growth and fostering a broader social awareness. Lastly, children who frequently watch aggressive behavior on television may miss out on opportunities to develop essential social and emotional skills. Their screen time might overshadow more positive experiences, such as engaging in creative play, spending quality time with family and friends, or participating in extracurricular activities that promote cognitive, emotional, and social growth. In conclusion, aggressive behaviors portrayed in television programs may have a detrimental psychological effect on children. It is vital for parents, caregivers, and educators to monitor and limit children's exposure to such content, as well as encourage the consumption of age-appropriate, educational, and positively stimulating media. This approach will not only mitigate the potential harm caused by aggressive television content but also promote healthy psychological and emotional development in children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The result was a second consecutive victory for Constantine Karamanlis and his National Radical Union party , which won 171 of the 300 seats in Parliament . - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - The National Radical Union ((), \\"Ethnik Rizospastik Énsis\\" (ERE)) was a Greek political party formed in 1955 by Konstantinos Karamanlis, mostly out of the Greek Rally party. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Greek Rally ((), \\"Ellnikòs Synagermós (ES)\\") was a right-wing political party in Greece. Founded on 6 August 1951 by former field marshal Alexandros Papagos, the party encompassed a broad spectrum of the royalist conservative elements in Greek society and was modelled on the Charles de Gaulle's Rassemblement du Peuple Français (RPF). Throughout the years, the Greek right had become splintered. Papagos' new party managed to attract considerable support, and the Populist Uniting Party (led by Panagiotis Kanellopoulos and Stephanos Stephanopoulos) and the New Party (led by Spiros Markezinis) dissolved and merged with the Greek Rally. Later on, a large portion of the People's Party, the major right-wing party of the prewar era, defected to the Greek Rally; among the prominent defectors was Konstantinos Karamanlis.

Question: suppose there is very little human interference happens, how will it affect fewer eggs hatch. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"Given the process provided, the second effect mentioned is \\"The egg hatches into a baby bird.\\" Now let's analyze the situation: Very little human interference happens, which could potentially lead to fewer eggs hatching. 1. \\"A bird lays an egg\\": With very little human interference, it is likely that there is no change or a positive effect on this stage. There might be more suitable habitats and fewer disturbances for the birds to lay eggs. 2. \\"The egg hatches into a baby bird\\": Since there is very little human interference, it is possible that the environment is better suited for the eggs and the hatching process; however, fewer eggs hatch could suggest natural factors such as predation or environmental conditions have a greater effect. Nonetheless, human interference plays a minor role, and any perturbation might have less effect on this process. 3. \\"Baby bird eats\\": With little human interference, it is likely that the food sources for the baby birds are also less affected, which might lead to the birds having enough food and possibly less competition. As a result, this stage might see more or less the same effects as the previous two steps. 4. \\"Grows into an adult bird\\": The growth of the baby bird could be influenced by the previous steps and the environment. As very little human interference means minimal disturbances, it is expected that the baby bird's growth could be reasonably suitable for its natural environment, leading to more or less the same effects as the previous steps. 5. \\"The bird finds a mate\\": Minimal human interference may result in a healthier bird population, which subsequently could lead to higher chances of finding a mate. As a result, the birds may have a larger pool of potential mates, leading to more or less the same effects as the previous steps. 6. \\"The pair build a nest\\": If there is very little human interference, it means there could be more favorable conditions for nest-building in the form of more suitable habitats and fewer disturbances. The birds should have no problem in building a nest, leading to more or less the same effects as the previous steps. 7. \\"The birds lay eggs\\": With minimal human interference, the birds can enjoy a generally healthy environment and potentially produce more eggs in the future. This step's effects may also be more or less the same as the previous steps. Considering the entire process and the influence of very little human interference, I would say that it has less effect on the second effect mentioned, which is \\"The egg hatches into a baby bird.\\" It is worth mentioning that natural factors will still play a significant role in determining the overall success of the processes described."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is this text about?","completion":"This text, dated October 27, reports the views of then French President Jacques Chirac on Turkey's attempt to join the European Union, often abbreviated as the EU. To expound, the EU is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe, characterized by the abolition of border control between member states, a common market, and policies that ensure the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor. In this text, President Jacques Chirac explicitly states that Turkey's bid to become a member of this union was \\"not a done deal,\\" essentially highlighting the uncertainty and unpredictability of the accession process. The statement seems to temper enthusiasm or reductionist views that Turkey's accession to the EU was guaranteed or inevitable, underscoring that there could be possible obstacles or disagreements that might affect the actualization of this membership. However, Chirac also expresses his belief that it was in Europe's best interests for Turkey to join the EU. This statement assumes significance as it posits that Turkey's accession could potentially bring strategic, economic, or geopolitical benefits to Europe. Although Chirac doesn't clearly delineate what these potential benefits could be, one might infer that they might pertain to strengthening regional security, boosting economic growth, fostering diplomatic relations, among other beneficial outcomes. The views stated by Chirac were reported by a government spokesman after a cabinet meeting. This setting and method of delivery underline the importance of the issues being discussed, where decisions and viewpoints potentially have broad and far-reaching consequences on international relations and regional dynamics. To wrap up, this text is centered on Turkey's bid for EU membership as seen from the perspective of the then French President Jacques Chirac. It shines a light on the intricacies of international politics, where decisions are rarely easy or straightforward, and the potential benefits and uncertainties that come with nations seeking new partnerships and memberships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Singer Chris Brown, sought by Los Angeles police after an alleged domestic violence incident, turned himself in Sunday, police said. Chris Brown attends a party saluting music producer Clive Davis in Beverly Hills, California, on Saturday. Brown, nominated for two Grammy Awards, was a no-show Sunday night at the nationally televised awards show. He was scheduled to perform at the show. His girlfriend, singer Rihanna, abruptly canceled her planned Grammys performance, but neither her spokesman nor the show organizers gave a reason. \\"Rihanna is well,\\" her spokesman said in a written statement. \\"Thank you for concern and support.\\" Police have not identified the alleged victim, who they said \\"suffered visible injuries and identified","completion":"Brown as her attacker.\\" The incident took place early Sunday morning in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. Both Brown and the alleged victim attended Clive Davis' pre-Grammy party on Saturday night before the incident occurred. Brown was taken into custody on suspicion of making criminal threats, a felony, and later released on a 50,000 bail. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said they needed more time to review the case and gather additional evidence before deciding whether to file formal charges against Brown. Rihanna's representatives have not confirmed or denied if she is the unidentified victim in the case. However, sources close to the couple have claimed that Rihanna was indeed the victim of the alleged assault. As the case unfolds, both Brown and Rihanna's careers have come under scrutiny, with many fans and industry insiders expressing concern for their safety and well-being. While some have called for Brown to be stripped of his Grammy nominations, others argue that the incident should be treated as a private matter between the two artists. Advocacy groups have also seized on the case as an opportunity to raise awareness about domestic violence and the importance of getting help for both victims and perpetrators. Domestic violence hotlines have reported an uptick in calls following news of the alleged altercation, though it is unclear if the increase can be directly attributed to the high-profile case. The Recording Academy, the organization responsible for the Grammy Awards, issued a statement expressing its disappointment on the situation. \\"We hope that this matter can be resolved swiftly and fairly, and that both Chris Brown and Rihanna can resume their careers and continue to inspire fans around the world,\\" the statement read. As the story continues to develop, it is expected that more details about the alleged altercation will emerge, shedding light on the events leading up to the arrest and the nature of the alleged victim's injuries. Additionally, legal experts suggest that if charges are pressed against Brown, he could potentially face jail time, depending on the severity of the allegations and any previous criminal history. Both Chris Brown and Rihanna have remained largely silent about the incident, with their representatives urging respect for the artists' privacy during this difficult time. As fans and the music industry await further developments in this case, it is clear that the outcome of this story will have lasting effects on the lives and careers of these two talented musicians."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gavin Christopher Newsom was born in San Francisco, California, to Tessa Thomas (nee Menzies) and William Alfred Newsom III, a retired state appeals court justice and attorney for Getty Oil. He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan. His father is of mostly Irish descent; one of Newsom's maternal great-grandfathers, Scotsman Thomas Addis, was a pioneer scientist in the field of nephrology and a professor of medicine at Stanford University. Newsom is the second cousin, twice removed, of musician Joanna Newsom. In 2014, Newsom was the only statewide politician to endorse California Proposition 47, a piece of legislation that decriminalized nonviolent offenses like drug and property crimes, turning them into misdemeanors as opposed to felonies. In July 2015, Newsom released the final report of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana Policy, which he had convened with the American Civil Liberties Union of California in 2013. The report's recommendations to regulate marijuana were intended to inform a legalization measure on the November 2016 ballot. Newsom supported the resulting measure, Proposition 64, which legalized cannabis use and cultivation for California state residents who are 21 or older. In response to pro-enforcement statements made by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Newsom sent a letter on February 24, 2017, to Attorney General Sessions and President Trump, urging them not to increase federal enforcement against recreational cannabis firms opening up in California. He wrote, \\"The government must not strip the legal and publicly supported industry of its business and hand it back to drug cartels and criminals ... Dealers don't card kids. I urge you and your administration to work in partnership with California and the other eight states that have legalized recreational marijuana for adult use in a way that will let us enforce our state laws that protect the public and our children, while targeting the bad actors.\\" Newsom responded to comments by Spicer which compared cannabis to opioids saying, \\"Unlike marijuana, opioids represent an addictive and harmful substance, and I would welcome your administration's focused efforts on tackling this particular public health crisis.\\" Ask a question about this article.","completion":"What was the purpose of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana Policy that Gavin Newsom convened with the American Civil Liberties Union of California in 2013?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: But many of its facts, while delightful, aren't actually factual, something noted by a BuzzFeed reporter in a tweet last December. With more than 6 million followers since its inception in 2011, UberFacts is one of the most widely followed accounts on Twitter. On Facebook, UberFacts' page has more than 283,000 likes. It even has its own website. Not really true but it makes a good Tweet I guess. RT @UberFacts: Apple now has more cash on hand than the U.S. government. Not really true but it makes a good Tweet I guess. RT @UberFacts: Apple now has more cash on hand than the U.S. government. When UberFacts was pressed over Twitter about the prevalence of false information coming from the account, BuzzFeed received an apparent response from Kris Sanchez, the founder of UberFacts. In December, he emailed to suggest unfollowing the UberFacts Twitter page instead of complaining about the validity of the facts. (Sanchez more recently denied sending the email, and suggested his email was hacked.) The tweets about Apple now read , \\"for a brief period of time in 2011, Apple had more money than the U.S. government.\\" In this case, this fact was briefly true, during the debt ceiling debate in July of 2011, but UberFacts recycled the tweet numerous times , tweeting it on Feb. 6, 2012, Feb. 12, 2012, March 3, 2012, March 13, 2012, May 8, 2012, and June 19, 2012, as well as tweets in August 2012 and December 2012. This week, after more criticism, Sanchez denied the correspondence. He tweeted publicly that the suggestion that he had sent the email is fabricated and \\"ridiculous.\\" I'm flattered that a writer from a well known website would make up such a ridiculous story. Don't understand it, but still flattered! I'm flattered that a writer from a well known website would make up such a ridiculous story. Don't understand it, but still flattered! For the record: I don't and never have sent emails to people who don't like me or my page... Because they don't exist :) For the record: I don't and never have sent emails to people who don't like me or my page... Because they don't exist :) The email came from \\"kris@uber-facts.com,\\" the email he told BuzzFeed he uses. It's the same email Sanchez listed when he filed to trademark the term \\"UberFacts\\" in February 2012. \\"I never sent you an email,\\" Sanchez told BuzzFeed. \\"It is my email address but my email has been compromised in the past. So that's not the address that I actively use.\\" When asked if his email had been hacked, Sanchez said he'd been a victim of hacking before. \\"I've been a victim and a target of that before. That's the only explanation. I'm not suggesting you made it up. I can tell you definitively that I never sent you an email...it happens; it comes with the territory.\\" In a \\"frequently asked questions\\" section of his site from March 2013, Sanchez says he sometimes cites sources but rarely ever does it on the UberFacts Twitter page, explaining people don't like to see links in tweets. 2) Do you ever cite your sources? Yes! But not all of them, and rarely ever on the Twitter page. Sources can be found here on the website below articles. As far as tweets go, it's much more time efficient for one to simply use the Google machine to find the answers to whatever questions you may have! Believe it or not, more people would prefer NOT to see a link at the end of the tweet. Sanchez has also said in the past he fact-checks all of his facts before posting them. \\"Any fact that is submitted that I do consider using is always verified before it's posted,\\" Sanchez said in an interview in April 2012. But Sanchez's errors sometimes draw anger from some of the account's 6 million-plus followers. A tweet in October about a Florida man who complained about a headache only to realize at the hospital his wife had accidentally shot him used an image from a story about a Chinese woman who had a bullet removed from her brain. When asked about the discrepancy on Twitter, Sanchez tweeted, \\"the image is not the fact.\\" Sanchez said he doesn't create the images himself, noting that he pulls them from different sites and puts them in a file format he has for tweeting images. \\"None of those images are created by me,\\" Sanchez said. Sanchez told BuzzFeed that the majority of the facts he finds are culled from a variety of sources as well as a smaller percentage of facts that people submit. He says he fact-checks them all. \\"I would say 96–97% of the facts you see on the Twitter account are facts I found on science articles, Google alerts, new studies, anything like that,\\" he said. \\"The other 3–4% are facts which people have submitted, which I will then look up before posting. Anything I post I honestly believe to be true, and when I find out otherwise I remove it as quickly as I can.\\" When asked about some of the tweets that are believed to be incorrect, Sanchez said, \\"anything that I post up there [I] truly believe to be true. I'm not trying to lie to anyone. When I do find out that things are incorrect. I will either correct them or will remove them.\\" Sanchez says he handles corrections by posting a new fact and tweeting the correction at UberFacts' Twitter account. \\"I'll tweet the new fact out,\\" Sanchez said, citing a correction from Monday. \\"There was a photo of the Titanic, the story of the guy who survived the sinking of the America and then died on the Titanic and I had messed up the year. So I retweeted the fact again with the proper year and mentioned the UberFacts account from UberFacts with the correction.\\" ||||| Kris Sanchez is tapping furiously on the screen of his iPhone 6. \\"It gets harder\\"—-tap, tap, tap—\\"and harder as you go,\\" he says, staring intently at the sleek appliance. \\"You have\\"—tap, tap, tap—\\"less time.\\" Kris Sanchez It’s a blindingly sunny morning in October, and Sanchez, founder of the uber-popular Twitter account UberFacts, is sitting outside at a sidewalk cafe in Beverly Hills showing me a feature on the about-to-be-released UberFacts Android app. (An iOS app already exists.) He's playing a game called UberTap, in which you try to tap the screen a certain number of times within a certain number of seconds. Say, 80 times in 10 seconds. It’s mindlessly addictive (wait—what about 100 times in 10 seconds?), and has absolutely nothing to do with the weird, Ripley's Believe It Or Not-type trivia that has made UberFacts one of the most powerful brands on Twitter. \\"I really want to give people a variety of things to do,\\" Sanchez says, pushing up the sleeves on his dark green leather jacket to reveal a small tattoo on his wrist that says \\"wealth and prosperity\\" in Chinese characters (the other wrist says \\"love\\" also in Chinese characters). The 23-year-old former dancer—he studied theater in high school and was among the hundreds of dancers who performed at the Microsoft Kinect launch in 2010 in Times Square—is wearing jeans and purple high-tops. His dark hair is cut in a thick Mohawk, the tips bleached the color of burnt caramel. \\"I want people to be able to do more than just read facts all day long.\\" Of course, the greater public's love of doing just that is what has made Sanchez one of the top 100 influencers on Twitter, as well as one of the richest. By spewing out tens of thousands of the most \\"unimportant things you’ll never need to know,\\" as the UberFacts Twitter page cheekily pronounces, Sanchez has accumulated over 7 million followers since launching the account in 2009 when he was a bored college student at SUNY New Paltz. (\\"Total hippie town, drum circles. I only went there for a year.\\") It was really the first time I was really publicly attacked on the Internet. After that I was like, okay, UberFacts needs to be treated like a real brand. Today he says he makes about 500,000 a year just from sponsored links. The way this works is that a company called Social Reactor, which pairs social media influencers with advertisers, supplies him with galleries or other web pages that he links to in his Tweets. He gets paid for every click those pages receive. Then there are the branded deals he’s done with companies like Ford and Paramount, wherein a simple tweet, accompanied by a link and a hashtag, becomes a virtual slot machine, gushing out thousands to tens of thousands of dollars. Plus the apps. The iOS app, which has been downloaded 1.5 million times, is estimated to generate 60,000 a week from advertising, though that has not yet been implemented. Sanchez is a \\"special breed,\\" according to Scott Jones, the CEO of ChaCha, which owns Social Reactor. \\"It’s pretty rare to make that much [money],\\" Jones says. The reason Sanchez is \\"on the upper end of the pay scale,\\" Jones says, is \\"partially because he has a big follower base, but more importantly, his audience is highly engaged. They stay for an average of more than 14 page views a visit. So if it's a gallery of 10 images, they're going to look at the 10 and then four (pages) of something else.\\" In a lot of ways, Sanchez is a personification of the kind of you’re-never-gonna-believe-this facts that his Twitter feed churns out. A twentysomething college dropout can make more money on Twitter than a corporate executive. But his tale is also revealing of the often tumultuous, sometimes painful, way that young, talented, creative, and very green new media mavens are forced to grow up in the fast-paced, self-regulating world of the Internet. It’s a place where entrepreneurs with bold ideas and Red Bull-fueled energy reserves can carve out insanely lucrative jobs and identities overnight, often without realizing that what they’re doing is actually a job, and usually without any real training. Some UberFacts \\"facts\\" | Click to expand In Sanchez’s case, until just recently, he thought of UberFacts as \\"a hobby.\\" It was one that he started in college when, instead of studying, \\"I decided to kill time by searching for facts on the Internet.\\" Oh, and there was another reason, too. \\"I also joined Twitter to follow Britney Spears\\" he says. \\"But I didn't have anything to tweet about. So I figured, hey, tweeting these facts would be a really good idea. It was just so I could feel like I was closer to her.\\" Alas, Britney didn't follow him back (and still hasn't), but Sanchez had found his calling. After dropping out of SUNY, he moved back to Brooklyn, his hometown, and, in between dance auditions and a job as an after-school counselor that paid 250 a week, he tweeted. Like many Internet pioneers, he worked out of an apartment, rolling out bed in the morning and sitting down in front of his computer before heading off to his real job as a counselor. Sharp, intuitive, and a very quick-study, it was not long before he figured out that generating more of the right kind of tweets at the right times of day resulted in more followers, and so he ramped up to 60 to 70 tweets a day. He also spent 1,000 on retweets and shout-outs from other influencers (now a Twitter no-no), and his account started taking off. But for a one-man operation, the schedule was challenging, he says, and earlier this year he was called out by BuzzFeed and Gizmodo for posting a number of untrue, or, in some cases, untrue-ish, facts. (One of the latter had to do with a Huggies diaper that sends out a tweet when a baby pees; Sanchez maintains that a prototype of the diaper was made, even if it didn’t actually hit the market.) \\"There are so many tweets going out each day that it was tough for one person, being me, to make sure that every single one of them was completely true,\\" he says, adding, \\"Anything that I posted up there, I thought was true. And I'm always bummed to find out that it isn't.\\" Sanchez is visibly still hurt by the incident—which he calls \\"my first public mess\\"—though he's eager to talk about it, perhaps because it wound up prompting a major maturation in himself and his company. \\"It was really the first time I was really publicly attacked on the Internet. And, you know, BuzzFeed is a really popular website. And it was Lindsay Lohan’s face and my face on their front page. It was after that that I was like, okay, UberFacts needs to be treated like a real brand. It has a large following and I want to put more work in it and make it better. I just want to increase the quality of it.\\" Some UberFacts \\"facts\\" | Click to expand Last January he moved from New York to L.A. and got serious. He made himself CEO of UberFacts and brought on two business partners (who, in the startup tradition, are also his best friends and roommates), in addition to a small staff of fact-finders whose sole job is to comb through reports, websites, and various publications looking for the kind of quirkily stupefying factoids that are likely to generate clicks. He then goes over their suggestions and selects which ones will be posted. When I ask where he and his staff find most of their ideas for tweets, he says \\"BuzzFeed, ironically enough,\\" as well as Reddit and Digg. \\"On Reddit, a lot of people will find an article then write about the article they found. So I'll click on the article and see what else there is,\\" he says. Even though he's not always culling from The New Yorker or other rigorously fact-checked sources, Sanchez says he stresses the importance of fact-checking to his staff, and that after one employee came up with a series of tweets about pandas that, after being posted, were discovered to have been taken from a book about made-up facts about pandas, the person was let go. \\"That was the fourth employee,\\" he says. \\"Now there are three.\\" Many of UberFacts' tweets are actually pretty soft, noncontroversial facts, particularly the gallery links that earn him so much dough. (\\"15 foods that can boost your sex drive!\\") Still, there are the occasional tweets that rely on the conventional wisdom of the Internet and are stripped of nuance for the sake of sensationalism. For instance, this one: \\"Drug Lord Pablo Escobar had so much cash that rats ate nearly one billion dollars of his money each year.\\" Sanchez cites his source as being the website Elite Daily, which touts itself as the HuffPo for millennials. In a \\"Gangster of the Week\\" compilation of wowza facts about Escobar, the drug lord's brother Roberto is quoted as saying: \\"Pablo was earning so much that each year we would write off 10% of the money because the rats would eat it in storage or it would be damaged by water or lost.\\" The quote seems to be taken from Roberto's book The Accountant's Story: Inside the Violent World of the Medellín Cartel, and is a little mangled, but the point is that rats alone were not responsible for destroying Escobar's cash. Sanchez isn't the only one who ran with the partial reading of the line. Rats eating Escobar's billions is a widely circulated meme on the Internet. But it's not the whole truth. Some UberFacts \\"facts\\" | Click to expand Sometimes you have to spend hours going through really mundane pieces of information to find the one that’s magical. UberFacts might seem like one of those deceptively simple ideas that we all could have thought of, had we been thinking about deceptively simple ideas that would take off on Twitter. But the art of the brand is more than just coming up with oddball trivia and shaving it down to 140 characters. Sanchez has a unique style that is itself deceptively simple, as well as a knack for coming up with facts that walk the line between totally unbelievable and just believable enough. Sample: \\"Blue whales are so big that a human can swim through their largest veins and arteries.\\" He is also a keen student of how the web works. Says Jones: \\"Kris only had 200,000 followers when we first met. And in just a matter of a few years, he’s grown that to 7 million. The real trick he pulled off is, he’s tweeting at the right times, and tweeting stuff that resonates. He pays attention to the engagement level of his audience, and he tweets more of the stuff that works and less of the stuff that doesn’t work.\\" When asked what kind of trivia he likes to push on UberFacts Sanchez says \\"cute animals\\" and \\"those studies that say people who drink more coffee tend to be more open to ideas that contradict their own. \\"I love stuff like that because it’s just so unexpected. It’s not something that you hear and you say, ‘Oh, I knew that.’ It’s not common sense.\\" So what’s he planning to do with all his cash? Brand expansion, naturally. Beyond the apps, there’s talk of a book, TV deals and possibly—hey, why not?—a calendar. Still, he says he will never stop toiling to come up with surprising tweets. \\"Sometimes you have to spend hours going through really mundane pieces of information to find the one that’s magical. But I really enjoy finding those magical ones.\\" ||||| UberFacts UberFacts is available in the app store. What if you got paid to tweet? No, we’re not talking about handling a company’s social media. We’re talking big bucks, hundreds of thousands of dollars, just for typing a few characters, adding a link, and clicking “send.” That’s the business 23-year-old Kris Sanchez, who tweets under the account @UberFacts, a Twitter account that tweets — you guessed it — facts, to 7.2 million followers. Last year, he made US500,000 for tweeting sponsored links, according to Fast Company. The links, when clicked by his followers, earn him between US.01-.03/click. Multiply that by a few sponsored links a day, a couple of hundred thousand eager followers, and 365 days in the year, and you’re rolling in money. There’s also an UberFacts app, which reportedly brings in US60,000 a week in ad revenue. Sanchez tweets 60-70 times a day.

While the statement \\"A woman figure skater in a blue costume holds her leg in the air by the blade of her skate\\" provides information about the actions and appearance of a woman figure skater, it does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether she is performing in a competition. The action described, which involves holding her leg in the air by the blade of her skate, is likely a part of her figure skating routine, but it could also be a practice session, an exhibition, or a casual performance. Competitions are just one of the many settings where figure skaters perform their routines. They may practice extensively before participating in competitions, perform in exhibitions or ice shows, or engage in casual performances and routines outside of formal events. The fact that the figure skater is wearing a blue costume adds some context, as costumes are generally worn during official performances. However, it is still not enough to confirm if the skater is indeed participating in a competition. To establish whether the figure skater is performing in a competition, additional information would be necessary. Such information might include details about the venue, the presence of an audience or judges, how the performance is scored or ranked, or the nature of any awards or prizes involved.

Fifteen miles (24.1 km) west-northwest of Charing Cross, it is one of the major metropolitan centres identified in the London Plan. Uxbridge historically formed part of the parish of Hillingdon in the county of Middlesex, and was a significant local commercial centre from an early time. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century it expanded and increased in population, becoming a municipal borough in 1955, and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. It is a significant retail and commercial centre, and is the location of Brunel University and the Uxbridge campus of Buckinghamshire New University. The town is close to the boundary with Buckinghamshire, which is locally the River Colne. - Hillingdon is a suburban area within the London Borough of Hillingdon, situated 14.2 miles (22.8 km) west of Charing Cross. It was an ancient parish in the county of Middlesex that originally included the market town of Uxbridge. During the 1920s Hillingdon experienced a rapid increase in population and was absorbed by Uxbridge Urban District in 1929. It has formed part of Greater London since 1965. - The London Borough of Hillingdon is the westernmost borough in Greater London, England which had a population of 273,936 according to the 2011 Census.

The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition. Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \\"futile\\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto. But it was House conservatives who defeated the 867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed. The House Freedom Caucus — a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House — had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow — it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive.

Tea Party groups make gains against 'ObamaCore' education program Tea Party groups are barnstorming state capitals across the country to stop an Obama administration-backed initiative to impose federal math and English education standards on public schools. Though conservatives have long argued that state and local officials can best make decisions on K-12 education, the Tea Party's opposition to the federal program -- Common Core State Standards -- represents a pivot for the movement, which started in 2009 to promote lower taxes and smaller government. And they are making gains, as some states consider putting the program on hold. \\"We have a renewed sense of vigor,\\" Lee Ann Burkholder, founder of the 9/12 Patriots in York, Pa., told FoxNews.com. \\"And when it comes to your kids or grandkids, people really get fired up.\\" The Tea Party is already riled up following revelations that the IRS had been singling out its groups over the past few years. On the education issue, Burkholder said her group held a meeting this spring that attracted 400 people, double the usual number. The meeting was followed by a bus trip to the state capital in which members wore matching T-shirts and pressed their case to lawmakers. Groups have pressured state legislatures and school boards from Michigan to Georgia to drop their support or defund the bipartisan-backed program they've dubbed \\"ObamaCore,\\" putting heat on Republican governors in particular. It's not so much the actual standards they object to but the fact that it's coming from Washington as opposed to the state level, and could lead to tracking student data across the country. Lawmakers, include several seeking reelection, have taken notice, especially after hearing about Tea Party groups vowing to back challengers to those who continue to support Common Core. Seven state legislatures purportedly have proposed legislation to at least delay implementation. And two states with Republican governors -- Indiana and Pennsylvania -- have put the program on hold. In addition, Georgia Republican Gov. Nathan Deal, up for reelection in 2014, issued an executive order last month titled Reaffirming State Sovereignty over Education that in part said: \\"No educational standards shall be imposed on Georgia by the federal government.\\" Deal later told The Washington Post: \\"We didn't see it coming with the intensity that it is, apparently all across the country.\\" Common Core was designed by governors and state education officials with input from teachers and others, with much of its funding coming from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. So far, 45 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards, which are scheduled to go into effect next year. The Tea Party effort got a boost when FreedomWorks got involved. The well-funded national group has devoted a variety of resources to raising awareness about the issue, an effort that includes putting several information pages on its website and hosting a national teleconference Wednesday night. \\"Common Core dictates what (teachers) teach, how they teach it and when they teach it,\\" Whitney Neal, a FreedomWorks grassroots organizer, said. \\"Every child is treated the same.\\" However, Common Core states the program only sets standards for math and English language arts, not a national curriculum, and says teachers play a big role. \\"Local teachers, principals, superintendents and others will decide how the standards are to be met,\\" the group says on its website. \\"Teachers will continue to devise lesson plans and tailor instruction to the individual needs of the students in their classrooms.\\" Neal and others suggest states were pigeonholed into accepting the program so they could get much-needed Race to the Top education grants in Obama's 2009 stimulus package. And they are concerned about the gathering of student-assessment data for comparison among students, schools, districts and states. \\"It's very creepy,\\" Neal said. Potential 2016 presidential candidate and former Florida Republican Gov. Jeb Bush has landed in the middle of the controversy. A champion of education reform, including support of home schooling and school vouchers, he has essentially asked lawmakers to resist the Tea Party pressure. \\"The Common Cause State Standards are clear and straight forward,\\" he told business leaders last month in Michigan. \\"Do not pull back.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Spiderman is one of the most famous comic book heroes of all time. He was created by Stan Lee in 1963 and was first introduced to the world in the pages of Marvel Comic Books. Spiderman's story is the story of Peter Parker, a child who lost his parents and lives with his aunt and uncle. Peter is a shy, quiet boy wearing glasses and has few friends. One day, on a high school class trip to a science lab, he gets bitten by a special spider. Soon Peter realizes he has amazing powers: he is as strong and quick as a spider and also has a type of sixth sense. He no longer needs his glasses and he can use his super power to fly through the city streets! Remembering something his Uncle Ben has told him _ ,Peter decides to use his powers to fight against enemies who do cruel things to people. And so, Spiderman is born. Life is not easy for Peter even though he is a superhero. He is in love with Mary Jane but he can't tell her about his amazing powers. Besides, his best friend Harry hates Spiderman! Peter is also short of money and time. He has to sell photos of Spiderman (himself!) to a newspaper and he keeps losing his other jobs because he's so busy saving people! Yet he has to fight against different kinds of cruel enemies. Question: What does\\"With great power, there must also come great responsibility\\"mean? Options: A: Powerful people can do whatever they like. B: People with power are always good. C: Powerful people should have a responsibility to do good. D: Powerful people are to blame for all the bad things that happen. A:","completion":"To answer the question, let's break down the possible answer choices and evaluate them according to the context provided in the article: A: Powerful people can do whatever they like. This option seems to go against the lesson Peter Parker learns from his Uncle Ben. Instead of doing whatever he likes, he decides to use his powers for good and fight against enemies who harm others. This option is not a good representation of the meaning behind the quote. B: People with power are always good. The article does not imply that power automatically makes someone good. It discusses Peter's struggle to balance his life with his newfound powers. Thus, this option does not accurately capture the meaning of \\"with great power, there must also come great responsibility.\\" C: Powerful people should have a responsibility to do good. In the article, after Peter gains his amazing powers, he remembers his Uncle Ben's words and decides to use his abilities to fight against enemies who do cruel things to people. This response aligns with the meaning of the quote, as Peter feels a responsibility to use his powers for good. D: Powerful people are to blame for all the bad things that happen. The article focuses on Spiderman's efforts to protect people from harm, not on blaming powerful individuals for all the bad things that occur. This option does not reasonably reflect the meaning behind the quote. Based on the analysis, the most accurate explanation for \\"With great power, there must also come great responsibility\\" is: C: Powerful people should have a responsibility to do good."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Mark Kessler, the small-town Pennsylvania police chief who posted videos of himself firing automatic weapons while cursing about gun control, has been given a termination notice. The borough council of Gilberton, population 750, voted 6-1 to fire him at a meeting Thursday night, said council chairman Daniel J. Malloy. Kessler was suspended July 31 at a council meeting that drew thousands of his supporters, including some openly armed, to the small town in Schuylkill County in eastern Pennsylvania. He will remain on suspension for 10 days to give him time to appeal, Malloy said. He would not comment further. \\"We knew it was coming,\\" Kessler said after the vote, CNN affiliate WFMZ-TV reported. Kessler's attorney, Joseph Nahas, said he will request a public hearing next week, the affiliate reported. The council accused Kessler of misusing borough property, neglecting his duties and failing to turn over weapons to the borough, his lawyer said. But Kessler said the firing is \\"because of my videos.\\" In the videos, he rails against liberals for attempting to curb gun rights and Secretary of State John Kerry for supporting an arms treaty.

Premise: \\"Installation of the control device hookup on a sequential basis usually involves an overlap of compliance testing of FGD system on one unit with hookup of an FGD system with the next unit.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Hookup cannot proceed from one unit to the next until the first unit is completely hooked up and tested for compliance.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"Hookup cannot proceed from one unit to the next until the first unit is completely hooked up and tested for compliance.\\" appears to be false. The premise states that the installation of the control device hookup on a sequential basis usually involves an overlap of compliance testing of FGD (Flue-gas desulfurization) system on one unit with the hookup of an FGD system on the next unit. This implies that while one unit is undergoing compliance testing, the hookup process for the next unit may simultaneously commence. To further understand the reasoning behind this answer, let us break down the premise and the hypothesis to obtain a clearer picture of the interrelated processes. 1. Control device hookup on a sequential basis: This suggests that installations happen one after the other in an organized and consecutive manner. Units are progressively connected, establishing a systematic order in the installation process. 2. Overlap of compliance testing of FGD system on one unit with hookup of an FGD system on the next unit: As per this statement, the hookup of an FGD system on one unit takes place while the compliance testing for the previous unit is being conducted. It indicates that the processes are happening concurrently, not strictly one after the other. 3. Hypothesis: The hypothesis implies that installation of the FGD hookup on the next unit cannot begin until the previous unit has been entirely connected and tested for compliance. This would mean that the processes of hookup and compliance testing must occur sequentially without any overlap. Considering the information presented in the premise, it can be concluded that the hypothesis does not align with the statement. The premise specifically highlights the overlap of compliance testing and the hookup of the FGD system on the next unit. Therefore, the hookup process for the following unit does not necessarily have to wait until the first unit is fully connected and tested for compliance. In summary, according to the given premise, the hookup of a control device on a sequential basis can indeed proceed from one unit to the next while the previous unit is still undergoing compliance testing. This allows for a more efficient and streamlined workflow. Consequently, the hypothesis appears to be false in the context of this premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

War work again brought local prosperity during World War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the 707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees, BECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington. Another boom began as the city emerged from the Great Recession which commenced when Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North Beacon Hill to South Lake Union. This initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion of almost 10,000 apartments in Seattle in 2017, which is more than any previous year and nearly twice as many as were built in 2016.

Popul re casino game Could you correct the punctuation please?","completion":"Popular Casino Game: Casino games are a popular form of entertainment that provides individuals with an opportunity to test their luck and potentially win money. There are many casino games available, both in physical casinos and online platforms, and each has its unique characteristics and popularity among players. Here, we will discuss one of the most popular casino games: blackjack. Blackjack, also known as 21, is a card game played between one or more players and a dealer. The main objective of the game is for the player to have a hand value of cards that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21. The game is highly popular due to its relatively simple rules and the level of skill involved. The game begins with each player receiving two cards, both face-up. The dealer also receives two cards, but one is face-down and called the \\"hole card.\\" Players then have the option to either “hit” (receive additional cards) or “stand” (keep their current cards, hoping they have a higher hand than the dealer). Each card has a corresponding point value: number cards are worth their face value, face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) are worth 10 points each, and an ace can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value would give the player's hand a better chance at winning. Players can continue requesting additional cards (hitting) until they either decide to stop (stand) or go over 21 points, at which point they \\"bust\\" and automatically lose the game. Once all the players have completed their respective turns, the dealer reveals their hole card. The dealer must hit until they have at least 17 points, after which they stand. The dealer can also bust, in which case any remaining players who have not busted win the game. If the dealer does not bust, then each player's hand is compared to the dealer's hand. Whoever has a hand value closer to, but not exceeding, 21 wins. If the value of both hands is equal, the game is considered a \\"push,\\" and no money is won or lost. There are various strategies that players can employ to increase their chances of winning. For example, players can use basic strategy charts to determine the optimal way to play, depending on their own hand and the dealer's face-up card. Card counting is another strategy used by more advanced players to predict the likelihood of high or low-value cards being dealt from the deck. However, card counting is frowned upon in most casinos, and players found doing it can be banned or face other penalties. In conclusion, blackjack is a highly popular casino game that offers an exciting blend of luck, skill, and strategy. Its simple rules and widespread availability make it a favorite among both novice and experienced casino-goers. Whether playing at a physical casino or an online platform, blackjack provides countless hours of entertainment and the potential for thrilling wins."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The city is located immediately north of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and holds sub-provincial administrative status, with powers slightly less than a province. - Mainland China, also known as the Chinese mainland or simply the mainland, is the geopolitical area under the direct jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China (PRC). It generally excludes the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau; however, it usually includes Hainan. The term \\"mainland China\\", which avoids calling the area simply \\"China\\" and thereby recognizing the founding of the PRC as \\"the\\" \\"China\\", was coined by the Kuomintang (KMT) after receiving control of Taiwan from Japan after World War II. By 1949, the KMT-led Republic of China (ROC) government was defeated in the Chinese Civil War in mainland China and fled to the island of Taiwan where the KMT pledged to \\"retake the Mainland\\". The KMT considers both sides of the Taiwan Strait (including Taiwan), as (one) \\"China\\" and one country, whereas Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) considers only mainland China as \\"China\\" and Taiwan (ROC) as \\"Taiwan\\" and maintains that they are different countries. - Henan is a province of the People's Republic of China, located in the central part of the country.

There is a debate about the origins of Cantonese opera, but it is generally accepted that opera was brought from the northern part of China and slowly migrated to the southern province of Guangdong in late 13th century, during the late Southern Song dynasty. In the 12th century, there was a theatrical form called the Nanxi or \\"Southern drama\\", which was performed in public theatres of Hangzhou, then capital of the Southern Song. With the invasion of the Mongol army, Emperor Gong of the Song dynasty fled with hundreds of thousands of Song people into Guangdong in 1276. Among them were Nanxi performers from Zhejiang, who brought Nanxi into Guangdong and helped develop the opera traditions in the south. - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage. - Chinese opera is a popular form of drama and musical theatre in China with roots going back to the early periods in China. It is a composite performance art that is an amalgamation of various art forms that existed in ancient China, and evolved gradually over more than a thousand years, reaching its mature form in the 13th century during the Song Dynasty. Early forms of Chinese drama are simple, but over time they incorporated various art forms, such as music, song and dance, martial arts, acrobatics, as well as literary art forms to become Chinese opera. - Guangzhou , traditionally romanised as Canton, is the capital and largest city of the Province of Guangdong in southeastern China. Located on the Pearl River about north-northwest of Hong Kong and north of Macau, Guangzhou was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub. - Hangzhou, formerly romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in east China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo.

It can be found in many of the performing arts, sports (sporting) events, and martial arts. Acrobatics is most often associated with activities that make extensive use of gymnastic elements, such as acro dance, circus, and gymnastics, but many other athletic activities such as ballet and diving may also employ acrobatics. Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, it may also apply to other types of performance, such as aerobatics. - Guangdong (Simplified ) is a province on the South China Sea coast of the People's Republic of China. Formerly romanised as Canton or Kwangtung, Guangdong surpassed Henan and Sichuan to become the most populous province in China in January 2005, registering 79.1 million permanent residents and 31 million migrants who lived in the province for at least six months of the year; the total population was 104,303,132 in the 2010 census, accounting for 7.79 percent of Mainland China's population.

Now, let's try to find out how many dollars the monthly pension dropped between the years 2001 and 2004. Drop means the amount that it went down, like when your ice cream falls from your cone. Sad, I know, but we'll figure it out together! To find this out, we need two pieces of information: the monthly pension amount in 2001 and the monthly pension amount in 2004. Unfortunately, I cannot give you the exact number because it would be different depending on the person and their job. But let's pretend we have these numbers. Imagine in 2001, the monthly pension was 1000. Now, pretend that in 2004, the monthly pension became 800. To find the difference (the drop) between these two numbers, we can play a little game of subtraction. Just like when you have 5 candy bars, and you eat 2, you'll have 3 left. In our case, we have: 1000 (pension in 2001) - 800 (pension in 2004) When we subtract 800 from 1000, we are left with 200.

Pointing to a color1ful flower, Campbell lifts her baby's soft hand, and rapidly moves it from one side of his nose to the other as she sniffs .\\"Flower!\\" she says loudly. Gregory smiles and looks carefully. It could be a year before Gregory, 4 months old, can speak, but now his mother hopes to communicate with her baby through sign language. Like others around the world, Campbell is part of a growing movement of parents teaching hearing babies simple signs to communicate before they can talk. The baby sign language has been more popular in recent years. The movie,\\"Meet the Fockers\\",where the main character teaches his young grandson to sign, makes it well developed. Babies generally begin to talk between 12 and 15 months, but babies can use sign language to communicate before they learn how to speak. \\"We know they are learning language faster than they are able to show you with their speech production because that system takes a long time to develop.\\" says McRoberts, director of developmental research at the Haskins Laboratories. \\"They are understanding words before they are able to say them. From around 16 to 18 months, they might say 50 words but understand 200.They understand short sentences well.\\" says McRoberts.

Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge? Hint: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. The answer is:","completion":"Will learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The given paragraph presents detailed information about the formation and characteristics of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is related to the creation of new seafloor as well as subduction zones. In the given context, Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor, so his area of expertise is directly related to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and its formation processes. Barry would have more knowledge about the geological processes associated with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, such as the spreading of the ocean floor and the characteristics of the oceanic crust in that region. On the other hand, Will is specialized in montology, which is the study of mountains. Although mountains can also be formed due to tectonic processes that happen at the subduction zones or spreading centers, the paragraph emphasizes the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and gives no information about the formation of mountains in that specific region. Thus, Will's expertise in montology would provide him with less knowledge about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge compared to Barry's expertise in subduction zones and new seafloor. In conclusion, based on their areas of specialization, Will learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge than Barry. As Will's expertise revolves around mountains and their formation processes, it does not directly connect him to the geological processes mentioned in the paragraph, while Barry's study of subduction zones and new seafloor places him in a better position to understand and analyze the information given about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a recollection of Paulo 's experiences as he made his way across northern Spain on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela . The novel serves as part adventure story , part guide to self - discovery . - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry.

New Zealand international Luke Ronchi's spectacular 19-ball half-century helped the Foxes reach 183-6 as they won with two balls to spare. Ronchi made 57, backed up by Colin Ackermann's unbeaten 58, off 47 balls. In the South Group, Kent maintained their own quarter-final hopes with a six-wicket win against Somerset. Leicestershire earned their first home win in this season's competition to claim a second North Group victory inside 24 hours. Their previous five wins had come away from Leicester - but going into their final two games, the three-times T20 winners are now one of four clubs on 13 points. They include third-placed Yorkshire, who were powered by half-centuries by Tom Kohler-Cadmore (75 from 40 balls - his best T20 score since arriving from Worcestershire) and Australian Shaun Marsh (60). But the Tykes, lifted by beating rivals Lancashire at Headingley the previous evening, have just one group game left, at home to second-placed Northants on Thursday, and they must win to stand any chance of qualifying. Derbyshire and the Birmingham Bears are the other three sides on 13 points, two behind group leaders Notts Outlaws, who are a point ahead of Northants. Kent's New Zealand paceman Adam Milne claimed a county-best 5-11 as the bottom-of-the-table Spitfires caused an upset in the South Group, beating Somerset by six wickets at Taunton. Milne sent down 15 dot balls from 23 deliveries as the hosts were dismissed for 149 in 18.5 overs. England one-day international Sam Billings then battered an unbeaten 56 from 36 balls as the visitors reached their target with nine deliveries to spare, to inflict Somerset's first home defeat in this year's competition. \\"We have a really good record here at Taunton,\\" Billings told BBC Radio Bristol. \\"The guys love playing on this square. That's eight wins on the trot for us here. \\"The dismissal of James Hildreth was a key moment and Adam Milne weighed into the tail after that.

In 1765, Thomson paid a visit to Cooper's grave, which is an event that occurred five years after Cooper's death. 2. If we subtract five years from the date of Thomson's visit (1765), we can determine the year Cooper died. Thus, Cooper passed away in 1760 (1765 - 5 = 1760). Taking these conclusions into account, the statement \\"Cooper had been dead for five years\\" would indeed be accurate, as it corresponds with the information provided.

Many early 19th-century neoclassical architects were influenced by the drawings and projects of Étienne-Louis Boullée and Claude Nicolas Ledoux. The many graphite drawings of Boullée and his students depict spare geometrical architecture that emulates the eternality of the universe. There are links between Boullée's ideas and Edmund Burke's conception of the sublime. Ledoux addressed the concept of architectural character, maintaining that a building should immediately communicate its function to the viewer: taken literally such ideas give rise to \\"architecture parlante\\". The baroque style had never truly been to the English taste. Four influential books were published in the first quarter of the 18th century which highlighted the simplicity and purity of classical architecture: Vitruvius Britannicus (Colen Campbell 1715), Palladio's Four Books of Architecture (1715), De Re Aedificatoria (1726) and The Designs of Inigo Jones... with Some Additional Designs (1727). The most popular was the four-volume Vitruvius Britannicus by Colen Campbell.

But even today, teachers are role models for students. Teaching is still a respectable job. But there are great changes in the education system. One of the most obvious changes is that the influence of Western culture has increased. We are paying too much attention to doing business, just like the Western world. Teachers are likely to to be influenced by this too, but it is not good. Teachers are nation builders. The development of any country depends upon its education system. All types of development are possible through education. Another change has happened in the curriculum . The curriculum connects the teacher and the student.

Julian Paul Assange (; ne Hawkins; born 3 July 1971) is an Australian computer programmer and the editor of WikiLeaks. Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006, but came to international attention in 2010, when WikiLeaks published a series of leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). Following the 2010 leaks, the federal government of the United States launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and asked allied nations for assistance. Assange was born in Townsville, Queensland, to Christine Ann Hawkins (b. 1951), a visual artist, and John Shipton, an anti-war activist and builder. The couple had separated before Assange was born. When he was a year old, his mother married Richard Brett Assange, an actor, with whom she ran a small theatre company. They divorced around 1979. Christine Assange then became involved with Leif Meynell, also known as Leif Hamilton, a member of Australian cult The Family, with whom she had a son before the couple broke up in 1982. Assange had a nomadic childhood, and had lived in over thirty Australian towns by the time he reached his mid-teens, when he settled with his mother and half-brother in Melbourne, Victoria. He attended many schools, including Goolmangar Primary School in New South Wales (1979-1983) and Townsville State High School, as well as being schooled at home. He studied programming, mathematics, and physics at Central Queensland University (1994) and the University of Melbourne (2003-2006), but did not complete a degree. While in his teens, Assange married a woman named Teresa, and in 1989 they had a son, Daniel Assange, now a software designer. The couple separated and initially disputed custody of their child. Assange was Daniel's primary caregiver for much of his childhood. In an open letter to French President Francois Hollande, Assange stated his youngest child lives in France with his mother. He also said that his family had faced death threats and harassment because of his work, forcing them to change identities and reduce contact with him.

Is it true that did they wear tie dye in the 70s based on the following text? Unlike regular resist-dyeing techniques, tie-dye is characterized by the use of bright, saturated primary colors and bold patterns. These patterns, including the spiral, mandala, and peace sign, and the use of multiple bold colors, have become cliched since the peak popularity of tie-dye in the 1960s and 1970s. The vast majority of currently produced tie-dyes use these designs, and many are mass-produced for wholesale distribution. However, a new interest in more 'sophisticated' tie-dye is emerging in the fashion industry, characterized by simple motifs, monochromatic color schemes, and a focus on fashionable garments and fabrics other than cotton.

China is facing its worst wave of labour unrest since a series of wildcat strikes at Japanese-owned car plants last year, as declining export orders force factories to reduce worker pay. More than 10,000 workers in Shenzhen and Dongguan, two leading export centres in southern Guangdong province, have gone on strike over the past week. The latest protests broke out on Tuesday at a Taiwanese computer factory in Shenzhen. \\"There has been an intensification of labour unrest in the past week that is probably the most significant spike in unrest since the summer of 2010,\\" said Geoffrey Crothall of China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based labour advocacy group that monitors unrest in China. The strikes come amid mounting concerns about the global economy, which is suffering from the European sovereign debt crisis and a weak recovery in the US. Fears about the Chinese economy grew on Wednesday after a manufacturing index compiled by HSBC fell to levels not seen since March 2009. Last week, Guangdong's acting governor said the province's exports dropped 9 per cent in October from the previous month. Provincial leaders are also contending with widespread protests by farmers over land seizures. On Monday nearly 5,000 residents in the town of Wukan marched on government offices in a peaceful protest. Factories are cutting the overtime that workers depend on to supplement their modest base salaries, after a drop in overseas orders. According to CLB, the average basic wage for electronic workers is about Rmb1,500 (236) a month, but rises to Rmb2,500 with overtime. \\"Their basic wage is never enough on its own without overtime,\\" Mr Crothall said. Tuesday's protests followed a bigger demonstration last week at a shoe factory in Dongguan that supplies footwear to Nike and Adidas. About 7,000 workers at the Taiwanese factory, owned by Pou Chen, objected to a cut in their overtime and management's decision to shift some work to other factories in the Chinese hinterland and Vietnam, where labour costs are lower. \\"We were forced to return to the factory,\\" one worker told the Financial Times. \\"But we just sit there. No one is operating machines.\\" The worker, who did not want to be identified, said the local government had taken a tough stance during negotiations and sided with the management. With additional reporting by Zhou Ping. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"China is experiencing a significant increase in labor unrest as declining export orders cause factories to cut worker pay.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Sheep Smarter than Thought London--Sheep, like turkeys and ostriches, are not considered the most clever animals. British scientists said last Wednesday humans may have underestimated the woolly creature. They could be much smarter than we think. Researchers at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge, southern England, have shown that the animals have a good memory system and are extremely good at recognizing faces--which they think is a sure sign of intelligence. Behavioral scientist Keith Kendrick and his friends trained 20 sheep to recognize and distinguish 25 pairs of sheep faces and used electrodes to measure their brain activity , which showed they could remember 50 faces for up to two years . \\"If they can do that with faces, they have to have reasonable intelligence; otherwise, what is the point of having a system for remembering faces and not remembering anything else?\\" Kendrick said in an interview. So hours of seemingly mindless eating grass may not be so mindless after all. Kendrick believes sheep got their reputation as dumb (unable to speak, unintelligent) animals because they live in large groups and do not appear to have much individuality and are frightened of just about everything. \\"All animals, including humans, once they are frightened, don't tend to show signs of intelligent action,\\" he explained. In research reported in the science journal Nature, Kendrick and his team showed that sheep, like humans, have a specialized system in the brain which allows them to distinguish between many different faces which look extremely similar. \\"The most important finding (of the study) is that they are able , both from a behavioral point of view and from looking at the way the brain is organized , to remember a large number of individuals for a very long time,\\" said Kendrick. \\"It is a very strange system. They are showing similar abilities in many ways to humans.\\" Options: A sheep are among the week animals B it is not right for people to raise sheep in groups C when sheep eat grass in the field their minds may be active D if people feel frightened, they may become braver Answer: C when sheep eat grass in the field their minds may be active Question: Answer:","completion":"Based on the article, which statement is true about sheep and their intelligence?

Tuxedos are often worn with a bow tie and a cummerbund or a waistcoat. A normal suit is a bit more casual and can be worn for different events like business meetings, weddings, or parties.

Choices: - two - seven - four - three A: Answer:","completion":"The body contains three types of muscle tissue. These are: 1. Skeletal muscle: These are the muscles attached to bones by tendons, and they help in body movement through contraction and relaxation. Skeletal muscle fibers are long, cylindrical, and multinucleated, with a striped (striated) appearance. They are also known as voluntary muscles because we can consciously control their movements. 2. Smooth muscle: Found in the walls of internal organs such as the intestines, blood vessels, and stomach, smooth muscles help in maintaining normal functioning (such as pushing food through the digestive tract or constricting blood vessels to regulate blood flow). Smooth muscle fibers are spindle-shaped, non-striated, and have one central nucleus. They are also called involuntary muscles because their movements are not under conscious control. 3. Cardiac muscle: This muscle type is found only in the heart and is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. Cardiac muscle fibers are also striated, but they are branched and have one or two nuclei. Cardiac muscles work involuntarily and are capable of rhythmic contractions without external stimulation or fatigue. So, the correct answer is three types of muscle tissue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I normally do not post certain types of things on my blog or on social media, like political messages, but today I feel compelled.

I am so angry it makes me cry and for those of you out there who know me, angry-cry is the end-stage, top-of-the-gauge level of angry for me. I am angry that as a nation, we continue to wring our hands and bemoan each mass shooting but we don’t take any action to stop the next one. I am angry that our elected officials have failed us in the most spectacular way possible by being unable to work together or to set aside special interests to protect the lives and safety of Americans, including our most vulnerable citizens, our children. I am angry that time and time again, we the people and our elected officials weigh the value of human lives against countless other things (Second Amendment, special interests, party disagreements, inertia, whatever) and the value of human life comes up short in the calculations. I am angry at myself for believing at any point in the last several years that I could trust lawmakers to address this epidemic and I am angry at myself for feeling so helpless that I have not personally taken action.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Quiet Man Context: Sean and Mary Kate In the 1920s, Sean Thornton (John Wayne), an Irish-born American from Pittsburgh, travels to Ireland to reclaim his family's farm and his birthplace in Inisfree. He meets and falls in love with the fiery Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), the sister of the bullying, loud-mouthed landowner Squire \\"Red\\" Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen). Danaher, who had wanted the farm himself, is angry that the Widow Tillane (herself angered by Danaher's admission that he had discussed her in the local pub) accepts Sean's bid, and retaliates by refusing consent for his sister to marry. Several town locals, including the Catholic priest, Father Lonergan (Ward Bond), conspire to trick him into believing that the wealthy Widow Tillane (Mildred Natwick) wants to marry him, but only if Mary Kate is no longer living in his house. After learning the truth on Sean and Mary Kate's wedding day, an enraged Will refuses to give his sister her dowry which is made up of a large sum of money and her family possessions passed down from her mother. Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, cares nothing about the dowry, but to Mary Kate the dowry represents her independence, identity, and pride. She feels passionately and intensely that the dowry is hers and is needed to validate her marriage to Sean. Angered and shamed by Sean's refusal to confront her brother and demand what is legally hers, she brands him a coward, and, despite living together, they are quickly estranged as husband and wife. In the morning they find that others in the village had visited Will and pressured him to return Mary Kate's furniture, but not her money. Sean had been a boxer in the United States, a heavyweight challenger known as \\"Trooper Thorn\\". After accidentally killing an opponent in the ring, Sean hung up his gloves, vowing never to fight again. This is known to only one person in the village, the Church of Ireland minister, the Rev. Playfair (Arthur Shields), who once upon a time had been the lightweight champion and so understands Thornton's... Answer:","completion":"In the movie The Quiet Man, Sean Thornton, played by John Wayne, is an Irish-born American who returns to Ireland to reclaim his family's farm in Inisfree. Sean falls in love with Mary Kate Danaher, portrayed by Maureen O'Hara, and eventually marries her despite opposition from her brother, Squire \\"Red\\" Will Danaher. The crux of the issue revolves around Mary Kate's dowry, which her brother Will refuses to give her. The dowry consists of a large sum of money and her family possessions, which are of great importance to Mary Kate as they represent her independence, identity, and pride. Sean, who is not familiar with Irish customs, initially does not care about the dowry, causing a rift between him and Mary Kate. However, after a series of events including pressure from the village people, Will returns Mary Kate's furniture but keeps the money. Sean was once a professional boxer known as \\"Trooper Thorn\\" and had quit boxing after accidentally killing an opponent in the ring. Only the Church of Ireland minister, Rev. Playfair, knows about Sean's past as a boxer. Towards the end of the movie, Sean confronts Will Danaher to resolve the issue once for all. Sean drags Will to the town where he forcibly takes the money from him and pours it into a stove in front of the entire village. This act is a powerful statement by Sean that emphasizes the importance of love, pride, and respect over material possessions. It ultimately earns him the respect and admiration of the community, but more importantly, it reconciles him with his wife Mary Kate. In the end, Sean shows that it is not the money itself that matters, but the principle behind it, demonstrating his commitment to Irish customs and his wife's values. So, to answer the question: Sean uses the money to prove a point about the importance of respect, love, and dignity, reconciling with his wife and earning the community's respect by pouring the money into a stove in front of everyone."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph 1: The impact of backing Trump early on Step 1: Discuss the advantages gained by early Trump supporters on Capitol Hill. Trump's early backers on Capitol Hill have seen their political careers and national recognition flourish thanks to their unwavering support for the former president. Some have landed influential committee positions, while others have increased their media presence and overall political influence. Paragraph 2: High-profile early supporters Step 1: Mention key Trump supporters in Congress Some of the high-profile early supporters on Capitol Hill include Senator Lindsey Graham, Representatives Jim Jordan, and Matt Gaetz, who have gained considerable political clout and notoriety as a result of their allegiance to Trump. Step 2: Discuss how their profiles have been raised These legislators have been prominently featured in the media and have developed large followings both in their home states and across the country. They have also received increased campaign donations and political support, which have bolstered their positions within the Republican Party. Paragraph 3: The impact on the Republican Party Step 1: Explain how these rising profiles have affected the party The elevation of Trump's early backers on Capitol Hill has demonstrated how the Republican Party has shifted more towards Trumpism, embracing his policies and rhetoric. This has deepened divisions within the party, with traditional Republicans being pitted against a more populist and nationalist faction. Step 2: Highlight party tensions These tensions came to a head during the January 6th insurrection, with pro-Trump politicians being criticized and even being threatened with censure by members of their own party. Despite these pressures, many of these early supporters have doubled down on their loyalty, maintaining their profile and further highlighting fractures within the GOP. Conclusion: The future of Trump's early backers Step 1: Discuss potential future trajectories The future of Trump's early backers on Capitol Hill will largely depend on the overall direction of the Republican Party. Should the party continue to embrace Trumpism, these politicians may continue to benefit from their allegiance and further consolidate their power and influence. Step 2: Address potential shifts in the political landscape Alternatively, if the GOP shifts course and distances itself from Trump, these early backers may see their profiles diminished as the party looks to move in a new direction. Only time will tell how the political landscape will evolve, but it is clear that the early support for Trump has had a significant impact on the careers and profiles of these politicians."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Asks Rich Nations for Support WASHINGTON — The International Monetary Fund, showing heightened concern over a slowing world economy, said on Tuesday that cash-rich countries like Germany needed to step up large public investments to help keep the flagging global recovery on track. The comments — from the fund’s managing director and its lead economist — reflect growing concerns within the I.M.F. that Germany, which recently passed China as the country with the largest trade surplus in the world, is not doing enough to spur growth in Europe. At a news conference at the start of its semiannual meeting, an event that attracts financiers, policy makers and central bankers from around the globe, the fund’s top economists highlighted a shift in the global economy in which many major nations are failing to keep up with what is still a relatively modest recovery in the United States. In an interview on Friday, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the fund, said global growth risked being stuck in a rut for a long time. “If nothing gets done in a bold way, there is a risk of a new mediocre” level of growth for the global economy, she said. And she took note that Germany could do more to stoke growth in Europe. “Given Germany’s current position, it could certainly spend more on infrastructure,” she said. The fund’s growth worries were underscored on Tuesday when Germany said that orders for industrial goods in August shrank by the largest amount since 2009, plunging 4 percent on a month-over-month basis. For investors, the warnings in the I.M.F. forecast and the report from Germany helped send the broad stock market down sharply on Tuesday, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index falling 1.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq each fell about 1.6 percent. The I.M.F. brought its estimate for global growth this year down to 3.3 percent from 3.7 percent and reduced its forecast for 2015 to 3.8 percent. The fund pointed to weaker growth in China, Europe, Japan and Latin America — Brazil in particular — as the main culprits behind the broad retrenchment. Germany’s growth forecast for 2014 was cut sharply to 1.4 percent from 1.9 percent. Its estimate for United States growth in 2015, 3.1 percent, outpaces all major industrialized countries and exceeds as well a number of emerging markets, which in theory are supposed to grow at a substantially more rapid clip. The assessment reflected a broad acceptance by global investors that, at least for the near future, the United States economy was set to advance ahead of many large economies, not just in terms of growth but also in corporate profitability and international competitiveness. As a result, large investors and central banks have become aggressive purchasers of the dollar, betting that the currency will keep rising in value against the euro, the yen and the wobbly currencies of countries like Russia, Brazil and Turkey. Economists have been warning for some time now that a situation in which the American economy becomes the prime engine for the global recovery brings with it significant risks by creating financial uncertainty in emerging markets as currencies weaken and capital flows reverse. “At this stage, the question is, can the U.S. continue to power along while the rest of the world acts as a drag on global growth,” said Eswar Prasad, a professor of international finance at Cornell University and the author of a recent book on the dollar. “This is a very unbalanced recovery.” Fund economists expect annual growth in the eurozone of just 0.8 percent, with inflation coming in at 0.9 percent — a figure that Ms. Lagarde raised pointed concerns about. “We’ve been warning for over a year now about persistent low inflation, and frankly we faced a bit of denial — everyone said we don’t need to think about it,” she said. “But now it’s there.” The fund unveiled this week a paper arguing that large-scale infrastructure investments, if properly undertaken, could bring relatively quick growth benefits — a message that seemed to be directed at deficit-obsessed eurozone governments, including Germany. “Infrastructure investment, even if debt-financed, may well be justified,” Olivier Blanchard, the fund’s senior economist, said at the news conference on Tuesday. And while he did not mention Germany by name, he left little doubt to whom he was broadly referring. “Eurozone countries should be ready to do more,” Mr. Blanchard said. Mr. Blanchard pointed out that with interest rates at modern-day lows — Germany can borrow money for 10 years at below 1 percent — taking on extra debt to stimulate the economy need not be seen as profligacy. He offered up a brief economic primer to underscore his point. “It is an irony of macroeconomics,” he said with a small smile, “that for countries with too much debt, sometimes the solution is to create more debt.” Mr. Blanchard, who oversees economic research at the I.M.F., was behind the fund’s public recognition two years ago that heavy-handed austerity policies in Europe had a larger-than-expected impact on economic growth. Now, it seems, the global watchdog seems to be going one step further by urging eurozone officials to relax their rigid austerity measures. Both Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Blanchard also made it clear that they had their doubts about the two-year bull run in eurozone government bonds. Ms. Lagarde, in the interview, said that there was a “disconnect between what’s happening in markets and, on the other hand, progress in the real economy.” Mr. Blanchard said that the markets “were too complacent” and that policy makers should be especially watchful. “The risk is there,” he cautioned. The tough tone may well reflect a sense within the fund that this time around it needs to be more forceful in warning of financial trouble spots before it is too late. The I.M.F. was criticized for not spotting the last financial crisis. It has responded by recently publishing a series of papers outlining how it might improve on its watchdog capabilities. The fund has repeatedly cautioned that investors have become too reliant on very loose monetary policies on the part of global central banks to bolster their returns. Wholesale purchases of bonds by monetary authorities have inflated equity and bond markets in countries around the world where investments were minimal and growth subpar, economists for the fund said in the report. The warning echoes a rising chorus from economists and regulators who say that when the Federal Reserve in the United States starts raising interest rates — expected to begin in 2015 — so-called hot money flows that sought out high-yielding but risky returns in Europe and in emerging markets, including China, will head for safer shores. A consequence could be a broad disruption in financial markets, similar to but greater in scope than the market spasm that hit markets in the developing world earlier this year.

They are especially asking Germany to spend more money on things like roads and bridges, which will help Europe as a whole. The IMF is worried that many countries are not growing as quickly as they should, and they think that the United States cannot solve this problem all by itself. So they are encouraging other countries to spend money and grow their economies, too."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Whose wife is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India?, using the article: In an American suburb in Northern New Jersey, conservative, middle-aged Indian immigrant Gopal, a telephone-company engineer who has taken early retirement, is celebrating Diwali in November with his wife and grown daughter. His daughter suddenly tells him that she is leaving indefinitely to teach English in Mongolia with her German boyfriend. As Gopal recovers from this shock and tries to talk her out of it, largely on the grounds that she will be living in sin in his eyes, his wife Madhu announces that she is leaving him as well, and is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India. Confused, mortified, bored, and directionless, newly single Gopal lies to his few Indian-American acquaintances about the situation, and refuses to answer his daughter's phone calls from Mongolia. He tries to cope with his emptiness by redecorating slightly, searching through the various corners of his small house, reading newspapers, and watching videos of Bollywood romance extravaganza films. Desperately lonely, he latches upon a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine that had belonged to his daughter, and takes a quiz gauging a man's suitability for a relationship – which reveals that he is a \\"Ditchable Dude\\". In the midst of his distress and his Bollywood fantasies, Gopal's eccentric neighbor, the oddly attractive divorcée Mrs. Shaw – whom he had previously thought of as loose-moralled (because of her one-night stands) and slovenly – appears at his door asking to borrow one of his rakes. This sets off a whole new set of fantasies on his part. A few nights later Gopal sees her on her porch nursing a drink, and after a tentative conversation, asks her to have Thanksgiving dinner with him at home the next day. While cleaning and straightening for the date, Gopal finds several more of his daughter's Cosmopolitans, and reads several articles on \\"What women want\\" from a man – evidently it is for them to \\"listen, listen, listen\\"., what would be the answer ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan, (nee Miller; 15 September 1890 - 12 January 1976) was an English writer. She is known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections, particularly those revolving around her fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. Christie also wrote the world's longest-running play, a murder mystery, The Mousetrap, and six romances under the name Mary Westmacott. In 1971 she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature. Christie had long been a fan of detective novels, having enjoyed Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White and The Moonstone, as well as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's early Sherlock Holmes stories. She wrote her own detective novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring Hercule Poirot, a former Belgian police officer noted for his twirly large \\"magnificent moustaches\\" and egg-shaped head. Poirot had taken refuge in Britain after Germany invaded Belgium. Christie's inspiration for the character stemmed from real Belgian refugees who were living in Torquay and the Belgian soldiers whom she helped treat as a volunteer nurse in Torquay during the First World War. Agatha began working on The Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1916, writing most of it on Dartmoor. Her original manuscript was rejected by such publishing companies as Hodder and Stoughton and Methuen. After keeping the submission for several months, John Lane at The Bodley Head offered to accept it, provided that Christie change the ending. She did so, and signed a contract which she later felt was exploitative. It was finally published in 1920. Christie, meanwhile, settled into married life, giving birth to her only child, daughter Rosalind Margaret Hicks, in August 1919 at Ashfield, where the couple spent much of their time, having few friends in London. Archie left the Air Force at the end of the war and started working in the City financial sector at a relatively low salary, though they still employed a maid. Christie's second novel, The Secret Adversary (1922), featured a new detective couple Tommy and Tuppence, again published by The Bodley Head. It earned her PS50. A third novel again featured Poirot, Murder on the Links (1923), as did short stories commissioned by Bruce Ingram, editor of The Sketch magazine. In order to tour the world promoting the British Empire Exhibition, the couple left their daughter Rosalind with Agatha's mother and sister. They travelled to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii. They learned to surf prone in South Africa; then, in Waikiki, they were among the first Britons to surf standing up.

Does the sentence \\"It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.\\" answer the question \\"What polymer is a major part of wood?\\"","completion":"No, the sentence \\"It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period\\" does not answer the question \\"What polymer is a major part of wood?\\" The statement refers to the evolutionary history of land plants rather than the composition of wood. A more appropriate answer to the question \\"What polymer is a major part of wood?\\" would be: Lignin is a complex organic polymer that is considered a major constituent of wood, along with cellulose and hemicellulose. Lignin is responsible for the rigid structure and strength of wood, making it an essential component in the plant cell walls of woody plants. Wood is primarily composed of three main polymers: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Cellulose is a long chain of glucose molecules that interweave to form strong microfibrils. These microfibrils are embedded in a matrix of hemicellulose, which is a more heterogeneous polymer built from a variety of sugar molecules, including xylose, mannose, and galactose, among others. The cellulose-hemicellulose matrix provides wood with its flexibility and resistance to being compressed. Lignin is the other major component of wood, accounting for 15-40% of its dry weight, depending on the plant species and the part of the plant being analyzed. It is a complex, three-dimensional polymer that is primarily composed of three phenylpropane-type monomers called p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) units. The monomer units are arranged in different proportions and structures, resulting in a variation of lignin structure among plant species. Lignin plays a crucial role in the vascular system of plants, conferring mechanical support and protection to the plant cell walls, as well as waterproofing in the form of lignified xylem vessels. By encasing the cellulose fibers and forming covalent bonds with hemicellulose, lignin contributes to the overall strength and rigidity of the plant cell walls and helps maintain the upright growth of land plants. In summary, lignin is a major polymer found in wood, providing essential mechanical support and structural stability. Together with cellulose and hemicellulose, these polymers contribute to the unique hardness, flexibility, and resistance of wood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds. From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat. While Rahmat does not express herself verbally at all, over time she seems to respond to this love. During a surprise visit of the labour inspectors, they find themselves face to face with Rahmat. She panics and runs away, as they chase her through the city streets. Lateef runs after them, struggling with the inspectors while Rahmat flees. Lateef is beaten and taken to the police station.

Answer the above question based on the context below: BookWars is a creative documentary which is told in an unconventional, narrative style. The film opens with the narrator (who is also the film's director) driving out West along a desert highway, relating to the audience his previous experiences as a streetside bookseller in New York City. The entire documentary – including the central events involving his experiences among the street booksellers in New York – is thus \\"told\\" as a long conversation. The narrator describes his post-graduation years in New York, and how he ended up at one point virtually penniless. Driven by a desperate need to pay the rent, he resorts to wheeling his own books out to the street to try to sell them. He reveals that he was not only successful in making a significant amount of cash on that first day, but he has also met a variety of interesting and strange characters of the streets of New York – including other street booksellers. A motley assortment of street booksellers on West 4th street, in Greenwich Village, New York City, are first introduced. Among them: \\"Slick\\" Rick Sherman, a semi-professional magician; Al Mappo, so named because he only sells maps and atlases; Emil, who says only he \\"escaped\\", though we do not know from where; and Pete Whitney: King of the booksellers, toad collector, and collage artist. BookWars next introduces another group of street booksellers who hawk their trade on nearby 6th Avenue. Mainly black and minority individuals, they ply books and magazines in parallel fashion to the nearby West 4th street booksellers, who are primarily white. The booksellers on 6th Avenue suffer greater exposure to the law, with many claiming this to be due to racial profiling. Some of the significant personalities that are introduced on 6th Avenue include: Marvin, always wearing his trademark black hat; and Ron, from Jamaica – charismatic, streetwise and outspoken.

Which type of energy in gasoline is transformed into mechanical energy in a motorcycle engine? Options are: --chemical. --nuclear. --magnetic. --electrical.","completion":"The type of energy in gasoline that is transformed into mechanical energy in a motorcycle engine is chemical energy. Gasoline, as a type of fuel, stores chemical energy. The elements such as carbon and hydrogen in gasoline have bonds that hold a significant amount of potential energy. This chemical energy is released when the gasoline is combusted or burned in a controlled environment like an engine. Let's go through the process in detail to appreciate how chemical energy in gasoline is transformed into mechanical energy in a motorcycle engine. 1. Intake stroke: The cycle begins when the piston in the engine moves down, which allows a mixture of fuel (gasoline) and air to be drawn into the cylinder. 2. Compression stroke: As the piston moves upwards, it compresses the fuel-air mixture, which increases its potential energy. 3. Power stroke (combustion phase): The spark plug ignites the compressed fuel-air mixture. This ignition causes the gasoline to combust, resulting in a mini explosion. The chemical energy stored in the gasoline is released in the form of heat and light, thus transforming into thermal energy. 4. Expansion: The explosion from the combustion drastically increases the gas pressure in the cylinder, which forces the piston to move down. This movement of the piston transforms the thermal energy into mechanical energy, which is then used to move the crankshaft connected to the wheels of the motorcycle, making the bike move forward. 5. Exhaust Stroke: After the power stroke, the piston moves up again, pushing the exhaust gases (a by-product of combustion) out of the cylinder. 6. The cycle repeats with a new intake of gasoline and air mixture, thus continuing the transformation of chemical energy into mechanical energy. So, amongst the options given -- chemical, nuclear, magnetic, and electrical energy -- it's the chemical energy in gasoline that is converted into mechanical energy in a motorcycle engine. Nuclear energy is not involved in such small-scale combustions, magnetic energy does not play a direct role in the energy conversion in this case, and electrical energy is used mainly for creating sparks via the spark plug for combustion and to operate other electrical components of a motorcycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hostilities emerged when, in 1867, Bahrain arrested a Qatari Bedouin in the Qatari mainland and deported him to Bahrain. In response, the Qataris, led by the Naim tribe, defeated the Bahraini army that was based on the peninsula, effectively expelling them. These tensions led Bahrain, allied with Abu Dhabi, to attack Qatar. The conflict failed to pacify and resulted in an escalation between the two parties in the following year. In October 1867, the Bahraini Hakim Mohammed al Khalifa, sent his brother, Ali Al Khalifa, with a force of 500 men in 24 boats to attack Qatar. He was joined by a force of 200 men under Ahmed al Khalifa. Additionally, Bahrain's ally Abu Dhabi sent 2,000 troops in 70 boats. The attack on Qatar led to the sacking of Bida and Wakra. A British record later stated \\"that the towns of Doha and Wakrah were, at the end of 1867 temporarily blotted out of existence, the houses being dismantled and the inhabitants deported\\". A Qatari counterattack followed the next year, resulting in the destruction of most of the Bahraini naval vessels deployed.

The controversy surrounding affirmative action's effectiveness is based on the idea of class inequality. Opponents of racial affirmative action argue that the program actually benefits middle- and upper-class African Americans and Hispanic Americans at the expense of lower-class European Americans and Asian Americans. This argument supports the idea of class-based affirmative action. America's poor is disproportionately made up of people of color, so class-based affirmative action would disproportionately help people of color. This would eliminate the need for race-based affirmative action as well as reducing any disproportionate benefits for middle- and upper-class people of color.

The original sentence provided only states that a memorial, the Lorelei Fountain, was created in tribute to Heinrich Heine and is based on one of his well-known works from 1838. To answer the question of when Heinrich Heine died, a little more context and information is required. Heinrich Heine was a renowned German poet, journalist, and literary critic. He was born on December 13, 1797, in Düsseldorf, Germany, and his writings are remembered for their lyricism and wit. His poetry and prose were influential in shaping German literature in the 19th century, as well as furthering the Romantic movement. Heine's life was marked with political and social controversy, as he was an outspoken advocate for political and artistic freedom. Many of his writings centered on themes of individuality, freedom, and love. He was of Jewish origin, and although he later converted to Protestantism, his heritage led to persecution and censorship during his lifetime. This also resulted in his works being targeted by the Nazis in the following century. Heinrich Heine's health began to decline in the mid-1840s, and he eventually suffered from what is now believed to be a form of multiple sclerosis. As his health worsened, he became bedridden and dependent on his wife and friends for care. He continued to write until near the end of his life, though the quality of his later works is regarded as inferior to his earlier compositions. Heine died on February 17, 1856, in Paris, France. His death came after years of suffering from his debilitating illness. In accordance with his wishes, Heine was buried at the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris. His grave is inscribed with a line from one of his own poems: \\"Wo man begräbt den Dichter dort / Entsteht aus seinem Grabe Hort\\" (Where one buries the poet there / Springs from his grave a treasure). This engraving speaks to the lasting legacy of his works and the idea that a poet's true value is revealed after their death."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Review: peter mattei 's love in the time of money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"The movie review sentence for Peter Mattei's \\"Love in the Time of Money\\" can be considered a mix of both positive and negative elements. On the positive side, the review points out that the film sets itself apart from others, suggesting that it has a unique or original quality to it. The reviewer also mentions that the film's chain of relationships comes full circle, which implies that the plot is well-designed and thought-out. Additionally, the mention of a positive ending, despite being tragic, shows appreciation for the emotional impact that the film has on its audience. However, there are also negative aspects in this review. The mention of a tragic ending indicates that the film has a somber or potentially upsetting conclusion. This can be seen as a negative point, depending on the viewer's preferences. The fact that the positive note comes with a tragic specification creates a sense of mixed feelings about the movie's resolution.

Banned: Asma al-Assad, can no longer travel or shop in the EU comes as diplomats try to crank up pressure on her husband to end a bloody crackdown on popular unrest. Her days of shopping in the EU for the president's palace are over, as ministers have decided the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is no longer welcome. The ban on travel and shopping in the EU, will come as a blow to Asma al-Assad, whose love of pricey purchases has been well documented in the past few weeks in leaked emails. They detailed Asma placing an order for £10,000 worth of candlesticks, concern over getting hold of a new chocolate fondue set from Amazon, and swapping details with friends of crystal-encrusted designer shoes costing nearly £4,000. The announcement comes as diplomats try to crank up pressure on his government to end a bloody crackdown on popular unrest. Her name is now among 12 people added to the sanctions list, which already includes her husband. The list will be released over the weekend, but diplomats confirmed the list includes Mr. Assad's mother, sister as well. They said that Mr. Assad's 36-year-old wife would be subject to the EU's asset freeze and banned from traveling to all EU member states except the U.K. British authorities will decide whether they prevent her entering the country and a U.K. diplomat said it is premature for a decision on the issue. Speaking ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, EU's foreign policy chief, Baroness Ashton, said sanctions were ''a really important tool.' UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said it was 'very important to increase the pressure on the Syrian regime.' A British-born former investment. banker who had once cultivated an image of a woman inspired by Western. values, Asma al-Assad has become a hate figure for many Syrians. Crackdown: A British-born former investment, Asma al-Assad has become a hate figure for many Syrians.

She. has stood by her husband during a year-long crackdown on popular unrest. in which the U.N. says at least 8,000 people have died. Last week activists released some 3,000 emails they said were from private accounts belonging to Mr Assad and his wife. The messages, which have not been independently verified, suggested Mrs Assad continued to shop online for luxury goods. while Syria descended into bloodshed. She comes across as a shallow. ingenue, focused on internet shopping rather than the horrific plight of. the people she professes to care for. The EU has. responded to Syria's violence with a broad range of sanctions, which. include a ban on Syrian oil imports to Europe and measures against the. Syrian central bank and other companies and state institutions. Foreign. ministers of EU member states are set to agree on a new round of. measures, the bloc's 13th, and impose asset freezes and bans on travel. to the EU against 12 people, include Asma.

A prohibition for European companies to do business with two more Syrian entities is also planned. 'The. text (of sanctions) has gone through,' said one EU diplomat, referring. to an agreement reached by EU envoys in Brussels to a list of new. sanctions. Another diplomat confirmed Assad's wife is included in the. list of sanctioned individuals. The list still needs formal approval. from ministers. It will become public on Saturday when new sanctions are. due to go into effect. Assad himself has been a target since May last year, but sanctions have had little impact on his policies so far. Fighting: A Syrian woman, kisses a soldier from the Free Syrian Army yesterday in front of a destroyed Syrian army forces tank which was attacked during clashes between the Syrian government forces and the Syrian rebels, in Homs. Destruction: A house is destroyed by Syrian government shelling in Rastan town in Homs - the U.N. says at least 8,000 people have died during the crackdown on violence. Violence has intensified in recent weeks as pro-government forces bombard rebel towns and villages, looking to sweep their lightly armed opponents out of their strongholds. The international community has struggled to formulate a joint approach in the face of opposition from Russia and China to any resolution by the U.N. Security Council. Assad absorbed a major diplomatic blow on Wednesday, however, when Russia and China joined the Security Council in voicing support for U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan's bid to end violence that has brought Syria to the brink of civil war. Asma Assad. Asma Assad, 36, (pictured) grew up in Acton, West London where she was known as 'Emma'. She is the daughter of consultant cardiologist Fawaz Akhras and retired diplomat Sahar Otri, both Sunni Muslims. Her parents moved from Syria to London in the Fifties so that her father, who is now based at the Cromwell Hospital and in Harley Street, could get the best possible education and medical training. Asma, who holds dual citizenship,. British and Syrian, was educated at a Church of England school in Ealing. before attending a private girls’ day school - Queen’s College, Harley. Street. From Queen’s,. where she achieved four A-levels, Asma went to King’s College London to. read Computer Science and take a diploma in French Literature. She. graduated with a First and, after six months of travelling, joined. Deutsche Bank as an analyst in hedge-fund management.

His neighborhood is terrorized by a local gang called The Golden Lords, led by Simon Caine and allied with drug lord Anthony Byers. One night, Jeff steps in to rescue a woman from the gang only to end up running from them himself. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, he manages to escape. As he climbs out, he is struck down by a glowing, green meteorite. His spine is crushed and he receives severe burns. A small fragment of the meteor was left over and taken by a vagrant named Marvin. Reed awakens several days later in the hospital, but when his bandages are taken off, he is miraculously healed of all injuries. Jeff soon discovered that the meteorite had left him with spectacular abilities such as flight, x-ray/laser vision, superhuman strength, speed, and hearing, invulnerability, healing powers, the ability to absorb a book's content by touch, super breath, telepathy with dogs (which he uses to communicate with his own dog, Ellington), and telekinesis.

Many people think that in the future computers will be used a lot in everyday's life. It is thought that we won't have to go shopping because we will be able to get most things which are sold in shops on the Internet. There will be fewer books because we will be able to get all texts from computers. The Internet will be used to play games, see films and buy food. Most telephone calls will be made by computers, too. Some people are glad about these new ways of shopping and communicating . Others do not think that computers will replace our old ways. Let's take books for example. Some people think that one day we won't read books made of paper. Instead, we will buy and read books using computers. We will read texts on small pocket computers. The computers will keep many different books in them at the same time. We won't need to turn lots of pages and paper will be saved. Computerized books will be used more and more. Is Internet shopping such a pleasure as going to the shop? Many people say it is not. It is a pleasure to go into shops and look at things you want to buy. It is also unlikely that many people will want to read large texts on our computers. Because paper books will perhaps be more friendly. Maybe computers won't change these two habits .

What is the last name of the person that helps the park ranger find the naturalist in an animal skin? Answer the above question based on the context below: The film opens with military veteran helicopter pilot and guide Don Stober flying individuals above the trees of a vast national park. He states that the woods are untouched and remain much as they did during the time when Native Americans lived there. Two female hikers are breaking camp when they are suddenly attacked and killed by an unseen animal. The national park's chief ranger, Michael Kelly, and photographer Allison Corwin, daughter of the park's restaurant owner, decide to follow a ranger to the primitive campsite to check on the female hikers. There, they discover the mangled corpses of the two girls, one of which has been partially buried. At the hospital, a doctor tells Kelly that the girls were killed by a bear. The park supervisor, Charley Kittridge, blames Kelly for the attacks, saying that the bears were supposed to have been moved from the park by Kelly and naturalist Arthur Scott before the tourist season began. Kelly and Kittridge argue over closing the park, before deciding to move all hikers off the park's mountain while allowing campers to remain in the lowlands. Kelly calls Scott, who tells him that all of the bears are accounted for and this specific bear must be unknown to the forest. During a search of the mountain, a female ranger stops for a break at a waterfall. Deciding to soak her feet, she is unaware that the bear is lurking under the falls, and she is attacked and killed. Kelly recruits the helicopter pilot, Stober, to assist in the search. Flying above the forest, they see what they believe to be an animal, only to discover the naturalist Scott adorned in an animal skin while tracking the bear. He informs them that the animal they are looking for is a prehistoric grizzly bear (a fictional Pleistocene-era Arctodus ursos horribilis) standing at least 15 feet tall and weighing 2,000 pounds. Kelly and Stober scoff at the notion.","completion":"In the context you provided, the last name of the person that helps the park ranger find the naturalist in an animal skin is Stober.

Q: Abstract: Early local tumor invasion in breast cancer results in a likely encounter between cancer cells and mature adipocytes, but the role of these fat cells in tumor progression remains unclear. We show that murine and human tumor cells cocultivated with mature adipocytes exhibit increased invasive capacities in vitro and in vivo, using an original two-dimensional coculture system. Likewise, adipocytes cultivated with cancer cells also exhibit an altered phenotype in terms of delipidation and decreased adipocyte markers associated with the occurrence of an activated state characterized by overexpression of proteases, including matrix metalloproteinase-11, and proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β]. In the case of IL-6, we show that it plays a key role in the acquired proinvasive effect by tumor cells. Equally important, we confirm the presence of these modified adipocytes in human breast tumors by immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. Interestingly, the tumors of larger size and/or with lymph nodes involvement exhibit the higher levels of IL-6 in tumor surrounding adipocytes. Collectively, all our data provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that (i) invasive cancer cells dramatically impact surrounding adipocytes; (ii) peritumoral adipocytes exhibit a modified phenotype and specific biological features sufficient to be named cancer-associated adipocytes (CAA); and (iii) CAAs modify the cancer cell characteristics/phenotype leading to a more aggressive behavior. Our results strongly support the innovative concept that adipocytes participate in a highly complex vicious cycle orchestrated by cancer cells to promote tumor progression that might be amplified in obese patients..

Write an article based on this summary: Two new studies confirm that multiple exploding stars, called supernovae, have showered the Earth with radiation within the last few million years.","completion":"Title: Recent Studies Reveal Supernovae Showered Earth with Radiation Within the Past Few Million Years Introduction A supernova is a massive, energetic explosion of a star that occurs at the end of its life cycle. These extraordinary astral events not only produce brilliant light displays, but also release vast amounts of energy, radiation, and cosmic particles. Intriguingly, scientists have discovered that multiple supernovae have showered the Earth with radiation within the last few million years. Body Two groundbreaking studies have recently confirmed that the Earth has experienced multiple instances of radiation bombardment from the explosion of nearby stars known as supernovae. The findings of these studies offer significant insights into the effects of supernovae on our planet and its environment. 1. Study methodology The two studies each employed a distinct methodology to arrive at their conclusions. The first study analyzed iron-60 isotopes discovered in ocean sediments and ice cores from the Antarctic. Iron-60 is an isotope with a half-life of 2.6 million years and primarily originates from supernovae events. By examining the concentration and distribution of iron-60, researchers were able to deduce the occurrence of supernovae and their impact on Earth in the past. The second study utilized a combination of data from spacecraft and computer simulations to calculate the trajectory of cosmic rays produced by a supernova. This allowed scientists to determine the paths taken by these high-energy particles, as well as their subsequent interaction with the Earth's atmosphere. 2. Timeline of supernova events Combining the findings of both studies, researchers were able to confirm that the Earth has been exposed to radiation from multiple supernovae within the past few million years. Notably, the studies suggest that one such event took place approximately 2.5 million years ago and another more recently, with estimated radiation levels twice those of today's background cosmic radiation. 3. Implications of supernovae on Earth The exposure of Earth to radiation from supernovae has potentially far-reaching consequences for our planet and its environment. High levels of radiation may cause significant ecological disruption, mutations, and extinction events. Moreover, the energy produced by supernovae could have a profound impact on the Earth's climate and overall atmospheric conditions, possibly contributing to major climatic shifts over time. Conclusion The studies' findings that multiple supernovae have showered the Earth with radiation within recent geological time contribute immensely to our understanding of the effects of these cataclysmic events on our planet. Future research will continue to explore the consequences of supernovae on Earth and help unravel the mysteries surrounding these powerful phenomena."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Marie Curie, a renowned Polish-born physicist and chemist, named the element Polonium (Po) after her native land, Poland. Not only was she a trailblazer in radioactivity research, but she also broke numerous barriers for women in science. Curie discovered Polonium as well as another element, Radium (Ra), both of which played a crucial role in the development of modern science and technology. Born as Maria Skłodowska in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, she later moved to Paris to pursue higher education, as women were not allowed to attend university in Poland during that time. In Paris, she enrolled at the Sorbonne University, where she met and married her husband Pierre Curie. Together, they conducted groundbreaking research with significant impacts on the scientific community. The discovery of Polonium occurred in 1898 while Marie Curie was studying the radioactive properties of the mineral pitchblende. Pitchblende, an ore primarily composed of uranium oxide, exhibited higher levels of radioactivity than the uranium content alone could explain. Intrigued by this discrepancy, the Curies developed an analytical process to investigate the presence of any additional radioactive elements in the ore. Through a series of laborious and time-consuming chemical separation procedures, Marie Curie was able to isolate two new radioactive elements – Radium and Polonium. The choice of the name Polonium was a tribute to her homeland, Poland, which at that time was not an independent country. By naming the element after her native country, she aimed to draw attention to the struggles and scientific accomplishments of the Polish people. Polonium is a very rare and highly radioactive metal with the atomic number 84, characterized by its silvery appearance. It has several isotopes, with Polonium-210 being the most prominent. Polonium-210 is a known alpha particle emitter, meaning it releases alpha particles during radioactive decay. Due to its high radioactivity, Polonium has limited practical applications but has been used in specialized research environments, such as nuclear physics and various industrial processes. Marie Curie's determination and hard work in discovering Polonium and Radium laid the foundation for understanding radioactivity and its properties. This ultimately paved the way for significant developments like the establishment of radiography in medical diagnosis, the creation of radiotherapy for cancer treatment, and the harnessing of nuclear energy. Furthermore, Marie Curie's accolades are a testament to her immense contributions to science. She was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize and remains the only person to have received Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields – physics and chemistry. Her unwavering dedication to understanding radioactivity, as well as her choice to honor her native country, Poland, by naming an element after it, truly make her an inspiring figure in history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music. At the 42nd St-Grand Central subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their boombox. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Wilson.

Some types of pine trees used for landscaping include white pine, jack pine and Scotch pine. Ask the seller about growing environments if you live in a different climate or at a different elevation than the location where the seedling was grown. Bare-root pine seedlings must be planted during the late fall and winter, when pine trees are dormant. Container-grown seedlings can be planted at any time, although the hottest summer months will require additional shade and water to prevent dehydration and sun damage. Most seedlings can be kept for several weeks between 35º and 38º F (1.7 – 3.3ºC), but you should check with the seller in case the species you bought has different requirements. Keep the roots damp until you are ready to plant, but refrain from soaking them in water, which could kill them. If the roots form a dense ball, or circle the sides the of the container, carefully rearrange the main root branches so they are more spread out. Some seedlings are sold with a small amount of soil mixture packed around the roots. Try to keep as much of this on the roots as possible while rearranging. Each pine tree should have plenty of open space, with no small plants around its base and no root systems of other trees nearby. Choose a location where the tree will receive direct sunlight during the cooler parts of the day. If you cannot plant a pine tree somewhere with shade on its west side, instructions are included below for creating a sun shade. A mix of sand and loam is best for pine trees, but you should only need to mix in suitable organic mulch such as sphagnum if the soil is a hard clay consistency. Choose an area with well-draining soil. A 1 foot (30 cm) deep hole filled with water should drain easily within 12 hours. If it does not, you may need to install drainage. Do not plant trees when conditions are windy, dry, or above 85ºF (30ºC). The soil should not have standing water or ice on the day you plant, but should not be parched either. The top layer of soil is the highest quality, so fill the bottom few inches (about 10 cm) with topsoil after you dig your hole. Be sure to dig the hole large enough that the roots still fit after you've added the topsoil. Warning: Contact your utility company to discover the location of underground lines before digging any large holes. Try to plant the tree to the same level it was planted in the nursery. If you're unsure, it is better to plant the tree too high than too low. If you’re planting more than one pine tree, be sure to leave at least 10 to 12 feet (3 to 4 m) of spacing so they can grow to mature width without any obstruction. Some varieties of pine may need even more space, like the huge Austrian pine. Although burlap and other biodegradable material can be left on the plant, carefully removing it gives the seedling a better opportunity for growth. Fill the hole again after planting, periodically patting down loose soil with your shovel handle, not with your feet. Fill the hole until it is level with the surrounding soil, or slightly lower if the climate is especially dry, so water can run into the roots. Have an assistant hold the tree upright while you fill the hole if necessary. . Staking pine tree seedlings is only necessary in areas of unusually high wind. If you think the pine tree is in danger of blowing over, use one or two stakes attached by ties or straps, and leave enough room for the tree to sway. Do not loop wire directly over the tree. You may need to provide a sunscreen for your small pine tree by using a tarp or sheet of painted plywood. Planting where there is shade from another tree or a building is also a practical choice. The shade should be on the west side of the tree, which is where the sun is located during the hottest parts of the day.","completion":"This article discusses selecting, planting and caring for pine tree seedlings, with specific tips on ideal growing environments, planting timeframes, soil preparation, spacing requirements, and sun protection to ensure the healthy growth and development of pine trees in landscaping."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: \\"Outtakes Vol 1\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Truman gave the go-ahead to build the hydrogen bomb, also known as the H-bomb or thermonuclear bomb, on January 31, 1950. The decision to develop this powerful weapon was made during the early years of the Cold War, an era marked by an escalating arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Truman's decision was primarily driven by a desire to maintain the United States' military and technological superiority. The H-bomb would become an essential aspect of the United States' nuclear arsenal during the decades that followed. The hydrogen bomb was a significant advancement in nuclear weapon technology. It was designed to be many times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The H-bomb relies on nuclear fusion instead of fission, which is the process used in atomic bombs. The fusion method involves merging atomic nuclei, resulting in an immense release of energy. Truman's decision to authorize the H-bomb development was influenced by several factors. Firstly, the Soviet Union had successfully detonated its first atomic bomb on August 29, 1949, an event known as \\"First Lightning.\\" The American monopoly on nuclear weapons had come to an end, and a desire to maintain a technological advantage over the Soviets became essential for US national security. Secondly, prominent American scientists and policymakers like Edward Teller and Ernest O. Lawrence strongly advocated for the development of the hydrogen bomb. They argued that it was crucial to ensure the United States' security and maintain a strong nuclear deterrent against potential Soviet aggression. Additionally, the international political landscape further contributed to Truman's decision to pursue the H-bomb. The relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union had become increasingly hostile in the years following World War II. Conflicting political ideologies, mutual mistrust, and an international power struggle made the development of powerful weapons like the H-bomb seem more necessary. The United States began constructing its first hydrogen bomb under a top-secret project codenamed \\"Project Ivy.\\" On November 1, 1952, the US conducted its first successful H-bomb test, known as \\"Ivy Mike,\\" on the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The explosion was approximately 500 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Subsequently, the Soviet Union would also develop its own hydrogen bomb, conducting its first successful test in August 1953. Ultimately, Truman's decision to proceed with the development of the hydrogen bomb played a pivotal role in shaping the strategic environment during the Cold War. By authorizing the creation of a more powerful weapon, the United States aimed to maintain its position of power and deter potential threats from the Soviet Union. The hydrogen bomb was a significant step in the nuclear arms race, with both superpowers vying for supremacy and developing ever more destructive weapons."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences.

Works written in Latin during classical times used Classical Latin rather than Vulgar Latin, with very few exceptions (most notably sections of Gaius Petronius' \\"Satyricon\\"). Because of its nonstandard nature, Vulgar Latin had no official orthography. Vulgar Latin is sometimes also called colloquial Latin, or Common Romance (particularly in the late stage).

The property extends to other related geometric objects. - The Romance languages (sometimes called the Romanic languages, Latin languages, or Neo-Latin languages) are the modern languages that evolved from Vulgar Latin between the sixth and ninth centuries and that thus form a branch of the Italic languages within the Indo-European language family. - A noun (from Latin \\"nmen\\", literally meaning \\"name\\") is a word that functions as the name of some specific thing or set of things, such as living creatures, objects, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas. Linguistically, a noun is a member of a large, open part of speech whose members can occur as the main word in the subject of a clause, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition. - The four cardinal directions or cardinal points are the directions of north, east, south, and west, commonly denoted by their initials: N, E, S, W. East and west are at right angles to north and south, with east being in the clockwise direction of rotation from north and west being directly opposite east. Intermediate points between the four cardinal directions form the points of the compass. The intermediate (intercardinal, or ordinal) directions are northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW). Further, the intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal direction is called a secondary-intercardinal direction, the eight shortest points in the compass rose to the right, i.e. NNE, ENE, ESE, and so on. - In linguistics, an adjective (abbreviated ) is a describing word, the main syntactic role of which is to qualify a noun or noun phrase, giving more information about the object signified. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Italic languages are a subfamily of the Indo-European language family, originally spoken by Italic peoples. They include Latin and its descendants (the Romance languages) as well as a number of extinct languages of the Italian Peninsula, including Umbrian, Oscan, Faliscan and South Picene. - East is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from west. - South is a noun, adjective, or adverb indicating direction or geography. It is one of the four cardinal directions or compass points. South is the polar opposite of north and is perpendicular to east and west. - Septentrional , meaning \`\` of the north '' , is a word rarely used in English , but is commonly used in Latin and in the Romance languages . The term septentrional usually is found on maps , mostly those made before 1700 . Early maps of North America often refer to the northern - and northwestern-most unexplored areas of the continent as at the \`\` Septentrional '' and as \`\` America Septentrionalis '' , sometimes with slightly varying spellings . Moreover , the term septentrional , is the adjectival form of the Latin noun septentrion , which refers to the seven stars of the Big Dipper asterism , the Septentrion . - An adverb is a word that modifies a verb, adjective, another adverb, determiner, noun phrase, clause, or sentence. Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as \\"how?\\", \\"in what way?\\", \\"when?\\", \\"where?\\", and \\"to what extent?\\".

Help as much as you can. Normal practice when handling ancient artifacts is to move carefully and minimize any sudden movements. Shaking the object is definitely not encouraged. But that’s exactly what we—a group of museum curators and conservators—did when this exquisite Greek black-glazed kantharos (wine cup) was temporarily removed from display during the reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Getty Villa. One of just a handful of “rattling cups” that survive from the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., we wanted to learn more about how it was made.(1) Although we were eager to find out what was below the surface of the cup, we started by examining its exterior. The kantharos’s distinctive shape, with profiled lip, tall foot, and elegant, upward-sweeping handles, is characteristic of black-glazed pottery made in the second half of the fourth century B.C., and replicates the form of luxury vessels in metal. Although the cup is currently catalogued as South Italian, the shape—and its striking decoration—are also typical of Athenian manufacture, and it may in fact have been produced there.(2) During the fourth century B.C., Athenian pottery was both imported into southern Italy and imitated by local craftsmen. The best South Italian versions were meant to be difficult to distinguish from Athenian examples, and we are continuing to investigate where ours may have been made. A Greek inscription applied in gilt around the rim reads: ΚΑΣΤΟΡΠΟΛΥΔΕΥΙΚΕΣ (“KASTORPOLYDEUIKES”). Kastor and Polydeukes were twin sons of Zeus—known together as the Dioskouroi—and were worshipped as protectors of sailors, horsemen, and chariot racing.(3) The inscription indicates that the kantharos was dedicated to them, perhaps as thanks for—or in hope of—safe passage at sea or a successful race. The gold decoration supports this idea: because each brother split his time between Mt. Olympus and Hades, they were often represented by stars, depicted here beneath the cup’s rim. Further, the wreath, garlands, and bucrania (skulls of... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

We open with a saucer shaped spacecraft drifting across a star filled sky. It stops and hovers, ejects a small sphere which heads to Earth. On a lonely highway at night a truck approaches. The driver, McCrary (Kenneth Alton) smokes and whistles to a tune playing on the radio. Suddenly his radio experiences interference, all of the truck instruments malfunction, and the truck engine quits. He exits the vehicle to check the engine. The sphere loitering nearby transforms into light and electrical energy and possesses McCrary. He gets back in his truck and drives to Lab Central, a government installation. A guard prevents his entrance. McCrary tells the guard he is lost. Distracting the guard, McCrary knocks the guard out with a monkey wrench. He walks into the main building and enters the office of Dr. Hubbell Eliot. Dr. Eliot (John Emery) challenges him asking, \\"Who are you? What are you doing here? You have no business here. How did you get past the guard?\\" McCrary never answers, but the light that possessed him is transferred to Dr. Eliot. McCrary falls to the floor. The injured guard and a maintenance man enter Eliot's office to check on the director.

From the moment my partner and I walked in, we were greeted with warm smiles, stunning decor, and a wonderful atmosphere that set the tone for the rest of the evening. We had reservations for 7 pm, and to our delight, the staff promptly showed us to our table – a cozy corner spot with a gorgeous view of the patio, softly illuminated by romantic string lights. The ambiance was a perfect blend of elegance and comfort, making it an ideal spot for both special occasions and casual gatherings. Our server, Jessica, was nothing short of phenomenal. She was attentive, knowledgeable, and had a contagious enthusiasm that made the dining experience even more enjoyable. She expertly guided us through the menu, answering our questions about ingredients, and offering recommendations based on our taste preferences. We decided to start with the Zesty Crab Cakes and the Mixed Green Salad, both of which were prepared to perfection. The crab cakes were delicately crispy on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside, beautifully complemented by the tangy lemon aioli. The salad was a refreshing medley of locally sourced greens and heirloom tomatoes, all dressed in an addictively delicious honey-ginger vinaigrette. For our main courses, I chose the Herb-Crusted Salmon, and my partner went for the famous Truffle Porcini Risotto. Let me just say – WOW. The salmon was cooked flawlessly, with the most delectable flaky texture, while still retaining its juices. The risotto, rich in its truffle aroma, had a beautifully creamy consistency, generously scattered with tender porcini mushrooms – a true game-changer! To top off the evening, Jessica recommended that we try their signature Chocolate Lava Cake, served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice-cream. The molten center of the cake was sinfully good, and we could not resist finishing every last bite! The wine selection at \\"Flavors of Paradise\\" further enhanced our meal. With a vast array of options from around the world, we opted for a delightful 2017 Pinot Noir, the perfect accompaniment to our exquisite dinner.

Within the blue circle is a white band with the national motto inscribed on it. The motto on the Brazilian flag is \\"Ordem e Progresso,\\" which in English translates to \\"Order and Progress.\\" This phrase is derived from Auguste Comte's motto of Positivism, which is \\"L'amour pour principe et l'ordre pour base; le progrès pour but\\" – in English, this means, \\"Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal.\\" The Brazilian flag was designed by a group of Brazilian artists and intellectuals, and it was adopted as the national flag on November 19, 1889, just a few days after the declaration of the Republic of Brazil on November 15, 1889. The colors and elements on the flag symbolize various aspects of Brazil's history, culture, and geography. The green field represents the House of Braganza, which was the family of Dom Pedro I, the first Emperor of Brazil. The yellow diamond represents the House of Habsburg, which was the family of Empress Maria Leopoldina of Austria, the wife of Dom Pedro I. The blue circle and the stars symbolize the sky over Brazil on the night of November 15, 1889, and the 27 stars represent the 26 states of Brazil and the Federal District. The flag's design has undergone a few modifications over time, primarily to accommodate the addition of new states. The current version of the flag with its 27 stars was adopted on May 11, 1992, when the number of states in Brazil increased. In summary, the phrase \\"Ordem e Progresso\\" on the Brazilian flag reflects the country's commitment to maintaining order and striving towards progress, inspired by the principles of Positivism. The flag as a whole symbolizes Brazil's rich history, culture, and natural beauty, while also expressing the nation's aspirations for a brighter future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer.

DeLay was known to \\"primary\\" Republicans who resisted his votes (i.e., to threaten to endorse and to support a Republican primary challenge to the disobedient representative), and, like many of his predecessors in Congress, used promises of future committee chairmanships to bargain for support among the rank-and-file members of the party. Employing a method known as \\"catch and release\\", DeLay allowed centrist or moderately conservative Republicans to take turns voting against controversial bills. If a representative said that a bill was unpopular in his district, then DeLay would ask him to vote for it only if his vote were necessary for passage; if his vote were not needed, then the representative would be able to vote against the party without reprisal, a practice which has been followed by other party leaders and whips from both sides of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, respectively, when in power. In the 108th Congress, a preliminary Medicare vote passed 216-215, a vote on Head Start passed 217-216, a vote on school vouchers for Washington, D.C., passed 209-208, and \\"Fast track\\", usually called \\"trade promotion authority\\", passed by one vote as well. Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay's ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as \\"growing the vote\\". DeLay was noted for involving lobbyists in the process of passing House bills. One lobbyist said, \\"I've had members pull me aside and ask me to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I've never been asked to work on a bill--at least like they are asking us to whip bills now.\\" His ability to raise money gave him additional influence. During the 2004 election cycle, DeLay's political action committee ARMPAC was one of the top contributors to Republican congressional candidates, contributing over 980,000 in total. Partly as a result of DeLay's management abilities, the House Republican caucus under him displayed unprecedented, sustained party cohesion. On September 30, 2004, the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay because he \\"offered to endorse Representative [Nick] Smith's son in exchange for Representative Smith's vote in favor of the Medicare bill.\\" Answer this question \\"What was he most known for?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"DeLay was most known for his ability to sway the votes of his party and make them follow his decisions, like using \\"catch and release\\" method and involving lobbyists in the process of passing House bills.

What is the first name of the person who explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks?\\" Answer the above question based on the context below: Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation.

It was released as the fifth single from their highly successful second studio album, \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\" in 1996. The song quickly became a fan-favorite and remains one of Oasis's most iconic tracks. Noel Gallagher has stated that he was inspired to write \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" after spending time in Paris with friends. The opening piano phrase is inspired by John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" with Lennon being his idol. In fact, Gallagher memorably starts the song with the evocative line, \\"So, Sally can wait,\\" which is said to be a nod towards The Beatles' song \\"Sexy Sadie.\\" The song also features a melodic guitar solo paying tribute to George Harrison's signature style. Upon its release, \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and contributed to the success of \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\". It has since become a staple of British popular music and an anthem for an entire generation. The song has received international recognition and continues to enjoy airplay on radio stations worldwide. Lyrically, \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" is a message of hope and reassurance. The song touches on themes of nostalgia and the importance of not dwelling on past events, focusing instead on positive aspects of life and moving forward. While its specific inspiration and meaning might remain somewhat ambiguous, \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" encourages listeners to embrace personal growth, let go of regret, and persevere through challenging times. In summary, Noel Gallagher of the band Oasis wrote \\"Don't Look Back in Anger,\\" a song that has become an anthem for resilience and positivity. Far beyond its chart-topping success, the track continues to resonate with fans across generations, providing a timeless message of hope and determination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are several elements in the text that suggest a negative sentiment. The first key word is \\"disaster,\\" which carries a strong negative connotation, implying that something undesirable or harmful must have happened. Moreover, the tweet refers to \\"hopefully last one of the night,\\" which indicates that the user has possibly experienced a series of negative events or \\"disasters\\" throughout the night and is expressing hope that things will get better from this point forward. Additionally, the tweet's ending, \\"just get me there safe!\\" communicates an urgent desire from the user for safety and security amidst their perceived troubles.

Firstly, the reviewer mentions that Chompie's was high on their list of attractions, indicating that they were excited to visit the place. This enthusiasm is further supported by their mention of watching the Jewish Slider Challenge on Man v. Food, which suggests that they already had an interest in the establishment even before visiting. Upon entering Chompie's, the reviewer felt like they were in a Jewish deli/bakery in New York. This demonstrates that the atmosphere and presentation of Chompie's met, or possibly exceeded, their expectations, and they enjoyed the authenticity of the place. Additionally, there is ample praise for the food, with the reviewer mentioning various desserts that they enjoyed as well as their repeated order of the Jewish sliders. The recommendation to order extra gravy for dipping shows that they found this feature particularly enjoyable. Although they found the matzo ball in the soup to be too tough, they still acknowledged its size and continued to appreciate other aspects of Chompie's menu, such as the stuffed cabbage dish. The mention of the waitstaff being nice and attentive also adds to the positive sentiment of the review, as it highlights the overall good experience the reviewer had at Chompie's.

Article: Try to have a pantry week once week a month, in which you do not do any grocery shopping and instead just rely on what's in your pantry. Use leftovers, frozen food, and anything else you can find. You probably have more food than you realized sitting around. You can google recipes that only use the ingredients you have on hand that week. As previously stated, many websites offer you lists of suggestions if you type in the ingredients you have. Some foods can be frozen to increase their shelf life. If a bread item you usually buy, like sourdough bread or bagels, goes on sale you can freeze loaves or packages to increase their shelf life. Bread can last about three months when frozen. Most raw meats can be frozen to increase their shelf life. How long they last depends on the type of meat, but poultry, beef, and pork can last for months frozen. If you're big on seafood, buy pre-frozen seafood in the store rather than fresh cuts. Not only does this cost less, you can stock up on sale items and leave them frozen for a few weeks or months before use. It's okay to buy expensive foods once in awhile. However, choose the items you splurge on wisely. Certain foods may cost slightly more, but this is because they're healthier. Whole wheats, for example, are much healthier than processed wheats. This means you'll end up using less of these items as you'll feel fuller faster and for longer periods. Some organic foods may actually fill you up more. You can experiment with going organic on certain items, usually wheat or grain-based foods, and see if you notice yourself eating less. If so, you might want to try swapping certain foods for the organic variety as you may end up spending less over time.

Question: Given the following context: Gerald Clamson is a bank examiner who loves fishing on his annual two-week holiday. Unfortunately, one day at the ocean he reels in Syd Valentine (also played by Lewis), an injured gangster in a scuba diving suit. Syd tells Gerald about diamonds he has stolen from the other gangsters and hands him a map. Gerald escapes as frogmen from a yacht machine-gun the beach. They swim ashore, locate Syd and gun him down. Their leader Thor ensures Syd's demise by firing a torpedo from his yacht that goes ashore, blowing a crater into the beach. As the police ignore Gerald's story, Gerald heads to the Hilton Inn in San Diego where Syd claimed the diamonds were hidden. There he meets Suzie Cartwright, an airline stewardess. While searching for the diamonds, he needs to avoid the hotel staff after inadvertently hurting the manager. Gerald disguises himself as a character noticeably similar to Professor Julius Kelp from The Nutty Professor, while trying to stay one step ahead of the other gangsters who are on his tail, as well as the hotel detectives led by the manager—all the while courting Suzie. As each of the gangsters see Gerald, an identical lookalike to the deceased Syd, they have nervous breakdowns; one imagining himself a dog, one turning into a Larry Fine lookalike, the other (Charlie Callas, in his usual character) becoming a hopeless stutterer.

Write some highlights for the following article: Springwood teenagers Dean, Kris, Jesse, Nancy and Quentin are having trouble not sleeping: They're knocking back coffee, popping pills, anything to delay another date with their dream stalker (which may explain why these high school students look like college grads). When one of them does drop off, the bedsheets turn red. Wes Craven's 1984 slumber party massacre started from scratch -- it was a low-budget item from what was then a genuine independent studio, New Line -- and became the iconic horror franchise of the decade. With his battered fedora, a striped sweater, a razor-glove and a face like Sal's Famous, Freddy Krueger was the most personable boogie man Hollywood had come up with in a long time, so what if he was also a child abuser? A recurring nightmare who stalked teenagers as they slept, Freddy preyed on the defenseless and played fast and loose with physics: If Salvador Dali had created a slasher movie villain, he might have come up with someone like Freddy. After eight movies, a TV series and a comic book, you might think Mr. Krueger had been done to death. It's been seven years since Freddy put Jason Vorhees in his place (in \\"Freddy vs Jason\\"). But you can't keep a good bad guy down, and at the rate Hollywood is cannibalizing its horror back catalogue, we'll be seeing remakes of the remakes any day now. Directed by pop video director Samuel Bayer and written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer, the new \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" is actually a lot like the old one. So much so, for a while you wonder why they didn't just re-release it. (You'll wish they had.) Surprisingly, Bayer doesn't go the Michael Bay route and give it a high-gloss, ADD tempo, but in duplicating the most memorable bits from the original (the glove in the bath, for instance, and the face coming through the wallpaper), he fails to put his own stamp on it. As Freddy, Jackie Earle Haley, who was Oscar nominated for playing a sex offender in \\"Little Children\\" (and who went on to play Rorschach in \\"Watchmen\\" and the battered psychopath Noyce in \\"Shutter Island\\") finds Robert Englund a tough act to follow. Haley drops his voice an octave and comes on heavy -- this Freddy mostly keeps his quips to himself -- but he's significantly shorter than Englund, and the make-up suggests nothing so much as Ray Bolger in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\": the scarecrow who didn't even scare the crows. iReporter gives new \\"Nightmare\\" an \\"A\\" Branching out tentatively toward something new, the film toys with repressed memory syndrome and the intriguing suggestion that maybe Freddy was innocent; that he has every right to be angry about the lynch mob that incinerated him. I'll leave you to imagine how far the filmmakers go with that radical notion, but maybe a prequel would have been a more rewarding way to go? The new \\"Nightmare\\" also proudly introduces a clinical-sounding term called \\"micro-naps,\\" a side effect of sleep deprivation that handily justifies more shock effects even as the number of survivors is whittled down to two (gratifyingly, they're the least synthetic of the young cast members). But is it scary? Barely. In the wake of \\"Paranormal Activity,\\" Freddy's grandstanding theatrics seem pretty old hat.

Answer the following question: Process: - Wind and water erode rocks - The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks - Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice - Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times - The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time - The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment - The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight - Question: suppose less sediment is carried away happens, how will it affect MORE sedimentary rock forming. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"When less sediment is carried away, the rate at which sedimentary rocks form may be affected. The process of sedimentary rock formation involves the accumulation, compaction, and cementation of sediments. When less sediment is transported, it can have several possible effects on the formation of more sedimentary rocks. Firstly, less sediment being carried away could potentially lead to an increased rate of sedimentary rock formation. As sediment accumulates in a particular area due to reduced transportation, the rate of deposition of the sediment will be greater. As the layers of sediment pile up, the sediment near the bottom will experience increased pressure. This leads to faster compaction, ultimately resulting in the more rapid formation of sedimentary rocks. However, there are other factors that can influence the rate of sedimentary rock formation. For instance, the nature of the sediment itself plays a crucial role in determining how well the sediment can accumulate and compact. If the sediment is composed of fine particles, such as clay, it may require more water for the particles to settle, and therefore, potentially leading to a slower rate of sedimentary rock formation. On the other hand, if the sediment is composed of coarse particles, such as sand or gravel, it may compact more quickly and form sedimentary rock more rapidly. Another factor that can affect sedimentary rock formation is the rate of cementation. Cementation is the process wherein dissolved minerals act as a “glue” to bind the sediment particles together over time, ultimately solidifying the material into rock. If the environment in which the sediment is deposited is favorable for cementation (e.g., it has the right chemical conditions), this can encourage more rapid sedimentary rock formation. Conversely, if the environment is unfavorable for cementation, the process may be slowed down or may not occur at all. The second effect you mentioned is the compression of older sediments by the overlying sediments. If less sediment is being carried away, this could result in more significant compression of the sediment layers due to the increased rate of deposition. This increased compression could lead to the more rapid formation of sedimentary rocks in the affected area. In conclusion, if less sediment is carried away, it can potentially have a “more” effect on the formation of sedimentary rocks through increased accumulation, faster compaction, and a higher degree of compression. However, various factors such as the nature of the sediment, rate of cementation, and the environmental conditions in which the sediment is deposited can also influence the formation of sedimentary rocks. Consequently, the overall impact of the reduced sediment transportation will depend on the combined influences of these factors in any given geological setting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information: - The Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte (German Air Force)known before October 1916 as the Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches (\\"Imperial German Flying Corps\\") or simply Die Fliegertruppewas the World War I (191418) air arm of the German Army, of which it remained an integral part. In English-language sources it is usually referred to as the Imperial German Air Service, although that is not a literal translation of either name. German naval aviators serving with the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" remained an integral part of the Imperial German Navy \\"(Kaiserliche Marine)\\". Both military branches, the army and navy, operated conventional aircraft, observation balloons and Zeppelins. - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force. - A flying ace or fighter ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down several enemy aircraft during aerial combat. The actual number of aerial victories required to officially qualify as an \\"ace\\" has varied, but is usually considered to be five or more. The few aces among combat aviators have historically accounted for the majority of air-to-air victories in military history. - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted. - The Messerschmitt Bf 109, was a German World War II fighter aircraft that was the backbone of the Luftwaffe's fighter force. The Bf 109 first saw operational service during the Spanish Civil War (1939) and was still in service at the dawn of the jet age at the end of World War II (1945). It was one of the most advanced fighters of the era, including such features as all-metal monocoque construction, a closed canopy, and retractable landing gear. It was powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine. From the end of 1941, the Bf 109 was steadily being supplemented by the superior Focke-Wulf Fw 190. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - Squadron leader (Sqn Ldr in the RAF and PAF; SQNLDR in the RAAF and RNZAF; formerly sometimes S/L in all services) is a commissioned rank in the Royal Air Force and the air forces of many countries which have historical British influence. It is also sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure. - The Desert Air Force (DAF), also known chronologically as Air Headquarters Western Desert, Air Headquarters Libya, the Western Desert Air Force, and the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF), was an Allied tactical air force created from No. 204 Group under RAF Middle East Command in North Africa in 1941 to provide close air support to the British Eighth Army. Throughout World War II, the DAF was made up of squadrons from the Royal Air Force (RAF), the South African Air Force (SAAF), the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and other Allied air forces. - Hans-Joachim Marseille (13 December 1919 30 September 1942) was a \\"Luftwaffe\\" fighter pilot and flying ace during World War II. He is noted for his aerial battles during the North African Campaign and his Bohemian lifestyle. One of the most successful fighter pilots, he was nicknamed the \\"Star of Africa\\". Marseille claimed all but seven of his \\"official\\" 158 victories against the British Commonwealth's Desert Air Force over North Africa, flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter for his entire combat career. No other pilot claimed as many Western Allied aircraft as Marseille. - Squadron Leader Derek Harland Ward , DFC & Bar , was a New Zealand flying ace during the Second World War . He was credited with six kills , one shared destroyed , one probable and four damaged against the Luftwaffe . Ward was shot down and killed by the German ace Hans - Joachim Marseille on 17 June 1942 . Among his notable victories was a Focke - Wulf 200 \`\` Condor '' , destroyed on 1 May 1942 . - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.

We will first combine these terms. 0 = (125v - 104v) - 21 By combining the like terms, we get: 0 = 21v - 21 Step 2: Isolate the variable v Now we need to isolate the variable v by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. To do this, we will add 21 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 21 = 21v - 21 + 21 Which simplifies to: 21 = 21v Step 3: Solve for v Since we now have the equation in the form of 21 = 21v, we can solve for v by dividing both sides of the equation by 21. 21 ÷ 21 = 21v ÷ 21 By dividing both sides by 21, we get: 1 = v So, the solution to the equation 0 = 125v - 104v - 21 is v = 1."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Process: - Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots - It passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Sunlight is absorbed by a green chemical in the leaves. Question: suppose more pollution occurs happens, how will it affect more resources filling the pores occurs. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"An increase in pollution, particularly in the form of airborne particulate matter and harmful gases, can potentially have detrimental effects on the process of photosynthesis in plants. To examine how an increase in pollution may affect the availability of resources filling the stomatal pores, it's crucial to understand the primary elements involved in photosynthesis: carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. Based on these factors, let's analyze the potential impacts on each one. 1. Carbon dioxide: As pollution increases, the concentration of gaseous pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), also rises. These pollutants can have negative effects on plants as they compete with carbon dioxide for uptake through the stomatal pores. As a result, the availability of CO2 for plants may be reduced, which can adversely affect the process of photosynthesis. Hence, in this scenario, the answer would be B: less. 2. Water: An increase in pollution can lead to the contamination of water sources, reducing the availability of clean water for plants to absorb through their roots. Furthermore, climate change induced by the rise of greenhouses gases may cause irregular water distribution, which could lead to droughts or flooding, further stressing the plants and affecting their water uptake. As a result, the answer for water availability would also be B: less. 3. Sunlight: The presence of particulate matter and smog formed due to pollution, mainly in urban areas, can reduce the amount of sunlight reaching plants' leaves. Additionally, some pollutants may adhere to the leaf surface, hindering the absorption of sunlight by the green chemical chlorophyll, which is vital for photosynthesis. Consequently, the availability of sunlight as a resource for plants is also likely to be affected negatively in this case. The answer for sunlight would again be B: less. In conclusion, an increase in pollution has the potential to negatively affect the availability of essential resources required for plants' photosynthesis. The stomatal pores might get filled with less carbon dioxide, and the plants may experience a drop in the amount of sunlight and clean water they receive. So the answer, considering these factors, would be B: less."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Help as much as you can. You are given a new situation: Woodland had two nearby fish hatcheries. Pine hatchery had great result the past few years because they found a way to reduce ammonia water toxicity. Spruce hatchery has big ammonia toxicity problems and hadn't find a way to remediate them. and a hint : Ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species. At lower concentrations, around 0.05 mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases. Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate. At concentrations exceeding 2.0 mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death. Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0 mg/l.During winter, when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems, the surrounding environment. Please answer this question : Which hatchery found fewer fish with poor growth?

As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?'

While the Clinton camp fears that Obama may promote Michelle as a contender for the 2016 elections, undermining Hillary's chances, the Obamas view the Clintons as a threat to the president's legacy. In this tense atmosphere, both families must find a way to work together and put their differences aside, focusing on party unity and the common goal of the Democrats winning the 2016 presidential race.

A leading Italian soccer coach has called for stronger action against racism after a top-level match between AC Milan and Roma was suspended Sunday due to abusive chants by supporters.

After several minutes' delay, the match continued and ended in a 0-0 draw.

If blood is red, why are veins blue? Actually, veins are not blue at all. They are more of a clear, yellowish colour. Although blood looks red when it's outside the body, when it's sitting in a vein near the surface of the skin, it's more of a dark reddish purple colour. At the right depth, these blood-filled veins reflect less red light than the surrounding skin, making them look blue by comparison. Which works harder, your heart or your brain? This question depends on whether you're busy thinking or busy exercising. Your heart works up to three times harder during exercise, and shifts enough blood over a lifetime to fill a supertanker. But, in the long run, your brain probably tips it, because even when you're sitting still your brain is using twice as much energy as your heart, and it takes four to five times as much blood to feed it. Do old people shrink as they age? Yes and no. Many people do get shorter as they age. But, when they do, it isn't because they're shrinking all over. They simply lose height as their spine becomes shorter and more curved due to disuse and the effects of gravity . Many (but not all) men and women do lose height as they get older. Men lose an average of 3-4 cm in height as they age, while women may lose 5 cm or more. If you live to be 200 years old, would you keep shrinking till you were, like 60 cm tall, like a little boy again?No, because old people don't really shrink!It is not that they are growing backwards--their legs, arms and backbones getting shorter. When they do get shorter, it's because the spine has shortened a little. Or, more often, become more bent and curved. Why does spinning make you dizzy ? Because your brain gets confused between what you're seeing and what you're feeling. The brain senses that you're spinning using special gravity and motion sensing organs in your inner ear, which work together with your eyes to keep your vision and balance stable. But when you suddenly stop spinning , the system goes out... Question: Why do some old people look a little shrunken as they age? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Their spine becomes more bent.\\"?

Possible A: flintlock, tennis court, at home, motion, arcade Why is \\"arcade\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"The option \\"arcade\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is the most fitting context for the given scenario, considering safety, entertainment, and practicality. Let's analyze each option to understand the rationale for choosing \\"arcade\\" as the most appropriate answer: 1. Flintlock: A flintlock refers to an antiquated form of firearm or mechanism. Firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth using a flintlock would be highly dangerous, as it could cause physical harm both to the shooter and the person or object being used as the target. This choice does not align with common sense. 2. Tennis court: A tennis court is an outdoor sports venue designed for playing tennis. While it might be possible to fire a projectile ball toward a clown's mouth at a tennis court, it is not a typical environment for such an activity. The primary purpose of tennis courts is to play tennis, not to engage in activities like shooting projectile balls at targets. 3. At home: Firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth in a residential setting is not advisable due to safety concerns and potential property damage. Additionally, some homes may not have sufficient space for such an activity, and it may not be appropriate for a residential environment. This option lacks the common sense of a safe and designated area. 4. Motion: Motion, in this context, is an abstract term that is not directly related to a specific location or setting for firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth. Choosing \\"motion\\" as a location would not make sense as it does not correspond to a particular environment where the activity can take place safely and enjoyably. 5. Arcade: An arcade is a public setting designed for various forms of entertainment, including amusement games and attractions. Shooting a projectile ball at a clown's mouth is an activity that can be typically found in an arcade setting, as it involves skill-based target shooting and can be safely enjoyed by players of all ages. Arcades offer controlled environments, specialized equipment, and proper safety measures, ensuring a fun and secure experience. Considering all the given options, \\"arcade\\" aligns with human common sense because it is a location specifically designed for amusement activities such as firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth. It offers a controlled environment, proper safety measures, and an enjoyable experience, making it the most appropriate choice among the possibilities presented."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Process: - Humans are born as babies - Babies become infants - Infants become children - Children learn skills - Children become teenagers - Teenagers undergo puberty - Teenagers become adults - Adults have children - Adults become elderly - Elderly humans die.

Given the question: Given the below context: Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos.A three-year civil war followed his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king.

Des cas documentés de TdP (mortels et non mortels) associés à l'utilisation d'un médicament ont entraîné le retrait du marché de plusieurs médicaments et la relégation d'autres parmi les médicaments de deuxième intention. Translate to English","completion":"Documented cases of TdP (both fatal and non-fatal) associated with the use of a drug have led to the withdrawal of several drugs from the market and the relegation of others to second-line treatments. TdP, also known as Torsades de Pointes, is a type of life-threatening abnormal heart rhythm that can be potentially fatal. It is seen particularly in patients who have a history of heart issues or are under certain medications that put them at risk for developing this condition. In the pharmaceutical industry, when drugs are found to be associated with significant safety issues like TdP, they undergo strict regulatory review and scrutiny, which may result in several potential outcomes. One of these outcomes is the withdrawal of the drug from the market, meaning that the drug is no longer approved to be sold and prescribed to patients due to the risks it presents. The process of withdrawal starts with drug safety monitoring authorities, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), identifying the risks associated with the drug. They review clinical data and reports, including side effects and adverse events reported by doctors, patients, and drug manufacturers. If a strong link between the drug and TdP is established, this information is shared with other regulatory agencies around the world to ensure that the drug is removed from the market to protect patients’ safety. Another possible outcome of this safety review is the relegation of the drug to the status of a second-line treatment option. This usually occurs when a drug has proven to be less safe than other alternatives, but the benefits of its use might still be considered greater than its risks for certain patients under specific circumstances. In such cases, the drug may still remain on the market but with new usage guidelines, reflecting its newfound second-line status. This may involve doctors being advised to choose alternative medications first, and the relegation of the drug to a backup option, reserved only for cases when first-line treatments prove to be ineffective or intolerable due to side effects. In both withdrawal and relegation scenarios, one common goal is to ensure patient safety. Healthcare practitioners and regulatory authorities work together to monitor drug safety, review potential risks, and act accordingly to protect public health. Drug manufacturers are also responsible for ongoing monitoring of drug safety and reporting findings to regulatory agencies to help maintain the safety and integrity of the medicines that people take every day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two coastal communities on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment. Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","completion":"Davin village was more thoughtful about the environment.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: When District Attorney Carol Chambers last tweeted about a shooting in Aurora, it was about a man found guilty of a killing at a liquor store. Chambers touted the success of her office in convicting Anthony Jahmar Gillespie for shooting to death Benigno Morales-Ramirez. Few outside Colorado probably knew Chambers' name then -- her Twitter account only has 62 followers. But that was a month before the cinema killings. Before James Holmes, the man with orange hair who called himself \\"The Joker,\\" was arrested for spraying a movie theater audience with gunfire during an early morning screening of the new Batman movie. He stands accused of killing 12 people and wounding 38 others. Official: Package at university mail room apparently sent by Colorado suspect. Now Chambers finds herself handling America's next big case, all eyes upon her to deliver justice. She appeared in a dark pantsuit before a horde of reporters and clicking cameras on Monday, the day Holmes first appeared in court. Some who know her believe this case presents the moment she has long awaited. She's a veteran prosecutor who has rarely drawn attention beyond the local limelight. This could be her last hurrah as head of the 18th Judicial District -- term limits on her office force her to step down later this year. She's known for being tough. She's known even more for not caring how she or her actions are reflected in public. She told The Denver Post once that she was \\"not motivated by people to like me.\\" Rick Kornfeld, a defense lawyer in Denver who has known Chambers for years, said she is someone who believes strongly in what she is doing and doesn't care if she garners negative publicity. \\"That is to be respected,\\" he said. But it has also made her a controversial figure in the world of Colorado courts. Alan Prendergast, a journalist for Denver's Westword newspaper who has covered Chambers since she took office in 2004, called her a maverick who is well acquainted with controversy. Threats before, after other 'Dark Knight' showings, authorities said. Prendergast has doggedly written about how Chambers has turned her office into a \\"conviction machine.\\" From seeking the death penalty in a state that does not embrace it to pursuing harsh habitual-criminal charges against chronic but low-level offenders, she has earned a reputation as a hard-ass. \\"As far as prosecution is concerned, you probably couldn't be in a better jurisdiction,\\" said Todd Whelan, who worked in Chambers' office before she was elected district attorney and later, as a defense attorney, butted legal heads with her in court. A 2008 Westword article was headlined \\"The Punisher: Censured but defiant, Carol Chambers goes after habitual criminals -- and cops, judges and lawyers -- like no other district attorney. But at what cost?\\" The cost was that these low-level offenders were being put away on absurdly long and costly sentences when the prison system was overloaded and rehab programs were grossly underfunded, wrote Prendergast, citing Colorado defense attorneys. Residents return to building where suspect set boobytraps. Chambers, said Whelan, goes after the most minor offenders with gusto. \\"There's no deference given to any defendant whatsoever,\\" he said. Chambers is the only state district attorney in Colorado to seek the death penalty in the past five years. Two of the three men on Colorado's death row were prosecuted by Chambers. That makes her an anomaly in a state that fell one vote short in 2009 of abolishing capital punishment. \\"That jurisdiction is very enamored with the death penalty,\\" Kornfeld said about Arapahoe County. \\"And this is a state that uses it very sparingly.\\" Many of the Aurora cinema shooting victims' family and friends are demanding death for the suspect. In this case, they will have a prosecutor who is not shy about seeking the harshest punishment. \\"If there ever was a case for the death penalty, this is probably that case,\\" Kornfeld said. \\"What's a more extreme case than this?\\" Colorado shooting: Stories of survival. Chambers told reporters this week that her office had a lot of work to do in the investigation. \\"I would say there's no such thing as a slam-dunk case,\\" she said. \\"We're still looking at the enormous amount of evidence.\\" She will get to decide whether Holmes' case will be a capital one. But by the time the trial progresses, which Kornfeld said could take years, Chambers will be long gone. \\"Chambers is a very successful prosecutor,\\" said a profile of her this week in the Atlantic magazine. \\"She has the experience, talent and intellect necessary to prosecute the coming Holmes case in a productive way. But she doesn't necessarily come to her most famous case, her legacy case, with completely clean hands.\\" She is tainted perhaps by allegations of questionable ethics -- including providing benefits to prosecution witnesses and a tight management style that has led to a backlog of cases, Kornfeld said. She was even publicly censured recently, Prendergast said. And, she has been known to scuffle with judges, police officers and other public officials. A Chambers spokeswoman said she would not comment because of a gag order placed on the Holmes case, but she has always denied the allegations against her and stood firmly in her convictions. Even some of her detractors call Chambers a fair person who tries to do the right thing. Kornfeld called her when he was defending Greg Kolomitz, the Colorado governor's former campaign manager who was accused of mishandling funds. He recalled her saying: I know what it's like to be a victim of a political witch hunt. We will investigate. Kornfeld said Chambers was fair. She is a Republican who was dealing with a Democratic scandal. But after looking into it, Chambers cleared Kolomitz of wrongdoing. Kornfeld said he believes Chambers' past comes into play in her role as a prosecutor. Court appearance fuels theories about Colorado shooting suspect. She was raised in a small town in Ohio, the daughter of a Presbyterian pastor, according to her official biography. Her grandfather worked for the church as did her three uncles. \\"So needless to say, my childhood centered around the church, which was our extended family,\\" she wrote in her biography. She earned a nursing degree from Texas Christian University and then moved to Denver, where she worked in the emergency room to put herself through law school at the University of Denver. \\"During the two years I worked in the ER at Denver General, I saw the results of homelessness, poverty, drug abuse, sudden and unexpected death, Alzheimer's, suicide, disabilities, mental illness, chronic disease, severe alcohol addiction, victimization, violent crime, sexual assault, child abuse, elder abuse and driving under the influence,\\" she wrote. How to help the victims. Kornfeld believes Chambers' nursing experience makes her extremely empathetic and solicitous of crime victims. \\"As all DAs should be,\\" he said. \\"But she comes at it from a different background.\\" Chambers worked in medical malpractice defense but wanted to be a prosecutor in criminal cases. She joined the 18th Judicial District, which covers four Colorado counties. Kornfeld said he understands why Chambers has a blemished reputation. But she's not necessarily as inflexible as people make her out to be. \\"If you ask her constituents, she's done an effective job as a law enforcement officer,\\" he said. She married Nathan Chambers, who defended the most notorious criminal perhaps in contemporary America -- Timothy McVeigh. He was even there to witness the execution of the Oklahoma City bomber. In Kornfeld's mind, that makes Carol Chambers not a zealot, after all. Now all of America will be able to see her, judge her, as Coloradans have done for years -- as she prosecutes a man suspected in another heinous act that will also be a part of modern American history.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the title of the work that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major?, using the article: Handel's music for Messiah is distinguished from most of his other oratorios by an orchestral restraint—a quality which the musicologist Percy M. Young observes was not adopted by Mozart and other later arrangers of the music. The work begins quietly, with instrumental and solo movements preceding the first appearance of the chorus, whose entry in the low alto register is muted. A particular aspect of Handel's restraint is his limited use of trumpets throughout the work. After their introduction in the Part I chorus \\"Glory to God\\", apart from the solo in \\"The trumpet shall sound\\" they are heard only in \\"Hallelujah\\" and the final chorus \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\". It is this rarity, says Young, that makes these brass interpolations particularly effective: \\"Increase them and the thrill is diminished\\". In \\"Glory to God\\", Handel marked the entry of the trumpets as da lontano e un poco piano, meaning \\"quietly, from afar\\"; his original intention had been to place the brass offstage (in disparte) at this point, to highlight the effect of distance. In this initial appearance the trumpets lack the expected drum accompaniment, \\"a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III\\" according to Luckett.Although Messiah is not in any particular key, Handel's tonal scheme has been summarised by the musicologist Anthony Hicks as \\"an aspiration towards D major\\", the key musically associated with light and glory. As the oratorio moves forward with various shifts in key to reflect changes in mood, D major emerges at significant points, primarily the \\"trumpet\\" movements with their uplifting messages. It is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending. In the absence of a predominant key, other integrating elements have been proposed. For example, the musicologist Rudolf Steglich has suggested that Handel used the device of the \\"ascending fourth\\" as a unifying motif; this device most noticeably occurs in the first two notes of \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" and on numerous other..., what would be the answer ?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the excerpt, the answer to the question \\"What is the title of the work that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major?\\" is Handel's \\"Messiah\\". The excerpt states that \\"it is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending,\\" referring to D major, and the article is discussing Handel's music for Messiah."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Just seconds after home right-back Conor Coady had coolly cleared off the line from Britt Assombalonga, Wolves broke straight away down the right. Andreas Weimann squared for Dicko to tuck home, before Forest's Danny Fox was sent off in stoppage time. The hosts' fifth straight win leaves Forest two points clear of trouble. Paul Lambert's Wolves are now a much healthier 11 points above the relegation zone with a game in hand on many of the teams below them, who have just six matches left to play. A generally frustrating night could have turned out differently after Wolves were clearly hindered by the loss of record signing Helder Costa, who pulled out after aggravating an ankle injury in the pre-match warm-up, to be replaced by Dicko. Assombalonga was close to scoring early on when he cut inside and tested Wolves keeper Andy Lonergan with a low right-foot shot saved at his near post. Dicko then went close at the other end with a low left-foot shot just wide, while Ben Marshall sent a right-foot curler just past the post after the break. Forest then seemed certain to break the deadlock when Wolves found themselves outnumbered. But, after a desperate tackle from Ivan Cavaleiro, the covering Coady got back to clear on the line - and Wolves rapidly made Forest pay for their profligacy. Wolves went down the other end, Dicko slid in from close range for only his fourth goal of the season - and a theatrical Lambert leapt high in the air in his technical area to celebrate. Forest substitute Jamie Ward had a hooked left-foot volley saved by Lonergan, who then made a desperate save to deny another of Forest's subs, Mustapha Carayol, in the last minute of stoppage time, after Fox was sent off for a second yellow card. But Wolves hung on for the victory that all but ensures their Championship safety. Wolves boss Paul Lambert told BBC Sport: \\"We had a bit of a doubt over Helder Costa's ankle in the warm-up, so we made the late change. \\"But we had every confidence that Nouha Dicko would do a good job for us. And Ivan Cavaleiro did well too. He's a big talent. \\"When he gets the ball he's exciting, but he also did well for us when he tracked back to help stop them scoring. Conor Coady on the goal line was a big moment for us and then we showed how quickly we can break.\\" Forest boss Mark Warburton told BBC Radio Nottingham: \\"It hurts to lose in that way. We had our best chance of the game, it falls sweetly for the goalkeeper and then, 10 or 12 seconds later, it's in the back of our net. \\"They are the fine margins. Goals change games, as they say.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the premise supports the hypothesis, let's break down the given statements and analyze their relationship. Premise: \\"But there's a box just round the corner.\\" This statement informs us that there is a box located around the corner, although it does not provide any specific information about the size (small, medium, large) or other characteristics of the box. Hypothesis: \\"There's a small box around the corner.\\" This statement indicates that there is a box around the corner, as the premise states, but it also includes a specific detail (the size of the box being 'small') not mentioned in the premise. Before we draw any conclusions, let's review the concept of validity in deductive reasoning. In deductive reasoning, an argument is considered valid if the truth of its premises guarantees the truth of its conclusion. For an argument to be valid, it must be impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the premise is true, meaning there is indeed a box around the corner, there are a few possibilities: 1. The box is small, which would make the hypothesis true. 2. The box is medium-sized or large, which would make the hypothesis false, as it specifically states that the box is small. 3. The box has a different characteristic, such as being round, but not necessarily small, making the hypothesis neither true nor false. Given these possibilities, we cannot definitively conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. The premise on its own does not provide enough information to confirm the specific detail of the box's size mentioned in the hypothesis. The hypothesis could be correct, but it might not be - our conclusion would rely on assumptions not supported by the premise. In conclusion, based on the premise, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true. The premise only guarantees that there is a box around the corner, without providing any information about its size. Without additional premises that confirm the box's size, we cannot verify if the hypothesis is true or false."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please add spaces between words: Toraisetheanimalsandprovidebeefforourconsumption,forestsandjunglesequivalenttotheareaofEnglandarebeingfelledeachyear.","completion":"To raise the animals and provide beef for our consumption, forests and jungles equivalent to the area of England are being felled each year. This statement highlights the significant impact of the meat industry, specifically cattle farming, on deforestation and environmental issues. The raising of cattle for beef production requires immense amounts of land for grazing, feed production, and other associated activities. As the global demand for beef continues to grow, more and more land is cleared to accommodate this industry. This deforestation leads to several consequences, both for the environment and local communities. Firstly, deforestation contributes to the loss of biodiversity. Forests and jungles serve as home to countless species of plants, animals, and other organisms. Clearing these habitats for cattle farming invariably leads to the displacement and potential extinction of various species, ultimately diminishing the richness and stability of ecosystems. Secondly, deforestation has significant implications for climate change. Forests serve as massive carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it within plant tissues and soil. When these forests are cut down, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Furthermore, the loss of forest cover disrupts the local water cycle, leading to changes in precipitation patterns and potentially exacerbating water scarcity in affected regions. Thirdly, deforestation can have severe social consequences. In many instances, forests and jungles are home to indigenous communities who rely on the land for their livelihoods, culture, and well-being. The expansion of cattle farming often results in the displacement of these communities, threatening their way of life and potentially contributing to social conflict and instability. There are some efforts in place to address this issue, such as promoting sustainable beef production practices and encouraging a shift toward more plant-based diets. While such changes may not completely eliminate the need for cattle farming and associated deforestation, they can help minimize the negative impacts on the environment and communities. In conclusion, the statement \\"To raise the animals and provide beef for our consumption, forests and jungles equivalent to the area of England are being felled each year\\" serves as a stark reminder of the immense environmental and social impacts associated with the global meat industry. Efforts to reduce these impacts, through sustainable farming practices and dietary shifts, are essential for ensuring a more environmentally responsible and socially equitable food production system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Immunology, the study of the immune system and how it protects the body from various pathogens and diseases, began to emerge as a distinct scientific discipline in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While it is true that the Greek historian Thucydides indeed observed the concept of immunity during the Plague of Athens in 430 B.C., the codification of immunology as a scientific theory took shape much later, with significant milestones and contributions by several researchers. Three major discoveries in the late 19th century laid the groundwork for immunology as a formal scientific field: 1. Immunization and the discovery of the germ theory: Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch contributed significantly to the understanding of the role of microorganisms as agents causing infectious diseases. Pasteur's widely acknowledged research on vaccination, starting with the development of the chicken cholera vaccine in the 1870s and leading up to the rabies vaccine in 1885, established the basis for using weakened or inactivated pathogens to provide immunity against diseases. 2. Cellular Immunology: In 1883, Russian biologist Elie Metchnikoff discovered phagocytosis, a process by which certain cells in the immune system called phagocytes engulf and destroy foreign particles or pathogens. He proposed the theory of cellular immunity, suggesting that the body's defense mechanisms work through interactions between various types of cells. 3. Humoral Immunology: In the late 1800s and early 1900s, researchers Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato worked on the principles of humoral immunity, which involves the production of soluble substances called antibodies in response to infection. In 1890, they demonstrated that serum from the blood of a diphtheria-immune animal could transfer protective immunity to a non-immune animal, thus realizing the concept of passive immunity. These groundbreaking discoveries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coupled with subsequent advances in the understanding of the complex interactions between cells, molecules, and organisms in the immune system, established immunology as a distinct scientific discipline. Today, immunology has broad applications in various fields, including medicine, epidemiology, and public health, and it continues to evolve through ongoing research."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If more resources are available, such as an increased supply of coal, it could potentially lead to an increase in power generation by burning more coal in the firebox. However, if there is less power available despite the increased resources due to some other external factors (e.g., inefficient boiler, faulty components, or limited steam production), the overall efficiency of the locomotive's operation will be affected. This can result in less power being supplied to the pistons, crank, and connecting rod, leading to a slower movement of the locomotive's wheels and affecting the speed and power of the train."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present. and a hint : Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Please answer this question : Who is less likely to have lowered oxygen supply to their heart muscles? Answer:","completion":"Ryan is less likely to have a lowered oxygen supply to their heart muscles. This is because, during their physical examination, it was found that Ryan had no plaques present in his arterial walls, while Jake had a high amount of plaques. Atherosclerosis, which is characterized by cholesterol and other material deposits forming plaques on the interior of the arterial wall, can lead to restricted or blocked blood flow. When blood flow is decreased, it results in high blood pressure and reduced oxygen supply to the heart muscles. Since Ryan does not have any plaques present in his arterial walls, his blood flow is less likely to be restricted, which lowers the likelihood of him experiencing a reduced oxygen supply to his heart muscles."},{"prompt":"Q:Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

It is not possible to tell Based on the provided premise, \\"Reduction Act Begins field,\\" it is challenging to precisely conclude that the hypothesis \\"The reduction act has begun.\\" is true. There is some ambiguity in the context, and more information is required to make a more informed decision. Firstly, the premise itself could be open to various interpretations. The term \\"Reduction Act\\" might refer to several meanings, such as a legislation or initiative aimed at reducing something (e.g., spending, carbon emissions, waste production, etc.). Similarly, \\"begins field\\" could be referring to the act's starting point, a specific location or area it applies, the field of study it impacts, an implementation period, or other possible meanings. Secondly, there is insufficient detail in the premise to determine the hypothesis's truthfulness entirely. To make a more accurate assessment, additional context, and supplementary information about the Reduction Act would be beneficial. More information may include the specific area or topic of the act, the act's purpose, its targeted goals, and the timeline for its commencement. Furthermore, broader background knowledge about the Reduction Act helps cement a better understanding of the premise's aim and offer a more concrete response to the hypothesis. Essential factors to consider include the act's stakeholders, its overall projected impact, and the reasons behind the act's inception. Lastly, the context is essential to determine the truthfulness of any hypothesis accurately, especially when working with a limited premise. Acquiring knowledge about the context might enlighten the understanding of the premise itself and offer additional hints regarding the hypothesis's accuracy. In conclusion, based on the given premise, \\"Reduction Act Begins field,\\" it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis \\"The reduction act has begun.\\" is true. The premise's ambiguous nature, coupled with the lack of detailed context and information, hinders the ability to provide a definitive response.

A: Answer:","completion":"The movement of molten metal in the Earth's outer core is responsible for creating Earth's geomagnetic field, also known as the magnetosphere. This is a complex process centered around the generation of electric currents and magnetic fields arising from the movement of molten metal, mainly composed of iron and nickel, within Earth's outer core. Several factors contribute to the movement of the molten metal in the outer core. These factors include: 1. Earth's rotation: The Earth spins on its axis, which causes the molten metal in the outer core to swirl and move in a circular motion. This rotation movement is known as the Coriolis effect. 2. Differences in temperature and density: Temperature and density variations in the outer core lead to convection currents. Hotter, less dense liquid metal rises toward the boundary with the mantle, while cooler, denser liquid metal sinks back down toward the core. This continuous movement creates convection currents that circulate molten metal within the outer core. 3. Gravitational forces: The force of gravity influences the movement of the molten metal. As heavier, denser components of the core descend, it contributes to the overall circulation patterns in the outer core. These movements of molten metal create an electrical current due to a phenomenon called the dynamo effect. The dynamo effect, in simple terms, is an electric current generated by moving conductive fluids through a magnetic field. Since Earth's outer core is mostly composed of conductive materials like iron and nickel, the movement of these materials through the existing magnetic field amplifies and sustains the magnetic field. This self-sustaining process constantly regenerates Earth's geomagnetic field. The geomagnetic field serves several important functions: 1. Protection from solar winds and cosmic radiation: The magnetosphere protects Earth from harmful solar winds and cosmic radiation by deflecting or trapping them before they can penetrate the atmosphere. These solar particles can cause significant damage to living organisms and interfere with electronic systems, satellites, and communication networks. 2. Navigation: Earth's magnetic field is essential for navigation, particularly for species that rely on magnetic compasses to determine their location and direction. This includes animals such as birds and sea turtles, which navigate vast distances during migration using Earth's magnetic field. 3. Preservation of Earth's atmosphere: The magnetosphere plays a critical role in preserving Earth's atmosphere by shielding it from the erosive effects of solar wind. Without our magnetic field, the solar wind would gradually strip away the atmosphere, making it difficult for life to exist on Earth. 4. Climate stabilizer: The Earth's magnetic field also contributes to the regulation and stabilization of the planet's climate by influencing atmospheric circulation and ocean currents. This impacts weather patterns and overall climate stability. In conclusion, the movement of molten metal in Earth's outer core creates a dynamic and self-sustaining geomagnetic field, providing essential protection and maintaining the viability of life on our planet."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: How many NCAA tournament titles has the coach for the only college basketball team to have ever had its national title vacated won? Passage:The first NCAA Tournament was organized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Oregon won the inaugural tournament, defeating Ohio State 46–33 in the first championship game. Before the 1941 tournament, control of the event was given to the NCAA. In the early years of the tournament, it was considered less important than the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), a New York City-based event. Teams were able to compete in both events in the same year, and three of those that did so—Utah in 1944, Kentucky in 1949, and City College of New York (CCNY) in 1950—won the NCAA Tournament. The 1949–50 CCNY team won both tournaments (defeating Bradley in both finals), and is the only college basketball team to accomplish this feat. By the mid-1950s, the NCAA Tournament became the more prestigious of the two events, and in 1971 the NCAA barred universities from playing in other tournaments, such as the NIT, if they were invited to the NCAA Tournament. The 2013 championship won by Louisville was the first men's basketball national title to ever be vacated by the NCAA after the school and its coach at the time, Rick Pitino, were implicated in a 2015 sex scandal involving recruits. Links: a. Rick Pitino b. National Invitation Tournament c. 2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal d. Rick Pitino","completion":"First, we need to identify the question, which is asking about the number of NCAA tournament titles won by the coach of the only college basketball team to have its national title vacated. From the passage, we know that the coach is Rick Pitino and that the team's 2013 championship was vacated. Now, to answer this question, we need to search for more information about Rick Pitino and his NCAA tournament titles. We cannot answer this question based solely on the given passage. Upon further research, we can find that Rick Pitino has won two NCAA tournament titles: one with the University of Kentucky in 1996 and another with Louisville in 2013. Since the 2013 title was vacated, we can conclude that he has effectively won one NCAA tournament title. Therefore, the answer should be the term related to Rick Pitino, which is option \\"a\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Select the correct sentiment of the following review: The interesting aspect of \\"The Apprentice\\" is it demonstrates that the traditional job interview and resume do not necessarily predict teamwork skills, task dedication, and job performance. And they certainly don't reveal any hidden agendas. In other words, a good indicator of potential may be to see a job applicant in action which is the point of \\"The Apprentice\\". People vying for a corporate position may hand over a sugar-coated resume and put on their best personality attire for the interview, but these are not necessarily the best indicator of strengths, weaknesses, and performance. Briefly, \\"The Apprentice\\" involves 16 job candidates competing for the ultimate career opportunity: a position in real estate magnate Donald Trump's investment company. \\"The Apprentice\\" refers to the winner who will win a salaried position, learn the art of high stakes deal-making from the master himself, and, presumably, gain prime corporate connections. The position is a dream-come-true for those wanting to make more money than the GNP of some foreign countries. To entice the candidates, Trump shows off his private jet, his private luxury apartments replete with statues and artwork, his limos, his connections to celebrities, and other aspects of the life of a billionaire magnate. The road to success is not easy. The group is divided into two teams that compete against each other. Each has a corporate-sounding name, such as Versacorps and Protégé Corporation. The teams are assigned tasks that entail an entrepreneurial venture such as creating advertising, selling merchandise, or negotiating. Teams select a project manager who provides the leadership and organizational skills to complete the task. If they win, the manager receives a lot of credit, particularly in the eyes of the final arbiter. If they lose, the manager may also become the scape-goat. Some of the tasks are monumentally difficult with only a day or two to complete. Tasks may involve creating a TV commercial, or print ad. Others may involve selling at a retail outlet or on the street. The tasks bring out the best and worst in the participants. They often show immediately who is the most reliable, who is the most trustworthy, and who is hard working. And the tasks also expose who is not a good team player, who is inefficient, and who seems only out for themselves. The tasks invariably reveal in unexpected ways the strengths and weaknesses of the participants and in particular the project manager. How well the manager communicates with the team, delegates work, organizes time, and sets specific goals will largely determine the outcome, but it does not necessarily predict the winner. The single-most telling aspect of someone's potential is when he or she is assigned as a project manager. Their real abilities as opposed to their self-propagated abilities immediately show through the veneer that cannot be hidden by a 100 silk tie or a beautiful makeover. Leadership qualities and/or weaknesses often become agonizingly obvious after only a few minutes. Those promoting themselves as top-notch leaders are not always as strong when put into a real-life leadership situation. It is always easier to \\"toot your own horn\\" than to actually engage in leadership. Project managers, even those on the winning teams, often do not formulate a cohesive strategy. They often believe that by diving off the deep end to complete the task at the first minute rather than taking a little time to organize and discuss how the task will be completed is more efficient. More often than not, members of an ill-strategized team are running around like headless chickens figuring it out as they go along, and in the long run they end up wasting far more time. The winning team gets a taste of the high life, such as eating dinner at an exclusive restaurant, flying in a private jet, and/or meeting a celebrity. The losing team comes to the dreaded board room where Trump hears the lame excuses of the members and knocks off one or more of the contestants like pieces off a chess board with the now infamous \\"You're fired\\". Often, the project manager is held partially responsible for the team's loss, and may be the target of Trump's accusatory rhetoric. Every week, at least one person becomes a casualty from the losing team. My least-favorite aspect of \\"The Apprentice\\" is the board room. While the tasks themselves bring out the strengths and weaknesses in the candidates, the board room often brings out the worst. Unfortunately, the rules of the game insist there is one winning team and one losing team, even if the competition was close. Members of the losing team start accusing each other, often ruthlessly, about who was at fault. And sometimes more than one person gets fired. I seldom see an under-performing candidate take responsibility for their actions in the board room. Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson were possibly the only candidates who took full responsibility for her team's losses and received no recognition for this selfless act. For me, Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson had the most integrity of all the candidates. However, Trump saw Kristi as weak and fired her, claiming she wasn't standing up for herself, which may mean he values ego more than integrity. No one should sacrifice their integrity for this. Kristi Frank may not have become the apprentice but she can live with herself knowing she did not blame others unjustly. Isn't that worth as much as \\"winning\\"? The strength of \\"The Apprentice\\" is also its weakness. Because team performance is evaluated strictly by winners and losers, other evaluation opportunities are overlooked. Barring huge gaps between the winning and losing teams, sometimes a losing team exemplifies a high standard of teamwork and efficiency. I have seen losing teams sometimes appearing better organized than the winning team. We Americans are so often obsessed with winning and losing that we often overlook excellence.

As her powers grow, so does her desire to explore further and understand the full extent of the book's potential. Step 6: Conflict Maria's growing power attracts attention from a secret organization that has been searching for \\"The Enchanted Legacy\\" for centuries. They believe that Maria's possession of the book makes her a danger to the world, and they will stop at nothing to either control her or retrieve the book for themselves. Step 7: Internal struggle As Maria uses her newfound powers, she wrestles with the responsibility her father warned her about. She struggles to decide whether to use her powers for good and protect her loved ones or seek personal gain and adventure. Step 8: Climax In order to protect Maria and the book, her father is kidnapped, and Maria must go on a dangerous journey to save him and confront the organization. During this journey, she discovers that her mother was once a member of the organization but eventually rebelled and hid the book from them. Step 9: Resolution Maria successfully rescues her father and defeats the organization. She learns the true power of the book – that her mother's spirit is alive within it, guiding her choices. Maria makes the difficult decision to destroy the book, releasing her mother's spirit and ending the threat of the organization using it for malevolent purposes. Step 10: Conclusion Maria, now without the book's powers, returns to her normal life with her father, but she is forever changed by her experience. She has a greater appreciation for the life she leads, the extraordinary adventure, and the knowledge that her mother's love will always be with her."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Where is the football club from that Glen Robert Moss plays for?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. 2007 FIBA Americas Championship For 10 mens national basketball programs representing countries in the Americas, the road to the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing runs through Las Vegas. The 2007 FIBA Americas Championships are set to go from Aug. 22  Sept. 2 and for a retooled team from Canada, the stakes couldnt be higher with Olympic berths on the line. \\"I think the team is very focused,\\" said head coach Leo Rautins in a recent phone interview from San Juan, Puerto Rico in preparation for the tune-up Tuto Marchand Cup. \\"They understand that it's a tough task at hand, but at the same time they realize it has to be all of them doing it together, all 12 guys. But the effort and concentration has been there.\\" Rautins is banking on a young team to bring Canada back to its first Olympic basketball appearance since 2000, where the team was lead by Steve Nash and ultimately finished seventh. Now, a new generation of players with ranging NBA experience will lead the team, including guards Carl English and Denham Brown, forwards Juan Mendez, Olu Famutimi and Levon Kendall as well as centre Samuel Dalembert. Rautins is currently using the four-team exhibition tournament in order to establish those younger players in game situations and nail down his best lineups. \\"We have such limited opportunity to give these guys experience that the plan was to just do whatever we can to load them up with whatever we could give them and hopefully this year, next year and the year after really starts to pay dividends,\\" he says. In order to even think about next summer however, Canada will need a strong showing in Las Vegas. Teams that reach the finals at the FIBA Americas automatically get their ticket punched for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. But the third, fourth and fifth place finishers will have another chance in a tougher World Olympic Qualifying tournament taking place a month before the Games and featuring similar finishers from FIBA Asia, Europe, Africa and Oceania tournaments being played in the next month. Rautins is understandably dreaming big (\\"just like everyone else we're shooting for those top two spots,\\" he says), but even he knows that his team will need to fight through some deficiencies to earn a chance to qualify in 2008. \\"This group has to take advantage of its skills but I think we also have to cover up a few things,\\" says Rautins. \\"We're not particularly strong at point guard and that's something that we've adjusted in how we play. We're kind of playing that position by committee and we've adjusted how we run and how we get into our offence accordingly.\\" Of course, Canada does happen to have a pretty good point guard in Nash, who hasnt ruled out Beijing in 2008 should Canada qualify, but passed on Vegas this summer. \\"[Nash doesn't] need to make excuses, [he's] put in many years with this team,\\" says Rautins. \\"He certainly has left the door open for next year, if we're successful in getting there. With his personality and what he's done, the guys are open and willing to have him come in, even though he might not be there right now.\\" Fellow NBA player Jamaal Magloire once again has declined the invitation to represent Canada in international play, but Rautins says both cases clearly can't be considered in the same context. \\"I've repeatedly tried to communicate with [Magloire] and my last communication was that we were supposed to have a sit-down to talk about it and he never followed through on that,\\" he says. \\"Then, I pick up the newspaper and he indicates that he won't be playing but he's looking forward to joining the team if we qualify. \\"Quite honestly, a lot of this team saw that and they weren't too impressed by that and you know, nor was I. \\"He's a big guy, he's an NBA talent and I wouldn't want to hurt these guys by not having him there. But if they don't feel he belongs there then he won't be there, regardless of what his intentions are.\\" Magloire's skills as a centre might have become easier to live without thanks to the recent addition of Philadelphia 76'ers centre Dalembert to the Canadian team. The Montreal resident, by way of Haiti, was sworn in as a Canadian citizen on Aug. 7, and should provide a true anchor in the post for his newly adopted home country despite his limited international experience. \\"He can run, he can play above the rim and he's a tremendous shot blocker so he's going to present problems for opposing bigs and our job is just to put him in situations where he can catch it on the move and take advantage of people around the basket,\\" says Rautins, who also is cautioning patience with his starting centre given that he's only had two weeks to get ready. \\"He was doing what he can along with other things to potentially prepare but certainly, he's not in mid-season form, so it's going to be interesting to see the adjustment.\\" A strong contribution from Dalembert in Las Vegas could provide a huge boost to a nation desperate to get back Olympic competition but his coach knows that it's going to take more than just the efforts of one player in order for Canada to advance. \\"We have to have some players really step up and play as good as they can play,\\" says Rautins. \\"We need every single player on the same page, not one guy can stray or vary from that and we have to have absolute effort on the defensive end of the floor at all times.\\" The rest of the field Even at its best however, Canada will face a daunting challenge in a tournament that became much more competitive thanks to a result from over a year ago. On Sept. 1, 2006, both the United States and Argentina were dumped from the semi-finals of the 2006 World Championships, allowing Spain to prevail and earn a guaranteed spot in Beijing in the process. So instead of the world No.1 Americans or the defending Olympic champion Argentines treating this trip to the Strip like a working vacation, these basketball superpowers are going to have to go all-out at the University Nevada-Las Vegas' Thomas and Mack Centre. That may be bad news for the rest of the field, but it definitely ups the international intrigue for basketball fans looking for a late-summer fix. Sports Online breaks down the rest of the field for the 2007 FIBA Basketball Americas tournament. The Favourite  United States With all due respect to the defending champs from Argentina, nobody should be betting against the house in this tournament. The U.S. appears poised, reloaded and refocused after its debacle in Athens in 2004, which saw them fail to clinch Olympic gold for the first time since the pre-Dream Team days. That team was led by Tim Duncan and backed by a flock of the NBAs brightest young stars but was exposed against international defensive zones and fizzled to a bronze-medal finish under head coach Larry Brown. But incoming managing director Jerry Colangelo and a revamped coaching staff led by Duke University coach Mike Krzyzewski appear to have worked hard on addressing their weaknesses. While a large degree of improvement can be expected from the development of players like Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosh, the real difference with this team is the addition of shooters and stability in the backcourt that cost them dearly in 2004. Player to watch: On a team littered with all-world talent barely old enough to enjoy an adult beverage in Las Vegas, the U.S. team should clinch a top-two finish if it can get the best out of the 34-year-old New Jersey Nets floor general Jason Kidd. No other NBA player outside of Steve Nash can elevate the play of his teammates like Kidd. The Olympic gold medalist's ability to run the fast break and pick apart half-court zone defences solves a lot of the issues this team had in Athens. A walking triple-double any time he steps on the floor, Kidd is showing no signs of slowing down as hes coming off one of his finest seasons. The Defending Champs  Argentina Argentina would normally be a lock with the US to advance from this tournament but whos missing from the defending Olympic champs heading into Las Vegas has become just as much of a story as whos going. Missing in action will be current NBA players Manu Ginobili (San Antonio Spurs), Fabricio Oberto (Spurs), Walter Hermann (Charlotte Bobcats) and former NBA point guard Pepe Sanchez. That leaves the bulk of the heavy lifting to guard Carlos Delfino (Toronto Raptors), power forward Luis Scola (Houston Rockets) and small forward Andres Nocioni (Chicago Bulls). Despite the absence of some its best, expect Argentina to still be a handful. Strong team play and an up-tempo style have made the defending Olympic gold medalists one of the strongest international squads on the planet. Player to watch: A versatile swingman, who was shrewdly acquired by Raptors general manager Bryan Colangelo this off-season, Delfino will be required to pick up the scoring and leadership slack in the absence of the dynamic Ginobili. So far, he appears more than capable. At the tune-up Super 4 tournament in Santa Fe, Delfino scored 23 points in the championship game for the Argentines on his way to tournament MVP honours. Perhaps the most underrated team in the tournament, the Brazilians have put together a talented squad that could pull off an upset a team and finish with a guaranteed Olympic berth. Leandro Barbosa of the Phoenix Suns will serve as point guard and the NBAs Sixth Man of the Year will be joined by some talented big men including Spurs first-round pick Tiago Splitter, Anderson Varejao (Cleveland Cavaliers) and Nene (Denver Nuggets). Player to watch: A pretty serious knee blowout in the first game of the 2005 NBA campaign cost Nene well over a season. But he came back in the first half of the 2006 campaign to average 12 points and seven rebounds for Denver during the regular season and upped those numbers in the playoffs. His combined experience with the nuances of the international game as well the talent of the NBA should make him invaluable to Brazils chances. Should contend for the top five and seems to thrive in playing the role of giant killer. A lack of NBA-level talent didnt stop Puerto Rico from thumping the Americans 92-74 at Athens in 2004  handing the U.S. its first Olympic defeat with professionals on its roster and its most lopsided loss against top-flight international competition ever. Puerto Rico has traditionally shown no fear against the bigger kids on the playground and shouldnt be a pushover this time around either. Player to watch: Carlos Arroyos a journeyman in the NBA but nothing short of a warrior when he dons his national team jersey. The 28-year-old former Raptor and current Orlando Magic point guard is now a seasoned veteran for the national team having enjoyed his greatest success at last years World Championships where he averaged 21.2 points, 4.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game from that tournament in Brazil. Playing the U.S., in particular, brings out the best in Arroyo. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The 2007 FIBA Americas Championship was a basketball tournament for men's national teams that took place in Las Vegas from August 22 to September 2. The competition was important because it helped decide which countries from the Americas would go to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Canada had a young team and was hoping to make it to the Olympics for the first time since 2000. The United States and Argentina were strong teams, while Brazil and Puerto Rico were also expected to do well in the tournament."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Gene activation leads to other effects, since the protein products of many of the responding genes include enzymes and factors that increase gene expression. Gene expression factors produced as a result of a cascade can turn on even more genes. Therefore one stimulus can trigger the expression of many genes, and this in turn can lead to the activation of many complex events. In a multicellular organism these events include the increased uptake of glucose from the blood stream (stimulated by insulin), and the movement of neutrophils to sites of infection (stimulated by bacterial products). The set of genes and the order in which they are activated in response to stimuli are often called a genetic program. Tony decided to cook a large amount of pasta for dinner, a meal that contains a high amount of glucose and will stimulate the release of insulin. Tony eats his meal on the couch, while sitting next to his sister Justine. Justine is not eating a meal, and is just quietly watching television. Who will more likely be expressing a higher amount of genes at that time? Answer:","completion":"Both Tony and Justine will have various genes being expressed continuously at different levels, as all cells in the body require proteins synthesized by gene expression for normal functioning. However, given the specific situation you describe, Tony would more likely be expressing a higher amount of genes at that time, compared to Justine, who is not eating a meal. The rationale behind this inference is as follows: 1. The consumption of a glucose-rich meal (such as pasta) by Tony will trigger an increase in blood glucose levels in his body. Consequently, his pancreas will produce and release insulin, which will facilitate the uptake of glucose by cells in various tissues. As the level of glucose and insulin rises, cells will in turn activate genes involved in glucose metabolism and energy production, such as glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. 2. The activation of these glucose-responsive genes will likely result in Tony expressing a greater number of genes related to glucose metabolism and energy production. This may lead to a higher overall level of gene expression, as proteins and enzymes are synthesized to facilitate these processes. 3. In addition to the genes directly related to glucose metabolism, there may be other genes expressed as a result of the initial metabolic response. This could be due to the activation of signaling pathways cascades, as you mentioned in the question, leading to the expression of even more genes involved in various cellular processes. On the other hand, Justine, who is not eating a meal and is quietly watching television, would be maintaining her basal level of gene expression required for the normal functioning of cells. While she would still have genes being expressed to maintain cellular activities, her gene expression would not likely experience the same increase in intensity as her brother Tony, who is consuming a high-glucose meal. It is important to note that gene expression is a dynamic and complex process, influenced by many factors such as the cellular context, environmental cues, and the individual's physiological state. Although the consumption of a glucose-rich meal like pasta would likely result in a higher overall level of gene expression for Tony compared to Justine, it would be an oversimplification to conclude that this is the only factor that will determine their respective gene expression levels at that specific moment."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. DJs(disc jockeys) are the people who play and present music on the radio, or in nightclub. A VJ(video jockey) is a person who introduces music videos on television. VJs were first seen on television in the early 1980s when MTV went on the air. As MTV became popular, and the audience for music videos expanded, a variety of other music video channels started broadcasting. In addition to rock music, there were channels for people who had a lot of interest in alternative kinds of music, such as country music, light music, and R&B(rhythm and blues), and all of these channels needed VJs. By the 1990s, international music video channels like Channel V in Asia and VIVA in Europe had started. The VJs for the new international stations had to be chosen carefully. Although some VJs did shows that focused on small audiences and showed mostly local content, other VJs presented shows for international viewers. These VJs, and the material they presented, needed to be popular in several different cultures. One successful international VJ in Asia is Asha Gill. She is from prefix = st1 /Malaysia, but her parents and grandparents are fromIndia,FranceandEngland. She speaks three languages and has fans across Asia, fromJapanto theUnited Arab Emirates. Another VJ who has made a big hit in Asia is Lili. She is actually a computer- Animated VJ on MTV Asia. An actress wearing special computer equipment makes Lili move like a puppet . The actress also talks for Lili, and her shows can be seen in five languages. When asked what makes a good video jockey, many successful VJs have given similar answers.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Children learn what they live, making it vital that parents set the right example with their own food choices. If parents are routinely eating and snacking on unhealthy foods, how can children be expected to do any differently? Setting the right example to get children to eat right requires parental self-discipline. Parents need to provide loving and firm guidance in making healthy and wise choices regarding food and snacks. It is most important to eat plenty of vegetables and fruits yourself. If you model positive behaviors, chances are your kids will copy you. Watch your body and facial expression as well when you try something new. In infancy, children often get fruit and vegetable baby foods, once they start eating table food, what you eat is going to be a big influence on what your kids like to eat. If you rarely serve vegetables with meals or eat fruit, don't be surprised if your kids develop the same habit. Children typically do not like changes being made to their routines, so expect children to express their dislike to newly implemented changes in the family meal plan. Calmly explain that “this is what we’re having for dinner”, and if children adamantly refuse to eat the planned meal, simply cover it and save it for when they say they’re hungry. Remember, your home is not a cafeteria-style restaurant where children dictate what they will or will not eat. When the child later says they are hungry, simply say “Well that’s good because I saved your dinner for you”, then reheat as needed. For example, carrots have vitamin A which is good for skin and eyes. Make the connections between food and what it does for our bodies. For example, have them help when making salads or main meals together. They will be able to recognize what they are eating if they get to see it and feel it. It's also a great chance to discuss the food and get to understand its value better.","completion":"Parents should set a good example by eating healthy foods themselves, as children tend to copy their parents' eating habits and learn from their choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: You're the top! Hypothesis: You are the bottom. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The hypothesis that \\"You are the bottom,\\" does not entail the premise \\"You're the top.\\" To understand this better, let's break down the concepts of entailment, premises, and hypotheses. Entailment refers to a relationship between statements wherein, if the premises are true, then the conclusion (or hypothesis) must also be true. When a hypothesis is entailed by its premise, it implies that there is a logical connection and coherence between the two. A premise is an initial assertion or assumption made as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or belief. It is used to set the foundation for a logical argument and can be viewed as the starting point. A hypothesis, on the other hand, is a proposed explanation or tentative assumption based on limited evidence. It is an educated guess that can be tested and validated through further investigation, experimentation, or observation. Now, let's analyze the given premise and hypothesis: Premise: \\"You're the top!\\" This premise suggests that you (or someone being referred to) are considered to be the best or superior in a particular context. It asserts that one holds a high position, either literally or metaphorically. Hypothesis: \\"You are the bottom.\\" The hypothesis presents a contradictory statement by claiming that you (or someone being referred to) are not the top but rather at the bottom or inferior. It implies that one holds a low position or rank in the given context. As we can see, the hypothesis contradicts the premise directly. In this case, if the premise is true (\\"You're the top!\\"), it would make the hypothesis false (\\"You are the bottom.\\"), as one cannot be both the top and the bottom simultaneously. This contradiction signifies that the hypothesis does not entail the premise because it fails to provide a coherent or logical connection. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"You are the bottom\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"You're the top!\\" because of the direct contradiction between the two statements. For entailment to occur, there must be a logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, which is absent in this case."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Process: - Suns heat enters atmosphere - Green house gases enter from the earth - Heat is trapped in atmosphere - Different things on earth are hotter - The overall planet is hotter. Question: suppose Making meat illegal happens, how will it affect LESS global warming. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"B: Less Making meat production and consumption illegal would have an effect on reducing global warming. The process of meat production, particularly in the case of beef, contributes to greenhouse gas emissions in several ways: 1. Deforestation: Large areas of forests are cleared to create pastures for livestock or grow feed crops. This deforestation results in the release of large amounts of stored carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. 2. Methane emissions: Ruminant animals, such as cows, produce methane as a byproduct of their digestive process. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, approximately 28 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. 3. Manure and fertilizers: The massive amounts of manure produced by livestock, as well as the synthetic fertilizers used for growing feed crops, release nitrous oxide (another potent greenhouse gas) into the atmosphere. 4. Fossil fuel consumption: The process of meat production is energy-intensive and relies on the use of fossil fuels, which produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct. By making meat illegal, the demand for meat and meat products would decrease. This could result in a reduced need for livestock production, which would consequently lead to a decrease in the greenhouse gas emissions associated with meat production. This would in turn have a positive impact on combating global warming, ultimately contributing to less global warming overall. However, it is essential to consider the complex socio-economic and ethical aspects of such a decision and look for alternative solutions to reduce the environmental impact of meat production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Complete the next sentence: How to buy a mobile home Decide how much space you need. Mobile homes come in different sizes with different amounts of bedrooms. Consider how many people will be living in your house and decide how many bedrooms you need. 1). Mobile homes typically come in 3 different sizes, single wide, double wide, and triple wide. Single wides are typically long and narrow with their rooms connecting without hallways.; 2). Have a copy of a listing for each room on your list. You may be able to rent a home as a temporary home or as a home purchase for a family member who will only be living there for a few months or to the next year.; 3). If you will be in a tiny apartment or a five-bedroom house with 20 bedrooms, you would want to think about how many bedrooms are you going to require. Determining how many bedrooms you can realistically have in your new home is a rough estimate.; 4). Most mobile homes will come with their significant other's smart phone or tablet with certain rooms turned into mini-bedrooms. Mobile homes can range from one 2 bedroom home to a house that houses up to two bedrooms.; The answer is:","completion":"1). Mobile homes typically come in 3 different sizes, single wide, double wide, and triple wide. Single wides are typically long and narrow with their rooms connecting without hallways. This answer provides the most accurate information related to the size and structure of mobile homes, which is sparked by the preceding text about the need to decide how much space is needed when purchasing a mobile home. It is relevant to note that mobile homes come in varying sizes and configurations, and this choice delves into those specifics—single wide, double wide, and triple wide. Single-wide mobile homes are typically the smallest, designed long and narrow, offering efficient use of space with rooms often connected directly to one another without hallways. This layout fits well for one person or a small family. Double-wide mobile homes are larger and offer more space. They are typically made by joining two single sections side by side, creating more room for additional bedrooms or living areas. Their size makes them more apt for larger families or those who desire more space. Triple-wide mobile homes are even larger, manufactured by joining three sections. These are less common but offer substantial space, closely resembling traditional single-family homes in terms of size and layout. Other options mentioned in the multiple-choice list are either irrelevant, confusing, or incorrect. For instance, mobile homes do not typically come with smartphones or tablets, as indicated in the fourth option. The third option seems to imply that the number of bedrooms in one's previous apartment will determine the number of bedrooms in your new mobile home, which isn't necessarily true. Housing a family member temporarily (option two) doesn't specifically relate to deciding on the size of the mobile home to buy. Thus, option one is the most commonsensical answer to the question, as it appropriately continues the narrative on how to consider the size of a mobile home based upon an individual or family's needs. This answer gives the potential buyer the most practical understanding of the sizes of mobile homes available in the market and thus directs their decision-making process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ahmet Ertegun was a prominent Turkish-American music executive who played a significant role in the development of Rhythm and blues. Born in Turkey, Ertegun eventually moved to the United States, where he co-founded the iconic Atlantic Records, which heavily focused on promoting and distributing Rhythm and blues music. As a major figure within the industry, Ertegun contributed to shaping the landscape of popular music in the mid-20th century. Through his work with Atlantic Records, he was influential in launching the careers of numerous famous Rhythm and blues artists such as Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, and Otis Redding. Rhythm and blues (R&B) is a genre of music that originated in African American communities during the early 1940s. The data provided gives us an insight into its core elements, specifically its stylistic origin and the derivatives that evolved from it. Rhythm and blues music was born from blues, which can be traced back to African musical traditions and African American work songs. The blues genre, characterized by its expressiveness and emotional intensity, laid the foundation for Rhythm and blues music. R&B retained these core emotional aspects while integrating a strong rhythmic focus, creating a unique sound that resonated with a wide demographic of listeners.

Andrea: Of course, every time we chat, he seems to be so nostalgic about his time spent here. Poor guy! Julián: Yeah, I know. So, I was thinking we could share some pictures of the city that might not be so picturesque or charming, you know, just to help him cope with his longing for the city and maybe ease his nostalgia. Andrea: That's kind of an unusual idea, but I see where you're coming from. So, which not-so-favorable pictures should we send him? Julián: Let's start with the obvious – traffic during the rush hour. We can send him a picture of Avenida 9 de Julio with all the buses, cars, and people trying to cross the street. Andrea: Right, and I bet he won't miss the noise and chaos of public transport here. Oh, and speaking of noise, we could share a photo of a construction site, with all the drilling and hammering sounds that accompany it. Julián: Good idea! I also thought about sharing pictures of some streets after a heavy rain, you know, with all the flooded sidewalks and people trying to navigate their way through them. It can get pretty messy and dirty in Buenos Aires after a rainfall. Andrea: Definitely, and we all know how common power outages can be in the city, especially during the summer months. We should send him a photo of a pitch-black neighborhood with no electricity and remind him of those hot, stuffy nights without air conditioning. Julián: Haha, that's true! Oh, what about sharing pictures of those massive lines at banks and ATMs during a busy day? He'll remember the frustration of having to wait in long queues for simple transactions. Andrea: We can't forget about the strike days when everything comes to a halt, and the city is filled with protest marches, road closures, and a general state of chaos. We can send him a picture of that too. Julián: Great idea! And for the last image, we should send him a photo of the graffiti and trash that, unfortunately, sometimes adorn the streets of our beloved city. Andrea: Yeah, it's sad but true. Alright, so we have our list of photos to send to Callum. Hopefully, it will help to lessen his longing for the city, at least a little bit. Julián: Yep, it may not be the most conventional method, but it's worth a try. And even though we're focusing on the not-so-great aspects, we still love Buenos Aires and hope that Callum can return someday to enjoy all the amazing things that our city has to offer.

In the first half, Oakland trailed as Chiefs kicker Dave Rayner got a 41-yard field goal in the first quarter and a 31-yard field goal in the second quarter. In the third quarter, the Raiders got on the board with QB Daunte Culpepper completing a 21-yard TD pass to WR Ronald Curry for the only score of the period.

Oakland managed to respond with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 37-yard field goal, along with trying to turn a late-game drive into some winning points. Unfortunately, the game ended with an interception.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had people with stronger immune systems? Hint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia.

Answer the following question: Information: - Pinyin, or Hàny Pnyn, is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in mainland China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. It is often used to teach Standard Chinese, which is normally written using Chinese characters. The system includes four diacritics denoting tones. Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet, and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters. - Korla, Kurla, or Kuerle ( lit. Krorain) is a mid-sized city in central Xinjiang, and is, administratively, a county-level city and the seat of the Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, which is larger than Great Britain and is the largest Chinese prefecture. Korla is known for its \\"fragrant\\" pears. - In geography, an oasis (plural: oases) is an isolated area of vegetation in a desert, typically surrounding a spring or similar water source, such as a pond or small lake. Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas; caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames, and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara Desert. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Lop Nur or Lop Nor (from a Mongolian name meaning \\"Lop Lake\\") is a former salt lake in China, now largely dried-up, located between the Taklamakan and Kumtag deserts in the southeastern portion of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of China. Administratively, the lake is in Lop Nur township (pinyin: Luóbùp zhèn, also known as Luozhong , pinyin: Lu zhng) of Ruoqiang County, which in its turn is part of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. - Libya (\\"\\") is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad and Niger to the south, and Algeria and Tunisia to the west. The three traditional parts of the country are Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica. With an area of almost , Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa, and is the 16th largest country in the world. Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world. - Loulan , also called Krorän or Kroraina ( simplified Chinese : ; traditional Chinese : ; pinyin : Lóulán ; Uyghur : , ULY : Kroran ) , and known to Russian archaeologists as Krorayina , was an ancient kingdom based around an important oasis city along the Silk Road already known in the 2nd century BCE on the north - eastern edge of the Lop Desert . The term Loulan is the Chinese transcription of the native name Krorän , and is used to refer to the city located near Lop Nur as well as the kingdom . The kingdom was renamed Shanshan ( ) after its king was assassinated by an envoy of the Han dynasty in 77 BCE ; however , the town at the northwestern corner of the brackish desert lake Lop Nur retained the name of Loulan . The kingdom included at various times settlements such as Niya , Charklik , Miran , and Qiemo . It was intermittently under Chinese control from the early Han dynasty until its abandonment centuries later . The ruins of Loulan are near the now desiccated Lop Nur in the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture , Xinjiang , and are now completely surrounded by desert . - The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction through regions of the Asian continent connecting the East and West from China to the Mediterranean Sea. - Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, often abbreviated to Bayingol (literally \\"rich river\\"), is an autonomous prefecture of the People's Republic of China, bordering Gansu to the east, Qinghai to the southeast, and the Tibet Autonomous Region to the south. It is the largest prefecture-level division nationally, with an area of , even larger than its neighbouring province of Gansu. The prefectural capital is Korla. - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market. - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location. - Ruoqiang (Qarkilik) County (historically known as Charkliq, Chaqiliq, or Qakilik) is a county in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China under the administration of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture.

The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\". - The Lop Desert, or the Lop Depression, is a desert extending from Korla eastwards along the foot of the Kuruk-tagh (meaning Dry Mountain) to the formerly terminal Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. It is an almost perfectly flat expanse with no topographic relief. Lake Bosten in the northwest lies at an altitude of 1,030 m to 1,040 m (3,380 to 3,410 ft), while the Lop Nur in the southeast is only 250 m lower. - Awjila (Berber: \\"Awilan\\", \\"Awjila\\", \\"Awgila\\" Latin: \\"Augila\\") is an oasis town in the Al Wahat District in the Cyrenaica region of northeastern Libya. Since classical times it has been known as a place where high quality dates are farmed. From the Arab conquest in the 7th century, Islam has played an important role in the community. The oasis is located on the east-west caravan route between Egypt and Tripoli, and on the north-south route between Benghazi and the Sahel between Lake Chad and Darfur, and in the past was an important trading center. It is the place after which the Awjila language, an Eastern Berber language, is named. The people cultivate small gardens using water from deep wells. Recently, the oil industry has become an increasingly important source of employment. - Ghadames or Ghadamis (Berber: \\"ademis\\"; \\"admis\\", Libyan vernacular: \\"dms\\", Latin: \\"Cidamus, Cydamus\\") is an oasis Berber town in the Nalut District of the Tripolitania region in northwestern Libya. - Kufra is a basin and oasis group in the Kufra District of southeastern Cyrenaica in Libya. At the end of nineteenth century Kufra became the center and holy place of the Senussi order. It also played a minor role in the Western Desert Campaign of World War II.

To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

Choose your answer: is the following review positive or negative? I normally color my own hair but I was looking for a major change - going from blond to wanting to add a lot of brown with blond highlights. I was referred to this salon and told they would do a cut and color for 45. As a single mom, that price was right up my alley. I met with Gavin and I thought he really listened to what I was looking for and what I really didn't want. I was very clear that I did not want my hair to be ashy in any way, shape or form, that I was looking for a very rich brown and if he didn't think that would work to please let me know. In regards to my cut I showed him some other ideas but told him I was open. He said he didn't really know what to do about the cut but we would talk about that after he did the color. He looked at the photos I brought in and told me some of the color ideas I brought may be too dark and he acted like he understood what I wanted. In hindsight, I did the majority of talking and he really didn't talk to me about what colors would work best nor did he show me any samples of color. He mixed up color and came back and started working on my hair. He was very pleasant and made a bit of small talk. He seemed to be very thorough with the application but I did notice that he didn't seem to be putting the color all the way to my roots (and there were grays that needed to be covered) but it's been a long time since I've had my hair done professionally and I figured it was o.k. One comment he made while doing my hair was that the lighting in the salon was not very good. He said when he does blondes a lot of them freak out because they see red tones in their hair, which he says is due to the lighting. When he took the foils out it was hard to get a good idea of the true color (due to the lighting and it was dark outside which made the salon dark) but the ends looked really, really dark. He still had no ideas on what to do with my hair and trimmed the back and told me he would do the bangs and angle the sides toward my face. He didn't seem to spend much time on the front of my hair and then said he wanted to blow dry it and see where we were and he'd finish the cut from there. He was blow drying and it seemed like all of a sudden he was bored, stopped and said we were done. He never checked the cut in the front and didn't even brush it out - just stopped blow drying. I went to give him my debit card only to be told that he forgot the card swipper for his phone at home. I had to go to the bank, get cash and run it back. When I got home and looked at my hair in real light I about cried. The color was ALL ash and large sections were extremely dark, like the hair grabbed too much color. Pretty much everything I said I didn't want. My bangs are too short to pull over to the side, I have 2 clumps of hair on either side of my head that end at about my cheekbones - there does not seem to be any angling or layering at all. I noticed today that when I pull my hair up you can see all the gray at my roots - he didn't color the roots at all (which reminds me, toward the end of my cut he told me if I wanted to use my box color to touch up the roots, I could - what stylist tells their client they can do that??) I tried calling to give him a chance to fix it. (I can't afford to go to another salon to have the cut and color fixed) When I did Frank answered and asked me to call back the next morning at 9 a.m. I did as I was asked and was told that Gavin hadn't come in yet but Frank took my name and number and said he would have Gavin call me. That was 3 days ago and I'm still waiting. Select from: + negative; + positive;","completion":"- negative The review is negative because the customer was not happy with the color and cut of her hair. She mentioned that the color turned out to be the opposite of what she wanted, and there were issues with the haircut as well. Also, she faced inconvenience while trying to pay and had a difficult time contacting the stylist to fix the problem. All of these reasons make her experience a negative one.

Question: What may happen after this situation ?","completion":"Step 1: Assess the current state of the baggage Before deciding what to do next, I will examine the contents of the baggage to determine how full it truly is. This will give me an idea of the available space for the newly bought chocolates and whether I need to reorganize the contents. Step 2: Prioritize items in the baggage Once I have a clear understanding of the baggage's contents, I will prioritize the items based on their importance for the trip. This can help me decide which items are absolutely necessary, and which can potentially be left behind to make room for the chocolates or any other additional items. Step 3: Reorganize the contents of the baggage With the list of prioritized items, I can now reorganize the contents of the baggage to maximize space utilization. This may involve rolling clothes instead of folding them or using packing cubes to compartmentalize items. I may also need to remove any unnecessary items to create additional space. Step 4: Add the chocolates to the baggage Now that I have optimized the arrangement of the baggage, I can locate an appropriate space for the chocolates. I will ensure they are packed securely and protected from melting or getting crushed by other items in the baggage. Step 5: Consider checking in extra baggage (if necessary) If, after reorganizing and prioritizing the contents of the baggage, there is still not enough space for the chocolates or any other essential items, I may need to consider checking in an extra piece of luggage. This additional baggage will allow for more space and ensure a stress-free packing experience. Conclusion: After this situation, the individual will likely have successfully rearranged their baggage to accommodate the chocolates and may have needed to pack an additional piece of luggage. By prioritizing and reorganizing their baggage, they can enjoy their two-week vacation knowing they have packed both essential items and desired treats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Santorum Will Have to Answer on Satan RUSH: I mentioned earlier in the program that Santorum, people have dug deep and they found a speech that he gave back in 2008 in Ave Maria, Florida, at Ave Maria University. Drudge has this plastered up. The Democrats have found it. It’s all over the place. Think Progress and whatever leftist think tanks have dug this up, and it’s part of the predictable attempt to impugn Santorum as an absolute religious nut and wacko. But he did say these things and he’ll to have an answer for these things when queried. Let’s play these sound bites. We have three of them. This is where Santorum has said that Satan has set his sights on America. Again, this is at Ave Maria University, August of 2008, in Ave Maria, Florida. SANTORUM: The Father of Lies has his sights on what you would think the Father of Lies, Satan, would have his sights on: a good, decent, powerful, influential country — the United States of America. If you were Satan, who would you attack in this day and age? There is no one else to go after other than the United States, and that’s been the case for now almost 200 years, once America’s preeminence was sown by our great Founding Fathers. RUSH: Okay, so he said it. Can we take you back to the United Nations? What was it, 2000… I don’t know, three or four or five or six. Hugo Chavez shows up, he speaks either the afternoon Bush spoke earlier or the next day, but he gets to the microphone at the United Nations and the General Assembly and starts sniffing around. (Sniffing) He says, “I can still smell the sulfur. The Devil was here,” and he had accused Bush of being the Devil. And the assembled monsters that look like they’re out of Star Wars bar scene that made up the UN General Assembly all started laughing. So we’re back to the double standard. Hugo Chavez can show up and call George W. Bush Satan. “Hey, hey! You know what, that’s right! That’s great. Let’s laugh about it. Let’s applaud it.” Santorum gives a speech in Ave Maria, Florida, back in 2008. “Oh, my God, we’re dealing with a nutcase! Oh, wow, what a fanatic weirdo. What are we gonna get next, an exorcism?” So the double standard does exist. Here’s more from the same speech from Santorum. SANTORUM: Satan has done so by attacking the great institutions of America, using those great vices of pride, vanity, and sensuality as the root to attack all of these strong plants that have so deeply rooted in American tradition. He was successful. The place where he was, in my mind, the most successful and first successful was in academia. He understood pride of “smart” people. He attacked them at their weakest, that they were in fact smarter than everybody else and could come up with something new and different, pursue new truths, deny the existence of truth, play with it, “because we’re smart;” and so academia a long time ago fell. RUSH: Satan conquered academia: Rick Santorum, August 29, 2008. And it was in 2006, September 20th, to be exact, where Hugo Chavez strode confidently to the microphones of the UN and was sniffing around and said, “The Devil came here yesterday. It still smells of sulfur today.” And let’s not forget, ladies and gentlemen, Saul Alinsky, who’s the primary mentor of “Barack Hussein Obama! Mmm, mmm, mmm!” Saul Alinsky, the author of the book Rules for Radicals — a book about which Hillary Clinton wrote her masters or doctoral thesis, whatever it was, when she was at Wellesley. Saul Alinsky, who Obama has studied and implements to this day and whose tactics he taught while ostensibly teaching law at the University of Chicago. Saul Alinsky dedicated his book that all these leftists love to Lucifer, the Devil! Here’s Alinsky’s dedication: “Lest we forget, at least an over the-shoulder acknowledgement to the very first radical from all our legends, mythology and history — and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins or which is which? The first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom: Lucifer.” Saul Alinsky made that dedication in his book Rules for Radicals. So Santorum is just joining the crowd here in discussing this. Here is the final sound bite. SANTORUM: The next was the church. Now, you say, “Well, wait. The Catholic Church?” No. We all know that this country was founded on a Judeo-Christian ethic, but the Judeo-Christian ethic was a Protestant Judeo-Christian ethic. Sure, the Catholics had some influence, but this was a Protestant country, and the Protestant ethic. Mainstream, mainline Protestantism. And of course we look at the shape of mainline Protestantism in this country, and it is a shambles. RUSH: That’s Rick Santorum August 29, 2008. That stuff is out there. It’s headlined on Drudge and the left has it, and Santorum will have to deal with it. He’ll have to answer it. I don’t know. It’s just not the kind of stuff you hear a presidential candidate talk about. It’s not ordinary in that sense. Snerdley says, “Yeah, yeah, it’s kind of refreshing.” Snerdley likes devil stuff. I mean, he watches movies about it. He has The Exorcist on a loop at home and it helps with his sciatic pain. ||||| (Jay Westcott/POLITICO) Matt Drudge has led his site for several hours with a speech Rick Santorum gave in 2008 at Ave Maria University in Florida, in which he talked about Satan having his \\"sights on\\" the United States. It's a familiar speech for longtime Santorum-watchers, and it popped up a bit on the Web last week before Drudge's posting. It's a piece of information that will be used to fill in the blanks on Santorum for a nation of voters that knows him mostly for old culture war headlines and little else, and at a time when he's surging in polls as the last real Mitt Romney alternative standing in the GOP field. Per ABC News, the full quotes came in a speech in which Santorum said that the issue of denying communion to politicians supporting abortion rights related to a \\"spiritual war:\\" “While we all see all this as a great political conflict in warfare between the Obama camp and the McCain camp and culture wars, what Bishop Aquila put his finger on and what I think, I suspect those of you who are here understand, this is not a political war at all. This is not a cultural war. This is a spiritual war,” Santorum said. “And the Father of Lies has his sights on what you would think the Father of Lies would have his sights on: a good, decent, powerful, influential country, the United States of America. If you were Satan, who would you attack in this day and age. There is no one else to go after other than the United States and that has been the case now for almost 200 years, once America’s preeminence was sown by our great Founding Fathers.” Rush Limbaugh talked about it on his show, saying the former senator is going to have to explain it: \\"That stuff is out there. It's headlined on Drudge and the left has it, and Santorum will have to deal with it. He'll have to answer it. I don't know. It's just not the kind of stuff you hear a presidential candidate talk about. It's not ordinary in that sense.\\" I've emailed a Santorum spokesman and haven't heard back. ||||| Rick Santorum was sitting at the center of the Drudge Report's homepage Tuesday afternoon looking like a religious nut. \\"SANTORUM'S SATAN WARNING,\\" the headline screamed, under a black-and-white photo of the candidate standing behind a lectern with a cross on it. The conservative blogger drives mad crazy traffic, and he's using it to attack the biggest threat to his reported ally, Mitt Romney. This isn't the first time Drudge has gone nuclear on a Republican who threatened Romney's candidacy. Drudge is making Santorum look like the scary mom from Carrie, pulling up several Santorum quotes from 2008. Those include \\"Satan is attacking the great institutions of America, using those great vices of pride, vanity, and sensuality as the root to attack all of the strong plants that has so deeply rooted in the American tradition,\\" as well as \\"We look at the shape of mainline Protestantism in this country and it is in shambles, it is gone from the world of Christianity as I see it.\\" Drudge has used the same tools—screamer headlines, old photos—to take down another candidate who looked like he might beat Romney. Just as today's post goes after one of Santorum's strengths, his faith, a month ago Drudge published a ton of research attacking Newt Gingrich's strength, his experience. In late January, Gingrich was peaking in the polls, and Drudge's assault caused blogger Matt Barber to rant about \\"The Drudge Distort.\\" Drudge on January 25: Note the same use of black and white to make an uninteresting photo look sinister. Gingrich peaked the day before this headline ran, according to Talking Points Memo's poll average: Of course, Drudge didn't cause Gingrich to fall in the polls all by himself. And maybe the site reflects what the most conservative parts of the conservative establishment are already thinking. Santorum has been ahead of Romney in at least the last six national polls. Maybe some -- or at least the Romney campaign -- are nervous Santorum could actually win. That may explain why while Drudge is attacking Santorum for being too Christian, a Romney adviser is attacking the candidate for not being Christian enough. Mark DeMoss is an outside evangelical adviser to the Romney campaign, Politico reports, and says that Santorum's lack of big charitable donations \\"shows a lack of personal commitment to a principle that religious conservatives and political conservatives believe in.\\" Sure, these accusations are contradictory, but one of them has to stick, right?

Elspeth Reeve |||||Summary:","completion":"In 2008, Rick Santorum gave a speech at Ave Maria University in Florida, discussing the role of Satan in attacking the United States. The speech has now resurfaced, and as Santorum is running for president, he will need to address these statements. It has created a double standard, as others have spoken about Satan in relation to politics without the same level of scrutiny. Santorum's speech also touched on the Catholic Church and the idea that the United States was founded on a Protestant Judeo-Christian ethic. The speech reflects an aspect of Santorum's faith and belief system, and he must now clarify his views as a presidential candidate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A BRUTAL attack takes place on live television; the on-air reporter and cameraman are fatally shot while at work on an early morning story. The resulting footage — essentially a stomach-churning snuff film — aired on cable news, and was embedded in online news reports. In a further grotesque twist, the killer filmed the episode and posted his first-person shooter video on social media. “See Facebook,” he tweeted, directing readers to the video that he also posted on Twitter, and which auto-played on many streams as people shared the posts. This is probably exactly what the shooter, who took two lives and then his own on Wednesday in Virginia, was hoping for in his engineering of mass media and viral infamy. And he is not the only one. Studies show a rise in public mass shootings in the years since the 1999 killings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. These incidents are often followed by discussions of the availability of guns, and about mental health support. Those are crucial issues. But there is something else going on, too: Many of these shooters are seeking a twisted form of notoriety. The killers’ success in obtaining the distorted fame they seek is helping inspire the next troubled person. We need to understand the copycat aspect of these killings so that we can start dampening this effect. After studying 160 “active shooter” events over the past decade, with access to information beyond what the public knows, Andre Simons, of the F.B.I.’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, concluded that “the copycat phenomenon is real.” When the F.B.I. report summarizing the research was released in 2014, he said: “We think we’re seeing more compromised, marginalized individuals who are seeking inspiration from those past attacks.” While we can’t know most killers’ exact motives, we can study their actions. On the morning he fatally shot two people, the Virginia shooter is believed to have faxed a 23-page document to ABC News. The document lionized other young men who had earlier taken multiple lives — men whose actions, motivations and inspirations had been sensationally documented in the news media. He even compared their “tally” of deaths, praising the Virginia Tech shooter for murdering “double the amount” of the Columbine killers. Like many of these individuals, he seemed deeply interested in ensuring a perverse notoriety for his own brutal acts, as well as for past incidents. The troubled young man who killed 20 elementary school students in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 meticulously collected news clippings of previous mass killings. The teenager who killed two people in a Maryland shopping mall in 2014 was obsessed with the Columbine massacre — he even waited till the exact time of its occurrence to start shooting. During the trial of the gunman who committed the Aurora, Colo., theater massacre, as news coverage of the event spiked, two more shootings happened in movie theaters in just two weeks. The gunman in Santa Barbara, Calif., who killed six people in 2014 left behind a carefully prepared video screed (which many media outlets played or linked to). We’ve long known that media reporting of suicides creates a contagion effect by planting what’s known as “the seeds of ideation” in at-risk individuals. Recently, Arizona State University researchers examined whether mass killings and school shootings were similarly contagious. After examining a database of school shootings and mass killings, the researchers reported “significant evidence of contagion.” The occurrence of one mass killing meant that another one in the next two weeks was significantly more likely compared with when there had been no such event in the recent past. Crucially, the next one did not necessarily occur nearby, which is what we’d expect if the contagion effect was a result of word-of-mouth or local news. The researchers concluded that high-profile events that got widespread media attention seemed to inspire the next ones. Psychiatrists agree with the F.B.I.’s conclusion and statistical studies. In 2007, the American Psychiatric Association weighed in, saying that “the scientific evidence in this area is clear.” Asking the news media to stop airing the “disturbing writings, photographs and video” of the Virginia Tech killer, the A.P.A. said that publicizing these materials “seriously jeopardizes the public’s safety by potentially inciting ‘copycat’ suicides, homicides and other incidents.” Attention seeking is not a new kind of behavior, but now those who seek attention via infamy have more tools available than ever. They can film their own manifestoes, as did the Virginia Tech shooter, who killed 32 people. They can post their grievances on social media themselves, as did the Santa Barbara shooter, who killed six people. They can even film the shootings from their own vantage point, as Wednesday’s live-television shooter did. These killers act knowing that their ploy is likely to work, and that their faces, words and vicious deeds will be splashed on our screens on their terms. We can change this by changing the way we cover these stories, similar to the way that the news media did for suicides. After a rash of copycat suicides in the early 1980s, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued voluntary guidelines for reporting on such events: Emphasize that help is possible, do not romanticize the act and do not report on details of the method. (Research shows that being able to imagine an act in specific terms makes it more likely that someone will carry out their plans.) The media needs to adopt a similar sensible framework to covering mass killings. And in the age of social media, that also means changing our own behavior. This doesn’t mean censoring the news or not reporting important events of obvious news value. It means not providing the killers with the infamy they seek. It means somber, instead of lurid and graphic, coverage, and a focus on victims. It means not putting the killer’s face on loop. It means minimizing or not using the killers’ names, as I have done here. It means not airing snuff films, or making them easily accessible on popular sites. It means holding back reporting of details such as the type of gun, ammunition, angle of attack and the protective gear the killer might have worn. Such detailed reporting can give the next killer a concrete road map. This may seem unrealistic. Our media culture tends toward more, not less. But nothing is inevitable, and once awareness of the copycat impact is raised, the news media can change its behavior. It’s not true that the media never holds back information or changes its coverage when lives are at stake. Reporting of suicides already generally follows the C.D.C. guidelines. And, back in 2012, when NBC’s high-profile foreign correspondent, Richard Engel, was kidnapped in Syria, the fact of the abduction was widely known among journalists. But almost all of them complied with NBC’s request for a news blackout to ensure better fact-finding and easier negotiations with the captors. The kidnapping became widely known only after Mr. Engel and his colleagues escaped. The framework necessary to dampen the copycat effect is nowhere as severe as such a blackout. Instead, it requires not giving the killers the fame they most likely seek for their face or for their words or videos, while reporting on the news with a focus on victims and the brutality of the crime. For the rest of us, it means not sharing manifestoes or shooters’ social media accounts. Such change is possible. Brutal beheadings by the Islamic State used to be covered graphically by the news media, and also shared widely on social media. Recently, each such event in my social media feed has been followed by reminders not to share the videos — and almost nobody in my social network does anymore.

The labor is very painful, and her accomplice Stathis Borans is dragged away from the procedure after he objects to her treatment. She eventually gives birth to a larval sac, causing her to go into shock and die. The larval sac is opened by the surgeons to reveal a seemingly normal human baby inside.The baby is named \\"Martin\\" by the scientists. He begins to age much faster than a normal human; the company's CEO, Bartok, tells him that this is due to an extremely rare disease called \\"Brundle's Accelerated Growth Syndrome\\", caused by inherited mutant DNA from his father (hence the disease's name). Martin is just as much of a genius as his father, and Bartok wants him to finish the work Seth started. One day, Martin sneaks into a room where animals are held for testing, and befriends a Golden Retriever. He slips out of his room one day to bring the dog some of his dinner, but he finds that it has been transferred to another section. Martin goes there to discover a new set of Telepods, like the ones his father invented; his dog is being prepared for teleportation. The scientists send the dog through, but it unfortunately emerges as a hideous mutant, biting off a scientist's fingers. A horrified Martin screams, as Bartok consoles him.Five years after Martin's birth, he is now physically 20 years old. He is taken to a new living space, which is much more luxurious and wide open.

As a result, they use little renewable resources and instead power most of the city through non-renewable resources like fossil fuels.

A:","completion":"A: Los Angeles emits less greenhouse gases compared to Las Vegas due to its higher reliance on renewable energy sources. As stated, Los Angeles receives a steady supply of sunlight and wind throughout the year, enabling the city to generate a significant amount of renewable energy to power its buildings and factories. This reduces the dependency on non-renewable resources like fossil fuels, which are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, Las Vegas lacks sufficient sunlight and wind, leading to a higher dependence on non-renewable energy sources. As a result, the city emits more greenhouse gases than Los Angeles, considering the carbon footprint associated with the burning of fossil fuels. It is worth noting that the total greenhouse gas emissions for a city may also vary based on factors like population, industry, and transportation habits, but due to the fundamental differences in energy sources, Los Angeles would generally emit less greenhouse gases thanks to its reliance on renewable resources."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The company revealed its Web ambitions Thursday in a keynote speech reminiscent of Apple’s slickly produced presentations, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined the company’s next stage. Facebook is aiming to become an all-inclusive Web portal for news, music and movies, letting developers build apps that will update users profiles in real-time. And all those interests will be prominently displayed on a splashy new profile page called the “Timeline,” which pulls together all the content you have on Facebook into one, deep page. The Timeline has three main components,Zuckerberg said --- all your stories, all your apps and a new way to express who you are. Pictures and videos are featured prominently, making profiles much more visually focused, and users can sort through the feed by date, type of media and location. Users can customize the top of their timeline, called a “cover” — a large photo at the top of the profile that will look familiar to anyone with a blog. In fact, the whole profile looks more like a blog, which fits in with Facebook’s decision to extend the limit on user updates to 5,000 characters. Facebook is also trying to change the way people get news. Zuckerberg revealed that the site is partnering with news outlets such as Yahoo News, The Daily and, yes, The Washington Post. Users will be able to click on an item in a news stream and read it on the site without ever leaving the social network. They can also read what their friends are reading and find new content based on suggestions. “This new app is fun,” said Donald Graham, chairman and chief executive of The Washington Post Co. “If you know that several of your friends have read a story, you’ll be more interested in it.” Graham is also a member of Facebook’s board of directors This level of sharing also applies to music, through partnerships with companies such as Spotify and Clear Channel’s iheartradio, and video via deals with streaming sites such as Netflix (though not yet in the U.S.) and Dailymotion. Some of the new apps are available immediately. The Timeline layout has started its beta test, and will be available to everyone in the coming weeks. Apart from the functional and visual changes Facebook revealed Thursday, the quality and style of the keynote speech also showed how the social network has grown as a company. The slides projected off of Zuckerberg’s laptop could have been taken directly from former Apple CEO Steve Jobs’ computer. Facebook also broke up its presentation with highly produced, evocative videos showing off exactly how they want users to take advantage of the new features. The moves are sure to irk some users and privacy advocates, who are likely to object to the real-time feeds from apps. If you hook up your accounts on other media sites to the network, you’ll have to come to terms with the fact that you may be sharing more than you realize. Your friends will be immediately be able to see that you’ve read articles on Jersey Shore, indulged in a cheesy video or opted to listen to one-hit wonders from the eighties. At a time when Web users are trying to become more savvy about what their digital identities project to the world, they may be loathe to share their private media consumption so publicly.

Question: suppose the isotope is more unstable happens, how will it affect MORE vegetables. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"The question asks about the effects of an unstable isotope on the growth of more vegetables, specifically in relation to the second effect mentioned in the process of planting seeds. To answer this question, we need to first understand the potential impact of an unstable isotope on the growth of vegetables and how it could influence the second effect mentioned, which is picking a spot to plant the seeds. Unstable isotopes are radioactive elements that decay over time, releasing radiation in the form of particles or electromagnetic waves. If these isotopes are present in the soil or water where vegetables are being grown, they can potentially be absorbed by the plants. This radioactive contamination may lead to a variety of undesired consequences such as inhibited growth, DNA damage, or direct harm to the consumer of the vegetables. Now, let us consider how the presence of unstable isotopes could impact the second effect mentioned in the process of planting seeds, which is picking a spot to plant them. Ideally, one would want to select a location that is safe and suitable for the healthy growth of the vegetables. The presence of unstable isotopes might cause a decrease in the available options, as certain areas may become contaminated and unsuitable for planting. This could, in turn, lead to a reduction in the total number of vegetables that can be grown within a given area. Given this information, the presence of an unstable isotope would have a negative effect on the growth of more vegetables and influence the second effect mentioned – picking a spot to plant seeds – by making it more difficult or risky to select a proper location. This could ultimately lead to a decrease in the overall production of vegetables due to the radioactivity and contamination concerns caused by the unstable isotope. Therefore, the answer to the question is \\"less,\\" as the supposed perturbation caused by unstable isotopes would lead to a decrease in the total number of vegetables that can be grown and negatively impact the process of selecting the appropriate planting spot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Believes dieters often fail because they don't acknowledge these benefits. Admitting why you WANT to be fat might help lose weight.","completion":"Title: The Surprising Benefits of Being Overweight: How Acknowledging Them Can Help You Lose Weight Introduction: As society frequently advocates for a slender body image, the idea that there might be benefits to being overweight is counterintuitive. However, Dr. Bernadette Rock, an expert in the field, believes that understanding these benefits might actually be the key to a successful weight loss journey. This article explores the concept of acknowledging the perks that come with being fat to ultimately reach your weight loss goals. The Benefits of Being Overweight: Dr. Bernadette Rock asserts that being fat has certain advantages that are often overlooked. Here, we discuss some of these benefits, as recognized by the expert. 1. Protection: Carrying extra weight around serves as a protective body shield against physical harm. For some individuals, their excess weight might make them feel safer or more robust. 2. Reserve energy: People with additional body fat have extra reserves of energy that they can utilize during times of illness or nutrient shortages, allowing their bodies to cope better. 3. Emotional comfort: Food can often provide emotional satisfaction, and being overweight might be more comforting in times of distress, allowing for a sense of security. The Role of Acknowledging the Benefits: According to Dr. Bernadette Rock, acknowledging these benefits might be the key factor in successful weight loss because being aware of the reasons why you want to remain overweight can make it easier to tackle these issues head-on. Dieters, who frequently fail, often neglect to consider these advantages, making it more difficult for themselves to stay on track and ultimately lose weight. 1. Gain a healthier mindset: By acknowledging the benefits of being overweight, you can create a healthier mindset that's focused on optimizing your overall well-being rather than fixating on a particular body image. 2. Identify hidden motivations: Recognizing the reasons that make being overweight appealing to you can help you identify the underlying emotional needs. Addressing these needs in a constructive manner will enable a more effective weight loss journey. 3. Set realistic expectations: By accepting the benefits of being overweight, you are better equipped to establish attainable weight loss goals. This helps to prevent the collapse of motivation caused by unattainable expectations. Conclusion: Dr. Bernadette Rock's thought-provoking insight shifts our perspective on how to approach weight loss effectively. By acknowledging the advantages of being overweight, we can identify our hidden motivations, gain a healthier mindset, and set realistic goals for ourselves. Ultimately, this awareness can lead to a more successful and sustainable weight loss journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

President Truman, symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat. It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A \\"Draft Eisenhower\\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \\"I Like Ike\\". It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at Yalta and against Truman's policies in Korea and China—matters in which he had once participated. In defeating Taft for the nomination, it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party; his selection of Richard M. Nixon as the Vice-President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose. Nixon also provided a strong anti-communist presence as well as some youth to counter Ike's more advanced age.

Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Movie title: Bordertown Movie plot: The opening titles explain that American corporations are using the North American Free Trade Agreement by opening large maquiladoras right across the United StatesâMexico border. The maquiladoras hire mostly Mexican women to work long hours for little money in order to produce mass quantity products. Lauren Adrian (Jennifer Lopez), an impassioned American news reporter for the \\"Chicago Sentinel\\" wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war. Instead, her editor George Morgan (Martin Sheen) assigns her to investigate a series of slayings involving young maquiladora factory women in a Mexican bordertown. Worker Eva (Maya Zapata), originally from the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, takes a bus to go back to her shanty-town home after work. After a while she is the last passenger still in the bus. The driver asks her if she minds if he goes to a gas station to fill up, and Eva agrees. However, he takes her to a remote place and assaults and rapes her, together with another man, who then tries to strangle her. The two men, believing she's dead, bury her alive. With the little energy she has left, Eva escapes. Adrian heads to Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Chihuahua, on the U.S.âMexico border to investigate the murders, hoping that if she does well she will be promoted by Morgan to be a foreign correspondent. In JuÃ¡rez, Adrian meets up with Diaz (Antonio Banderas), whom she had been working with six years before, and who is now the editor for the local newspaper \\"El Sol de JuÃ¡rez\\". She also meets Eva. The three try to find the two killers and have them prosecuted. For this purpose she starts working in the factory, in order to act as bait on the bus ride.

An enjoyable pop projection of post-9/11 anxiety. That said, it also makes you nostalgic for the days when irresponsible action movies didn't have to deal with it. 3. As more and more movies rely on massive CGI enhancement and Hong Kong choreographed wire-rigged fights, Die Hard revels in good, old-fashioned fist fights and real, immaculately executed stunts. 4.

Spacey was born in South Orange, New Jersey, to Kathleen Ann (nee Knutson), a secretary, and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, a technical writer and data consultant. He has an older brother, Randy Fowler, who is a limo driver and Rod Stewart impersonator in Boise, Idaho, and a sister, Julie Ann Fowler Keir, an office worker. His family relocated to Southern California when Spacey was four years old. Randy Fowler (from whom Spacey is estranged) has stated that their father, whom he described as a racist \\"Nazi supporter\\", was sexually and physically abusive, and that Spacey had shut down emotionally and become \\"very sly and smart\\" to avoid whippings. Spacey's first professional stage appearance was as a spear carrier in a New York Shakespeare Festival performance of Henry VI, Part 1 in 1981. The following year, he made his first Broadway appearance, as Oswald in a production of Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts, starring Liv Ullmann. Then he portrayed Philinte in Moliere's The Misanthrope. In 1984, he appeared in a production of David Rabe's Hurlyburly, in which he rotated through each of the male parts (he would later play Mickey in the film version). Next came Anton Chekhov's The Seagull. In 1986, he appeared in a production of Sleuth in a New Jersey dinner theatre. His prominence as a stage actor began in 1986, when he was cast opposite Jack Lemmon, Peter Gallagher and Bethel Leslie as Jamie, the eldest Tyrone son, in Jonathan Miller's lauded production of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. Lemmon in particular would become a mentor to him and was invited, along with Spacey's high school drama teacher, to be present when Spacey received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999. He made his first major television appearance in the second-season premiere of Crime Story, playing a Kennedy-esque American senator. Although his interest soon turned to film, Spacey remained actively involved in the live theater community. In 1991, he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Uncle Louie in Neil Simon's Broadway hit Lost in Yonkers. Spacey's father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor, and did not change his mind until Spacey became well-known. Some of Spacey's early roles include a widowed eccentric millionaire on L.A. Law, the television miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan (1988), opposite Lemmon, and the comedy See No Evil, Hear No Evil (1989). He earned a fan base after playing the criminally insane arms dealer Mel Profitt on the television series Wiseguy. He quickly developed a reputation as a character actor, and was cast in bigger roles, including one-half of a bickering Connecticut couple in the dark comedy film The Ref (1994), a malicious Hollywood studio boss in the satire Swimming with Sharks, and the malevolent office manager in the ensemble film Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), gaining him positive notices by critics. His performance as the enigmatic criminal Verbal Kint in 1995's The Usual Suspects won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Spacey appeared in the 1995 thriller film Seven, making a sudden entrance late in the film as the serial killer John Doe after going unmentioned in the film's advertisements and opening credits. His work in Seven, The Usual Suspects and Outbreak earned him Best Supporting Actor honors at the 1995 Society of Texas Film Critics Awards. He remarked in 2013: \\"I think people just like me evil for some reason. They want me to be a son of a bitch.\\" Spacey played an egomaniacal district attorney in A Time to Kill (1996), and founded Trigger Street Productions in 1997, with the purpose of producing and developing entertainment across various media. He made his directorial debut with the film Albino Alligator (1996). The film was a failure at the box office, grossing 339,379 with a budget of 6 million, but critics praised Spacey's direction.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife? Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

Question: Where does the invisible force drags Dyaln into? Title: Hollow Man 2 Movie plot: At a plush cocktail party at Reisner Institute, a government think tank based in Redmond, Washington DC, the guests and scientists present are enjoying themselves. One such scientist, Dylan, suddenly begins to become manipulated by an invisible force, which creates a scene to the guests and drags the scientist into the nearby bathroom and proceeds to brutally beat and throw Dylan around the room. Dylan apparently knows who it is, and begs the invisible man not to kill him, as he \\"doesn't have it\\", but the invisible man persists as he's \\"getting worse\\" and he's \\"running out of time\\". Though he does not know how to make more, Dylan mentions that another scientist, Maggie Dalton (Laura Regan), knows the formula. Seemingly accepting this, the invisible man releases Dylan and tells him not to tell anyone he was here, to which he agrees. No sooner has he left, than Dylan attempts to call someone on his cell phone, but the invisible man, who only pretended to leave to see if Dylan would stay silent, smashes the phone on the ground, and slashes Dylan's neck with the broken circuit board, killing him.The police arrive at the laboratory to conduct an investigation, but the military supervisor of the laboratory, Colonel Gavin Bishop (William MacDonald), insists it is an internal military situation and the police have no jurisdiction over the crime, and refuses to relent even when one of the detectives, Frank Turner (Peter Facinelli), points out that they have no experience conducting a proper criminal investigation.Fearing another attack on the remaining scientists, the lab company owner, Dr. William Reisner (David McIlwraith), employs Turner and his partner, Detective Lisa Martinez (Sarah Deakins), to protect Maggie (despite the military forcing the police out of the investigation), but refuses to divulge any information to the detectives on the nature of the work they are doing, which includes refusing to tell them that an invisible killer is on the loose.Turner and Lisa, after gaining Maggie's reluctant cooperation,...

Le gouvernement a persisté dans son refus d'intervenir auprès des autorités américaines pour aborder le cas d'Omar Khadr, un citoyen canadien qui avait été arrêté en Afghanistan alors qu'il n'avait que 15 ans et était détenu depuis plus de six ans dans la prison de Guantánamo Bay. Cette situation a suscité de nombreuses controverses et a fait l'objet de critiques tant au niveau national qu'international, principalement en raison de l'âge d'Omar Khadr au moment de son arrestation et de son incarcération dans des conditions considérées comme inhumaines et dégradantes. En effet, le traitement réservé à Omar Khadr soulève des questions importantes concernant le respect des droits de l'homme et du droit international, notamment le droit des enfants à être protégés contre toute forme de violence et de sévices. La Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant, ratifiée par les États-Unis et le Canada, interdit ainsi l'utilisation des enfants pour des activités militaires et impose aux États l'obligation de prendre toutes les mesures nécessaires pour assurer leur bien-être et leur réhabilitation. Dans le cas d'Omar Khadr, plusieurs organisations de défense des droits de l'homme et de protection de l'enfance ont dénoncé les violations présumées du droit international et ont appelé les autorités canadiennes et américaines à mettre fin à son incarcération et à lui fournir une assistance juridique et psychologique adaptée. Toutefois, le gouvernement canadien a persisté à ne pas intervenir dans ce dossier qui impliquait un de ses ressortissants, laissant ainsi peser de lourds soupçons sur sa volonté de défendre véritablement les droits et les intérêts de ses citoyens dans l'arène internationale. Cette affaire montre également l'ambiguïté et les limites des engagements internationaux pris par les États en matière de protection des droits de l'homme et des droits des enfants. En effet, en refusant d'intervenir efficacement pour défendre les droits d'un citoyen mineur se trouvant dans une situation aussi grave et préoccupante, le gouvernement canadien a en quelque sorte renoncé à assumer pleinement ses responsabilités en tant qu'État souverain, et a indirectement contribué à perpétuer l'existence et le fonctionnement d'un système de détention extrajudiciaire et illégal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

November 11] 1890 – December 30, 1941), known as El Lissitzky (Russian: Эль Лиси́цкий, Yiddish: על ליסיצקי‎), was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works – a Soviet propaganda poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against Nazi Germany.

My sister and two brothers had the same mean mother as I did. My mother insisted upon knowing where we were at all times. She had to know who our friends were and where we were going.

What are alternatives to the electoral college in the U.S.? What are some alternatives to the electoral college? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are paraphrases of each other, as they both inquire about the possible alternatives to the electoral college in the United States. They aim to gather information on different methods to elect the country's president instead of relying on the electoral college system presently in place. Alternatives to the Electoral College: 1. Direct Popular Vote: This method would abolish the electoral college and elect the president based on the total number of individual votes (popular vote) received by each candidate across the nation. With a direct popular vote, every person's vote would carry equal weight, and whoever receives the most votes would become the president. This could potentially encourage candidates to campaign more broadly and not just focus on swing states. 2. National Bonus Plan: Proposed by Senator Malcolm Moos in 1950, this system would maintain the electoral college while adding a predetermined number of bonus electoral votes (for example, 102) to the candidate who wins the national popular vote. This would give weight to the popular vote while still retaining some aspects of the current electoral college system. 3. Proportional Allocation of Electoral Votes: Instead of the current winner-take-all approach in most states, electoral votes would be allocated proportionally based on the percentage of the popular vote won by each candidate. This would prevent situations where a candidate wins the state by a slim margin but takes all the electoral votes, ensuring a more equitable distribution. 4. Congressional District Plan: Adopted by Maine and Nebraska, this approach allocates electoral votes based on the outcomes of individual congressional districts. The winner in each district would receive one electoral vote, and the remaining two votes (representing the state's senators) would go to the candidate with the most overall votes in the state. This method provides a more localized representation of the voters' preferences, thus balancing urban and rural interests. 5. Ranked-choice Voting: Voters would rank candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. The votes of the eliminated candidate would then be redistributed to the remaining candidates based on voters' second-choice preferences. This process would continue until a candidate reaches a majority. Ranked-choice voting could lead to a more consensus-driven election result and the possibility of third-party candidates gaining traction. 6. Approval Voting: Voters would cast a vote for any number of candidates they approve of, rather than selecting only one. The candidate with the highest total approval votes wins the election. This method encourages voters to support their genuine preferences without fear that their vote would be \\"wasted\\" on a less popular candidate. It also has the potential to reduce negative campaigning and promote collaboration between candidates with similar platforms. 7. Instant Runoff Voting / Single Transferable Vote: Similar to ranked-choice voting, but in this system, if no candidate receives a majority, the remaining candidates become the new options for redistribution. This process continues until there is a clear winner with a majority of votes. It can lead to a more representative outcome of the electorate’s preferences and, like ranked-choice voting, can give third-party candidates more opportunities. Each of these alternatives has its pros and cons and requires substantial analysis and debate to determine the feasibility of adoption within the U.S. electoral framework. Nonetheless, these alternatives strive to provide a more equitable and representative electoral process that could better reflect the will of the American voters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: In 1954, under the \\"Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands\\", the Netherlands, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles became a composite kingdom. The former colonies were granted autonomy, save for certain matters including defense, foreign affairs and citizenship, which were the responsibility of the Realm. In 1969, unrest in Curaçao led to Dutch marines being sent to quell rioting. In 1973, negotiations started in Suriname for independence, and full independence was granted in 1975, with 60,000 emigrants taking the opportunity of moving to the Netherlands. In 1986, Aruba was allowed to secede from the Netherlands Antilles federation, and was pressured by the Netherlands to move to independence within ten years. However, in 1994, it was agreed that its status as a Realm in its own right could continue. On October 10, 2010, the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved. Effective on that date, Curaçao and Sint Maarten acceded to the same country status within the Kingdom that Aruba already enjoyed. The islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba were granted a status similar to Dutch municipalities, and are now sometimes referred to as the Caribbean Netherlands. Question: How many years was it between Suriname's independence and the date the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved? Answer:","completion":"To determine the number of years between Suriname's independence and the date the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved, we need to look at the years mentioned in the context. Suriname gained full independence in 1975. The Netherlands Antilles were dissolved on October 10, 2010. Now, we need to calculate the difference between the years. 2010 - 1975 = 35 years So, it was 35 years between Suriname's independence and the date the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Based on experience with German strategic bombing during World War I against the United Kingdom, the British government estimated after the war that 50 casualties— with about one third killed— would result for every tonne of bombs dropped on London. The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy. In 1939 military theorist Basil Liddell-Hart predicted that 250,000 deaths and injuries in Britain could occur in the first week of war.\\", answer the following question.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man that resupplied the depot that was reached on February 23rd by the group that aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days? from the following article ? The party turned for home after 73 days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders Nimrod, having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened, yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January. As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot; during the ascent the same distance had taken 12 days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \\"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\\".The depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \\"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\\". A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate. \\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\\", wrote Shackleton. From 18 February onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks, and on the 23rd they reached Bluff Depot, which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by Ernest Joyce. The range of delicacies over and above the crates of regular supplies was listed by Shackleton: \\"Carlsbad plums, eggs, cakes, plum pudding, gingerbread and crystallised fruit\\". Wild's laconic comment was \\"Good old Joyce\\".Their food worries were now resolved, but they still had to get back to Hut...

To install the siding, we didn't need the hammer, but required the drill, as the part of the job that needed the","completion":"hammer had already been completed. We proceeded with the following steps: Step 1: Gather materials Before beginning, we made sure we had all the necessary materials, including the siding panels, drill, drill bits, screws, a level, a measuring tape, a utility knife, and safety goggles. We also prepared a sturdy ladder to reach the higher parts of the house. Step 2: Measure and mark Next, we measured and marked the exact locations on the wall where the siding panels would be placed. To ensure proper alignment, we used a level, string line, or chalk line, depending on the surface, for straight and accurate lines. Moreover, we took into account appropriate spacing for expansion and contraction of the siding material due to temperature changes. Step 3: Cutting the siding panels We then carefully measured and cut the siding panels to size using the utility knife. In some cases, we needed to use a circular saw, with the appropriate blade, for more precise cuts or for dealing with more rigid materials. Step 4: Installing the starter strip Starting at the bottom of the exterior wall, we secured a starter strip that would serve as a base for the first row of siding. We ensured that it was leveled before attaching it with screws, making sure not to overtighten them. Step 5: Attaching the siding panels Following the manufacturer's instructions, we placed the first siding panel onto the starter strip, making sure it was level and properly aligned. We then drilled pilot holes and attached the siding panel using screws. We continued attaching each panel, overlapping them as needed and ensuring that they were in line with the previously installed siding. Step 6: Cutting around windows, doors, and other obstacles For any locations where siding needed to be fitted around windows, doors, or other architectural features, we measured and cut the siding panels accordingly, ensuring a snug fit. If needed, we used a jigsaw or a hole saw for more intricate cuts. Step 7: Installing trim and finishing touches After all the siding panels were securely attached, we moved on to install the trim around doors, windows, corners, and any other edges where a finished look was required. We measured and cut the trim to fit each location, attaching it using screws and the drill. Step 8: Final inspection and cleanup Lastly, we conducted a thorough inspection to verify that all siding panels were properly installed. We checked for any loose panels or trim pieces and made the necessary adjustments. Then, we cleaned up the work area, disposing of any leftover material and debris. By following these systematic steps, we were able to successfully complete the siding installation process without needing a hammer. The use of the drill made for a more efficient and precise job, ensuring a longer-lasting and visually appealing finish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

No. The two questions are fundamentally different in their focus and the issues they seek to address. The first question, \\"If there are ants on your food do you leave it or eat it regardless?\\" is concerned with individual preferences and decision-making in a specific situation. This question is asking whether, in a scenario where ants are present on one's food, a person would choose to discard the food or consume it despite the ants' presence. This inquiry aims to gauge personal opinions and reactions to a potential real-life scenario that involves a level of disgust or health concerns. In contrast, the second question, \\"Why are people still eating McDonald's food?\\" addresses societal norms, consumer preferences, and potentially the health implications of fast food consumption. It asks why, despite the numerous concerns regarding the nutritional value and quality of fast food (in this case, McDonald's), people continue to patronize and consume such products. This inquiry considers broader concepts such as taste, convenience, affordability, and marketing strategies that might influence consumer choices. In summary, while both questions might touch upon aspects of eating and food decision-making, they are not the same.

They return to Texas to start their life together on the family ranch, Reata, where Bick's older sister Luz runs the household. Leslie meets Jett Rink, a local handyman, and he becomes infatuated with her. Leslie discovers on a ride with Jett that the local Mexican workers' living conditions are terrible. After tending to one of the Mexican children, Angel Obregon II, she presses Bick to take steps to improve their condition. When riding Leslie's beloved horse, War Winds, Luz expresses her hostility for Leslie by cruelly digging in her spurs; War Winds bucks her off, killing her. She leaves Jett a small piece of land on the Benedict ranch. Bick, who despises Jett, tries to buy back the land, but Jett refuses to sell. Jett makes the land his home and names it Little Reata. Over the next ten years, Leslie and Bick have twins, Jordan II (\\"Jordy\\") and Judy, and later have a daughter, Luz II.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What college did Lancaster attend between school and university? ? At the age of seventeen Lancaster passed his final school examinations and gained entrance to Lincoln College, Oxford, to study history. He persuaded his mother to allow him to leave Charterhouse at once, giving him several months between school and university, during which he enrolled on a course of life classes at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London. In October 1926 he started at Oxford. There, as at Charterhouse, he found two camps in which some students chose to group themselves: the \\"hearties\\" presented themselves as aggressively heterosexual and anti-intellectual; the \\"aesthetes\\" had a largely homosexual membership. Lancaster followed his elder contemporary Kenneth Clark in being contentedly heterosexual but nonetheless one of the aesthetes, and he was accepted as a leading member of their set. He cultivated the image of an Edwardian dandy, with large moustache, a monocle and check suits, modelling his persona to a considerable degree on Beerbohm, whom he admired greatly. He also absorbed some characteristics of the Oxford don Maurice Bowra; Lancaster's friend James Lees-Milne commented, \\"Bowra's influence over Osbert was marked, to the extent that he adopted the guru's booming voice, explosive emphasis of certain words and phrases, and habit in conversation of regaling his audiences with rehearsed witticisms and gossip.\\" Lancaster's undergraduate set included Stephen Spender, Randolph Churchill, and most importantly John Betjeman, who became a close friend and lifelong influence.Lancaster tried rowing with the Oxford University Boat Club, but quickly discovered that he was no more suited to that than he had been to field games at school. He joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), acted in supporting roles, designed programme covers, wrote, and choreographed. He contributed prose and drawings to Isis and Cherwell magazines, engaged in student pranks, staged an exhibition of his pictures, attended life classes, and became established as a major figure in the Oxonian social scene.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who opened the camp that used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge? The bank building was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building.

Input: Cdk5 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) family, which is activated by neuronal activators p35 or p39. Cdk5 regulates a variety of neuronal activities including migration, synaptic activity and neuronal death. p35 and p39 impart cytoplasmic membrane association of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5, respectively, through their myristoylation, but it is not clearly understood how the cellular localization is related to different functions. We investigated the role of Cdk5 activity in the subcellular localization of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5. Cdk5 activity affected the localization of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5 through phosphorylation of p35 or p39. Using unphosphorylated or phosphomimetic mutants of p35 and p39, we found that phosphorylation at Ser8, common to p35 and p39, by Cdk5 regulated the cytoplasmic localization and perinuclear accumulation of unphosphorylated S8A mutants, and whole cytoplasmic distribution of phosphomimetic S8E mutants. Cdk5 activity was necessary to retain Cdk5-activator complexes in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, small but distinct amounts of p35 and p39 were detected in the nucleus. In particular, nuclear p35 and p39 were increased when the Cdk5 activity was inhibited. p39 had a greater propensity to accumulate in the nucleus than p35, and phosphorylation at Thr84, specific to p39, regulated the potential nuclear localization activity of the Lys cluster in p39. These results suggest that the subcellular localization of the Cdk5-activator complexes is determined by its kinase activity, and also implicate a role for p39-Cdk5 in the nucleus.

Summarize this article: The woman who alleged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau touched her inappropriately some two decades ago issued a statement Friday saying the incident happened as described — but she now wants to be left alone. \\"I issue this statement reluctantly, in response to mounting media pressure to confirm that I was the reporter who was the subject of the Open Eyes editorial, published in the Creston Valley Advance in August of 2000,\\" Rose Knight, the former journalist, wrote. \\"The incident referred to in the editorial did occur, as reported. Mr. Trudeau did apologize the next day. I did not pursue the incident at the time and will not be pursuing the incident further. I have had no subsequent contact with Mr. Trudeau, before or after he became Prime Minister.\\" Knight, who said she has since left journalism, added she will not speak any further about the incident. \\"The debate, if it continues, will continue without my involvement,\\" she said. Trudeau was asked about Knight's statement while in Calgary for an investment announcement. \\"Over the past weeks, since this news resurfaced, I've been reflecting, we've all been reflecting, on past behaviours,\\" he said. \\"And as I've said, I'm confident I didn't act inappropriately, but I think the essence of this is people can experience interactions differently and part of the lesson we need to learn in this moment of collective awakening ... people in many cases, women, experience interactions in professional contexts and other contexts differently than men. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to reporters in Calgary on Friday 5:12 \\"I apologized in the moment because I had obviously perceived that she had experienced it in a different way than I acted or I experienced it.\\" The incident is alleged to have taken place in 2000 — when Trudeau was 28 — at the Kokanee Summit in Creston, B.C. The event was raising money for the Avalanche Foundation, a charity Trudeau became involved with after his brother, Michel, died in an avalanche in 1998. An unsigned editorial appeared in the Creston Valley Advance after the event accusing Trudeau of \\"groping\\" and \\"inappropriately handling\\" a young female reporter while she was on assignment. It suggests the woman felt \\"blatantly disrespected\\" but provides no other details about what occurred. The editorial in the Creston Valley Advance suggested that the day after the incident, Trudeau offered an apology of sorts: \\"I'm sorry,\\" he is quoted as saying. \\"If I had known you were reporting for a national paper I never would have been so forward.\\" The prime minister addressed that apology in detail on Thursday. \\"Again, I've been reflecting on the actual interaction and if I apologized later, then it would be because I sensed that she was not entirely comfortable with the interaction that we had,\\" Trudeau said. The allegations date back to a B.C. festival in August 2000 — an editorial accused Trudeau of \\"groping\\" and \\"inappropriately handling\\" an unnamed young female reporter. 2:29 \\"Like I said, I've been working very hard to try and piece it together, and even when the original editorial came out at the time I was fairly confident, I was very confident, that I hadn't acted in a way that I felt was in any way inappropriate.\\" Earlier this year, CBC News communicated by phone and email with Knight. She said she was not interested in being associated with any further coverage of the story. She also asked that her name not be used and that she not be contacted about the story again. A former co-worker remembers the reporter's account of the encounter. Valerie Bourne was the publisher of the Creston Valley Advance at the time and said the reporter was \\"distressed\\" by her contact with Trudeau. \\"My recollections of the conversation were that she came to me because she was unsettled by it. She didn't like what had happened,\\" said Bourne. \\"She wasn't sure how she should proceed with it because, of course, we're talking somebody who was known to the Canadian community.\\" Trudeau is expected to attend an event Saturday with Calgary MP Kent Hehr, who lost his cabinet post after an investigation into allegations of inappropriate conduct with women. The prime minister said the allegations levelled against him and those against the former minister of Sport and Disabilities are different. \\"I think people understand that every situation is different and we have to reflect and take seriously every situation on a case-by-case basis,\\" Trudeau said. \\"That's exactly what we're endeavouring to do.\\" ||||| CALGARY—A former newspaper reporter confirms Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized to her the day after what she says was an inappropriate encounter at a B.C. music festival almost two decades ago. Rose Knight also confirms she is the reporter that was referred to in an editorial 18 years ago in the Creston Valley Advance that said she was groped by Trudeau while covering the event. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday: “I’m confident that I did not act inappropriately but I think the essence of this is that people can experience interactions differently.” ( Chris Young / THE CANADIAN PRESS ) She says in a statement that appears to come from her email account that she did not take the matter any further at the time and doesn’t plan to do so now. “I enjoyed my career as a reporter, but it ended a long time ago. I avoided issuing a statement earlier out of concern for my and my family’s privacy,” she wrote Friday. “The incident referred to in the editorial did occur as reported. Mr. Trudeau did apologize the next day. “Beyond this statement, I will not be providing any further details or information. The debate, if it continues, will continue without my involvement.” Article Continued Below Trudeau said Friday that he respects Knight’s decision but remembers the encounter with her differently. “I’m confident that I did not act inappropriately but I think the essence of this is that people can experience interactions differently,” he said after an announcement in Calgary. Article Continued Below “Part of the lesson that we need to learn in this time of collective awakening is a level of respect and understanding for the fact that people, in many cases women, experience interactions in a professional context and other contexts differently than men.” Trudeau is to attend an event Saturday with Calgary MP Kent Hehr, who lost his cabinet post after an investigation into allegations of inappropriate conduct with women. The prime minister said the allegations levelled against him and those against the former minister of sport and disabilities are different. “I think people understand that every situation is different and we have to reflect and take seriously every situation on a case-by-case basis,” Trudeau said. “That’s exactly what we’re endeavouring to do.” The event in question was the Kokanee Summit festival in August 2000, which Trudeau attended to accept a donation to the Kokanee Glacier Alpine Campaign. The Trudeau family launched the campaign after his youngest brother, Michel, died in an avalanche in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park in 1998. The unsigned editorial said Trudeau “inappropriately handled’’ a reporter there to cover the event and apologized to her by saying, “If I had known you were reporting for a national paper, I never would have been so forward.’’ Alberta Premier Rachel Notley was asked about the allegations earlier Friday and said it’s important for women to be taken seriously if they come forward. “Once that happens, we have to make sure that there’s a very fair process and that everyone’s voice is heard,” she said. “I haven’t really dug in too much to the details of this situation and every situation is different. There’s no question about it.

Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question. Q: Passage: Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units and International System of Quantities. Time is used to define other quantities—such as velocity—so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. The operational definition leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from the counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured.

Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet (French: [ʒyl emil fʁedeʁik masnɛ]; 12 May 1842 – 13 August 1912) was a French composer of the Romantic era best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty. The two most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892). He also composed oratorios, ballets, orchestral works, incidental music, piano pieces, songs and other music. While still a schoolboy, Massenet was admitted to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became best known for his operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Like many prominent French composers of the period, Massenet became a professor at the Conservatoire. He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas. Among his students were Gustave Charpentier, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn and Gabriel Pierné. By the time of his death, Massenet was regarded by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted...

Miller A:","completion":"Title: Countdown to Chaos Genre: Action, Thriller Plot: The movie opens with a series of mysterious bombings occurring across various seemingly-unrelated targets in New York City, each explosion larger and more dangerous than the last. Law enforcement is scrambling to find the connection and put a stop to these acts of terror. Enter Jack Miller, a recently retired, highly skilled explosives expert formerly with the NYPD Bomb Squad. Despite stepping away from his law enforcement career, his unmatched expertise forces the department to recruit him as a consultant while they are under pressure to prevent the next blast, with fear and anxiety gripping the entire city. As Miller works to investigate these bombings, he begins to notice a complex pattern between the targets which leads him to unearth a vast array of personal files and a hidden, encrypted diary that once belonged to a mysterious person who went by the code name \\"Phantom.\\" Miller teams up with a rookie detective, Angela Ramirez, and together they decode the diary revealing it to have belonged to a former rogue military explosives specialist who was involved in covert operations. As they get closer to unveiling the true identity of the Phantom, the bombings become increasingly personal, with one bomb resulting in the tragic death of Miller's longtime friend and colleague. Now fueled by grief and vengeance, Miller and Ramirez work tirelessly to unveil the Phantom's network, unravel their plot, and bring them to justice. During a high-stakes race against time, Miller and Ramirez uncover that the Phantom, presumed to be dead, is actually alive and operating from the shadows with a new identity - Miller's former bomb squad partner and mentor, Tom Weston. Weston had secretly become disillusioned with his career and the government's agenda, turning into the cunning and ruthless mastermind behind the bombings. In a thrilling climax, Miller uses his unmatched skill and knowledge to defuse the most potentially devastating bomb yet, set to destroy a major city landmark. After disarming the device, Miller confronts his former mentor in a heart-stopping face-off that reveals deep, hidden motivations behind Weston's actions. After a pulse-pounding chase across the city, Miller apprehends Weston just as the police close in, saving New York City from a terrifying catastrophe. Having proved himself not just as an explosives expert, but as a true hero, Miller decides to permanently return to the force, working alongside Ramirez to continue protecting the city and chasing down evil. Countdown to Chaos is an action-packed, suspenseful rollercoaster ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat, giving audiences a thrilling glimpse into the life and mind of an explosives expert tasked with saving the city he loves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"It must be seen, and I want it acknowledged, as a departure from European law and practice.\\" said in Romanian?","completion":"In Romanian, the phrase \\"It must be seen, and I want it acknowledged, as a departure from European law and practice\\" would be translated as \\"Trebuie văzut, și îmi doresc să fie recunoscut, drept o abatere de la legea și practica europeană.\\" Let's break down the translation: 1. \\"It must be seen\\" is translated to \\"Trebuie văzut\\". In Romanian, the word \\"trebuie\\" expresses the necessity or obligation of something, and it can be understood as \\"must\\" or \\"have to\\" in English. \\"Văzut\\" is the past participle of \\"a vedea\\" which means \\"to see\\". The use of past participle here indicates that the action has to be completed. 2. \\"And I want it acknowledged\\" translates to \\"și îmi doresc să fie recunoscut\\". \\"Și\\" is the conjunction used to link words of the same part of speech, clauses, or sentences that are to be taken jointly, equivalent to \\"and\\". \\"Îmi doresc\\" means \\"I want\\", \\"să fie\\" translates to \\"to be\\", and \\"recunoscut\\" is the past participle of \\"a recunoaște\\", meaning \\"acknowledged\\" or \\"recognized\\". 3. \\"As a departure from European law and practice\\" becomes \\"drept o abatere de la legea și practica europeană\\". The word \\"drept\\" basically means \\"as\\", and can be used to introduce information. \\"O abatere\\" translates to \\"a departure\\", \\"de la\\" means \\"from\\", \\"legea și practica\\" is \\"law and practice\\", and \\"europeană\\" means \\"European\\".

Answer the following question: I heard that Carson broke their fall using the pillow but they still scraped their knee and it was bleeding. And I was wondering What will Carson want to do next? Answer:","completion":"Carson will likely want to follow a proper wound care procedure to ensure that their scraped knee heals effectively and to minimize the risk of infection. Here are the steps Carson should take: 1. Clean the wound: Carson should wash their hands with soap and water before touching the scraped knee. They should then gently clean the wound using water and a mild soap, or with an antiseptic solution or wipe to remove any dirt, debris, or germs. 2. Stop the bleeding: If the wound is still bleeding, Carson should apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth or sterile gauze for a few minutes, or until the bleeding stops. Elevating the injured area can also help to reduce blood flow to the area and minimize bleeding. 3. Apply an antibiotic ointment: Once the wound is clean and the bleeding has stopped, Carson should apply a thin layer of an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment to the scraped area to help prevent infection. 4. Cover the wound: Carson can then cover the scraped knee with a sterile bandage, adhesive bandage, or gauze pad, depending on the size and severity of the wound. This will help to keep the area clean and protected from further injury. 5. Monitor for signs of infection: Carson should keep an eye on the scraped knee for any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, increased pain, or discharge. If any of these symptoms develop, they should consult a healthcare professional for further guidance. 6. Change the dressing: Carson should replace the wound dressing as needed, ideally at least once a day, or when it becomes wet or dirty. They should also keep the wound clean and dry to promote healing. 7. Avoid picking at the scab: It is essential that Carson refrains from picking at the scab that forms over the wound, as this can delay healing and increase the risk of infection or scarring. Finally, Carson may want to take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to help manage any discomfort associated with the scraped knee."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Words like \\"sucked,\\" and \\"rude\\" show the intensity of the negativity they experienced during their visit. Notably, they use the phrase \\"fuck this place,\\" which is a powerful and clear-cut expression of disdain. 2. Unpleasant experience with the bouncer: The reviewer shares a negative experience they had with the bouncer, who was rude to them from the beginning. This not only dampens their mood but also has an impact on their overall experience at the establishment. 3. Accusation and mistreatment: The reviewer mentions being accused of drinking alcohol even though they ordered a non-alcoholic beverage. This accusation led to an undeserved and unjust ejection from the establishment, which understandably contributes to the negative sentiment. 4. Relationship between age and treatment: The reviewer brings up the fact that they are under 18 while their friends are over 21. It is implied that perhaps this difference in age could have had a role in their unfair treatment. 5. Inclusivity concerns: The reviewer identifies as a bisexual girl and came with friends who are gay men. It is not explicitly stated whether they believe their sexuality or gender identity is related to the issue at hand, but it contextualizes their experience at the establishment.

Select from: (I) coreference resolution; (II) chunking;","completion":"(I) coreference resolution Coreference resolution, the process of identifying and linking multiple mentions of the same entity in a text, is a problem that is still far from being solved. This has led to a surge in research in this area resulting in more work conducted on coreference resolution than chunking. Here are several reasons why coreference resolution remains a challenging field and continues to attract research efforts: 1. Ambiguity: Coreference resolution heavily relies on the understanding of context, syntax, and semantics to solve the inherent ambiguity present in the use of pronouns and other referring expressions in natural language. This demands sophisticated models that can deal with the complexities of real-world data. 2. Anaphora and Cataphora: Coreference resolution not only involves identifying anaphoric expressions (referring back to previously mentioned entities) but also cataphora (forward-looking references). Intertwining these two phenomena in a single model poses significant challenges. 3. Incomplete or missing information: In many cases, the information needed to resolve a reference is not explicitly mentioned in the text. This requires models to possess real-world knowledge and the ability to infer the missing pieces of information based on context. 4. Linguistic variations: The problem of coreference resolution spans across languages, each with its unique grammar rules, syntax, and dependencies. It necessitates cross-lingual approaches capable of handling diverse linguistic structures and challenges. 5. Scalability: Coreference resolution must be able to handle ever-increasing volumes of text data efficiently. Addressing this in large-scale applications continues to be an active area of research. 6. Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of coreference resolution systems in a reliable and standardized manner is a challenge in itself, primarily due to the complex nature of language and the lack of universally agreed-upon evaluation metrics and sample datasets. In contrast, chunking or shallow parsing (the task of identifying phrases in a text) is comparatively less complex and has seen significant advancements in recent years. Although the field continues to evolve, the overall progress has made the problem of chunking less critical in comparison to coreference resolution. Given the challenges and complexities mentioned above, coreference resolution has attracted more research and work efforts in comparison to chunking. A considerable breakthrough in coreference resolution would have wide-reaching implications in various natural language processing applications such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, information extraction, and question-answering systems, making it crucial for researchers to continue pursuing solutions to this challenging problem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere A:","completion":"The final step of the process is the intensification of the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change. When solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere, some of it is reflected back into space, while the rest is absorbed by the land and oceans, heating the Earth. The heat then radiates back towards space. However, some of that heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases, which helps maintain Earth's temperature at a level suitable for life. Human activities, including burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, agriculture, and industrial processes, have significantly increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The increase in these gases causes more heat radiation to be trapped within our atmosphere, enhancing the greenhouse effect. The result of the intensification of the greenhouse effect is global warming. This warming has observable consequences on the Earth's climate, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather events such as hurricanes and droughts, melting polar ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels, and changes in ecosystems and wildlife. To address this issue, efforts are being made to reduce human-caused greenhouse gas emissions through various mitigation strategies like increasing energy efficiency, transitioning to cleaner energy sources (wind, solar, and hydroelectric power), implementing carbon capture and storage technologies, and protecting and restoring forests. Additionally, adaptation measures like infrastructure improvements to protect coastal areas, water management strategies to handle droughts, and wildlife habitat conservation efforts are being developed to address the impacts of climate change on the environment and vulnerable communities. In summary, the final step in the process is the intensification of the greenhouse effect due to increased human activities, leading to global warming and climate change, which require both mitigation and adaptation efforts to address the environmental and societal impacts that result from these changes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How can I clean the inside of reusuable straws?","completion":"To clean reusable straws, you can use a little brush called a \\"straw cleaner\\". It's like a tiny broom that goes inside the straw and helps clean all the yucky stuff. Here's how: 1. Get some warm water and a little bit of soap. 2. Put the straw cleaner into the straw and wiggle it around. 3. Keep wiggling and scrubbing until the inside of the straw is clean. 4. Rinse the straw with water to wash away any soap left inside. And that's it! Your reusable straw will be all clean and ready for your next drink. Remember to clean it every time you use it, so it stays nice and clean for you."},{"prompt":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: power motor Review: motor works good the reason i gave it 4 stars is the lead that i needed was smashed and i had to cut my old one and use it.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The tuna will have been eaten. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence? OPTIONS: (a). unacceptable (b). acceptable","completion":"Option (b). Acceptable Evaluating the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence, \\"The tuna will have been eaten,\\" it appears to be acceptable. Various aspects of the sentence are well-constructed, and it demonstrates a strong command of English grammar. Here, we will carefully examine its grammatical structure, tense, subject-verb agreement, and effective message delivery. 1. Grammatical Structure: The sentence structure is straightforward and consists of an appropriate subject, verb, and object. \\"The tuna,\\" which is a countable noun, functions as the subject, \\"will have been eaten\\" is the verb phrase, and \\"eaten\\" is the past participle for the regular verb \\"eat.\\" 2. Tense: The verb tense used in this sentence is the \\"future perfect passive\\" tense. This tense is employed when talking about an action that will be completed at a specific point in the future, and the focus is on the result or the passive subject. The sentence construction is correct for this tense, as it follows the future perfect passive formula: \\"will have been\\" + past participle, which in this case is \\"will have been eaten.\\" This tense effectively conveys the intended message that the eating of the tuna will be completed at some point in the future. 3. Subject-verb Agreement: In this sentence, the subject \\"the tuna\\" agrees with the plural verb phrase \\"will have been eaten.\\" Due to the passive nature of the sentence, the agent performing the action is not stated, but the subject-verb agreement is still correctly implemented. 4. Effective Message Delivery: The sentence effectively communicates the intended meaning. It conveys that the tuna will be eaten at a certain point in the future, which can be particularly relevant in various contexts, such as when discussing potential food consumption, fishing, or marine life topics. In conclusion, the linguistic integrity of the sentence, \\"The tuna will have been eaten,\\" is acceptable. Its grammatical structure, tense, subject-verb agreement, and effective message delivery all contribute to the sentence being well-formed and comprehensible."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
