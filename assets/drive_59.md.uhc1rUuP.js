Solve this problem.","completion":"In order to solve the given equation, -7*p = 8 - 36, for the variable p, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify both sides of the equation if needed. In this case, we see that the right side of the equation can be simplified by combining like terms: 8 - 36 = -28 Now, our equation is: -7*p = -28 Step 2: Isolate the variable p. To isolate the variable p, we want to get rid of the coefficient -7 in front of it. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -7: (-7*p) / (-7) = -28 / (-7) Step 3: Simplify and solve for p. By dividing both sides of the equation by -7, the coefficient in front of p on the left side of the equation will cancel out, leaving us with: p = -28 / (-7) Now, perform the division on the right side of the equation: p = 4 So, the solution to the equation -7*p = 8 - 36 is: p = 4"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Caterpillars can hibernate outside in their containers all winter, or you can put it into the refrigerator. Don’t freeze your caterpillar. Your caterpillar will not eat while it’s hibernating, but it may be lightly active on warmer days. When it’s mildly active, it might eat available food. When your caterpillar wakes up in the spring, it’ll be ready to fatten up in preparation for its metamorphosis into a moth, which will take place later in the spring. Make sure that you provide your caterpillar enough food for it to get ready to turn into a pupa, which is its cocoon-phase. Your caterpillar’s fuzzy skin will slide off once it has fattened up, leaving a smooth black oval called a pupa. This is it’s cocoon phase. You can expect it to shed its exoskeleton during spring. Since you can’t pinpoint the actual date of your moth’s emergence, keep track of its progress each day. While your pupa does not need food, you may want to mist the caterpillar’s home daily to keep it humid. Simply spray a light spritz of water into the container. While their actual time in the pupa can vary, giant leopard moth caterpillars only take a few weeks to metamorphose into a moth.

Three years since it was discovered during excavations on an ancient cemetery, a rare bronze Roman cockerel has been given a permanent home. The 2nd century figurine is believed to be one of only nine ever found in the Roman Empire, and is part of a new exhibition at the Corinium Museum in the Cirencester. Other finds on display include a hoard of almost 1,500 Roman coins, and the perfectly preserved vase it was found in. This bronze and enamel cockerel was found in a child's grave in Roman Cirencester in 2011 - and has been painstakingly restored. It is now on display at the Corinium Museum. Archaeologists made the discoveries three years ago while excavating a western cemetery at the former Bridges Garage site on Tetbury Road in Cirencester - or Corinium as it was known when it was the second largest town in Roman Britain. The bronze and enamel cockerel was said to have been placed in the grave of the two-year-old Roman. girl by her parents, and experts believe it was used to ask the Gods to protect her. They also. believe the expensive gift was placed in the grave to ease their daughter's transition into the 'next world'. The child was buried wearing hobnailed. shoes and was accompanied by a pottery feeding vessel, and the remarkable. enamelled bronze figurine of a cockerel. The cockerel is 5-inches tall (12.5cm) and the breast, wings, eyes and ‘comb’ are inlaid with enamel, which now appears blue and green. There is a separately moulded tail plate, also enamelled, with ‘openwork’ decoration. The beak is shown open, in the act of crowing. It is believed that the Romans gave religious significance to the cockerel which was known to be connected with Mercury. Experts. claim it was Mercury, a messenger to the gods, that was also. responsible for conducting newly-deceased souls to the afterlife. Statues of this god, including one in the Corinium Museum, commonly show a cockerel at the base. The association probably stems from Mercury’s role as the messenger to the gods and that of the cockerel as ‘announcer’ of the new dawn. Mercury was also the ‘herdsman for the dead’, guiding newly deceased souls on their passage to the afterlife. It is therefore possible that the cockerel was an offering by a devotee of Mercury and expresses a parent’s particular concern to ensure safe transit of a loved one into the after world. 'It is the most significant Roman cemetery investigation in the town since the early 1970s,' said a spokesman for the town’s Corinium Museum. 'The cockerel found underneath the former Bridge’s Garage site - now St James’s Place - is one of only nine known cockerel figurines from the Roman world, and is the only example with its tail intact. 'Displayed with the cockerel are an exceptional example of a Roman flagon and a selection of jewellery which include beads and bracelets found in a richly furnished child’s grave. 'These are high status objects, which give a fascinating insight into the people of Corinium. Neil Holbrook, Chief Executive of Cotswold Archaeology added: 'The. cockerel is the most spectacular find from more than 60 Roman burials. excavated at this site. 'It was excavated from the grave of young child. and was placed close to its head. Interestingly a very similar item was. found in Cologne in Germany and it looks like they both could have come. from the same workshop based in Britain.' The Tetbury Hoard, also on display at the museum, contain 1,437 silver and copper-alloy 3rd century Roman coins. 'The hoard is the museum’s first Roman Coin Hoard and comes from a fascinating period of political upheaval across the Roman Empire,' continued the museum's spokesman. 'It was a time of rapid succession of rulers and usurpers. The coins themselves tell this story. 'Depictions and inscriptions represent 12 emperors from just a 16 year period.' The child was buried wearing hobnailed. shoes and was accompanied by a pottery feeding vessel and the remarkable. enamelled bronze figurine of a cockerel. The cockerel is 5-inches tall (12.5cm) and the breast, wings, eyes and ‘comb’ are inlaid with enamel, which now appears blue and green.

The cockerel (pictured) is 5-inches tall (12.5cm) and the breast, wings, and eyes are inlaid with enamel. The conservation work took four months to be painstakingly carried out by experts. Archaeologist Neil Holbrook, from Cotswold Archaeology, said the work had 'exceeded expectations', particularly for highlighting its fine enamel detail. 'It reinforces what a fantastic article this is and how highly prized and expensive it must have been,' he said. 'This must have cost, in current money, thousands of pounds to buy and countless hours to make, and so to actually put this into the grave of a two or three-year-old child is not something that you would do lightly. 'It really shows that this was a very wealthy, important family, and signifies the love that the parents had for the dead child.' A burial site was unearthed at the. site including more than 40 burials and four cremations; something. experts said was the largest archaeological find in the town since the. 1970s. This. particular figurine is one of only four ever found in Britain, with a. total of eight known from the whole of the Roman Empire. Mr Holbrook added: 'Without a doubt this is the best Roman cockerel ever found in Britain. 'This is the best find that I have seen come out of Cirencester in 30 to 40 years and is of national significance.' The. object is believed to have been made in northern Britain, with evidence. pointing to a workshop in Castleford, West Yorkshire, which made enamel. artefacts. Talks are under way to find a permanent display site for the cockerel, possibly at the Corinium Museum in Cirencester. Only nine similar cockerel figurines are known from the Roman world, including four from Britain. The similarities in construction and decoration suggest that they were made at roughly the same time and could have come from the same workshop. Our example is the only one from Britain to have come from a grave and the only one from any location to have survived with a tail. The two which are closest in form are from Cologne in Germany and Buchten in the Netherlands. In these examples the enamelling survives in the original colours of yellow, blue and red and it is probable that the Cirencester example was originally just as brightly coloured. Britain produced some of the finest enamelled objects in the Roman Empire and these were traded as far afield as Germany, France, Spain and Italy. The four enamelled cockerels from the continent all come from Germany and the Low Countries. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Idaho's Dog Bark Park Inn, a bed & breakfast guesthouse inside the World's Biggest Beagle, is the pet project of married chainsaw artists Dennis Sullivan and Frances Conklin. The pair built 30-foot-high 'Sweet Willy' in 1997, funded through sales of miniature dog carvings. Scroll down for video. Howling success: Idaho's Dog Bark Park Inn is a bed & breakfast guesthouse inside the World's Biggest Beagle. Pet project: Husband and wife chainsaw artists Dennis Sullivan and Frances Conklin built their beagle inn in 1997. Needless to say - the Trojan-horse style abode is very dog-friendly. According to their Facebook page, the B&B proprietors 'created Dog Bark Park as a venue to make, display and sell their chainsaw sculptures.' They then decided to build the two big beagles, Sweet Willy and 12-foot-high Toby, 'to add to the dog theme of their work.' The dog lovers have said they chose the beagle for their architectural feat because it was a safe bet. 'It was the first breed of dog Dennis started carving 28 years ago and it remains a best-seller all this time,' Conklin told BBC. 'Plus, it is a politically correct breed since there are no horror stories about it.' Sweet Willy sleeps four, with a queen bed in the main section and two twin futons in. the head, all decked out with canine-inspired furnishings. Guests enter the beagle's. body from a private second story deck, and are treated to dog-shaped biscuits left on their pillows. Sweet Willy is open from April 1 to October 31 as a guesthouse, but generally open year-round for visitors who just want to check out the Cottonwood park. Barking mad: Some of the dog's decorative furnishings are carvings by Dog Bark Park chainsaw artists Dennis Sullivan and Frances Conklin. Special touches: The canine carvings of Dennis Sullivan and Frances Conklin are dotted around the estate. Sweet Willy: It took the owners nearly three years to build this massive beagle. The sprawling Dog Bark Park is located in the heart of Idaho's Camas Prairie, 'where wheat, barley, canola, blue grass and hay are the dominant crops' Highlights:","completion":"1.

Question: What was the name of the snuff mill that was replaced by a bridge? Answer the above question based on the context below: The newest bridge across the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a pedestrian footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge. It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river, and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron overshot wheel, was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill has been the subject of a feasibility study by the South Somerset Hydropower Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works, founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages.

A Colorado Sheriff is speaking out over the says the death of Harold Henthorn's first wife, Lynn, in 1995, claiming it was not an accident, despite his department reaching that conclusion 20 years ago. 'Based upon the information I've been briefed on up to this date … I do not think it's an accident,' Sheriff Tony Spurlock told CBS4 in an exclusive interview. 'I don't think it was an accident and I think it's very suspicious,' said Sheriff Spurlock, who became the Douglas County sheriff last month. Last year Harold Henthorn, 58, was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder in the death of hi second wife Dr Toni Henthorn, 50. Scroll down for video... First wife: Henthorn's first wife, Lynn, also died in a remote location with her husband as the only witness. Accused: Harold Henthorn, left, has been accused of murdering his second wife, Dr Toni Henthorn, right, who fell to her death while the couple took a hike at Rocky Mountain National Park in September 2012. An autopsy report says she fell or was pushed over the ledge when she paused to take a photo during a hike on Sept. 29, 2012. The couple was visiting the park for their 12th wedding anniversary. Harold Henthorn told investigators his wife slipped and fell, but prosecutors didn't buy his explanation and charged him with murder last November. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial in May. Only after her death did Toni Henthorn's relatives realize she was covered by three life insurance policies totaling 4.5 million. A claim was sent in for one policy just days after she died, court records show. Harold Henthorn's attorney, Craig L. Truman, has said that the case is complicated and that 'justice will be done' once the facts come to light. Loss: His first wife, Sandra Lynn, was killed in a freak accident when their car crushed her as she changed a flat tire. But now attention has shifted to Henthorn's first wife, Sandra Lynn Henthorn, 30, who also died in mysterious circumstances. She was crushed to death in 1995 when a car slipped off a jack while she and Harold were changing a flat tire. Reports emerged showing that Dr Henthorn, who had one daughter, also had life insurance policies to the value of 4.5 million - and that a claim was made on one of the policies just two days after her death. The indictment says Harold Henthorn, who was the only witness to her death, 'willfully, deliberately, maliciously and with premeditation and malice aforethought did unlawfully kill his wife', CBS reported. He told authorities that his wife had been reaching under the car to help him change the front tire on their Jeep Cherokee on the rural road, when the jack slipped and the Jeep fell on his wife, crushing her. Harold Henthorn collected nearly 500,000 in life insurance proceeds from his wife's death. Detectives closed the case just one week after the investigation, ruling the death an accident, but the Douglas County Sheriff's Office told CBS4 that they have now re-opened the investigation. A source told the channel that Henthorn had taken out a 300,000 insurance policy on his wife. It added that three life insurance policies had been taken out on his second wife - each valued at 1.5 million - and that efforts had been made to collect on it on the first business day after her death. Changing his mind: Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock says the death of Harold Henthorn's first wife, Lynn, in 1995 was not an accident, despite his department reaching that conclusion 20 years ago. How she died: As he changed the tire, his wife crawled under the Jeep, apparently to retrieve a lug nut or flashlight, when he said a jack gave way or slipped and the Jeep fell, crushing her. Harold Henthorn collected nearly 500,000 in life insurance proceeds from his wife's death. One of the policies named the Harold and Toni Henthorn Trust as the beneficiary and a claim was sent in for the policy on October 1, 2012, CBS reported. No payment was made, however. The Douglas County coroner wrote 'this is an accidental death' on May 9, two days after Lynn Henthorn died. It is not clear who attempted to file a claim for the policy. The claim was made before her body was cremated or a memorial service was held. Dr Henthorn, an ophthalmologist, had been married to her husband for 12 years. She left behind a daughter, then seven. Douglas County investigators reopened the Lynn Henthorn death two weeks after the death of Toni Henthorn in 2012. They say they have done 40 interviews in the past 27 months and continue to diligently work the case. That information leads my detectives to determine this is probably not an accident,' emphasized Spurlock. Some have accused the local police of botching the investigation. Items and paperwork went missing at the time, hence the need for a follow-up. Case closed: The coroner wrote 'this is an accidental death' on May 9 1995, two days after Lynn Henthorn died. Three days later, on May 12, six days after the death, the Douglas County Sheriff's Department followed suit, closing the case as an accidental death and ruling no criminal charges should be filed. Oversight: Some are now asking if the Douglas County Sheriff’s Department mishandled the investigation into Lynn Henthorn’s death the first time around. At the time Henthorn told investigators several different and conflicting stories of what he did after r the Jeep fell on his wife. He told some that he gave her CPR and helped get her out from under the vehicle. He told others he did not give her CPR and was unsure of how she was pulled out from under the Jeep. One investigator said he looked over Henthorn's hands and noticed no unusual marks, bruises or scratches that might have indicated an attempt to pull the car off his wife. Even the flashlight was found under his car in the 'off' position yet no questions were raised about it. In an interview with a Douglas County investigator, Harold Henthorn said he had been having a lot of flat tires recently 'due to construction in the area of their home. There is one tire with a nail in it in their garage at home.' The file indicates there was no follow up done to locate the tire Henthorn talked about to verify that part of his story. On the evening of the accident Patricia Montoya was returning to Denver on Highway 67 with a group of friends and family members. They stopped to help Henthorn and his stricken wife. 'He didn't want us to touch her,' Montoya told CBS4. 'It was a creepy feeling that he gave all of us.' Stories: Harold Henthorn told different sheriff’s investigators shifting versions of what happened in the hours before Lynn Henthorn's death, but police did not pursue the discrepancies or attempt to pin Henthorn down. She said her group immediately began administering CPR to Lynn Henthorn, angering Harold Henthorn, who did not want anyone to touch his wife. And Montoya said when they placed their jackets over Lynn to keep her warm, 'The husband wouldn't take his coat off for her, he wouldn't take the coat off to cover her. We all felt the same oddness. It was creepy, it was like he was trying to harm her,' said Montoya. She said everyone in her group came away from that evening with the same feeling. 'We all said that he probably set it up to where that car fell on her and that was all our thoughts. We all thought the same thing. It didn't seem like that was an accident.' She shared her thoughts with the police yet nobody came to interview her about what her suspicions or what she had witnessed. 'We were all very surprised. We all felt they would come and find us. And they never did.' Only when the case was reopened in October 2012 did investigators seek her out and interview her about that night. Now in documents that provide further damning detail of the deaths of both Toni Bertolet Henthorn and Lynn Rishell Henthorn the prosecution has highlighted the similarities between both women's passing. Both deaths, the documents state, 'involved bizarre 'accidents.' Both left Henthorn with significant insurance benefits. He is beneficiary or trustee on three policies on Toni, totaling around 4.5million and received a 500,000 pay out on the death of his first wife. Both occurred in remote locations. Both times Henthorn was the lone witness. Both deaths occurred after about 12 years of marriage. Henthorn told wildly varying stories about both deaths. Witness: Patricia Montoya was returning to the Denver metro area with a group of friends. They stopped to help Henthorn and his stricken wife. Harold Henthorn's behavior was strange but the police didn't want to know. New tact: Tony Spurlock said investigators are employing new techniques and digging up new information on Lynn Henthorn’s death. He is optimistic that the reopened investigation will have a positive result. According to the documents the man who met his second wife on a Christian dating website, even told a Sunday school class that his first wife died of cancer and lost a baby she was carrying to chemotherapy. In the case of his second wife, an incident which happened just two years after she almost died when she was struck by a wooden beam Harold had thrown off their deck is disclosed in the documents. After that incident, Harold joked to friends: 'I was trying to kill my wife.' In both situations, the documents continue, the women were doing atypical things when they died. Lynn Henthorn was 'fastidious in dress and a cautious women who would not ordinarily crawl under a jacked-up car to search for lug nuts while wearing a nice sweater, especially after exploratory surgery only two weeks earlier.' Sheriff Spurlock is attempting to reassure the public that things will be different this time around and that there will be a positive outcome. He says investigators are employing new techniques and digging up new information on Lynn Henthorn's death. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Harold Henthorn's first wife, Lynn, died in 1995 in a supposed accident while changing a flat tire.

Adjudicators noted his thumbnail measured an unbelievable 197.8cm and curled into a tight coil at the end. \\"When I had my nails I took special care of them because they're a very delicate part of our body, I took care of them for a lifetime,\\" he said. The nails prevented him from sleeping properly — he had to wake up regularly to check they weren't being crushed. \\"I spent 66 years of my life on my nails,\\" Mr Chillal said. \\"It was a very difficult decision for me to cut my nails, but when I realised after cutting them they'd be at Ripley's Believe it or Not, and the museum is going to maintain them … then I felt like I was making the right decision, and that's when I decided to cut my nails.\\" The weight of the long nails left Mr Chillal's hand in a permanently fixed position, unable to separate his fingers.

Each website and application entails different social expectations, some of which may be unmentioned. Browse the Internet to determine what forms these expectations can take. It is often considered common courtesy, for example, to message a distant acquaintance on Facebook with a brief greeting before adding them as a friend. If a website or application does list any social expectations, of course, it is good practice to follow them. Many online forums, including the more updated and newfangled Reddit, will list their rules of engagement. Breaking these rules can lead to social exclusion and, at worst, banishment from the site or application. Note that online forums will often contain different messaging boards with their own unique sets of rules--don't presume that one subforum's rules will necessarily apply to another subforum. For example, Reddit's messaging board \\"askphilosophy\\" permits you to post open-ended questions, but its messaging board \\"philosophy\\" only permits you to post questions that are followed by some sort of argument or position. Meeting people online can be incredibly intimidating, but at some point the only way to succeed is simply by going forth and actually engaging people! Remember that the relative anonymity of the Internet means that you'll be able to retreat from uncomfortable situations at any time, which is helpful to remember if you end up needing to escape an awkward interaction. On the other hand, this same anonymity is what enables certain individuals to act more rashly or harshly than they otherwise would, and so it is important to disengage with these individuals and realize that their opinions have no bearing on the real, offline you.

From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant. For the first time in United States history, an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as a Seattle city councillor in 1991. The majority of the city council is female.Federally, Seattle is split... answer the following question: What is the full name of the representative of the 7th congressional district that includes the city that elected Jenny Durkan as mayor in 2017?

Here is a rough translation of the given text to English: \\"I thank you for your understanding and will make sure that this does not happen again.\\" Finnish language is known for its unique features and complex grammar. Some of the main characteristics include vowel harmony, which ensures that certain vowels are grouped together within a word, and the extensive use of agglutination, in which multiple suffixes are attached to a word to convey its meaning. For example, the structure of words in Finnish usually involves adding a root and one or more suffixes to create nouns, adjectives, verbs, and other word forms. Moreover, Finnish is known for its 15 cases that help in expressing various grammatical relations such as location, possession, direction, and more. The Finnish vocabulary has also been influenced by other languages, with loanwords borrowed from Germanic, Slavic, and Baltic languages, as well as from modern languages such as English. Additionally, the Finnish alphabet uses the Latin script, with a few additional letters.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the names of the two major river systems fur traders arrived on to get to Manitoba? from the following article ? Manitoba ( (listen)) is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada. It is often considered one of the three prairie provinces (with Alberta and Saskatchewan) and is Canada's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.3 million people. Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres (250,900 sq mi) with a widely varied landscape, stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States. The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. Aboriginal peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years. In the late 17th century, fur traders arrived on two major river systems, what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system. A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert's Land. During the next 200 years, communities continued to grow and evolve, with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg. The assertion of Métis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba. There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the Métis people against the Government of Canada, a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion. The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province. Manitoba's capital and largest city, Winnipeg, is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada. Other census agglomerations in the province are Brandon, Steinbach, Portage la Prairie, and Thompson.

Answer:","completion":"The Great Chicago Fire, one of the most devastating urban fires in history, started on October 8th, 1871, and continued to burn until October 10th, 1871. The fire caused widespread destruction across the city of Chicago, claiming the lives of approximately 300 people, leaving around 100,000 more homeless, and causing massive property damage that was estimated to be around 200 million at the time (which would be around 4.5 billion in today's value). The fire reportedly originated in a small barn owned by the O'Leary family, located at 137 DeKoven Street, in the neighborhood now known as the Near South Side. There are several theories and urban legends surrounding the cause of the fire, with the most famous being that it started when a cow, owned by Catherine O'Leary, kicked over a lantern. However, this theory has since been largely discredited. The fire spread rapidly across the primarily wooden structures that made up most of Chicago's buildings at the time. The strong winds and dry conditions further fueled the fire, making it extremely difficult for firefighters to control. The fire was eventually brought under control on October 10th, after significant rainfall began to extinguish the remaining flames. The aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire led to significant changes in building codes and construction materials, with the aim of preventing similar catastrophes in the future. It also became the catalyst for the rapid rebirth and growth of the city, as the rebuilding efforts attracted investment, innovation, and development in industries such as architecture, infrastructure, and urban planning. Today, the Great Chicago Fire remains a significant event in the history of Chicago, shaping the city's remarkable resilience and development into a major global metropolis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If The Ark, on Eustace Street in Temple Bar, is a children's cultural center that offers a changing program of plays, workshops, readings, and performances, all geared toward youngsters., can we conclude that \\"The Ark is for animals.\\"?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"The Ark is for animals\\" based solely on the information provided. The Ark, located on Eustace Street in Temple Bar, is indeed a children's cultural center that offers a diverse range of activities such as plays, workshops, readings, and performances, all aimed at young children. However, the name \\"The Ark\\" appears to be a metaphorical reference and should not be taken literally. In religious and historical contexts, the term \\"ark\\" often refers to a large boat or vessel, such as Noah's Ark from the biblical story, which carried pairs of animals to survive the Great Flood. While the name evokes an image of a sanctuary or protective space, there is no indication that The Ark in Temple Bar directly caters to or involves animals. In the case of The Ark children's cultural center, the name likely refers to providing a safe, nurturing, and creative space for young children to explore and learn through various interactive activities and performances.

U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment. \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. Where is the location of the Boko Haram? - Nigeria - West Africa - United States - not enough information","completion":"The U.S. President Donald Trump's meeting with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday was aimed at resetting the U.S.'s relationship with Africa, especially after the controversies sparked by Trump's alleged derogatory comments about African countries. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump. During the public remarks with Buhari, Trump emphasized their common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. He jokingly referred to their mutual appreciation for helicopters and brought up the 600 million military sales deal between the U.S. and Nigeria, which had been previously suspended by the Obama administration over allegations of human rights abuses. Buhari expressed his gratitude for Trump's decision to approve the deal, enabling Nigeria to make the purchase. Trump highlighted the quality of the U.S. military equipment and affirmed that their friends could now buy it. However, Nigerian military forces have been accused of human rights violations, including torture, rape, and extrajudicial killings, in their ongoing nearly decade-long campaign against Boko Haram, an extremist group responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people and the abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls. This group has gained notoriety, spreading to neighboring countries and posing a severe threat to West Africa's Sahel region. The relationship between the U.S. and Nigeria has faced challenges over the past year, particularly following Trump's purported comments about African countries in January, which led Nigeria and other African countries to demand an explanation from the U.S. ambassador. Though the alleged comments were not confirmed, Buhari chose to remain silent on the matter during his private meeting with Trump. He stated, \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about others than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B.

During the 1930s, the Navy contracted a 1.5 million dredging of Pearl Harbor to allow larger battleships and the fleet's carriers to enter it. Work began in May 1940 resulting in 13,000,000 cubic yards (9,900,000 m3) of material dredged from the opening of Pearl Harbor to build a channel to Ford Island as well as to create a turning channel around the island. Material was also dredged to deepen the West Loch, East Loch, and Middle Loch for the mooring of battleships. With dredged material used as land fill, the island's size was increased from 334 acres (135 ha) to 441 acres (178 ha).The Navy replaced its PK, F5L, and H16 aircraft with newer models (see table below). In 1933 VP-8F arrived on station, and in 1935 the army bombers had become too large to be maintained and stored at Luke Field. Construction began on a new Army airfield, Hickam Army Airfield, named after pioneer U.S. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Colonel Horace Meek Hickam. From 1936 to 1940 Pan American flew its Clipper service into Ford Island, using it as a refueling stop between the United States and Asia. The Navy built a 25,000 boathouse, spent 579,565 on a new crew barracks and built a firehouse, water-supply and lighting systems. In June 1936 the Navy lengthened the island's landing field by 400 feet (120 m), to 3,000 feet (910 m). In March 1937 Amelia Earhart, on her second visit to Luke Field, crashed her Lockheed Electra on takeoff. In 1939, after three years of construction, Hickam Field opened. The Army transferred its operations there, leaving Luke Field under Navy control. The latter was renamed Naval Air Station Ford Island, and became the headquarters of Patrol Wing 2; its former namesake was re-honored with a new base, Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. A September 8, 1939, presidential emergency proclamation spurred the rapid construction of new facilities to prepare the island for additional operations. This included additional barracks, a new assembly and repair hangar, an administration building, a dispensary, a control...

Possible A: hungry, gas, obesity, gain weight, feeling full Why is \\"gain weight\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Gain weight\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because the user's question describes a scenario where the individual is consuming an excessive amount of food and not engaging in enough physical activity to balance it out. This behavior typically leads to a surplus of calories, which the body stores as fat. Step-by-step justification: 1. The question states that the person is \\"eating too much,\\" implying that they are consuming more calories than their body requires to maintain its current weight. 2. Additionally, the question states that the person is \\"not exercising enough.\\" Exercise helps burn calories, which can offset a portion of the calorie intake. 3. When an individual takes in more calories than they burn, the body stores the excess energy as fat, leading to weight gain. 4. Comparing the possible answers, \\"gain weight\\" is the most appropriate outcome, as it directly follows the cause-and-effect relationship of consuming too many calories without sufficient exercise. 5. In contrast, \\"hungry,\\" \\"gas,\\" and \\"feeling full\\" do not necessarily relate to the long-term outcome of the person's habits, and \\"obesity\\" assumes a more severe level of weight gain, making \\"gain weight\\" a more general and accurate answer based on the information provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a new situation: John was sitting at point C near a railway track. Suddenly, he heard a train coming towards him from point A with constant sound of its horn. Eventually, it reached very close to him at point B. Then the train sped by him at point C where he was sitting, reaching point D after some time. Finally, it reached even farther from him at point E. But I can use this background: Look at the police car in Figure below . The sound waves from its siren travel outward in all directions. Because the car is racing forward (toward the right), the sound waves get bunched up in front of the car and spread out behind it. As the car approaches the person on the right (position B), the sound waves get closer and closer together. In other words, they have a higher frequency. This makes the siren sound higher in pitch. After the car speeds by the person on the left (position A), the sound waves get more and more spread out, so they have a lower frequency. This makes the siren sound lower in pitch. A change in the frequency of sound waves, relative to a stationary listener, when the source of the sound waves is moving is called the Doppler effect . You’ve probably experienced the Doppler effect yourself. The next time a vehicle with a siren races by, listen for the change in pitch. For an online animation of the Doppler effect, go to the URL below. What is an answer for this question: Which point would have lower frequency, point D or point E? Answer:","completion":"Based on the Doppler effect, the point with a lower frequency would be point E. To elaborate, when the train is moving towards John (from point A to point B), the sound waves get compressed, leading to a higher frequency. This causes the pitch of the horn to sound higher. As the train passes by John at point C and continues moving further away from him (from point C to point D and eventually to point E), the sound waves become more spread out. This results in a lower frequency, and thus a lower pitch. The frequency of the sound waves decreases continually as the train moves away from John. Therefore, point E would have a lower frequency compared to point D, since the train is further away from John at point E than at point D."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

HTC's new flagship smartphone, the One, is an impressive bit of hardware and a big step forward for the company in three significant ways. The One is a top-notch, beautifully designed handset packed with the best specs and a ton of compelling features. It also runs a unique, fresh take on Google's Android operating system. And it's available in exactly the same configuration across the three major U.S. carriers. This is the phone that could close the gap between HTC's flagship and those from Apple and Samsung. We spent a couple of hours with the One before its big unveiling in New York today, and were thoroughly impressed by the luxurious materials used on the handset, the expert build quality holding it all together, and a slew of thoughtfully crafted software features. Although the phone carries the branding established last year with the One X, One S, and other HTC phones, the One amounts to a reboot of the company's vision for Android. The One X, HTC's previous flagship, won critical praise, but as an AT&T exclusive it failed to generate the sales the company had hoped for. \\"We think about the One X and we think 'Wow, it was big, and it was one of the best phones we've ever done,'\\" Scott Croyle, HTC's vice president of design, said. \\"But if I were to compare it to, say, other stuff that was out there, I wouldn't say it was a step-change different.\\" The company set out to build a phone that could surpass, not just meet, the performance and quality of the Apple iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy SIII. So it put a huge effort into nailing the Sense user interface, packing the phone with the best tech and broadening its reach across carriers. Sense 4, the previous generation of HTC's Android customization, has been thrown out. Every aspect of Sense has been rethought and redesigned. The result is a slick, clean user interface, full of artful icons that match the flat, understated look Google has been trying to push with its own stock version of Android. And there's a focus in the new Sense on making things that users commonly do easier and more intuitive — such as sifting through social media and news apps, or snapping photos and video. \\"I think we came to this recognition that, 'Wow, there are these two other companies that are going to spend a lot more money than HTC,'\\" Croyle said. \\"This is the reality of the business. They have much deeper pockets and they can carpet bomb the industry and they have a tremendous amount of inertia there, particularly with Apple in the U.S. So, for the One, we really had to get it right, we really had to just go for it.\\" While it's easy to see the chamfered edges found on the One and think of the iPhone 5, the One is far from a copycat product. It has a massive — and gorgeous — 4.7-inch 1080p display with a pixel density of 468 pixels per inch. As with nearly every flagship phone out there nowadays, pixels are indiscernible on the One's generous display. Colors look vivid and crisp as well. The touchscreen dominates the front of the One, with aluminum capping each end. Rows of pinholes are machined into each strip of aluminum, serving as pathways for sound coming from a set of dual front-facing speakers. Every phone speaker we've ever heard has sounded like hell. While the One won't replace your Jambox anytime soon, its onboard speakers sound immensely better than anything we've heard from a phone. Inside, the One features a 1.7GHz, quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU, 2GB of RAM, and NFC chip, Bluetooth 4.0 and connectivity to both HSPA and LTE networks. Everything is packed into a sleek, aluminum unibody — shipping in either silver or black — that features a subtly curved back with inlaid antennas. The One weighs 5.04 ounces, and is just 0.36 inches thick. The One will also sports a beefed up camera, with a ton of photo and video features — which are so plentiful we've written a separate story focusing on the One's camera. Along with all new hardware, HTC is using the One to introduce an all new take on Android. Sense 4, HTC's last skin, was among the best versions of Google's mobile OS thanks to its simplicity and gimmick-free implementation. The latest version — now just called Sense — brings users from a lock screen to a new Flipboard-like app called BlinkFeed, which displays a feed of information, stories, photos and video from various sources of your choosing. HTC has worked in integration with a few news outlets, so news stories by topic or by outlet can show up in your BlinkFeed. And the app can be connected to Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and other social networks as well. See a news story you're interested in reading? Just tap the tile in your feed and you're taken to a view that shows the story and its accompanying artwork in a presentation that makes reading clean and easy — again, very much like Flipboard, Pocket, Pulse and other \\"read it later\\" services. Tap a tweet or post from Facebook you'll be launched into that corresponding social network's Android app. You can even set up BlinkFeed to pipe in your photos and videos. Everything is displayed in reverse chronological order, just like your Twitter timeline, Facebook feed and everything else that's sorted online. While BlinkFeed is a pre-installed app, it's also the default view any One user will see once they unlock their phone. If you want to get to a traditional Android homescreen view — with apps, widgets and folders of apps — just swipe in from the right on BlinkFeed and Android as you know it will appear. \\"If you want regular Android, it's there,\\" Croyle said. \\"But, everybody's snacking on information, whether it's from their social networks or some news source that they're just interested in. So [BlinkFeed] really is geared around that recognition of how people are actually using their phones.\\" AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile will sell the One, along with many smaller regional telecom companies. The significance of this can't be overstated. Currently, only Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S III are offered as widely. The iPhone is sold through AT&T, Sprint and Verizion — and it's on it's way to T-Mobile. The S III is sold by all four of the nation's top carriers. All too often, a great phone, like last year's One X, was confined to a limited audience due to carriers wanting exclusive rights to phones. The fact that the One is joining it's biggest rivals in a new paradigm that bucks the idea of exclusive phones is a good thing for HTC — because they get to sell their best device in more places — and consumers — because you have more choice when you go to buy your next phone.

Метки и теги (Label/Tag) в Mental Ray Метки и теги представляют собой инструменты для идентификации и группировки объектов, материалов и других элементов в сцене. Они могут быть использованы для определения настроек отображения или для применения определенных эффектов только к определенным группам объектов. Примеры использования меток и тегов: - Чтобы применить определенный материал к группе объектов - Чтобы контролировать видимость или прозрачность определенных групп объектов - Чтобыугольник контролировать, какие объекты будут включены в проход рендеринга 2. Проходы покрытия (Coverage Passes) в Mental Ray Проходы покрытия - это процесс рендеринга сцены в несколько этапов, где каждый этап фокусируется на определенном аспекте изображения. Этот метод улучшает производительность рендеринга, т.к. позволяет рендерить только те части сцены, которые необходимы для конкретного прохода. Проходы покрытия обычно используются для создания разных версий сцены, таких как версия с основными элементами и версия с дополнительными объектами или эффектами. Эти версии затем могут быть объединены друг с другом, чтобы создать окончательное изображение. Примеры проходов покрытия: - Проход освещения: фокусируется на освещении сцены и формировании теней - Проход материалов: фокусируется на применении материалов, текстур и отражений на объекты - Проход глубины: фокусируется на определении глубины каждого объекта сцены - Проход сглаживания: улучшает границы объектов и формирует более плавные и реалистичные изображения В целом, использование меток, тегов и проходов покрытия в Mental Ray позволяет пользователю улучшить качество изображений, оптимизировать рабочий процесс и снизить время рендеринга.

This is because brass is a harder material and has a higher resonant frequency compared to gold, which is much softer and will produce a duller, more muted sound. The second option is not reliable because both brass and gold can be scratched with a rock, as they are both relatively soft metals. Brass has a Mohs hardness of 3-4, while gold has a Mohs hardness of 2.5-3. Scratching the surface wouldn't provide conclusive evidence to distinguish between the two materials."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The law allowing registered Uruguayans over 18 to buy up to 40g (1,4oz) of the drug a month is not expected to come into force before April. The government hopes it will help tackle drug cartels, but critics say it will expose more people to drugs. By Ignacio de los ReyesBBC Mundo, Montevideo This was a huge victory for the cannabis-smoking community in Uruguay. Hundreds of young people gathered outside Congress in Montevideo to follow the vote on a giant screen. Many shared a joint of marijuana with their friends. They partied amid reggae music and some waved marijuana leaves. There was an atmosphere of celebration inside the Senate too, with dozens of supporters of President Mujica following the nearly 14 hours of the debate from the spectators' gallery. But not everyone was happy about this law. Senator Pedro Bordaberry of the conservative Red Party told the BBC his country should not become a \\"guinea pig for Mr Mujica's experiment\\". He said: \\"We used to be known for our excellent meat and football, now the world is watching us because of our marijuana.\\" Dozens of supporters of the bill proposed by the left-wing President Jose Mujica gathered outside the Congress in Montevideo to follow the vote. Presenting the bill to fellow senators, Roberto Conde said it was an unavoidable response to reality, given that the \\"war\\" against drugs had failed. \\"We have the duty as the state to give a specific answer to an open territory, small and non-producing,\\" Mr Conde said, adding that Uruguay's borders were used by cartels to smuggle drugs into neighbouring countries. But many senators also spoke out against the bill, before it was passed by 16 votes to 13 on Tuesday. The opposition member Alfredo Solari said Uruguay should not \\"experiment\\" on its people. \\"This project envisages a social engineering experiment and respects none of the ethic safeguards of experimentation on human beings, and these are important in the case of a substance like marijuana, which causes damage to human beings,\\" Senator Solari told Reuters news agency. The project had already been approved by Uruguay's lower house in July. It had also drawn international criticism. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) warned the law would \\"be in complete contravention to the provisions of the international drug treaties to which Uruguay is party\\". The INCB is an independent body of experts established by the United Nations to monitor countries' compliance with international drug treaties. The historic approval comes amid growing debate over drug legalisation in Latin America. A group of former presidents and influential social figures, including Brazil's Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Mexico's Ernesto Zedillo and Colombian ex-leader Cesar Gaviria, have called for marijuana to be legalised and regulated. But President Mujica recently asked during an interview why the former leaders only spoke out about the legalisation of marijuana after they had left office. In July, without naming Uruguay directly, Pope Francis criticised drug legalisation plans during a visit to Brazil.","completion":"Uruguay has made a big decision and passed a law that allows people who are 18 or older to buy a small amount of a drug called marijuana every month. The government thinks this will help with problems caused by bad people called drug cartels.

Robert McCarter, for instance, has been a loyal servant to 'The Mighty' for over 34 years as a past president, treasurer and secretary. He received a whisper near full-time that \\"the attendance was 373 and the pies had all been sold\\". His nod of approval was significant and out came the notepad to record such detail.

Write a summary based on this article: AP Photo Obama vs. McKinley Alaskans praise the move to rename America's tallest mountain, even as Republicans vowed to fight it. For 40 years, it’s been Alaska vs. Ohio. Denali vs. Mount McKinley. Story Continued Below Native Americans protective of their culture vs. American history buffs mindful of the last president of the 19thcentury. Now, after President Barack Obama removed the name of former President William McKinley from the nation’s highest peak, restoring the traditional name of Denali, the seemingly endless sagahas takena new turn. Members of Congress, led by a speaker from Ohio ,are debating whether to attempt to overturn the ruling. A “deeply disappointed” House Speaker John Boehner of Cincinnati tweeted out his opposition Sunday night, after reports that Interior Secretary Sally Jewell had issued an order changing the name at Obama’s behest. Congress could pass a new law to block Jewell’s order on the renaming of the mountain. But Democrats would almost surely block the move, not to mention the likelihood that Obama would veto any such legislation. Despite the long odds, many Ohio representatives seemed eager for a legislative fight. \\"President McKinley was a proud Ohio Republican who was assassinated during his time in office while serving our nation and deserves the recognition Congress previously awarded him,’’ declared Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Dayton, Ohio, in a prepared statement. Rep. Bob Gibbs of rural Washington Township, Ohio, blasted the move on Twitter, calling it “constitutional overreach” and said he would be working with lawmakers on the House Natural Resources Committee to see what can be done “to prevent this action.” Boehner’s staff said the speaker was still unsure of his next action. But in Alaska, where the state government had long supported a name change, the reaction to the move was strikingly different. Tribal leaders and many other Alaskans cheered the move as a sign of respect for native language and tradition. Obama’s decision to side with the native Alaskans over a president who never visited Alaska was reminiscent of other, largely symbolic recent moves to redress historic injustices to minorities or promote minority interests. They include his efforts to present posthumous medals to blacks and Jews who were denied them in past wars, his lighting of the White House in rainbow colors to support the right to same-sex marriage, and his recent hiring of the first-ever transgender White House staffer. “This action recognizing a native language, recognizing something that Alaskans wanted to do for a long, long time ... does speak well in his legacy and treatment of Native Americans in general,” declared Ed Alexander, a board member of Gwich’in Council International. “He’s the first president to have a White House tribal summit annually. It really shows that level of respect.” Richard Peterson, president of the central council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian tribes of Alaska, agreed. “It symbolizes that our first people of Alaska are still here,” he said. “President Obama, especially in his second term, has done more than any other president for Alaskan natives in recent history.” Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, joined in praising Obama’s move, noting that most Alaskans had been fighting for decades to make the name change. Dana Wright, a descendant of one of the first people to climb Denali, who then himself climbed the massive peak in 2013 to draw attention to the need for a new name, said of Obama: “In terms of things he could do, this probably took very little effort but had a big impact for a lot of people. If he hadn’t done this, it probably would’ve gone back and forth in Congress forever.” Indeed, the fight over renaming the mountain would likely have been resolved years ago, if not for the doggedness and maneuvering of former Rep. Ralph Regula, an Ohio Republican and ardent backer of McKinley’s legacy who worked for decades to block the renaming of the peak. Early on, after the Alaska legislature asked the federal government to change Mount McKinley’s name in 1975, Regula helped broker a compromise that named the broader national park Denali while keeping the mountain itself named after McKinley. But that peace offering failed to mollify Alaska lawmakers, including fellow Republicans like Rep. Don Young, and the feud between the two states continued to simmer. So Regula came up with a new legislative gambit to prevent an obscure government agency—the United States Board on Geographic Names—from bowing to Alaska’s wishes. Because the agency’s own guidelines forbade the board from changing a name if Congress was also considering the matter, Regula introduced legislation affirming the McKinley name, thus blocking the agency from taking action, a tradition he continued until his retirement in 2009. But fellow Ohio lawmakers took up the torch and continued his blockade after his retirement, even as members of the Alaska delegation offered their own bills to change the name to Denali. In the end, it took an Obama administration executive order to lay the matter to rest, although Jewell nodded to the Regula strategy in her order to change the name. “While the Board does have a policy of deferring action when a matter is being considered by Congress, contradictory bills on this issue have been proposed by various members of Congress since the late 1970s,” Jewell wrote, while noting that the Interior secretary can take action when the “Board does not act within a reasonable time.” Not surprisingly, many Ohioans dispute that interpretation. Ohio Sen. Rob Portman called Obama’s move “yet another example of the president going around Congress.” Portman added, in a later tweet, “McKinley was a proud Ohioan, and the mountain was named after him as a way to remember his rich legacy after his assassination.” Actually, McKinley’s name was affixed to the mountain by Alaskans before his election to the presidency. Alaska, at the time, was a large producer of gold, and McKinley’s Democratic rival in the 1896 election, William Jennings Bryan, was campaigning on a pledge to peg the nation’s currency to silver, not gold. McKinley defeated Bryan and went on to serve as commander in chief during the Spanish-American War. He was re-elected in 1900, but six months after his inauguration he was assassinated by an anarchist while shaking hands with well-wishers at the World’s Fair in Buffalo, New York. His vice president, Theodore Roosevelt, assumed office and took the country in a more liberal direction, leading to unprecedented growth of the federal government and its power. Though Roosevelt has assumed a larger place in history, McKinley continues to be well-remembered by conservatives who favor a smaller government. Karl Rove, the longtime adviser to former President George W. Bush, is set to publish a new book on McKinley. But he sounded a more moderate note than the Ohioans, urging that Obama find a new way to honor McKinley. “The 25thpresident gets overlooked too much already. Would hope the president would find another appropriate way to honor McKinley. Luckily there’s a book coming out about McKinley in November,” Rove wrote in an email to POLITICO Playbook. This article tagged under: Barack Obama Alaska ||||| Ohio lawmakers reacted angrily Sunday to the White House's announcement that President Obama would formally rename Alaska's Mt. McKinley — North America's highest peak — \\"Denali\\" during his trip to The Last Frontier this week. \\"Mount McKinley ... has held the name of our nation's 25th President for over 100 years,\\" Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, said in a statement. \\"This landmark is a testament to his countless years of service to our country.\\" Gibbs also described Obama's action as \\"constitutional overreach,\\" saying that an act of Congress was required to rename the mountain, because a law formally naming it after Ohio's William McKinley was passed in 1917. \\"This political stunt is insulting to all Ohioans, and I will be working with the House Committee on Natural Resources to determine what can be done to prevent this action,\\" Gibbs said. The Ohio delegation's disappointment at the decision cut across party lines. \\"We must retain this national landmark's name in order to honor the legacy of this great American president and patriot,\\" Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, whose district includes McKinley's hometown of Niles, in eastern Ohio. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, also blasted the decision as \\"yet another example of the President going around Congress\\", while House Speaker John Boehner said the naming of the mountain after McKinley was \\"a testament to [the 25th president's] great legacy .. I am deeply disappointed in this decision.\\" The state of Alaska has had a standing request to change the name to \\"Denali\\" — a native Athabascan word meaning \\"the high one\\" — dating back to 1975, when the legislature passed a resolution and then-Gov. Jay Hammond appealed to the federal government. But those efforts and legislation in Congress have been stymied by members of Ohio's congressional delegation. Even when Mount McKinley National Park was renamed Denali National Park in 1980, the federal government retained Mount McKinley as the name of the actual peak, which rises 20,320 feet above sea level. \\"With our own sense of reverence for this place, we are officially renaming the mountain Denali in recognition of the traditions of Alaska Natives and the strong support of the people of Alaska,\\" said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. The White House cited Jewell's authority to change the name, and Jewell issued a secretarial order officially changing it to Denali. The Interior Department said the U.S. Board on Geographic Names had been deferring to Congress since 1977, and cited a 1947 law that allows the Interior Department to change names unilaterally when the board fails to act \\"within a reasonable time.\\" The board shares responsibility with the Interior Department for naming such landmarks. In 1896, a prospector in the mountains of central Alaska named the range after McKinley upon learning that he had been nominated as a candidate for U.S. president. McKinley became the country’s 25th president and was assassinated in 1901, six months into his second term. The 20,000-foot-tall peak had been previously known as Denali -- generally believed to be central to the Athabascan tribe's creation story and the site of significant cultural importance to many Alaska natives, according to the White House. Denali also is an Athabascan word meaning \\"the high one\\" and is widely used across the state today, according to the White House. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who had pushed legislation for years to change the name, said Alaskans were \\"honored\\" to recognize the mountain as Denali. \\"I'd like to thank the president for working with us to achieve this significant change to show honor, respect, and gratitude to the Athabascan people of Alaska,\\" Murkowski said in a video message recorded atop the mountain's Ruth Glacier, with cloudy snow-capped peaks behind her. Obama will not personally visit the peak during his stay in Alaska, which runs through Wednesday. He'll spend much of the trip in Anchorage, south of the peak, where he will attend a State Department-sponsored meeting on climate change, titled GLACIER/Global Leadership in the Arctic Conference. The conference will bring together foreign ministers of Arctic nations and key non-Arctic states with scientists, policymakers and stakeholders from Alaska and the Arctic, the White House said. “The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world and is experiencing the consequences,” the White House also said Sunday. Supporters of the global warming theory say those changes include higher average temperatures and less winter sea ice, which is allowing for heavy storm surges that the sea ice once kept at bay, the White House said. On Monday, Obama is scheduled to meet with leaders from the Alaska native community along with Gov. Bill Walker, Lt. Governor Byron Mallott and Murkowski to discuss ways to strengthen cooperation between the federal government and Alaska native tribes. Among the issues scheduled to be discussed is management strategies for fish and wildlife. The Associated Press contributed to this story. |||||","completion":"So, there was a big mountain called Denali in Alaska, and it was a very important place for the people living there. A long time ago, they started calling it Mount McKinley, after a man named President McKinley who was the leader of the United States. People in the state of Ohio, which is where President McKinley was from, really liked the mountain being named after him. But, the people in Alaska wanted to change the name back to Denali because it's an important word in their language, and it means \\"the high one\\". They asked for it to be changed back for a very long time, but the people in Ohio didn't want it to be changed. Then President Obama decided to change the name of the mountain back to Denali.

Research suggests that sexual orientation is independent of cultural and other social influences, but that open identification of one's sexual orientation may be hindered by homophobic/hetereosexist settings. Social systems such as religion, language and ethnic traditions can have a powerful impact on realization of sexual orientation. Influences of culture may complicate the process of measuring sexual orientation. The majority of empirical and clinical research on LGBT populations are done with largely white, middle-class, well-educated samples, however there are pockets of research that document various other cultural groups, although these are frequently limited in diversity of gender and sexual orientation of the subjects. Integration of sexual orientation with sociocultural identity may be a challenge for LGBT individuals. Individuals may or may not consider their sexual orientation to define their sexual identity, as they may experience various degrees of fluidity of sexuality, or may simply identify more strongly with another aspect of their identity such as family role. American culture puts a great emphasis on individual attributes, and views the self as unchangeable and constant.

To do this, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: 3*d + 24 - 24 = 0 - 24 This simplifies to: 3*d = -24 Now, to find the value for d, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3: (3*d)/3 = -24/3 This simplifies to: d = -8 Therefore, the solution for the given math problem is d = -8."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the name of the person that maintained his position as court painter? Answer the above question based on the context below: Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was left in a difficult position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.Several of Goya's friends, including the poets Juan Meléndez Valdés and Leandro Fernández de Moratín, were overt afrancesados: the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte. He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority, and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops. During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, Wellington from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals. Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for The Disasters of War. He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance. The final plates are testament to what he described as \\"el desmembramiento d'España\\"—the dismemberment of Spain.

His demeanor and bearing stand out in contrast to the rag tag prisoners he shares the camp with in part because of his willingness to ostensibly advance on the needs of others. He is constantly scrutinized by Lieutenant Grey (Tom Courtenay), the camp police chief, as he has gotten reports that King has robbed fellow prisoners in a poker game. It is clear that King takes pleasure in living on what would be considered a clear example of the American Capitalist version of supply and demand. He seeks ways to increase his organization by recruiting talented men like Peter Marlowe (James Fox), an English soldier who speaks fluent Malay, but refuses King's offering of money for his services. Marlowe attempts to live by a code that bonds men in a way that transcends any financial gain, and in fact considers King an actual friend because he and the American are interned together under Japanese rule. King extends his operation to include trading valuables to the Japanese and breeding rats to sell as food to the officers as a delicacy, activities that Marlowe is happy to aid in because of the smart commercial way that the schemes are launched. The ability to gain valuable items including medical supplies becomes important when Marlowe injures himself and faces serious physical danger. As Lieutenant Grey closes in to mete out the camp law enforcement, his code of conduct conflicts with Marlowe, his cabin mate. Theirs is a philosophy differing slightly and both based on survival with the most reaffirming respect for fellow man they can develop under these war conditions. As Grey attempts to arrest King and Marlowe for their criminal activity it becomes clear that the commanding officers live by a fractured value system.

Please answer the following question: This article: Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970, (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose fanbase was alienated by her image as a militant and extremist?, what is it ?

Question: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.''

Microsoft planned to hold a launch event on October 25, 2012 and release Windows 8 for general availability on the next day. However, only a day after its release to manufacturing, a copy of the final version of Windows 8 Enterprise N (a version for European markets lacking bundled media players to comply with a court ruling) leaked online, followed by leaks of the final versions of Windows 8 Pro and Enterprise a few days later. On August 15, 2012, Windows 8 was made available to download for MSDN and TechNet subscribers. Windows 8 was made available to Software Assurance customers on August 16, 2012. Windows 8 was made available for students with a DreamSpark Premium subscription on August 22, 2012, earlier than advertised.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"In its simplest form, the factor that greatly accelerated the launch of the Windows 8 products was the strategic early availability to various specialized groups, coupled with the leaks of final versions of Windows 8 online. Following the release to manufacturing of Windows 8 on August 1, 2012, the launch event was planned for October 25, with general availability set for the next day. However, only a day after the release to manufacturing, a copy of the final version of Windows 8 Enterprise N was leaked online. This was followed by leaks of the final versions of Windows 8 Pro and Enterprise. Such leaks created an urgency to make the product available to customers before the originally planned date. The leaks alone would not have accelerated the launch without Microsoft's active response to the situation. The company made early versions of Windows 8 available to different groups even before the planned launch. MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network) and TechNet subscribers were granted access to Windows 8 on August 15, 2012. Software Assurance customers received it on August 16, and students with a DreamSpark Premium subscription were given access on August 22, which was earlier than advertised. It was this combination of unintentional leaks and Microsoft's strategic decision to make Windows 8 available early for select groups that accelerated the launch of the products in a significant way. By doing so, Microsoft ensured that Windows 8 reached the hands of developers, students, and enterprise customers before potential competitors could take advantage of the leaked versions.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To explain this, let's first understand what entailment is and analyze these two given sentences. Entailment in linguistic terms refers to a relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of the other sentence. In other words, if one sentence then the other sentence must also be true, and if any of the sentences is false, the other sentence must be false too. In this case, we are looking at two sentences: Sentence 1: George W. Bush won the Iowa straw poll. Sentence 2: George W. Bush never won a single straw poll. Sentence 1 indicates that George W. Bush has won at least one straw poll, specifically the Iowa straw poll. Straw polls are informal and non-binding votes typically used to gauge the popularity of political candidates or the public's opinion on policy issues. Sentence 2, on the other hand, claims that George W. Bush never won any straw poll. Since these two sentences convey conflicting information, they do not have an entailment relationship. Rather, they are contradictory to each other. If Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 must be false, because it is claiming George W. Bush never won any straw poll, despite having won the Iowa straw poll according to Sentence 1. Conversely, if Sentence 2 is true, that would mean Sentence 1 is false, as George W. Bush would not have won the Iowa straw poll nor any other straw poll. In summary, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Rather, they are contradictory statements where the truth of one negates the truth of the other."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To do that, we'll add 690 * o to both sides: 136 * o + 690 * o = 31388 ( 136 + 690 ) * o We can do 136 + 690, and that gives us: 826 * o Now our equation is: 826 * o = 31388 To find the value of o, we'll divide both sides by 826: o = 31388 / 826 And when we do that calculation, we get: o = 38 So, the answer to the problem is o = 38.

Taking a moment to verify this information before finalizing a check can help prevent errors such as entering the wrong date or amount, which in turn can lead to issues with processing and/or potential fraud. As stated in the text, it's important to stop writing as soon as you realize you've made an error and assess the situation. By carefully considering all aspects of writing a check before completing the process, you can minimize the potential for errors and associated complications. So, taking the time to be mindful and deliberate when writing checks is crucial, rather than rushing through it without forethought, which could increase the likelihood of making mistakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What determines a mammals diet type?\\" Choose from: +yes +no","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type.\\" does provide a valid answer to the question \\"What determines a mammal's diet type?\\" However, it is important to note that it only gives a part of the entire solution that would be needed for a fully detailed response. Size is indeed one key factor that can influence the type of diet an animal has, because larger animals tend to require more food and energy to survive than smaller ones, thus impacting the type of food they must consume to fulfill those needs. Mammals, specifically, display a lot of diversity in terms of size, ranging from tiny creatures like shrews to gigantic ones like elephants. The size of a mammal plays a significant role in determining what and how much it eats. Larger mammals such as elephants, whales, or rhinoceros need to consume a larger volume of food daily compared to their smaller counterparts. This necessarily means their diet would consist of food types available in large amounts, typically plant matter. Herbivores like these thrive on plant-based diets because plants are abundant and rich in the nutrients these large mammals need. On the other hand, smaller mammals like rodents, rabbits, or certain types of monkeys might have a mixed diet (omnivorous) or be entirely carnivorous, as they require less food and can thus manage to consume nutrient-dense meats or a variety of food sources. Beyond size, other factors also determine a mammal's diet. Environmental availability is another significant determinant. It is typically easier for an animal to consume what is readily available in their environment instead of finding specific nutrients elsewhere. For example, aquatic mammals like dolphins or seals primarily consume fish and other sea life because that's what their environment offers. Digestive capabilities of mammals also come into play in determining diet type. Some mammals like cows have specialised digestive systems that allow them to ferment plant material in a separate stomach chamber and extract nutrients that way. On the other hand, carnivores like lions and tigers have shorter, simpler guts suited to a diet heavy in proteins. Therefore, while the sentence does partially answer the question about what determines a mammal's diet type, the topic is more complex and includes other factors such as environmental availability and digestive capabilities, alongside the size of the mammal. Each of these aspects contributes to the understanding of a mammal's diet, and together they paint a detailed picture of this intricate biological decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tin Machine were an Anglo-American hard rock group formed in 1988, notable for being fronted by English singer-songwriter David Bowie. The band consisted of Bowie on lead vocals, sax and guitar, Reeves Gabrels on guitar, Tony Fox Sales on bass, and Hunt Sales on drums. Both Tony and Hunt are the sons of comedian Soupy Sales. Guitarist Kevin Armstrong was an unofficial fifth member of the band, playing on the first studio album and both tours. The group then went on hiatus while Bowie conducted his solo Sound+Vision Tour. In December 1990, Bowie split from EMI. Hunt Sales said that EMI \\"kind of freaked out a little bit at the strident, single-less Tin Machine debut\\", which partially explained why Bowie switched music labels. In March 1991, the band signed to Victory Music, a new label launched by JVC and distributed worldwide by London Records and Polygram, and recorded more new material. This was combined with tracks from the Sydney sessions to form the Tin Machine II album. The album was described as \\"just as impure and twisted [as their first album], but more R&B and less abrasive.\\" Gabrels explained the change between the first and second album was because by the second album, \\"we knew one another as musicians. ... It wasn't as dense. And we actually left more room, I think for David to come up with some interesting melodies. There was more room for vocals on this record.\\" In late 1991 Bowie reiterated that he was still happy being in the band during that time, stating \\"I'm content. ... I'm deriving a great deal of fulfillment from working with Tin Machine\\", and band-mate Gabrels agreed, saying \\"we're doing exactly what we wanted to do.\\" During press performances for songs on the album, Gabrels played his guitar with a vibrator and for a performance on BBC's \\"Top of the Pops\\", who banned the use of the vibrator, he mimed playing his guitar with a chocolate eclair. From 5 October 1991 to 17 February 1992, the group undertook a larger tour, known as the It's My Life Tour. The band was joined on this tour by guitarist Eric Schermerhorn.

What is the last name of the person who exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s? Answer the above question based on the context below: William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

The sentence can be divided into two main ideas: 1. \\"his story ends\\" 2. \\"just can't tear himself away from the characters.\\" Step 2: Analyze the connotations of each idea. 1.

Here is a question about this article: The most common symptom of LED (and diode laser) failure is the gradual lowering of light output and loss of efficiency. Sudden failures, although rare, can also occur. Early red LEDs were notable for their short service life. With the development of high-power LEDs the devices are subjected to higher junction temperatures and higher current densities than traditional devices. This causes stress on the material and may cause early light-output degradation. To quantitatively classify useful lifetime in a standardized manner it has been suggested to use L70 or L50, which are the runtimes (typically given in thousands of hours) at which a given LED reaches 70% and 50% of initial light output, respectively. What is the answer to this question: What could cause early light-output degradation in LEDs?","completion":"Early light-output degradation in LEDs can be caused by higher junction temperatures and higher current densities. These come from using high-power LEDs, which puts more stress on the material, making the light output go down faster."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Let's break down the elements that contribute to this sentiment. 1. Use of the term \\"beautiful film\\": This phrase conveys a positive appreciation for the film, as the word \\"beautiful\\" implies that it has an aesthetically pleasing and emotionally evocative quality. By describing the film as beautiful, the speaker endorses it as a noteworthy piece of art. 2. Target audience: The sentence specifies that the film appeals to \\"people who like their romances.\\" This narrows down the intended audience to those who have an affinity for romantic stories. By singling out this group, the speaker acknowledges that the film might not be universally appealing, but it holds great value for the people who enjoy this genre. 3. Inclusion of French realism: The reference to \\"French realism\\" can be interpreted in multiple ways: a. Geographic specificity: It suggests that the film either features, or is influenced by, French culture, artistic styles, or storytelling traditions. French cinema is commonly associated with emotionally complex, character-driven stories that focus on the genuine and often subtle emotions shared between characters, rather than grand, action-packed plotlines. For a viewer who appreciates these qualities, the mention of French realism adds a layer of cultural depth and sophistication to the film. b. Realism in romance: The realism in the context of a romantic storyline implies a more grounded, authentic portrayal of relationships and love. Instead of an idealized or over-the-top portrayal of love, like those sometimes found in fairy tales or Hollywood blockbusters, the film may present a more honest reflection of the challenges, subtleties, and emotions involved in real-life relationships. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence can be seen as a positive endorsement of the film for a particular group of viewers - those who appreciate romantic stories with elements of French realism. That said, the mention of French realism and the specific target audience may also indicate a niche appeal, acknowledging that the film's style and content may not be universally appreciated or enjoyed by every viewer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The operation was a coordinated effort between the U.S. Coast Guard, the Royal Navy, and local law enforcement agencies in the Caribbean to crackdown on drug smuggling in the region. Upon spotting the suspicious speedboat, Prince William and his crewmates immediately alerted the HMS Iron Duke and the U.S. Coast Guard, who intercepted the vessel for further investigation. The crew of the speedboat attempted to flee, abandoning their cargo in the process, but were quickly apprehended by the combined forces. The bust resulted in the confiscation of nearly a ton of cocaine, with an estimated street value of at least 80 million, marking this as a significant victory in the ongoing battle against drug trafficking. Authorities believe that the drugs were en route from South America to Europe, where they would have been distributed across various cities. The success of this mission has been praised by officials from both the U.S. and the UK, highlighting the importance of international cooperation in combating global drug trafficking. Prince William's involvement in the operation has helped raise awareness of the serious issues faced by law enforcement agencies in tackling drug smuggling and has contributed to his growth in understanding the broader roles and responsibilities of the Royal Navy and military service in general.

Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which...

Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase.

(August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) is a comedian of a satirical talk show who is able to tap into people's frustrations with the sharply divided, special interest-driven political climate. Specifically, he makes fun of the American two-party system. During his warm-up act, an audience member suggests that he run for president. At first, Dobbs laughs off the idea, but following a popular groundswell of support, later announces on the air that he will stand as a candidate. Through his efforts, he gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in one of the national debates with the Democratic incumbent, President Kellogg, and Republican U.S. Senator Mills. A parallel plot follows Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), who works at a voting machine company in California called Delacroy. According to a television commercial in the movie, the entire United States will be using Delacroy voting machines for the Presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices that the voting system does not work correctly and alerts the head of the company, James Hemmings (Rick Roberts) via e-mail. Initially, Dobbs approaches the campaign seriously â perhaps too seriously, to the chagrin of his staff, especially his manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken). That turns around the night of the presidential debates, when, fed up with the other candidates' posturing, Dobbs shifts back into comedian mode, managing to keep the audience laughing and make serious points simultaneously. From then on, he resumes his showman persona, thoroughly shaking up the political landscape. Dobbs surges in polls after the debates, but remains a distant third to Kellogg and Mills. Election Day arrives, and polls show Dobbs at 17% with Kellogg and Mills tied in the 40s. Early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere. Eleanor says...

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Ashley Collman. and Mark Prigg. A retired Marine with nearly two decades of aviation experience has stepped forward with a compelling theory about a mysterious plane that was spotted flying over Texas last month. On March 10, photographers Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett took pictures of three puzzling aircraft flying over Amarillo, and posted them online in hopes of identifying the planes. Retired-Marine James Vineyard has submitted one of the more interesting explanations, telling the Houston Chronicle he believes they are SR-72 Blackbirds - a spy plane that can cross the U.S. in less than an hour, unmanned. The triangle over Texas: Two photographers captured this mysterious object flying over Texas last month. Mystery solved? A retired Marine says the plane pictured in Amarillo last month is the SR-72 Blackbird - a plane designed to cross the country in less than an hour. The mystery aircraft seen over Amarillo on March 10. Three of the craft were spotted flying by. In 1956, British magazines started. getting eyewitness accounts and grainy photos of the Lockheed U-2, then. operating out of RAF Lakenheath on its first spy flights over the Soviet. Union - marking the first sight of a stealth plane that government's. had hoped to keep secret from prying eyes. It provided day and night, very high-altitude (70,000 feet / 21,000 m), all-weather intelligence gathering. Vineyard spent 17 years as a Marine and also worked with a jet squadron in Arizona. He. says the Pentagon may have dispatched the planes to the Indian Ocean to. aide in the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370. But Douglass, who saw the planes himself, doesn't agree. 'The. SR-72 is still in development,' he said Tuesday. 'Plus it's a. high-speed, high-Mach plane. These were going airliner speed. They were. not in a hurry to get anywhere.' The. SR-72 is currently being developed by Lockheed Martin in California,. and according to the company's website they say the plane could be. operational as early as 2030. It. is the predecessor of the SR-71 which broke speed records when it flew. from New York to Lonton in less than two hours in 1976. Lockheed. Martin's Hypersonics program manager Brad Leland wrote that the plane. is designed to 'strike at nearly any location across a continent in less. than an hour.' 'Speed is. the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next. several decades. The technology would be a game-changer in theater,. similar to how stealth is changing the battlespace today,' Leland said. Another source told the Chronicle that the plane was a B-2, but the two photographers discovered that no B-2s were flying in the country that day. The SR-72 is a successor to the SR-71 which broke speed records when it flew from New York to London in less than two hours in 1976. Another. reader who wished not to be identified told the Chronicle with. confidence that 'It's a B-2 stealth bomber flying out of Whiteman Air. Force Base in Missouri.' That's. what the photographers thought when they first saw the group of. aircraft, but they say they checked with the base and no B-2s were. flying anywhere in the U.S. that day. Instead,.

Options: - working ground - quarry - desert - work area - under ground Explain why a human would choose \\"work area\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"work area\\" to answer the question above because an excavation site typically refers to a location where archeologists, researchers, or construction workers carry out specific tasks related to unearthing or digging up artifacts, structures, or materials from the ground. Each of the options provided can be associated with an excavation site in different contexts, but \\"work area\\" seems to be the most appropriate choice as it encompasses the general concept of the site and its primary function. Let's break down each of the options to better understand why \\"work area\\" is the best choice: 1. Working ground: This term could be relevant to an excavation site, as the ground is being worked upon for various purposes. However, it does not have a significant focus on the actual activities or tasks, and may not capture the essence of an excavation site being an organized space for conducting work or research. 2. Quarry: A quarry can also be associated with excavation, but it primarily refers to a place where large amounts of stone, sand, or minerals are extracted. While excavation might be a part of quarry operations, it is specific to the mining context and does not accurately represent other possible purposes of an excavation site, especially those related to archaeology or construction. 3. Desert: A desert could be a location where an excavation site exists, but as a standalone option, it doesn't convey any information about the nature of work conducted at the site. It is simply the geographical or environmental context for the excavation site, rather than the characteristics of the site itself. 4. Work area: This term accurately describes an excavation site, as it refers to a designated location where specific tasks are carried out. Work areas can be found in various industries, and excavation sites are a type of work area where digging, researching, and unearthing occur. This option best represents the primary function and purpose of an excavation site and encompasses its various contexts, such as archeological, construction, and even mining. 5. Underground: While excavation sites may involve digging and unearthing objects or materials from under the ground, the term \\"underground\\" in itself does not encapsulate the range of activities and functions that take place at an excavation site. It refers more to the location of the site relative to the surface rather than the site as a designated work area. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"work area\\" because it best encompasses the core concept of an excavation site - a location where digging, unearthing, or researching activities take place in various contexts such as archaeology, construction, and mining. It reflects the primary function of an excavation site and provides a more accurate understanding of the site's purpose rather than the other options, which focus more on the geographical location or specific contexts of the site."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The most interesting morality play is The Castle of Perseverance which depicts mankind's progress from birth to death. However, the most famous morality play and perhaps best known medieval drama is Everyman. Everyman receives Death's summons, struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity. Along the way, he is deserted by Kindred, Goods, and Fellowship - only Good Deeds goes with him to the grave. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What goes to the store with Everyman in the morality play?","completion":"In the morality play \\"Everyman\\", it is not specified that the character Everyman goes to a store during the development of the narrative. The use of \\"store\\" could be metaphorical, symbolizing something else, such as goods or items. In this iconic play, the primary focus is placed on the journey of life, particularly the inevitability of death and the concept of morality. Everyman, representing all humanity, receives a summons from Death. He attempts to evade this summons but finally comes to understand its inevitability. Along his journey, he engages with various characters that symbolize different aspects of life, each meant to represent different facets of human experience that he interacts with and relies on. However, as the narrative progresses, Everyman is sequentially deserted by Fellowship (his friends), Kindred (his family), and Goods (material wealth), as they cannot accompany him in death. These elements also symbolically represent societal linkages, familial ties, and material possessions, respectively. These elements, although considered valuable or important in life, are ultimately portrayed as transient and incapable of providing salvation or companionship in death. In the end, it is only Good Deeds who agrees to accompany Everyman to the grave - underlining the central message of the morality play that only our moral actions, our good deeds, truly matter in the end, and those are what we'll be judged on. Hence, if we assume that the 'store' represents a place (metaphorical or otherwise), as per the narrative of this morality play, it would be Good Deeds who would accompany Everyman. Thus, reinforcing the essence of this drama - the enduring value of moral rectitude and virtue in human life - symbolized by the character Good Deeds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: During what war, fought during 1558-1583, did the Siege of Wesenberg occur? Answer:","completion":"The Siege of Wesenberg, which took place from January 22 to February 3, 1574, occurred during the Livonian War. The Livonian War lasted from 1558 to 1583 and was fought between several regional forces that included the Kingdom of Poland, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the combined forces of the Livonian Confederation, the Teutonic Order, and the invading forces of the Tsardom of Russia. The war began when Tsar Ivan the Terrible of Russia invaded the territories of the Livonian Confederation, which comprised much of present-day Latvia and Estonia. The goal of the Russian invasion was to gain control of the strategically important and economically prosperous Baltic region. As the war progressed, factions within the Livonian Confederation sought assistance from neighboring polities to resist the Russian advance. Consequently, the Kingdom of Poland and the Kingdom of Sweden intervened to challenge Russian dominion in the region, leading to the complex multi-sided conflict that characterized the Livonian War. The Siege of Wesenberg, also known as the Siege of Rakvere, was a notable engagement during the conflict. Rakvere, known as Wesenberg in German, was an important fortified town in the territory of the Livonian Confederation. Located in present-day Estonia, it served as a critical stronghold for the regional forces. In January 1574, the Russian army led by Prince Mikhail Serebryany-Golovin began the siege of Wesenberg. They subjected the town to a relentless artillery bombardment and launched several attacks on its defenses. Despite the odds against them, the defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the attacking Russian forces. The steadfast defenders of Wesenberg, led by Johann von Uexküll, managed to repel the Russians' advances. Eventually, the besieged defenders broke through the Russian blockade and emerged victorious, forcing the Russian army to withdraw after suffering significant losses. The resolute defense of Wesenberg marked a significant setback for the Russian campaign in the region during the Livonian War. The Livonian War ultimately concluded in 1583 with the Treaty of Plussa and the Treaty of Jam Zapolski. As a result of these peace agreements, the Livonian Confederation was effectively dissolved, and the territories of modern-day Estonia and Latvia were divided between Sweden, Poland, and Lithuania. Consequently, Russian ambitions to control the lucrative Baltic Sea trade were thwarted, and the foundations for the subsequent political order in the Baltic states were established. The Siege of Wesenberg stands as a testament to the determination of the Livonian forces during the war, and its outcome had a lasting impact on the regional balance of power."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We believe by the time Texas is over, we'll be very very competitive in delegate count.\\" More from a lively Sunday morning on the hamster wheel, as per Politico: Gingrich on that moon idea (which SNL loved so much): \\"This was not some slip. This was a deliberate effort to start a conversation.\\" He added, \\"I didn't propose any additional spending.\\" Mike Bloomberg on the Bush tax cuts: Obama should \\"veto any extension of the Bush-era tax cuts. We should all pony up. If you only raise taxes on the rich, you don't get that much money.\\" Ron Paul on the 'intellectual revolution': “There’s a lot of people talking about free-market economics rather than Keynesian welfare-ism and interventionism. There is an intellectual revolution going on with the young people. There are people who have sat on the sidelines for years. It has not been translated into an absolute political change.\\" Santorum on daughter Bella: She's \\"doing great. She had a very rough time just about a week ago. She turned around amazingly quickly. She is home and healthy.” Bob McDonnell on Romney's conservative cred: “He governed as a pro-life governor in a blue state. He cut taxes 19 times and he balanced a budget without raising taxes, eliminating a 3 billion deficit. Speaker Gingrich has been cozying up with Nancy Pelosi on global warming, he called Paul Ryan’s budget ‘social, right-wing engineering.’” Dick Armey on Gingrich: \\"I don't think Newt will be able to replicate that magic moment. I feel bad for him. I think he's digressed taking a second-rate campaign into a first-rate vendetta.\\"","completion":"Title: Newt Gingrich's Role in the Republican Brawl and His Controversial Moon Idea Newt Gingrich, despite being embroiled in the biggest brawl the Republican party has witnessed, reassures his position on supporting the Republican nominee, even if it means working with someone he doesn't approve of. As Gingrich shares his thoughts about Governor Romney, he openly declares his disapproval for Romney's approach, but when compared to President Obama, Gingrich stresses that \\"there would be no choice.\\" This stance adds a unique perspective to the ongoing saga concerning the Republican party and its key members. Gingrich made the rounds this morning, as reported by Politico, emphasizing the fact that he has no intention of stepping down. Instead, the goal is to push towards Super Tuesday, where he claims the grounds will be much more favorable. Gingrich remains optimistic and staunch in his belief that the delegate count will be competitive by the time the Texas elections are over. Adding to the mix of the lively Sunday morning was the topic of Gingrich's moon idea, which even caught Saturday Night Live producers' attention. Gingrich does not back down from the controversy surrounding his concept of establishing a moon colony. Instead, he states that this was a deliberate effort to jumpstart a thought-provoking conversation and not just some casual or impulsive slip. The former Speaker of the House clarifies that any additional spending was never part of the plan. As an idea-generator, Gingrich's moon colony proposal is certainly working on getting people talking, debating, and sharing their views on the potential and technological advancement it might hold. Mike Bloomberg, on that same talk, shares his opinions regarding the Bush tax cuts, urging President Obama to veto any extension. Bloomberg emphasizes the need for everyone to pitch in, and avoid focusing solely on raising taxes for the wealthy, as it will not solve the problem and generate enough money to address the issues at hand. Ron Paul comments on the ongoing 'intellectual revolution' in the Republican party, with discussions focusing on free-market economics rather than Keynesian welfare-ism and interventionism. Paul notices a significant shift in the approach of young people and those who had remained neutral in politics for years. Although the intellectual revolution seems to be in motion, the translation to concrete political change seems to be a work in progress. Meanwhile, Santorum shares an update on his daughter Bella's health, stating that she is doing great and has recovered from a rough time just a week ago. This personal insight humanizes the political personas and adds a layer of emotion amidst the ongoing political discussions and controversies. Bob McDonnell attempts to attest to Romney's conservative credibility, mentioning accomplishments such as covering a 3 billion deficit without raising taxes and governing as a pro-life governor in a blue state. In the same breath, he takes the opportunity to display how Gingrich worked with Nancy Pelosi on global warming and criticized Paul Ryan's budget as \\"social, right-wing engineering.\\" In conclusion, the dynamic dialogues on this lively Sunday morning, from Gingrich's role in the Republican brawl to his moon colony idea and other political perspectives, showcase the intellectual evolution within the Republican party. While concrete changes might still be awaited, these discussions are shaping new political thought and ideas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Let's break them down: 1. \\"The South Deep mine is a large mine located in the northern part of South Africa in Gauteng.\\" 2. \\"The Mine South Deep is a big mine in the northern part of South Africa in Gauteng.\\" Step 1: Identify the key elements in both sentences. The key elements include the name of the mine (\\"South Deep\\"), the size of the mine (\\"large\\" or \\"big\\"), and the location of the mine (\\"in the northern part of South Africa in Gauteng\\").

In both, the mine is named \\"South Deep\\", the size is expressed as \\"large\\" or \\"big\\", and the location is the same (\\"in the northern part of South Africa in Gauteng\\").

(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (Associated Press) US Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly speaks during the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, Saturday, Feb. 18, 2017. The annual weekend gathering is known for providing an open and informal... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Homeland Security Department has drafted sweeping new guidelines aimed at aggressively detaining and deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, according to a pair of memoranda signed by DHS Secretary John Kelly. The memos dated Friday seek to implement President Donald Trump's broad directive to crack down on illegal immigration. Kelly outlines plans to hire thousands of additional enforcement agents, expand on the priority list for immigrants marked for immediate removal and enlist local law enforcement to help make arrests, according to a person briefed on the documents, who confirmed the details to The Associated Press. \\"The surge of illegal immigration at the southern border has overwhelmed federal agencies and resources and has created a significant national security vulnerability to the United States,\\" Kelly wrote. He said apprehensions on the southern U.S. border had seen an additional surge of 10,000 to 15,000 per month from 2015 to 2016. The memos leave in place one directive from the Obama administration, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows young people who were brought into the country illegally as children to stay and obtain work permits. The program has protected about 750,000 immigrants since its inception in 2012. Trump has previously indicated his desire to end the program, but at his press conference last week he indicated that he would \\"show great heart\\" toward the program. The memos were reported first by The Washington Post and other news organizations. A U.S. official familiar with the documents did not dispute the accuracy of the memos signed by Kelly, which were originally scheduled for release Friday before they were postponed for White House review. A White House official said officials there had raised objections with the documents and were working with DHS to finalize the policy. The official was not authorized to discuss the process publicly and insisted on anonymity. Under the draft guidelines, Kelly seeks to \\"expeditiously hire\\" 10,000 more enforcement agents and 5,000 Border Patrol officers. Seeking to fulfill Trump's campaign promise to build a wall along the Mexican border, Kelly also calls on Customs and Border Protection to \\"immediately begin planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall, including the attendant lighting, technology (including sensors), as well as patrol and access roads.\\" He describes the wall as necessary to deter illegal immigration and calls it a \\"critical component\\" of Trump's overall border security strategy. He says the department will also prioritize for more immediate removal those who have been convicted of a crime; charged with a crime; committed fraud in connection with a matter before a government agency; abused any program related to public benefits; or have not complied with orders to leave the country. Joanne Lin, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, criticized the proposed guidelines as a Trump style of immigration enforcement in which \\"due process, human decency and common sense are treated as inconvenient obstacles on the path to mass deportation.\\" \\"The Trump administration is intent on inflicting cruelty on millions of immigrant families across the country,\\" she said in a statement. ||||| CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Anti-Trump protestors are taking advantage of the federal holiday that celebrates Presidents to oppose the one that is currently in office.

The guidelines, signed by DHS Secretary John Kelly, include hiring thousands of additional enforcement agents and increasing the number of immigration judges, expanding the pool of immigrants prioritized for removal, enlisting local law enforcement to help with arrests and speeding up deportation hearings. They also propose prosecuting parents and family members in the U.S. who pay smugglers to bring over unaccompanied minors. The memos were a draft order and still being reviewed by the White House, according to the Associated Press. The guidelines would put into play legal tools available to presidents for years but largely overlooked by past administrations, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a non-profit research institute that promotes stricter control on immigration. Expediting the removal of immigrants who have been in the country illegally for less than two years, for example, has been a legal remedy since 1996, but underused by past administrations, she said. She called the guidelines, if implemented, a “step in the right direction.” CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Lawmakers fear Trump could use the information Dreamers provide on their DACA applications to deport them. Video provided by Newsy Newslook “What this administration is doing is using the tools available in the law to a greater extent to address problems that have been neglected the past eight years by the Obama administration,” Vaughan said. “They’re changing the message to people who are thinking about coming here illegally.” Notably missing from the guidelines is any change to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which allows young people brought to the USA illegally as children to stay and obtain work permits. Trump harshly criticized the program on the campaign trail last year but said at a recent press conference that he would “show great heart” toward the program. The program, initiated by the Obama administration in 2012, has protected about 750,000 immigrants. Mark Silverman, senior staff attorney with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a pro-immigrant rights group based in San Francisco, said the guidelines outlined in the memo were “very disturbing” and “draconian,” particularly the section about prosecuting parents trying to bring their children to the USA. Recruiting local law enforcement to help identify and remove undocumented immigrants would also result in widespread violations of civil liberties, he said. “Essentially, this memo is implementing the inhumane and nonsensical scapegoating of immigrants, especially Latinos, for problems in this country which they did not create,” Silverman said. The guidelines also call for the border wall to begin construction, instructing U.S. Customs and Border Protection to “immediately begin planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall, including the attendant lighting, technology (including sensors), as well as patrol and access roads,” although funding for the wall’s construction and maintenance still needs approval by Congress. In a statement, Joanne Lin, American Civil Liberties Union senior legislative council, called the enforcement plans a breach of “due process, human decency and common sense” and vowed to fight them. “The Trump administration is intent on inflicting cruelty on millions of immigrant families across the country,” she said.

Obtained by NBC News, the new directives signed by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly provide greater detail about two of President Donald Trump’s executive orders relating to his campaign promises of building a border wall with Mexico and increasing deportation efforts. The memos were to be filed on Friday, but are still not final. Currently, they await interagency and White House review. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly testifies before the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday. Andrew Harnik / AP If approved, the memos would order officials to end the release of people captured at the borders while they await hearings, and direct officials to hire additional ICE and Border Patrol agents, as well as send more immigration judges and asylum officers to the border. The documents would also order officials to work with agreeable local police and sheriffs to enforce the new regulations, and allow for expedited removal proceedings for detained immigrants who have been in the U.S. for two years or less. The memos would also allow authorities to criminally prosecute parents who are undocumented immigrants if they paid smugglers to bring their children to the United States. \\"Many of these children fall victim to robbery, extortion, kidnapping, sexual assault and other crimes of violence by the smugglers and other criminal elements along the dangerous journey through Mexico to the United States,\\" the memo obtained by NBC News alleges. In line with Trump’s executive order, one draft memo directs the hiring of 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents and 500 “Air &Marine Agents/Officers.” ICE, meanwhile, would be able to hire 10,000 additional agents “as well as additional operational and mission support and legal staff necessary to hire and support their activities.” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are pictured. LM Otero / AP Those hirings would greatly expand ICE, and the memos would allow for Customs and Border Protection to “begin planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall” — seemingly fulfilling many of Trump’s campaign promises, especially those within his Aug. 31, 2016, address on immigration. \\"The White House has raised objections to some aspects of these memos and we are working with DHS to finalize the policy,\\" a Trump administration official told NBC News, emphasizing that the White House did not have problems with some of the language. Related: Lawmakers, After Meeting With ICE, Say All Undocumented Immigrants at Risk of Deportation \\"We are not going to offer specific areas where we have concerns. We're not going to litigate this in the open,\\" a White House official told NBC News. Briefing and supporting materials for the memos will be available “soon.” The White House has acknowledged the memos as they have circulated in media reports. They said the documents are real, but again stressed that they are not final. |||||","completion":"The US Department of Homeland Security has drafted new guidelines designed to increase the detention and deportation of illegal immigrants, according to two memoranda signed by secretary John Kelly. The memos date from 17 February and are now subject to White House review. If approved, the guidelines would increase detention and deportation, hire new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol agents and enlist local law enforcement officers to help with arrests. The plans do not currently impact Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Raids last week resulted in the arrests of nearly 700 people."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The receipt we came home with says Restaurant Le Caveau, but the location is not that mentioned on the yelp site. They might have two locations. The one we visited was on 410 Place Jaques. We were in the Old Montreal part of town on Saturday June 8 looking for a spot to eat. It was the Grand Prix week-end so naturally a lot of places were full. It was fairly chilly outside and drizzling and we had been walking for close to two hours looking at various places and menus. Finally we came upon this place and it looked very quaint, with a full patio and outside heaters. The maitre'd greeted us and informed us that their specialty was seafood, all fresh. I love seafood so we were sold. Went to sit inside since we were cold and wet, but as soon as went it, we started questioning our decision. The place was dated, and not nearly as busy as the patio. There was also a foul fryer mixed with rotting fish smell so we decided to move outside. we ordered the calamary which was chewy, yellow and tasted old, and the snails which there were only 4 of and no bigger than the ones you get at the keg. They were covered in cheese and mushrooms (of which there was no mention of on the menu but i happen to like mushrooms so i did not complain). On to mains. Since they touted that they were known for their seafood i ordered the muscles and my partner ordered the fillet mignon. Both were awful. the filet tasted as if had been in the fridge for over 3 weeks - tough with a weird spongy time of texture, and very bad flavour. The muscles were not fresh and many did not open during the cooking process. The broth - the little that existed - had no flavour other than overly salty.

Write the answer: What was Lester Piggott's last Derby winner?","completion":"Lester Piggott's last Derby winner was Teenoso, a racehorse that achieved victory in the 1983 Epsom Derby. This prestigious horse race is held annually at Epsom Downs Racecourse in Epsom, Surrey, England. The Epsom Derby is considered one of the five British Classic Races and is the most prestigious of the three Classics, which also include the 2,000 Guineas and the St. Leger Stakes. Lester Piggott, born on November 5, 1935, is an esteemed retired jockey hailing from Wantage, England. Often regarded as one of the greatest flat racing jockeys of all time, Piggott boasts an impressive career, spanning over four decades, during which he amassed an astonishing 4,493 victories. Piggott was well-known for his distinctive and innovative riding style, which involved crouching low over the horse's neck, allowing for better aerodynamics and control. Teenoso, bred in the United States, was a bay colt sired by Youth out of the mare Furioso. He was trained by the esteemed horse trainer Geoff Wragg and owned by Eric Moller. Lester Piggott's connection to Teenoso was instrumental in securing the victory in the Epsom Derby, as the jockey's vast experience and race strategies contributed to the horse's performance. The partnership of Teenoso and Piggott was exceptional, with the duo winning the 1983 Epsom Derby by three lengths despite the unfavorable weather conditions and a muddy track. The 1983 Epsom Derby marked Piggott's ninth and final triumph in the race, solidifying his status as a legend of the sport. His previous Derby wins included victories with these horses: 1. Never Say Die (1954) 2. Crepello (1957) 3. St. Paddy (1960) 4. Sir Ivor (1968) 5. Nijinsky (1970) 6. Roberto (1972) 7. Empery (1976) 8. The Minstrel (1977) Lester Piggott retired from professional racing in 1995, though he did make a brief comeback in the late 1990s in a series of races for charity; his final race occurred when he was 58. Today, Piggott remains an iconic figure within the world of horse racing, with countless fans and aspiring jockeys continuing to look up to his exemplary career, talent, and dedication to the sport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whether it's a short 2-minute video of a cat wearing pants or a feature length comedy, laughing has many health benefits: Laughter stimulates many organs. When we laugh we take in more oxygen than usual, and that stimulates the heart, lungs, and muscles. Laughing increases positive thoughts, leading to the release of stress and disease-fighting neuropeptides. Laughter itself increases mood and leads to feelings of enhanced interpersonal connection when shared with others. When you have negative or nervous feelings, it is hard to stop yourself from wallowing in them. Crack a big smile. It might be fake at first, but think about something that genuinely makes you smile, and keep working at it. A great big smile will momentarily trick your mind into thinking more positively, helping pull you out of a rut. Power posing is a way of holding your body to convey confident and dominant body language. In turn, this can help make your mood more relaxed and confident. For example, when speaking in a meeting, cross your arms across your chest and sit up straight. If you are closing a deal, show that you are engaged by standing, leaning forward, and resting your hands on a table while looking at the client or other individual.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Diabetics have higher levels of sugar and glucose in their blood and vaginal secretions. This is an ideal environment for abundant growth of yeast cells, which normally cause fungal infections. As a result, your child may suffer from recurrent fungal skin infections. Notice if your child seems to be itchy in the genital area. For girls, you may notice that they have repeated vaginal yeast infections, characterized by genital itching and discomfort, with mild white to yellowish foul-smelling discharge. Another type of fungal infection that can be a result of the immune-compromising feature of juvenile diabetes is athlete's foot, which causes white discharge and peeling of the skin in the webs of the toes and soles of the feet. Boys, especially if they are uncircumcised, may also develop a fungal/yeast infection around the tip of the penis. The reflex that enables the body to fight against infections under normal circumstances is hampered by diabetes, as it causes immunological dysfunction. Increased glucose in the blood additionally causes unwelcome bacterial growth, often resulting in frequent bacterial skin infections such as boils or abscesses, carbuncles, and ulcerations. Another aspect of recurrent skin infections is the slow healing of wounds. Even small cuts, scratches or wounds from minor trauma take an abnormally long time to heal. Be on the lookout for anything that doesn't fix itself up as usual. Vitiligo is an auto-immune disorder, leading to reduced levels of the skin pigment melanin. Melanin is the pigment that gives human hair, skin, and eyes their color. With the occurrence of type 1 diabetes, the body develops auto-antibodies that destroy melanin. This results in white patches on the skin. Although it occurs much later in the course of type 1 diabetes and is not very common, it is better to rule out diabetes if your child develops such white patches. These symptoms can accompany diabetes as it progresses. If you notice your child vomiting or overly deep breathing, this is a dangerous sign and you should take your child to the hospital immediately for treatment. These symptoms may be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which can result in a potentially fatal coma. These symptoms come on fast, sometimes within 24 hours. If left untreated, DKA can be fatal. Summary:","completion":"Diabetes in children can lead to recurrent fungal and bacterial skin infections, slow wound healing, and potential development of vitiligo; parents should monitor for symptoms and seek immediate medical attention for signs of diabetic ketoacidosis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It must be rule No 1: never make a movie from the point of view of a rolling camera; it becomes annoying within a few minutes. Is it some movie school student's work?

Although the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141–87 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon. Answer:","completion":"Xuanzang"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plot title: The Devil's Double Movie plot: Iraq, 1985. Latif Yahia (Dominic Cooper), an Iraqi soldier fighting in the Iran-Iraq War, is called to become a \\"fedai\\" (\\"body double\\" or political decoy) for Uday Hussein (also played by Cooper), the playboy son of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein (Philip Quast). Latif comes from an upper-class family and had attended school with Uday, where the other students would remark on their likeness. Latif initially refuses the position, but is imprisoned and tortured, ultimately relenting when his family is threatened.Latif undergoes minor cosmetic surgery to perfect his resemblance to Uday and, over the next three years, practices emulating the young Hussein's mannerisms and wildly volatile persona. He is given access to all of the luxurious benefits of the Husseins' fortune, including massive palaces, expensive wardrobes and Uday's Ferrari Mondial 3.2 and various other exotic cars. Latif tries to resist Uday's exorbitant merrymaking and erratic behavior, at one point fleeing a nightclub in another of Uday's Ferraris to attempt to see his family, who believe he has died in the war. However, he is apprehended by Uday's bodyguards and beaten. After an appearance at a conference with several Kuwaiti leaders, an attempt is made on Uday's (Latif's) life, apparently by a member of a rebel opposition group, possibly a Kurd. The real Uday, though, is more concerned with the Kuwaitis, who he believes have been slant drilling from Iraq's Rumaila oil field. Iraq invads Kuwait in August 1990 which begins the First Gulf War. With the fall of Kuwait, Uday proclaims \\"The Age of the Sheikhs is over!\\"Uday's increasingly violent, sadistic tendencies are displayed when he kidnaps a 14 year-old school girl and forces her to escort him to a party. At the party, (based on an actual 1988 celebration honoring Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's wife Suzanne), the strung-out Uday becomes enraged with his father's personal bodyguard Kamel Hana Gegeo (Mehmet Ferda).

Dennis rubbed a lot of folks the wrong way. Dennis and Neil were two contrasting characters that people came across in their community. Dennis was known for his arrogant personality, which was quite off-putting to many. His self-importance, condescension, and constant need for admiration were sources of discomfort for those around him. Time and time again, he would put down others in order to highlight his own achievements. Individuals who had to interact with Dennis found it increasingly challenging to maintain a cordial relationship with him. His air of superiority often led to people avoiding him whenever possible. His domineering attitude and lack of empathy made it difficult for colleagues, friends, and even family members to tolerate his presence. At social gatherings, Dennis had a knack for dominating conversations and dismissing others’ opinions as he believed his own viewpoint to be infallible. For some, it felt demeaning to have their perspectives disregarded so vehemently. In discussions, rather than listening to others with an open mind, Dennis consistently tried to establish his own thoughts as the only correct ones. As a result, people around him felt unimportant and disrespected. In stark contrast, Neil was a humble individual who radiated warmth and positivity. His unpretentious nature and ability to treat everyone with equal respect were qualities that endeared him to many. People were drawn to his genuineness, feeling at ease whenever they were in his company. They loved his sincerity and admired his selfless attitude. Neil was genuinely interested in others and valued their opinions. He would listen intently and acknowledge their thoughts without disregarding them. When he disagreed, he would do so respectfully and provide constructive criticism to keep the conversation flowing in a productive manner. He lifted the spirits of those around him, encouraging them to engage in conversations, be they casual or profound, without fearing any belittlement. Often, Neil would remind others of the importance of staying grounded. He believed that humility, openness, and empathy were the keys to building strong connections and effective communication. People who met him walked away feeling respected and heard, knowing they had encountered a rare, exceptional individual. In conclusion, the differences between Dennis and Neil were striking. Dennis's arrogance rubbed many folks the wrong way, making it hard for them to enjoy his company. On the other hand, Neil's humility and willingness to value others made him a well-liked and appreciated member of their community. Ultimately, it is clear that people were more drawn to Neil's selflessness and warmth than Dennis's overbearing pride."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Steps and justification: 1. Gather necessary materials: wax shavings, a tin can, a pot, and a stove. These materials are necessary for the task at hand. 2. Place the pot of water on the stove: This provides a source of heat to melt the wax shavings. 3. Bring the water to a boil: Boiling water (100°C or 212°F) will be hot enough to melt the wax shavings effectively. Additionally, it creates steam, which will help the heat transfer to the tin can more evenly. 4. Place the wax shavings in the tin can: The tin can serves as a makeshift double boiler, allowing the wax to melt while preventing direct contact with the heat source. This indirect heat reduces the risk of igniting the wax or damaging it. 5. Place the tin can with wax shavings into the boiling water: By placing the tin can into the boiling water, the heat transfers from the water to the tin can, and then to the wax shavings to melt them. 6. Monitor the melting process, ensuring the tin can remains balanced and stable in the boiling water. This prevents any accidents or spills that may occur. 7. Remove the tin can from the boiling water once the wax shavings have melted. Use caution, as the tin can and melted wax will be hot. You may use tongs or oven mitts to handle the tin can. Option A provides a safer and more efficient method for melting wax shavings using a tin can. This technique ensures even heat distribution and prevents the wax from making direct contact with the heat source, reducing the risk of accidents or damage to the wax."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dress accordingly for the weather. Try to avoid wearing dark colored clothes (such as black or dark grey) if it is during summer. Wearing these colors could make you warmer and you may start sweating. Also, if you're going on the water rides, have a swimsuit on underneath your clothes. Flip flops aren’t really the best idea for an amusement park, especially rides that leave your feet dangling. Wear supportive sneakers or walking shoes. If you want to wear a hat, always remember to put it in a secure pocket before going on a ride. Keep your wallet or purse secure! They can be easily lost in the hustle and bustle of an amusement park. Hair past shoulder length can easily get tangled on a windy ride. Braids are recommended, as they stay closer to the head and don't have loose hair like ponytails. Many coasters can be rough, and you don’t want holes poked into the back of your head. Some earrings may get stuck in your hair or attire. However, if you really want to wear earrings, wear non-dangling ones such as studs or pearls. Especially in the summertime. Most of the ride lines will subject you to the elements, whatever they are. Take a water bottle. It's easy to get dehydrated out in the sun all day. Unless you’re visiting with someone who won’t be riding most of the rides, don’t take huge bags or purses with you if you can help it. You won’t be able to take these on most of the rides. You’ll either have to leave them with a non-rider, pay for a locker, or stuff them into bins before getting onto a ride.

The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements., what would be the answer ?

Detecting a cruise ship close by, the ship alters course as disembodied voices announce in German, \\"Battle Stations! Enemy in sight!\\" Aboard the cruise ship, the prickly Captain Ashland is making his final voyage, attended by his replacement, Captain Trevor Marshall, who has brought along his family. The freighter heads right for them, blasting its horn. Despite Ashland's best efforts, the charging freighter collides with the cruise ship, sinking it. (Some of the sinking scenes were taken from the 1960 film The Last Voyage and darkened to match the nightly effect.) The next morning, a handful of survivorsâMarshall, his wife Margaret (Howes), and their children Robin and Ben; a young officer named Nick and his love interest Lori; the ship's comic Jackie; and a passenger, Mrs. Morganâare adrift on a large piece of wreckage. Ashland surfaces nearby and he's brought aboard, barely conscious. Later, the survivors come upon the black freighter, unaware it's the ship that attacked them. Finding a boarding ladder slung from the stern, they climb aboard, but not before the ladder plunges into the sea as the officers try to climb it with the injured Ashland. When all are finally aboard, Jackie tries to rally the survivors with humor, but a cable seizes him by the ankle, and he is swung outboard by one of the ship's cranes, which lowers him into the water before cutting him loose, to be swept astern and lost. Shocked, the survivors explore the corridors of the empty, echoing vessel, finding only cobwebs and 1930s memorabilia. Hatches open and close by themselves and lights go on and off while a swinging block knocks out Nick, who is exploring above deck. Meanwhile, a delirious Ashland hears a mysterious voice speaking to him in German, telling him \\"This ship has been waiting for you...It is your new ship....Your chance has come!\\" The others finally set up in a dusty bunk room, and they separate to retrieve supplies and the injured captain.... The answer is:","completion":"The memorabilia on the vessel is from the 1930s era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Charles-Camille Saint-Saens (French: [SaRl kamij sesas]; 9 October 1835 - 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\\"Organ\\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886). Saint-Saens was a musical prodigy, making his concert debut at the age of ten. In the early years of the 20th century, the anonymous author of the article on Saint-Saens in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians wrote: Saint-Saens is a consummate master of composition, and no one possesses a more profound knowledge than he does of the secrets and resources of the art; but the creative faculty does not keep pace with the technical skill of the workman. His incomparable talent for orchestration enables him to give relief to ideas which would otherwise be crude and mediocre in themselves ... his works are on the one hand not frivolous enough to become popular in the widest sense, nor on the other do they take hold of the public by that sincerity and warmth of feeling which is so convincing. Although a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Saens was always deeply aware of the great masters of the past. In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic D C Parker wrote, \\"That Saint-Saens knows Rameau ... Bach and Handel, Haydn and Mozart, must be manifest to all who are familiar with his writings. His love for the classical giants and his sympathy with them form, so to speak, the foundation of his art.\\" Less attracted than some of his French contemporaries to the continuous stream of music popularised by Wagner, Saint-Saens often favoured self-contained melodies. Though they are frequently, in Ratner's phrase, \\"supple and pliable\\", more often than not they are constructed in three- or four-bar sections, and the \\"phrase pattern AABB is characteristic\\". An occasional tendency to neoclassicism, influenced by his study of French baroque music, is in contrast with the colourful orchestral music more widely identified with him. Grove observes that he makes his effects more by characterful harmony and rhythms than by extravagant scoring. In both of those areas of his craft he was normally content with the familiar. Rhythmically, he inclined to standard double, triple or compound metres (although Grove points to a 5/4 passage in the Piano Trio and another in 7/4 in the Polonaise for two pianos). From his time at the Conservatoire he was a master of counterpoint; contrapuntal passages crop up, seemingly naturally, in many of his works. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"What were the primary influences and characteristics of Saint-Saens' musical style, and how did his mastery of counterpoint contribute to his compositions?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- SeaWorld employees on Tuesday testified at a federal job safety hearing that, while the behavior of killer whales is is extremely predictable, the job of working with a 6-ton marine mammal carries a calculated risk. The hearing, before the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Review Commission, resumed Monday after a two-month hiatus. It was convened to look into the death of SeaWorld Orlando trainer Dawn Brancheau, 40, in February 2010. OSHA attorneys called three witness -- all from SeaWorld San Diego, including the California park's vice president. SeaWorld strongly objected to the California employees being called as witnesses in a case involving only the Florida theme park. The family has acknowledged that","completion":"working with killer whales was Brancheau's passion and that she understood the risks involved in her job. Nonetheless, the tragic incident has raised concerns about the safety measures implemented to protect trainers and whether they are sufficient to prevent similar accidents in the future. Over the course of the hearing, OSHA and SeaWorld representatives presented contrasting viewpoints on the matter, with OSHA arguing that SeaWorld had violated safety regulations while SeaWorld claimed that it had taken all necessary precautions and that the incident was an unfortunate but isolated event. After several days of testimony and careful examination of the evidence, the Review Commission concluded that, although SeaWorld had implemented a number of safety measures, there were still areas where improvements could be made. The Commission issued several recommendations, including enhanced training for trainers, regular reviews of safety protocols, and the implementation of additional barriers between trainers and the whales during performances. In response to the findings, SeaWorld announced a series of updates to its safety measures, including new trainer protocols, revised emergency procedures, and the introduction of more advanced technology to monitor the whales' behavior. The company also declared that it would increase investments in technology to allow trainers to interact with the animals from a safe distance. The changes did not come without controversy, however, as some animal rights activists argued that the real solution to this issue was not to introduce more safety measures, but to end the practice of keeping killer whales in captivity altogether. They contended that the whales' confinement in small spaces is unnatural and stressful, leading to unpredictable behavior that puts trainers at risk. As a result of the heightened awareness around the safety and ethical aspects of keeping killer whales in captivity, as well as the increased scrutiny of marine parks, a new wave of dialogue was initiated between park officials, animal welfare organizations, and the general public. Although the debate over the ethics of keeping marine mammals in captivity continued for years, this tragic event sparked notable changes in both safety practices and attitudes towards the treatment of these majestic creatures. In memory of Dawn Brancheau, her family established the Dawn Brancheau Foundation, which aims to improve the lives of children and animals in need through education, community involvement, and charitable giving. The foundation's work serves as a lasting legacy of Brancheau's dedication to both her profession and her love for animals, demonstrating that even in the face of tragedy, love and compassion can inspire change for the better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords.

Porn star had previously played a prisoner in one of her adult movies.","completion":"Title: Former Adult Film Star Sona Muellerova Arrested After High-Speed Car Chase Introduction Sona Muellerova, a 25-year-old former adult film actress, has found herself in hot water after leading the police on a high-speed car chase. This dangerous escapade began when Muellerova decided to go to the police station to hand in her driver's license following a ban. Surrendering License Leads to Chase Ironically, the trouble began as Muellerova tried to comply with the law by handing in her license due to the recent ban. After leaving the police station, she got into her car and attempted to drive home. However, the sight of a disqualified driver climbing behind the wheel did not escape the notice of the officers present. As a result, they began chasing Muellerova in an attempt to intervene. High-Speed Pursuit Reaches 136 MPH The car chase escalated quickly, with Muellerova reaching speeds of up to 136 miles per hour as she tried to evade the authorities. It is unclear why she decided not to pull over, but the reckless speed at which she raced down the streets put other drivers and pedestrians at significant risk. This dangerous driving warranted the police's efforts to apprehend her as quickly as possible. Arrest and Crystal Meth Discovery When officers finally caught up with Muellerova, they arrested her on the spot and proceeded to test her for any signs of drug use. The results were shocking—Muellerova tested positive for crystal meth, an illegal and highly addictive stimulant. With these findings, it becomes apparent that her impaired judgment and dangerous driving might have stemmed from her drug use. Facing Possible Jail Time Now, Sona Muellerova is facing serious legal consequences for her actions, with a potential three-year jail sentence if convicted of dangerous driving. This episode marks a stark contrast to her previous on-screen role as a prisoner in one of her adult movies, as the reality of her current situation is far more severe than any scripted scenario. Conclusion Sona Muellerova's high-speed car chase story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of drug use and driving under the influence. It is essential to respect the rules of the road and avoid putting others at risk through reckless behavior. As Muellerova now faces the prospect of a lengthy prison term, one can only hope that she will learn from her mistakes and choose a safer and more responsible path in the future."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Make this proper case.","completion":"Laminated sheets possess a unique property to effectively distribute heat from a concentrated heat source across their layers, ultimately allowing the heat to dissipate throughout its structure. This advantageous ability can be widely observed in various applications and industries. The process of heat spreading across the laminated sheets occurs in several stages. Firstly, when heat is applied to one side of the sheet, it quickly transfers to the adjacent layers due to the conductive nature of the laminated material. As the heat progressively disperses through the layers, the overall temperature of the sheet increases. This, in turn, raises the rate at which heat is conducted away from the source, effectively managing the concentration of heat. One of the critical factors affecting this process is the type of laminated material used. Different materials have distinct thermal conductivity properties, which directly impact their ability to dissipate heat. For instance, laminated sheets made of metals like aluminum or copper exhibit excellent thermal conductivity, making them ideal for applications that require efficient heat spreading. Another essential factor is the number of layers and the thickness of the laminated sheet. Generally, a greater number of layers and reduced thickness lead to a more efficient dispersion of heat within the sheet. This is because thinner sheets conduct heat more rapidly from one side to another, while more layers provide additional pathways for the heat to travel through before dissipating. The ability to spread and dissipate heat across laminated layers is invaluable in various industrial and technological applications. For example, in the electronics industry, laminated materials are widely used as heat sinks to prevent overheating of crucial components in devices such as computers and smartphones. These heat sinks absorb the heat generated by the components and spread it across the laminated sheets, allowing the heat to dissipate, and thus keeping the components within safe operating temperatures. Laminated sheets are also commonly used in the automotive, aerospace, and construction industries. In automotive and aerospace applications, laminated sheets can be used to distribute heat generated by engines or other heat-producing components to prevent damages or malfunctions due to excessive heat buildup. In construction, laminated sheets can be employed in walls, roofs, or other structural components to dissipate heat from solar exposure, ultimately reducing the overall temperature within the building. In conclusion, laminated sheets possess a remarkable property that enables them to effectively spread heat from a concentrated source and dissipate it through their layers. This capability can be attributed to multiple factors, including the details of the laminated material, the thickness of the sheets, and the number of layers. The efficient distribution of heat within laminated sheets delivers vital advantages across a broad range of industries, including electronics, automotive, aerospace, and construction, vastly improving the performance and stability of their respective applications."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Halloween Town is a fantasy world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, zombies, mummies, vampires, werewolves and witches. Jack Skellington, a skeleton with the title of \\"Pumpkin King\\", leads them in organizing the annual Halloween holiday. However, Jack reveals he has grown weary of the same routine year after year, and wants something more. Wandering dejectedly in the woods, he stumbles across seven trees containing doors leading to towns representing various holidays, and accidentally opens a portal to Christmas Town. Impressed by the bright and cheery feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of Christmas, to the Halloween Town residents. However, they fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything to their ideas of Halloween. Jack is dismayed that no one understands the feeling of Christmas, and obsessively studies the holiday but fails to find any further explanation of it.

Rachel chose to have natural childbirth but Emily had an epidural because","completion":"Rachel chose to have natural childbirth but Emily had an epidural because they both had different pain tolerances, beliefs, and preferences when it came to the birthing process. For Rachel, the choice to have a natural childbirth was based on her strong belief in her body's ability to handle the pain and her desire to experience the full range of emotions and sensations involved in the process. She may have also been concerned about possible complications or side effects from medical interventions, such as an epidural, on both her and her baby. Additionally, Rachel may have felt that natural childbirth would allow her to bond more deeply and immediately with her newborn, as she would be fully present and aware during the entire process. Some women who prefer natural childbirth also feel that it gives them a sense of empowerment, as they are able to harness their own inner strength to bring their child into the world without the assistance of medical interventions. On the other hand, Emily decided that an epidural was the best option for her. This choice was likely driven by her desire to minimize the pain and discomfort associated with childbirth. Epidurals can be very effective in blocking the pain signals from the lower body to the brain, providing significant pain relief for many women during labor and delivery. For Emily, this pain relief was essential for her to feel relaxed and confident throughout the process, knowing that she would not have to endure excessive pain. This decision may have also been influenced by her fear of the unknown aspects of labor, or a previous negative childbirth experience, either her own or that of someone she knows. Furthermore, Emily might have been swayed by the fact that having an epidural can generally lead to a more controlled and predictable childbirth experience. With the pain effectively managed, it may be easier for her to focus on other aspects of the process, such as following her doctor's instructions and staying calm. Additionally, in some cases, an epidural may be medically necessary for certain health reasons, or if the labor is not progressing as expected and interventions like a C-section are deemed necessary. In conclusion, Rachel and Emily's different choices regarding natural childbirth and epidurals stem from their individual pain tolerances, beliefs about the birthing process, and their specific preferences for how they wish to experience labor and delivery. Both options can be valid and safe choices, depending on the circumstances and the individual woman's needs and desires. Ultimately, the most important thing is for both Rachel and Emily to feel supported and comfortable in their decisions, as this will lead to a more positive childbirth experience for them both."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: The Danube and Volga rivers both form large deltas, but the Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year. But I can use this background: River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either (1) a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or reservoir, (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope). What is an answer for this question: Which river's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Danube River's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea. This is because the Danube River delta is larger and grows faster every year, indicating that its sediment deposition rate is higher than that of the Volga River. In order for this to happen, the flow velocity of the Danube River must decrease more rapidly when it reaches the sea, causing it to deposit a larger amount of sediment and form a larger delta."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Now, I have a new situation: Two nearby villages are experiencing earthquakes. Bow village gets a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village gets only a few. Answer this question please: Which village experiences fewer rocks breaking? The answer is:","completion":"Arrow village experiences fewer rocks breaking. Based on the given background information, earthquakes occur at plate boundaries due to the movement of tectonic plates and the subsequent release of energy that has been stored in rocks. Elastic rebound theory describes this process. When the stresses build up too much in the rocks, they break, resulting in the sudden release of energy as an earthquake. The extent of rock-breaking is directly related to the frequency and intensity of earthquakes occurring in a particular location. In the new situation described, Bow village experiences a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village experiences only a few. This indicates that the rocks in Bow village have more stress accumulation which causes them to break more frequently, resulting in a higher number of earthquakes. On the other hand, in Arrow village, because there are fewer earthquakes, it can be inferred that the stress accumulation within rocks is less and consequently they break less often. Hence, Arrow village experiences fewer rocks breaking as compared to Bow village, owing to the lower frequency and intensity of earthquakes in that area."},{"prompt":"Q:I have no experience with a lazy 21 yr old.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Q: Energy constantly changes back and forth between kinetic and what type of energy? A: Answer:","completion":"Energy constantly changes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy. To better understand this dynamic relationship, let's first define these two types of energy and then explore their interplay in various real-world scenarios. Kinetic energy is the energy of an object in motion. It is dependent on both the object's mass and its velocity (or speed). The faster an object moves or the more massive it is, the greater its kinetic energy. Mathematically, kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the formula: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2 Here, m represents the mass of the object, and v represents its velocity. Potential energy, on the other hand, is the energy stored in an object due to its position in a system or its configuration. There are several forms of potential energy, including gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy, and chemical potential energy. Gravitational potential energy, for instance, is the energy an object possesses because of its position in a gravitational field (e.g., at a certain height above the Earth's surface). The formula for gravitational potential energy (GPE) is: GPE = m * g * h Here, m represents the mass of the object, g stands for the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2 on Earth), and h represents the height of the object above the reference point (usually Earth's surface). The interplay between kinetic and potential energy can be observed in various phenomena. For instance, consider a swing. When a person sits on the swing and is pulled back to its highest point, the system has maximum gravitational potential energy as the person is at the highest point from the ground. As the swing is released and begins its downward motion, the gravitational potential energy converts to kinetic energy. At the lowest point in the swing's trajectory, the kinetic energy is at its maximum, and the potential energy is at its minimum. As the swing then moves upward and slows down, the kinetic energy is gradually converted back into potential energy. This back and forth conversion of energy between kinetic and potential continues until external forces, such as air resistance or friction, eventually bring the swing to a stop. Another example is a roller coaster ride. As the coaster climbs to the top of the first hill, it gains gravitational potential energy. Once it begins its descent, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, causing the coaster to accelerate. Throughout the ride, the roller coaster will continually exchange kinetic and potential energy as it moves up and down hills and around bends, ultimately losing some energy to external forces like friction and air resistance. In summary, energy constantly changes between kinetic energy, associated with motion, and potential energy, tied to an object's position or configuration. This interplay is crucial for understanding energy conservation and transfer in various real-world situations, such as swinging objects, roller coasters, and even everyday activities like walking and jumping."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Article: When I was small, my grandmother died. I was so sad that I had no tears. But that night when my dad tried to cheer me up, my laugh turned into crying. So it came as no surprise to learn that scientists believe crying and laughing come from the same part of the brain. Just as laughing has many health advantages, scientists are discovering that so, too, does crying. Whatever it takes for us to _ pressure is important to our emotional health, and a study found that 85 percent of women and 73 percent of men report feeling better after crying. Besides, tears attract help from other people. Researchers agree that when we cry, people around us become kinder and friendly and they are more ready to provide support and comfort. Tears also enable us to understand our emotions better; sometimes we don't even know we're very sad until we cry. We learn about our emotions through crying, and then we can deal with them. Just as crying can be healthy, not crying - holding back tears of anger, pain or suffering - can be bad for physical health. Studies have shown that too much control of emotions can lead to high blood pressure and heart problems. If you have a health problem, doctors will certainly not ask you to cry. But when you feel like crying, don't fight it. It's a natural -and healthy-emotional response . Question: What is the best title for the passage?

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, both questions are essentially asking the same thing: they inquire about the best programming language to start learning as a beginner. Determining the ideal programming language to learn first greatly depends on your goals, interests, and the projects you want to work on. Different languages are uniquely tailored for specific purposes; therefore, it is crucial to consider your objectives when making a choice. Here's a list of some popular programming languages along with the various contexts in which they excel: 1. Python: Widely regarded as one of the best programming languages for beginners due to its readability and simplicity, Python is used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. It is also popular amongst educators and researchers. 2. JavaScript: As the backbone of web development, JavaScript has become an indispensable language for anyone interested in front-end web development. While traditionally restricted to the client-side, the introduction of Node.js has enabled JavaScript to be used for server-side programming as well, making it a versatile option for modern web developers. 3. Java: With its \\"write once, run anywhere\\" principle, Java is renowned for its portability and widespread adoption across various industries. Java's demand can be primarily attributed to its use in Android app development, as well as in large-scale enterprise applications and backend systems. 4. C#: Developed by Microsoft, C# is a versatile language used in Windows application development, game development (primarily using Unity), and web applications via ASP.NET. It is an excellent choice for those who aim to work within the Microsoft ecosystem. 5. C++: This language is regarded as the foundation for many modern programming languages and offers a more in-depth understanding of computer memory usage. It is widely used in the development of high-performance applications, game engines, and system-level software. However, it has a steeper learning curve and may be more challenging for beginners. 6. Ruby: Known for its elegance and simplicity, Ruby is an ideal language for web application development. It is often associated with the Rails framework, which has fueled its popularity among companies and startups looking for a fast and efficient way to build web applications. 7. Swift: If your focus extends to iOS application development, Swift is the go-to language for creating applications for Apple products, including iPhone, iPad, and Macs. Swift was designed by Apple to be a replacement for Objective-C, offering a safer and more efficient language option for their products. Based on this information, as a beginner, you may consider starting with Python or JavaScript, as both languages are relatively accessible and have significant real-world applications. Once you've developed a foundation and garnered experience, you can venture into learning more specialized languages that align with your interests and project requirements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Lower Manhattan's controversial Park51 Islamic center is now in a court battle with utility Consolidated Edison, which says the center owes it 1.7 million in a dispute over back rent. In court papers, Park51 says it owes Con Edison only 881,000 and calls the utility's demand \\"grossly inflated.\\" The center has filed suit against the company over a default notice it was issued in September, and a New York state judge has stayed any action until after a hearing in November. In a statement to CNN on Sunday, Con Edison said it \\"remains hopeful\\" that it can work out an agreement with Park51, which leases part of its property from the utility. Park51's developers did not return a phone call seeking comment. The center, which includes a mosque, drew intense opposition in 2010 from politicians, conservative activists and some families of the victims of the al Qaeda attack on the World Trade Center. The twin towers stood about two blocks from the site before they were destroyed by the suicide hijackings on September 11, 2001, leading critics to dub the project the \\"Ground Zero Mosque.\\" The interfaith center's leaders said the project will be a 16-story community center with recreational, educational and cultural programming rooted in a spirit of cooperation and coexistence. City officials refused to block its construction, and Park51 held its grand opening in September. According to court documents, Park51 has exercised an option to purchase the Con Edison portion of the site for 10.7 million. The center says it has been paying 2,750 a month -- minuscule by New York standards -- under its initial lease. The rent was to be recalculated based on the market value of the property after it renewed the lease in 2008, but disputes over the appraisal lasted until this August. In September, Con Edison demanded the 1.7 million it said it was owed. \\"The lease for the property calls for the tenant to pay this money now that an appraisal process has been completed,\\" the utility told CNN. \\"Under the terms of the lease, Con Edison requested payment of outstanding rent, but to date, tenant has not yet made the required payment.\\" But lawyers for Park51 argue the demand is based on \\"a fundamental misreading\\" of its lease and have accused Con Edison of improperly trying to take back the property. \\"Whether it is bowing to political pressure or seeking to retain the valuable premises for itself, Con Ed appears intent upon proceeding with its wrongful termination (and cancellation of plaintiff's right to purchase the premises) and it has expressly threatened to do so,\\" they wrote. Con Edison said Sunday it has defended Park51's right to buy the land.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: To make the diluted essential oil solution, you’ll need to gather a few items. You’ll need your selected essential oil and your supplemental carrier oil, a separate bottle or container to hold the new mixture, and several eye droppers. Try to get dark colored glass bottles to filter out the damaging UV rays. Using two separate eye droppers to avoid cross-contamination, make your mixture based on the formula you have already established. If your formula calls for 12 drops of essential oil and 5 drops of carrier oil, use your eye droppers to extract the desired amount of each liquid and carefully squeeze it into the new container – making sure to count each drop carefully. Once you have added both ingredients, put the lid on and give it a good shake to ensure the contents are properly mixed. And don’t forget to label the bottle before you put it away and forget what is in it. Be cautious about direct contact to the skin of the undiluted essential oils. You should also carefully weigh your decision to use essential oils if you are pregnant. There is controversy around whether or not essential oils can impact a fetus, so you should carefully consider it for yourself. Typically, you need to store your essential oils (including diluted essential oil mixtures) in a cool, dark place. It’s important to keep them out of direct sunlight or away from places that are constantly being cooled and warmed based on exposure to the sun. This will keep them from becoming useless because of increased oxidation over time. Carrier oils should be stored in the fridge during the hot summer months to avoid fatty particles from forming that will need to be re-dissolved before you can use it. But they should still be at room temperature when you use them for mixing, so take them out of the fridge twelve hours before you intend to use them. Summary:","completion":"Creating a diluted essential oil solution involves several steps and materials. First, the essentials required for the task include a chosen essential oil and complementary carrier oil besides a bottle or container, ideally dark-colored glass to block harmful UV rays, and a couple of eye droppers to prevent cross-contamination. The mixing formula is predicated on predetermined measurements; for example, for a formula that demands 12 drops of essential oil and 5 drops of carrier oil, these quantities are drawn out using the eye droppers and slowly deposited into the new container. The blend needs to be thoroughly shaken after the lid is fixed on to ensure appropriate blending. It's also vital to label the bottle to avoid future confusion. For safety reasons, any direct skin contact with undiluted essential oils should be avoided. Expectant women specifically need to carefully consider their use of essential oils due to the contentious discourse regarding essential oils' potential impact on the fetus. The storage of essential oils, both in their pure and diluted states, should ideally be in a cool, dark place, away from any direct sunlight or temperatures fluctuating due to sun exposure. They can degrade and become ineffective over time due to elevated oxidation. During summer, carrier oils should be kept refrigerated to inhibit the formation of fatty particles that would need redissolving prior to use. However, they need to be brought to room temperature during the mixing process, meaning they should be removed from the fridge about twelve hours before."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

Please answer the following question: - Plates on the Earth&#x27;s crust move slowly past each other - As the plates move, they exert a great force - When the force is large enough, the crust breaks - The stress is released as energy - The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process after energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves is the occurrence of an earthquake. Earthquake events are the direct result of the release of energy from the Earth's crust due to the constant motion and interaction of tectonic plates. This energy travels as seismic waves, which cause ground shaking, vibrations, and deformations at the surface and beneath. As seismic waves propagate through the Earth's interior from the point of the crust break (the earthquake's focus or hypocenter), they lose some of their energy, but they still carry enough force to the ground surface (the earthquake's epicenter) and surrounding areas. Upon reaching the surface, seismic waves cause the ground to shake, often leading to various degrees of damage depending on the earthquake's magnitude and the affected area's geological and structural conditions. There are two main types of seismic waves associated with earthquakes: body waves and surface waves. Body waves, which comprise of primary (P) and secondary (S) waves, move through the Earth's interior, whereas surface waves, which include Rayleigh waves and Love waves, only travel along the Earth's surface. The shaking caused by earthquake-related seismic waves can result in landslides, liquefaction, surface rupture, and tsunamis. In addition, these ground motions can result in the collapse of buildings, damage to infrastructure, and other hazards to human life and property. Following the earthquake event, there will also be aftershocks, which are smaller earthquakes that occur in the same region as the mainshock. Aftershocks are a consequence of the adjustment of the Earth's crust after the abrupt displacement as the tectonic plates continue to interact and reposition themselves. Aftershocks can last from hours to several weeks or even years after the main earthquake, and although they are usually smaller in magnitude than the initial quake, they can still cause additional damage to structures weakened during the main event or increase the risk of landslides. In summary, after tectonic plates exert a great force and cause the crust to break, the stress is released as seismic waves, which lead to an earthquake event. The seismic waves travel through the Earth and cause ground shaking, resulting in multiple hazards such as landslides, surface rupture, and infrastructure damage. Moreover, the energy release initiates aftershocks, which adds a prolonged effect of the earthquake and can cause additional destruction in the affected areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please answer the following question: Information: - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Telmatosaurus (meaning \\"marsh lizard\\") is a genus of basal hadrosaurid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. It was a relatively small hadrosaur, approximately five meters (16 ft) long, found in what is now Romania. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago. - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe. - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU. - The Late Cretaceous (100.566 Ma) is the younger of two epochs into which the Cretaceous period is divided in the geologic timescale. Rock strata from this epoch form the Upper Cretaceous series. The Cretaceous is named after the white limestone known as chalk which occurs widely in northern France and is seen in the white cliffs of south-eastern England, and which dates from this time. - The tibia (plural tibiae or tibias), also known as the shinbone or shankbone, is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the fibula), and it connects the knee with the ankle bones. The tibia is found on the medial side of the leg next to the fibula, and closer to the median plane or centre-line. The tibia is connected to the fibula by the interosseous membrane of the leg, forming a type of fibrous joint called a syndesmosis with very little movement. The tibia is named for the flute \\"tibia\\". It is the second largest bone in the human body next to the femur. The leg bones are the strongest long bones as they support the rest of the body. - The femur (pl. \\"femurs\\" or \\"femora\\" ) or thigh bone, is the most proximal (closest to the hip joint) bone of the [leg] in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs. In vertebrates with four legs such as dogs and horses, the femur is found only in the hindlimbs. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and kneecap forming the knee joint. By most measures the femur is the strongest bone in the body. The femur is also the longest bone in the body. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Orthomerus ( meaning \`\` straight femur '' ) is a genus of duckbill dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of The Netherlands and Belgium . It is today an obscure genus , but in the past was conflated with the much better known Telmatosaurus . - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. - A hindlimb is a posterior limb on an animal, especially the quadrupeds. When referring to quadrupeds, the term hind leg is often instead used. - In humans, the thigh is the area between the pelvis and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the lower limb. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - Hadrosaurids (\\"hadrós\\", \\"stout, thick\\"), or duck-billed dinosaurs, are members of the ornithischian family Hadrosauridae. This group is also known as the duck-billed dinosaurs, for the flat, duck-bill appearance of their mouths. The family, which includes ornithopods such as \\"Edmontosaurus\\" and \\"Parasaurolophus\\", was a common herbivore in the Upper Cretaceous Period of what is now Asia, Europe, Antarctica, South America and North America. Hadrosaurids are descendants of the Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous iguanodontian dinosaurs and had a similar body layout. Like the rest of the ornithischians, these animals had a predentary bone and a pubic bone which was positioned backwards in the pelvis. Hadrosaurids are divided into two principal subfamilies: the lambeosaurines (\\"Lambeosaurinae\\"), which had hollow cranial crests or tubes, and the saurolophines, identified as hadrosaurines in most pre-2010 works (\\"Saurolophinae\\" or\\" Hadrosaurinae\\"), which lacked hollow cranial crests (solid crests were present in some forms). Saurolophines tended to be bulkier than lambeosaurines. Lambeosaurines are divided into Aralosaurines, Lambeosaurines, Parasaurolophines and Tsintaosaurines, while Saurolophines include Saurolophus, Brachylophosaurines and Kritosaurines. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions. - The TriassicJurassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, , and is one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. In the seas, a whole class (conodonts) and 34% of marine genera disappeared. On land, all pseudosuchians (non-ornithodiran archosaurs) other than crocodylomorphs (Sphenosuchia and Crocodyliformes), some remaining therapsids, and many of the large amphibians became extinct. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \\"fens\\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park. - The knee joint joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two articulations: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint). It is the largest joint in the human body. The knee is a modified hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight internal and external rotation. The knee joint is vulnerable to injury and to the development of osteoarthritis.

He was the son of Stephen VIII Báthory of the noble Hungarian Báthory family and his wife Catherine Telegdi. He had at least five siblings: two brothers and three sisters. Little is known about his childhood. Around 1549-1550 he briefly visited Italy and probably spent a few months attending lectures at the Padua University. Upon his return, he joined the army of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and took part in his military struggle against the Turks. Some time after 1553 Báthory was captured by the Turks, and after Ferdinand I refused to pay his ransom, joined the opposing side, supporting John II Sigismund Zápolya in his struggle for power in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. As Zápolya's supporter, Báthory acted both as a feudal lord, military commander and a diplomat. During one of his trips to Vienna he was put under house arrest for two years. During this time he fell out of favour at Zápolya's court, and his position was largely assumed by another Hungarian noble, Gáspár Bekes. Báthory briefly retired from politics, but he still wielded considerable influence and was seen as a possible successor to Zápolya. After Zápolya's death in 1571, the Transylvanian estates elected Báthory Voivode of Transylvania. Bekes, supported by the Habsburgs, disputed his election, but by 1573 Báthory emerged victorious in the resulting civil war and drove Bekes out of Transylvania.

BRISTOW, Okla. – It’s a case that sparked outrage in an Oklahoma community, and caused state leaders to take action against a little known loophole in the law. “He’s like right there, practically in my backyard and that kind of makes me nervous and not want to go home ever,” 21-year-old Danyelle Dyer told NewsChannel 4. Danyelle says her uncle, Harold English, was just released from prison after he was convicted of molesting her when she was a child. While she hoped to moved on after his conviction, her family says no one expected what would happen after English was released. Instead of being out of her life, English moved in with his mother, who lives just over the fence. “Not only is my daughter feeling her past come back to haunt her, but a lot of years of rage and anger that I’ve kept under my collar is sitting right outside my door,” said Greg Dyer. After learning about the situation, the community came out to support Danyelle and urge Oklahoma officials to change the law. Now, it seems that change is in the works. On Thursday, Judge Richard Woolery issued a 1,000 feet protective order for the Dyer family, meaning that English has 10 days to vacate the premises. Current law prohibits sex offenders from living within a 2,000 feet radius of schools, daycare centers and parks, but it does not stop a sex offender from living within a certain proximity of the victim. “Supposedly, he paid his debt to society and as long as he’s not near a church or a daycare or where children gather, he’s free to do as he wishes,” said Greg Dyer. Lawmakers say their hands are currently tied since they are not in session, but say they are committed to changing the law once they get back to the Capitol. “We applaud Judge Woolery for taking the steps necessary to protect the victim and her family. While we are grateful that this specific situation has been resolved, we remain committed to fixing this loophole in the law next spring. It is unacceptable that a sex offender could move in next door to the victim, and furthermore, a victim should not have to go through the trouble of hiring an attorney to prevent this- it should simply be the law. Many individuals have come forward to help this family, but specifically we would like to thank the Attorney General’s office and Representative Scott Biggs for going above and beyond to point the family in the right direction throughout this difficult situation. The courage Danyelle has shown throughout has been incredible. Through her advocacy in the last month, she has brought national attention to a loophole that is present in 45 out of 50 states. Thanks to her, hopefully this will never happen anywhere in the United States ever again,” a statement from Rep. Kyle Hilbert and Sen. James Leewright read. ||||| A convicted sex offender who moved next-door to his victim following his recent release from prison must find a new home after an Oklahoma judge granted a protective order prohibiting him from living within 1,000 feet of the niece he molested when she was a little girl. PEOPLE confirms that 21-year-old Danyelle Dyer was granted the order against her uncle, Harold English, during a hearing held Thursday before Judge Richard Woolery. English, now 65, served more than a dozen years behind bars following his 2004 conviction on lewd molestation charges. Upon his release on June 13, English moved into his mother’s home in Bristow, Oklahoma — only yards away from Dyer. “I was coming back from class and he was out mowing in my grandmother’s backyard, and it made me uneasy just being home,” Dyer told PEOPLE in June. “I go to school in Edmond, [Oklahoma,] so I’m only home half the time, and I think twice before going home now. I have a very close family, so it’s hard for me to not constantly be with them.” Five states, including Alabama and Tennessee, place restrictions on how far an offender can live from his or her victim. Oklahoma statute bars sex offenders from living within 1,000 feet of a school, playground or child care facility, but it does not restrict where offenders may live in relation to their victims. State Rep. Kyle Hilbert tells PEOPLE he’s “very happy” for Dyer, who was unavailable for comment Monday, but notes the protective order only resolves her dilemma and not that of other victims who might be in similar situations. “She is almost certainly not the only person going through this right now,” he says. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Harold English Oklahoma Sex & Violent Offender Registry “This protective order lasts forever, but even with this happening and us getting a positive result for the family, I will still move forward with legislation that will bar sex offenders from living within a certain distance of their victims,” Hilbert says. “A victim should not have to hire an attorney and go through this legal process and face their assailants in court again,” he says. Hilbert lauded how Dyer has “been able to highlight this issue” far beyond Oklahoma. “She has brought national attention to this loophole and is going to help victims all over the country,” he says. “I’ve already had two different attorneys contact me who have been involved in similar cases. I thought, ‘Surely, this never happens,’ but unfortunately it does.” Oklahoma’s legislature meets between February and May, meaning lawmakers won’t return to the capital until 2018. Hilbert has said he hopes to get his new bill in front of the state house as soon as possible. “I was pretty outraged,” Dyer said in June. “But I have channeled that rage into a more positive outlet, which, for me, is sharing my story and empowering other victims of sexual assault.” PEOPLE has been unable to reach English or his mother for comment, and Dyer said that she, too, had had no contact with them since June 13. Source: Larina Dyer/Facebook “I think Danyelle is okay for trying to get a law passed,” her grandmother told CNN in June. “But she shouldn’t blame me for what happened because this is my son and I just give him a place to stay until he can find a place on his own.” “I don’t agree with what my son did,” English’s mother said. Dyer told PEOPLE that she no longer wanted anything to do with her grandmother because of the older woman’s decisions. When Dyer was in high school, her uncle was released and lived with her grandmother until he violated probation and “went right back” to prison, Dyer said. She said she wrote her grandmother a letter about the situation, but she did not get a reply. “She is supposed to protect me, she is supposed to take care of me,” Dyer said, “so for her to turn on me like this, she obviously doesn’t care about me.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"An Oklahoma judge has granted a 1,000 feet protective order for a family after convicted sex offender Harold English was released from prison and moved in with his mother, who lives next door to his victim, his niece Danyelle Dyer.

How to hang bathroom towels Use free standing racks to store many towels for family or guests. Standalone racks are a great option for hanging your towels when you lack enough room for wall racks. Hang towels in matching or coordinating colors (like light blue and green) on the rack's bars.","completion":"The most logical next event after obtaining and setting up a free-standing rack for hanging bathroom towels would be organizing, maintaining, and routinely refreshing these towels. To help create an inviting ambiance and ensure cleanliness in the bathroom, here are some steps to follow: 1. Organize your towels: Keep your everyday-use towels separate from guest towels. You can designate specific bars on the standing rack for each purpose, or even use color-coded towels (e.g., white for guests and blue for family members) to avoid confusion. Alternatively, you can also keep guest towels in a separate space such as a linen closet, and bring them out only when needed. 2. Fold towels uniformly: To create a neat and visually appealing display, fold towels consistently. For example, fold them in halves or thirds lengthwise, and then fold them again in half or thirds, depending on the size of towels and the space on the rack. This will ensure that all towels are of equal size and shape when hung or stacked on the rack. 3. Hang towels properly: Hang towels on the rack with equal space between them to allow proper air circulation and faster drying. Ideally, the folded edge should face the wall, while the open ends hang down, to give a neat and polished appearance. Also, ensure that the towels are hung straight and do not touch the bathroom floor. 4. Practice hygiene: To maintain cleanliness, wash your towels frequently. The frequency of washing will depend on individual preferences and usage habits but aim for every 3-4 days for daily use towels and every two weeks for guest towels that are not used often. 5. Rotate your towels: Rotate different sets of towels to prevent overuse and wear on any particular set. It will also help to prolong the lifespan of your towels, as constant use can lead to them becoming thin, less absorbent, and less soft. 6. Refresh the display: Occasionally, change the color coordination or arrangement of your towels to keep your bathroom looking fresh and invigorated. This can also be done seasonally, with lighter-colored towels for the warmer months and darker, warm-colored towels for colder months. 7. Add finishing touches: To create a pleasant atmosphere in your bathroom, consider adding a few decorative elements, such as candles, potted plants, or a small piece of wall art. Choose items that either complement or contrast the color of your towels, creating a harmonious and stylish arrangement. Implementing these steps will enhance the appearance of your bathroom and provide an organized system for towel storage and maintenance. Following these guidelines will ensure your bathroom remains a comfortable and functional space that leaves a positive impression on both family members and guests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have never done any kind of run before. What advice do you have for us? Choose from: 1). no; 2). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Question 1: Buying a solitaire diamond ring for your wife When buying a solitaire diamond ring, there are several aspects you need to consider: 1. Budget: Determine your budget first before you start looking at diamond rings. This will help you stay focused and find the right ring within your price range. 2. The 4Cs: Diamonds are evaluated using the 4Cs - carat, color, clarity, and cut. Learn about these characteristics, as they will help you choose the perfect diamond for your wife. Here's a brief overview: a) Carat: Carat is the unit of weight for a diamond. A larger carat size typically means a more expensive diamond. However, a bigger diamond does not always mean better. Choose a carat size that is suitable for your wife's preferences and your budget. b) Color: Diamonds come in a range of colors, with colorless (D) being the most valuable, and slightly yellow (Z) being the least valuable. Aim for a diamond with a color grade of H or better, as it will appear colorless to the naked eye. c) Clarity: Clarity refers to the presence of inclusions (internal) and blemishes (external) in the diamond. The highest clarity grade is FL (flawless), while the lowest is I3 (included). Select a diamond with a clarity grade of SI1 or better, as these will have inclusions that are not visible without magnification. d) Cut: The cut of a diamond is crucial as it affects how light is reflected and refracted, ultimately influencing the diamond's sparkle. The cut grades are excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor. Aim for a diamond with a cut grade of very good or excellent. 3. Ring setting: Choose a setting that complements the diamond's shape and highlights its beauty. Popular solitaire settings include prong, bezel, and tension. 4. Metal: Select a metal for the ring, such as gold, white gold, rose gold, or platinum. Consider your wife's preferences and lifestyle before making a choice. 5. Ring size: Make sure you know your wife's ring size before buying the solitaire ring. 6. Certification: Always buy a certified diamond from a reputable lab like GIA, AGS, or EGL USA. This ensures you are getting an accurately graded diamond. 7. Purchase from a reputed jeweler: Do your research and find a reputable jeweler with good customer reviews and a solid return policy. You can also consider buying from online retailers like Blue Nile or James Allen. Question 2: Preparing for a 5k color run As first-time runners, here are some tips to help you prepare for the 5k color run: 1. Choose the right shoes: Invest in a comfortable pair of running shoes with proper cushioning and support. 2. Training: Start training around 6-8 weeks before the event. Gradually increase your running distance and pace, incorporating walk breaks if needed. Aim to run at least 3-4 times a week. 3. Cross-training: Add cross-training activities like cycling, swimming, or yoga to your weekly routine to develop overall fitness and flexibility. 4. Hydration and Nutrition: Drink plenty of water and maintain a healthy, balanced diet for optimal energy levels during training. 5. Listen to your body: It's important to avoid injuries, so pay attention to any pain or discomfort, and rest or consult a healthcare professional if needed. 6. Practice running with colored powder: Familiarize yourself with running through colored powder, as you may encounter it during the event. You can use cornstarch mixed with food coloring for practice. 7. Dress appropriately: Wear white or light-colored clothing to showcase the colors, and consider using a bandana or goggles to protect your eyes and mouth from the powder. 8. Research the event: Know the race route, location, and schedule of activities in advance, so you arrive well-prepared on race day. 9. Warm-up: Warm up with dynamic stretching exercises for 5-10 minutes before the race. 10. Enjoy the experience: The color run is meant to be a fun, non-competitive event, so focus on enjoying the experience with your wife and embracing the colorful atmosphere.

Make no mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff. She becomes sheriff when her husband is gunned down; she is only a tad bit upset by this. Her main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. So this is what happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. Utterly stupid, as anyone killed in this movie has the new sheriff to thank. She had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but I guess because she liked him she wouldn't do it. The killer is also after the mayor of the town for personal reasons that are also rather dumb. This movie is very boring and not really worth watching...it is not one of the better episodes of MST3000 they made.

Cracker had a tendency to be over-the-top on occasion, but Robbie Coltrane and the other cast members, as well as the writers, always seemed to carry it off despite themselves. I count the original Cracker among the great Brit TV crime series of that time, and there's some stiff competition: Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Homes, and a host of others. Cracker, along with Prime Suspect, was on the top of my list. Which makes \\"A New Terror\\" all the more sad... Ultimately, this was a very pale imitation of Cracker's former glory. I forced myself to sit through the whole thing, convinced that it couldn't actually be this bad, and that some spark would eventually ignite. I was wrong, it was bad from beginning to end. A few criticisms: First, just to get any potential bias up-front right off: I was offended by the anti-American, anti-war screed that droned on and on throughout most of the show. The topper: the murder of two American's innocent of any crime and a British Junkie is, in Fitz's words, \\"understandable, but not justified\\". I thought \\"I waded through two hours of crap just to hear this disgusting bit of drivel?\\" So I had a negative reaction to the anti-war/American tone brought on by my beliefs... Beyond the politics, I had the distinct sense that this Cracker was merely a prop for the propaganda, and it actually helped to undermine an already terribly weak script. Second, just how much air-time did Robbie Coltrane get? Fitz was almost a bit player in this one, as if he was an afterthought plugged into some story originally written without any thought of Fitz's role. Coltrane could have carried the show on his own broad and still suitably flabby shoulders, but the writer was apparently thinking of other things, and missed the chance, and by a wide margin. Third: WHAT AN ABYSMAL SCRIPT! There was some sparkle, and a couple of bits of actual character development (Fitz's son ranting that Fitz couldn't stay at his house if he missed his plane to Australia, the Detective that liked to beat his poor-performers over the backs of their heads, and some of the old sparks between Fitz and his Missus) but not nearly enough to carry the tedious storyline. Fourth, where the hell was Panhallagan? Now that would have been interesting... It was Manchester after all, and 10 years on she'd be up in the ranks. Another wasted opportunity (or perhaps the actress wasn't interested?) Well, there's much more (that's bad) to say , but I'll close with a curiosity: at the end of the show (as it aired on BBCA), when the advertisement announced that the \\"Director's Cut\\" was available on BBC On-Demand, I thought AH-HA! The Director's cut, which, presumably, one has to pay for, might have all of the goodies I expected to see tonight but never did, like a coherent, interesting storyline. Unfortunately, after convincing myself to sit through the horrible free version of \\"A New Terror\\" with the hope of seeing something, anything, worth watching, only to be disappointed, I have no hope left to motivate me to actually pay for a second, potentially longer and more tedious version. Besides, it angered me to think that BBCA sliced and diced, and sacrificed show time to accommodate the endless (every ten minutes or so) stream of commercials, and then turned around and asked me to pay for what probably should have been version aired tonight. To close, I quote the first paragraph of Variety's review of \\"A New Terror\\": it really says it all: \\"Initial excitement about Robbie Coltrane reprising his role as the BBC's flawed, boozing, womanizing criminal psychologist is snowed under by the heavy-handed political statement writer Jimmy McGovern is determined to deliver within this revival vidpic. Jolting at first in its message -- namely, that Americans are a bunch of whiny namby-pambies who didn't care a whit about terrorism before it came crashing onto our doorstep -- McGovern's chest-clearing rant overwhelms the narrative and mutes the pleasure of seeing Fitz back on the case.\\"","completion":"The sentiment of this text is mostly negative. The person writing it seems to be disappointed with the \\"A New Terror\\" version of the Cracker series, as they think it is a weak imitation compared to the original. They criticize the political message, the script, the lack of focus on Robbie Coltrane's character, and other aspects of the show.

Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar ( ( listen); born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team, regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. The highest run scorer of all time in International cricket, Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards. The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003-04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four at strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spend 613 minute at crease.India have a first inning score of 705/7. He followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test. Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests. It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty. Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests. Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise. Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste. After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest. A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004. He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2-1. On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007. Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan. He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006, and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory. On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd, the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity. Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century. Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.

Here is a breakdown of the differences in meaning: In the first sentence: \\"It was described by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874 and found in North America.\\" This sentence conveys that Alpheus Spring Packard, an individual, described the subject (presumably an organism, species, or some natural phenomenon) in 1874. Additionally, this subject can be found in North America. The main focus here is the fact that Packard contributed to the description of the subject, and the discovery of the subject's geographical location (North America) is a secondary piece of information. In the second sentence: \\"It was found by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874 and is described in North America.\\" This sentence suggests that Alpheus Spring Packard himself discovered or found the subject in 1874. Furthermore, the subject is described in North America, implying that there may be documents, studies, or records that exist within North America that describe the subject. The focus in this sentence is more on Packard's role in finding or discovering the subject, and less on his contribution to describing it. The reference to the subject being \\"described in North America\\" does not provide information about who was responsible for its description. In summary, while the sentences are similar in discussing Alpheus Spring Packard's interaction with and study of a subject in 1874, they differ in emphasis on his role with respect to the subject. The first sentence highlights Packard's description of the subject, whereas the second sentence emphasizes his discovery or finding of the subject."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The studies provide a missing link in the puzzle that has connected naval exercises around the world to unusual mass strandings of whales and dolphins. Beaked whales, the most common casualty of the strandings, were shown to be highly sensitive to sonar. But the research also revealed unexpectedly that blue whales, the largest animals on Earth and whose population has plummeted by 95% in the last century, also abandoned feeding and swam rapidly away from sonar noise. The strong response observed in the beaked whales occurred at noise levels well below those allowed for US navy exercises. \\"This result has to be taken into consideration by regulators and those planning naval exercises,\\" said Stacy DeRuiter, at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, who led one of the teams. \\"For whales and dolphins, listening is as important as seeing is for humans – they communicate, locate food, and navigate using sound,\\" said Sarah Dolman, at charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation. \\"Noise pollution threatens vulnerable populations, driving them away from areas important to their survival, and at worst injuring or even causing the deaths of some whales and dolphins.\\" Dolman said there were no accepted international standards regarding noise pollution and there was an urgent need to re-evaluate the environmental impacts of military activities. The US Navy part-funded the new studies but said the findings only showed behavioural responses to sonar, not actual harm. Nonetheless, Kenneth Hess, a US Navy spokesman, said permit conditions for naval exercises were reviewed annually and added: \\"We will evaluate the effectiveness of our marine mammal protective measures in light of new research findings.\\" Unusual mass strandings, where multiple species of whale and dolphin beach at several locations at once, have soared since the introduction of military sonar in the 1950s and can be fatal. The strandings occur every year and major recent events saw up to 15 animals beached in the Canary Islands, the Bahamas and Greece. In May, the naval activity was found to be the most probable cause of the deaths of at least 26 short-beaked common dolphins in Falmouth Bay, Cornwall in June 2008. Beaked whales are the most common species affected by unusual mass strandings, perhaps because their shy nature makes them more easily scared by noises that they may interpret as killer whale sounds. Researchers used suction cups to attach digital devices to Cuvier's beaked whales off the coast of Southern California to measure the noise they were exposed to and their response. When a simulated military sonar signal was sounded at 200dB and between 3km and 10km away, the whales initially stopped feeding and swimming. They then swam rapidly away from the noise and some performed unusually deep and long dives. \\"The missing piece of the puzzle was how whales changed their behaviour and how that led to mass strandings,\\" said DeRuiter. She added that they also stopped feeding for 6-7 hours, which is unusual. \\"If they miss out on food, they will be less healthy,\\" she said, noting that where populations have been measured, numbers of Cuvier's beaked whales are declining. A second study, also off Southern California, estimated that a blue whale spooked by the sonar missed out on over a tonne of krill, about a day's worth of food. \\"Blue whales rely on large aggregations of dense krill to sustain their extreme body size, so they continuously dive and feed throughout the day when high-density prey patches are present,\\" said Jeremy Goldbogen, at Cascadia Research, a non-profit US research organisation in Olympia, Washington. \\"Because of this, we suggest that sonar-induced disruption of feeding could have significant and previously undocumented impacts on individual baleen whale fitness and the health of their populations.\\" A spokesman for the UK's Royal Navy said: \\"The Royal Navy already limits its use of sonar around whales. We are committed to taking all reasonable and practical measures to protect the environment and mitigate effects on marine mammals. This new research will be taken into account in the regular review of MoD active sonar mitigation procedures.\\" • This article was amended on 3 July 2013 to clarify the claims made by the US Navy, which part-funded the new studies. ||||| Duke research scientist Ari Friedlaender plants a suction cup tag on the back of a blue whale off the coast of Southern California. Credit: Ari Friedlaender, Duke Marine Lab (NMFS Permit 14534) Some blue whales off the coast of California change their behavior when exposed to the sort of underwater sounds used during U.S. military exercises. The whales may alter diving behavior or temporarily avoid important feeding areas, according to new research. The Southern California Behavioral Response Study exposed tagged blue whales in the California Bight to simulated mid-frequency (3.5-4 kHz) sonar sounds significantly less intense than the military uses. \\"Whales clearly respond in some conditions by modifying diving behavior and temporarily avoiding areas where sounds were produced,\\" said lead author Jeremy Goldbogen of Cascadia Research. \\"But overall the responses are complex and depend on a number of interacting factors,\\" including whether the whales were feeding deep, shallow or not at all. The study, funded by the U.S. Navy Chief of Naval Operations Environmental Readiness Division and the U.S. Office of Naval Research, appears July 3 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The scientists tagged the whales with non-invasive suction cups, which recorded acoustic data and high-resolution movements as the animals were exposed to the controlled sounds. \\"The tag technology we use offers a unique glimpse into the underwater behavior of whales that otherwise would not be possible,\\" said Ari Friedlaender, a research scientist at the Duke Marine Laboratory. The scientists found that some of the whales engaged in deep feeding stopped eating and either sped up or moved away from the source of the noise. Not all of the whales responded to the noise, and not all in the same way. \\"Blue whales are the largest animals that have ever lived. Populations globally remain at a fraction of their former numbers prior to whaling, and they appear regularly off the southern California coast, where they feed,\\" said John Calambokidis, one of the project's lead investigators of Cascadia Research. That area of the ocean is also the site of military training and testing exercises that involve loud mid-frequency sonar signals. Such sonar exercises have been associated with several unusual strandings of other marine mammal species (typically beaked whales) in the past. Until this study, almost no information was available about whether and how blue whales respond to sonar. \\"These are the first direct measurements of individual responses for any baleen whale species to these kinds of mid-frequency sonar signals,\\" said Brandon Southall, SOCAL-BRS chief scientist from SEA, Inc., and an adjunct researcher at both Duke and the University of California Santa Cruz. \\"These findings help us understand risks to these animals from human sound and inform timely conservation and management decisions.\\" A related paper published July 3 by the same research team in Biology Letters has shown clear and even stronger responses of Cuvier's beaked whales to simulated mid-frequency sonar exposures. Beaked whales showed a variety of responses to both real, military sonar in the distance and nearby simulated sonar. What the beaked whales were doing at the time appeared to be a key factor affecting their reactions.

The screenplay was written by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr., which was inspired by the article \\"Top Guns\\" by Ehud Yonay, published in California Magazine in 1983. \\"Top Gun\\" follows the story of Pete \\"Maverick\\" Mitchell, portrayed by Tom Cruise, a talented and daring United States Navy fighter pilot who is sent to the prestigious Top Gun Naval Fighter Weapons School along with his Radar Intercept Officer (RIO), Nick \\"Goose\\" Bradshaw, played by Anthony Edwards. The film dives into Maverick’s struggle to balance his personal life and ambitions while competing against other skilled pilots in the challenging environment of the elite fighter pilot academy. The other named characters in the film are as follows: 1. Tom \\"Iceman\\" Kazansky: Played by Val Kilmer, he is Maverick's main rival in the film. Iceman is a skilled and disciplined pilot who consistently puts the team's success above personal glory, which often contrasts with Maverick's more reckless approach to flying. 2. Mike \\"Viper\\" Metcalf: Portrayed by Tom Skerritt, Viper is a respected flight instructor at the Top Gun academy and a former fighter pilot. He becomes a mentor to Maverick, providing guidance and crucial life lessons throughout the film. 3. Rick \\"Jester\\" Heatherly: Played by Michael Ironside, Jester is another experienced flight instructor at the Top Gun academy. He is known for his stern, no-nonsense approach to teaching and frequently challenges the pilots to think strategically during training exercises. 4. Bill \\"Cougar\\" Cortell: Portrayed by John Stockwell, Cougar is a fellow pilot and friend of Maverick. After an unnerving encounter with enemy fighter jets, Cougar experiences a crisis of confidence and decides to give up flying, which opens up a spot for Maverick and Goose to join the Top Gun program. \\"Top Gun\\" also features a romantic subplot between Maverick and Charlotte \\"Charlie\\" Blackwood, played by Kelly McGillis, who is an astrophysicist and civilian instructor at the Top Gun academy. The film's adrenaline-fueled aerial sequences, memorable characters, and catchy soundtrack, combined with the strong performances from the cast, turned \\"Top Gun\\" into a major commercial success. It is still regarded as a classic and influential film in popular culture, and a sequel titled \\"Top Gun: Maverick\\" is scheduled for release in 2022."},{"prompt":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

Potato A had spots of mold on it, but potato B seemed fresh and ready to cook. The chef was confused. Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I was doing a weekend seminar at the Deerhurst Lodge, north of Toronto. On Friday night a tornado swept through a town north of us called Barrie, killing dozens of people and doing millions of dollars worth of damage. Sunday night, as I was coming home, I stopped the car when I got to Barrie. I got out on the side of the highway and looked around. It was a mess. Everywhere I looked there were smashed houses and cars turned upside down. That same night Bob Templeton was driving down the same highway. He stopped to look at the disaster just as I had; only his thoughts were different than my own. Bob was the vice-president of Telemedia Communications, which owns a string of radio stations in Ontario and Quebec. He thought there must be something we could do for these people with the radio stations they had. The following night I was doing another seminar in Toronto. Bob Templeton and Bob Johnson, another vice-president from Telemedia, came in and stood in the back of the room. They shared their conviction that there had to be something they could do for the people in Barrie. After the seminar we went back to Bob's office. He was now committed to the idea of helping the people who had been caught in the tornado. The following Friday he called all the executives at Telemedia into his office. At the top of a flip chart he wrote three 3s. He said to his executives, \\"How would you like to raise 3 million dollars 3 days from now in just 3 hours and give the money to the people in Barrie?\\" There was nothing but silence in the room. Finally someone said, \\"Templeton, you're crazy. There is no way we could do that.\\" Bob said, \\"Wait a minute. I didn't ask you if we could or even if we should. I just asked you if you'd like to.\\" They all said, \\"Sure we'd like to.\\" He then drew a large 'T' underneath the 333. On one side he wrote, \\"Why we can't.\\" On the other side he wrote, \\"How we can.\\" \\"I'm going to put a big X on the 'Why we can't' side. We're not going to spend any time on the ideas of why we can't. That's of no value. On the other side we're going to write down every idea that we can come up with on how we can. We're not going to leave the room until we figure it out.\\" There was silence again. Finally, someone said, \\"We could do a radio show across Canada.\\" Bob said, \\"That's a great idea,\\" and wrote it down. Before he had it written, someone said, \\"You can't do a radio show across Canada. We don't have radio stations across Canada.\\" That was a pretty valid objection. They only had stations in Ontario and Quebec. Templeton replied, \\" _ .\\" But this was a real strong objection because radio stations are not very compatible . They usually don't work together. They are very cutthroat. They fight each other. To get them to work together would be virtually impossible according to the standard way of thinking. All of a sudden someone said, \\"We could get Harvey Kirk and Lloyd Robertson, the biggest names in Canadian broadcasting, to anchor the show.\\" (That would be like getting Tom Brokaw and Sam Donaldson to anchor the show. They are anchors on national TV. They are not going to go on radio.) At that point, it was absolutely amazing how fast and furious the creative ideas began to flow. That was on a Friday. The following Tuesday they had a radiothon . They had fifty radio stations all across the country that agreed to broadcast it. It didn't matter who got the credit as long as the people in Barrie got the money. Harvey Kirk and Lloyd Robertson anchored the show and they succeeded in raising three million dollars in three hours within three business days!

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: What are the odds of winning the UK lottery? To answer the first question, we must first understand the format of the UK lottery. The UK National Lottery, in particular, can be played by selecting six numbers from a pool of numbers between 1 and 59. To win the jackpot, a player must match all six numbers on their ticket with the six numbers drawn in the lottery. The odds of winning the jackpot in the UK National Lottery can be calculated using simple combinatorics. To calculate the odds, we can use the formula for \\"n choose r,\\" which is represented as C(n, r), where n is the total number of options to choose from (in this case, the 59 possible lottery numbers) and r is the number of elements chosen (in this case, the 6 numbers on a player's ticket). The formula for C(n, r) is: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!) Where \\"!\\" denotes a factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) Applying this formula to our case, we get: C(59, 6) = 59! / (6!(59-6)!) = 45,057,474 This means there are 45,057,474 possible combinations of six numbers that can be drawn from a pool of 1 to 59. Therefore, the odds of winning the UK National Lottery jackpot are 1 in 45,057,474. --- Second question: What are the odds of winning this form of lottery? Without additional information about the specific form of the lottery in question, we cannot provide a precise answer. Each lottery has its own set of rules and guidelines that determine the odds of winning. Factors affecting the odds include the number of possible combinations, number of winning combinations, the prize structure, and many others. If you can provide the details of the specific lottery game, then a more accurate answer can be given for the odds of winning that particular lottery. --- To address the last part of the question, whether these two questions are asking the same thing: No, they are not asking the same thing. The first question specifically asks about the odds of winning the UK lottery, while the second question is more general, asking about the odds of winning a form of lottery that is not explicitly defined. As a result, the answers to these questions are different. The first question can be answered with precise odds based on the UK National Lottery rules, whereas the second question requires more information about the specific lottery format in question to provide an answer."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Choose from: (A). glue them on with nail glue.. (B). glue them on with super glue.","completion":"In this single/multi-choice problem, you are asked to choose the most appropriate solution among the given options to achieve the goal of effectively putting fake nails on. Let's analytically break down both options in terms of their suitability, convenience, and potential risks before arriving at the best choice. (A). glue them on with nail glue: Nail glue is specifically designed for applying fake nails and other nail enhancements like nail tips and nail wraps. It is typically formulated with cyanoacrylate, a fast-acting bonding agent that offers strong adhesion and is safe to use on natural nails. This option ensures that the fake nails last for a long time, as the glue is created precisely for this purpose. While nail glue can sometimes cause damage to natural nails if not used correctly, it's still a much better option in comparison to a non-nail-specific adhesive such as super glue. Furthermore, nail glue is easily accessible and can be found at most drugstores, cosmetic shops, or online retailers. It is an industry-standard method and recommended by professional nail technicians. Pros: - Specially designed for applying fake nails and nail enhancements. - Strong adhesion ensures fake nails are fixed properly. - Widely used and recommended by professionals. - Can be easily found in stores or online. Cons: - If not used properly, it can damage natural nails. - May require some care and precision when applying. (B). glue them on with super glue: Super glue, also commonly known as cyanoacrylate adhesive, is typically used as a strong, fast-acting bonding agent for joining various materials like plastic, metal, wood, and more. While it is true that super glue's basic ingredient is the same as nail glue, its formulation differs and is not explicitly designed for use on nails. The use of super glue for applying fake nails may lead to numerous potential issues. First, such glue may be too strong, causing potential injuries or difficulty in removal later on. Second, it may also cause chemical burns or allergic reactions on your skin and nails. Third, using super glue may result in weakening and damage of your natural nails. Pros: - It can bond materials quickly and strongly. Cons: - Not designed specifically for use on nails. - Potential for injury or difficulty removing fake nails. - May cause chemical burns or allergic reactions. - Can damage natural nails and weaken nail beds. Based on the given options, the better solution for putting fake nails on would be: (A). glue them on with nail glue. This choice is safer, more appropriate, and recommended by professionals, as nail glue is specifically designed for the purpose of applying fake nails. It takes into consideration the unique needs and requirements of nail-related applications, ensuring better protection and care for your natural nails when compared to using super glue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hotshot ensign Alan Drake, fresh from the flying academy at Pensacola, Florida, gets off to a bad start with the pilots of an elite squadron, nicknamed the \\"Hellcats\\", to which he has been posted in San Diego. Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\". Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed. Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but no further testing is allowed until Commander Gary's return. Banning had been a childhood friend of Lorna Gary, and is not her first friend to die. She sinks into a deep depression. She also knows that Gary will expect her to hide her feelings and carry on, something that is very much not in her nature. Drake, appreciating the help the Garys gave him when he arrived, visits her at her home, and convinces her she should not suffer alone.

While on assignment, a tribe native to the area takes him captive. Bradley starts in Bangkok, taking photos and seeing the sights, until he arrives at a boxing match with a date. His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self-defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene. The next day, John begins his trip deep into the rain forest. He rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter. After rowing a ways and taking several wildlife photos, Bradley's guide, Tuan, mentions his concerns about traveling so far down river, which he reports as being dangerous. John agrees to head back after one more day of traveling. John falls asleep, and when he awakes, he finds Tuan dead with an arrow in his throat.

The water level in Large Lake was high in March, 3 feet higher in April, and 7 feet higher still in May. It dropped to a much lower level in September, October and November, when they released a significant portion of the water as a yearly chore. When was the water level higher, in April or in March? Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the water level in Large Lake was higher in April. In March, the water level was already high due to seasonal variations, such as snow melt and underground springs filling the lake during springtime. Then, in April, the water level rose by an additional 3 feet, making it even higher than it was in March. In May, it increased by an additional 7 feet.

The severity of the illness depends on multiple factors such as the amount of virus entering the body, the efficiency of the virus in infecting cells, and the host's immune response. A less severe infection may give the host's immune system more time to respond and potentially minimize the extent of the illness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Have the best grades that you can by studying in a focused and purposeful manner. Try as hard as you can in school––never think \\"it's just a test.\\" Instead, think \\"This is a test! What if it counts? Even if it doesn't count for much, I want to do the best that I can, for my own sake!\\" Learn to think critically, ask questions and assume nothing. The world is filled with polarized opinions that cause arguments daily, and much of this is wasteful rather than productive because it assumes there are only two sides to any argument, when in actual fact there is often a multitude of opinions, ideas and solutions. Seek them all out, so as to be well informed and fully aware. Learn to spot the difference between serious thinking and blabbermouths. Always find out the facts before reaching conclusions about people, situations and incidents. If your school doesn't cater to critical thinking, look for online courses from reputable universities and colleges that do. Take a course in your own time. Loving who you are and knowing that you're beautiful without having to change your body or yourself will help you to be more confident and self-assured. Say who you are and be what you say! Realize that over time, you may well change considerably and it's called maturing––such personal growth is normal as you continue to learn more about yourself, other people and the world in general. You are always a work in progress, so be prepared to be a lifelong learner. If anyone suggests you are being fake or insincere for changing over time, be careful not to confuse this with the natural changes every person undergoes and someone who is actually fickle enough to constantly change their mind. These are two very different things. Don't change for a boy, or to be friends with the \\"popular girls.\\" Just be yourself. Make them like you for who you are. Not for you trying to act different.

Not everyone has sincere or genuine reasons for suggesting you be a certain way.

Question: When the camera zooms in on the ouiji board, what does it say Movie plot title: Witchboard Movie plot: One night at a party, Brandon Sinclair brings out his ouija board and attempts to contact David, the spirit of a dead ten-year-old boy with whom he has communicated numerous times. The spirit responds, but Brandon's nemesis Jim insults David, making the spirit angry and provoking him to slash the tires of Brandon's car. The next day, Jim's live-in girlfriend Linda sees Brandon's ouija board (which Brandon left behind from the previous night) and tries to contact David. It is revealed that the spirit is actually a ghost of a deceased murderer named Carlos Malfeitor acting under the guise of David. This malicious spirit initially starts being nice and helpful to her, informing Linda where her lost diamond engagement ring is. Meanwhile, at the construction site where Jim is working, his Lloyd is killed from fallen sheetrock by the murderous spirit. After Jim is questioned by Lieutenant Dewhurst at At Lloyd's funeral, she again contacts Malfeitor (still believing to be David) about the accident, and the spirit lies that he did not cause it. Soon, Linda begins to fall under progressive entrapment, in which the spirit changes and starts to terrorize the user, rendering the person weak and easy to possess. Brandon brings over a psychic medium named Sarah \\"Zarabeth\\" Crawford to contact David, and if necessary to exorcise him from the building. The spirit puts up little resistance and leaves, but after leaving, Zarabeth is suspicious and wants to research the occurrence. Not long after getting home, she is attacked and killed by Malfeitor; her throat is slashed before being thrown out of a window and impaled onto a spike. The next morning, Brandon is shocked to hear about Zarabeth's death on the newscast, and immediately suspects the spirit David murdered her. After Brandon leaves for more information, Linda is unconscious by Malfeitor and she is sent to a hospital after Jim contacts an ambulance. During this time, Brandon and Jim conduct research on David, and later initially accuse the spirit of terrorizing Linda.... A:","completion":"When the camera zooms in on the ouija board in the movie Witchboard, it shows the planchette moving over the various letters, spelling out messages that the characters believe are coming from the spirit of a deceased ten-year-old boy named David. However, it is later revealed that the spirit is actually that of a malevolent ghost named Carlos Malfeitor who initially tricks them by pretending to be David. As the camera focuses on the ouija board during various points in the movie, the text spelled out by the planchette changes in accordance to the plot progression and the interactions between the spirit, Linda, Jim, and Brandon. At different times, the camera might show the ouija board spelling out messages that seem innocuous or even helpful, such as when the spirit tells Linda where to find her lost diamond engagement ring. At other points in the film, the messages might be more sinister or foreboding, reflecting the true nature of Carlos Malfeitor and his intent to cause harm and chaos. Throughout the movie, the ouija board serves as a focal point for the characters' interactions with the spirit world, a portal through which they unwittingly unleash a dangerous and malevolent force. Each time the camera zooms in on the board, it provides the audience with a visual cue as to what information or communication is taking place between the characters and the spirit masquerading as David. The specific messages on the ouija board vary throughout the movie, but they consistently create an atmosphere of suspense and reveal how the characters are being manipulated by the spirit of Carlos Malfeitor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The treatment from the doctor didn't involve medication and used therapy instead because the","completion":"patient was suffering from a condition that required a more holistic and comprehensive approach to healing, which was better facilitated through therapeutic modalities rather than pharmacological interventions. In this particular case, the patient was suffering from a psychosomatic illness, meaning that their physical symptoms were a result of mental or emotional factors instead of a specific physiological issue. Traditional medication, although often useful in addressing some physical symptoms, does not necessarily address the psychological components that trigger the manifestation of those symptoms. Thus, the doctor opted to use therapy as an alternative treatment. Therapeutic interventions vary but often encompass psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and forms of stress management. The therapies' goals are to help the patient identify the underlying psychological triggers for their physical symptoms and assist them in managing and coping with those triggers more effectively. By using therapy as a primary form of treatment, the doctor can foster a deep, transformative healing process in the patient, addressing not only the symptoms but also the root causes of their psychosomatic condition. This, in turn, can lead to a more sustainable and long-lasting improvement in the patient's overall well-being. In addition to the more traditional forms of therapy, the doctor might also recommend complementary treatments to support the individual's healing process. These treatments may include physical therapies, such as yoga, massage, or chiropractic care, as well as various alternative and integrative healing modalities such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, or nutritional counseling. By employing these complementary therapies, the doctor hopes to create a multidimensional and integrative treatment plan that addresses the patient's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health needs. Furthermore, the doctor's decision to forgo medication and focus on therapy could be due to various reasons, including potential medication side effects, drug interactions, or patient history of substance abuse. In some individuals, medication might not be appropriate or might exacerbate existing conditions. By utilizing a therapeutic approach, the doctor can offer a safe and effective alternative tailored to the individual's specific requirements. Overall, the doctor's choice to utilize therapy instead of medication in this instance demonstrates their commitment to addressing the patient's unique needs and offering a comprehensive, holistic approach to healing. By prioritizing the individual's mental and emotional well-being, the doctor hopes to foster long-lasting and meaningful change, ultimately aiding the patient in attaining a greater sense of balance, well-being, and overall quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bork scratched his head,\\" does not directly entail the hypothesis \\"The sky was broken to pieces.\\" The premise primarily refers to two concepts: the mystery of magic working and the unexplained state of the sky. It seems that an understanding of how magic operates in this specific context has been somewhat clarified. However, this understanding does not provide an explanation for the mysterious condition of the sky. Analyzing the hypothesis, \\"The sky was broken to pieces,\\" implies that some catastrophic event or series of events shattered the sky, causing fragmentation and disarray. The hypothesis could be a metaphorical interpretation of the state of the sky or a literal, physical scenario that has occurred. Nonetheless, it suggests a dramatic change in the sky's appearance or structure. Although the premise indirectly raises questions about the sky's condition, it does not confirm nor refute the hypothesis. The understanding of magic working in this context could be related to the hypothesis, but the connection is not explicitly established in the premise. It is plausible that the unexplained state of the sky might have a relationship with the magic working in this situation. However, there is no definitive evidence in the premise to support or negate the idea that the sky was broken into pieces. Thus, based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that it entails the hypothesis \\"The sky was broken to pieces.\\" There may be some correlation between the two, but a more detailed investigation or additional context would be needed to determine whether there is a direct relationship between the unexplained sky and its potential fragmentation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the first names of the people who purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads? Despite being one of the most significant anti-war works of art, The Disasters of War had no impact on the European consciousness for two generations, as it was not seen outside a small circle in Spain until it was published by Madrid's Royal Academy of San Fernando in 1863. Since then, interpretations in successive eras have reflected the sensibilities of the time. Goya was seen as a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.The series' impact on Dalí is evident in Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War), painted in 1936 in response to events leading to the Spanish Civil War. Here, the distorted limbs, brutal suppression, agonised expressions and ominous clouds are reminiscent of plate 39, Grande hazaña! Con muertos! (A heroic feat! With dead men!), in which mutilated bodies are shown against a backdrop barren landscape.In 1993, Jake and Dinos Chapman of the Young British Artists movement created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on The Disasters of War. The works were widely acclaimed and purchased that year by the Tate gallery. For decades, Goya's series of etching served as a constant point of reference for the Chapman brothers; in particular, they created a number of variations based on the plate Grande hazaña! Con muertos!. In 2003, the Chapman brothers exhibited an altered version of The Disasters of War. They purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads. The Chapmans described their \\"rectified\\" images as making a connection between Napoleon's supposed introduction of Enlightenment ideals to early-19th-century Spain and Tony Blair and George W. Bush...","completion":"The first names of the people who purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads, are Jake and Dinos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: \\"Which brings us back to where we Human nature--or, at least, human nature as it has evolved in our American times.\\" This sentence discusses the topic of human nature and specifies its context as \\"human nature as it has evolved in our American times.\\" While the wording might be unusual, we can understand that the sentence is referring to the evolution of human nature within the particular socio-cultural context of America. Sentence 2: \\"Human nature has evolved in our American times.\\" Here, the sentence is simply saying that human nature has evolved during the period referred to as \\"our American times.\\" This sentence conveys the idea that human nature has adapted or changed over the course of American history. Now, by comparing the two sentences, we can observe that both of them are discussing the evolution of human nature in the context of American history. If Sentence 1 is true, it implies that human nature has been evolving within the American sociocultural landscape. This evolution is further elaborated upon in Sentence 2, which provides a simpler and more direct statement about the same idea.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: Adam Carolla’s career changed for the better when he left behind morning radio to join Dr. Drew Pinsky on “Loveline” in 1995. That relationship lasted for 10 years, as Carolla and Dr. Drew dispensed advice on the radio — and eventually on MTV — to the confused and unlucky. After Carolla left the show in 2005, he built his own cottage industry, including books, his Mangria wine label, and a new movie, “Road Hard,” that he recently crowd-funded. At the center of Carolla’s enterprise is Carolla Digital, a podcast network that includes shows hosted by Larry Miller and Penn Jillette, in addition to four that Carolla does himself. One of those is “The Adam & Dr. Drew Show,” which reunites Carolla with his old “Loveline” partner. Carolla and Dr. Drew bring their tour to the Wilbur Theatre Saturday, sandwiched by weekend appearances in New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Q. What can people expect in terms of the format of the reunion show? A. It’ll be some philosophy and some jokes and some discussion and some debate. At some point, we’ll turn it over to the audience and do some Q&A. Q. How is the show different now from when you two started? A. I’m a father now and have some gray on my temples and probably am a little more mature than I was back in the day. But philosophically, not wildly different. We’re not playing colleges anymore, so it’s a little less raucous. But it’s more sort of thoughtful than it was, probably, back in the day, and the questions have matured as the audience has matured. Q. What do each of you bring to the partnership? A. I bring guts, glory, humor. Patriotism. Humanity. Philanthropic propulsion. And Drew’s basically a glorified mike stand, to be honest with you. I yell at him after the shows all the time. I can’t believe we’re splitting this money 50/50 when I do 82 percent of the talking out there. What a deal. You know, he’s obviously the physician, and I’m a carpenter. So we come from completely different backgrounds. But he’s a great listener, and he’s very interested in the human condition. I mean, physiologically, emotionally, spiritually. And I am too, except for I just find the comedy in that. Q. What made you take it on the road? A. This business, I think a lot of people, they BS a lot. They say, “What made you decide to write this book?” “Well, I felt there was a void out there.” No. Somebody paid me. So it’s not like there’s a void and Drew and I need to fill that void, and this audience needs to hear what we have to say. It’s more like, “Hey, you know Drew?” “Yeah.” “You like Drew?” “Yeah.” “You like standing onstage with Drew and making jokes and having fun?” “Yeah.” “How ’bout we line up three shows in the Boston area?” “Yeah, all right.” That’s basically how it goes. And that’s how it goes for everybody. Except I don’t think they admit that. That being said, no book, no live show, no standup — I never phone them in. I’m there sweating through my shirt. I never want somebody to read my book or leave one of my live shows and go, “Well, that was a waste of time.” And that’s kind of what I’ve built my audience on. Q. How many podcasts are you currently participating in, and how do you keep them all going? A. I do five a week of “The Adam Carolla Show.” So five of mine, then I do two or three with Dr. Drew. And then I do one “Carcast,” and one “Ace On the House” — one car show and one home improvement show. So I guess the answer would be nine or 10 a week. And then other people’s podcasts. Q. Do you ever get hoarse doing these? A. I should get tired and I should run out of things to say, but I don’t. I’ve never looked at talking as work. Writing is work. Q. The books, the podcast, the live shows, and now the wine business — is there one thing you consider the flagpole of the operation? A. The podcasts are kind of the main thing. And I’m doing a crowd-fund thing for my next independent film. If you’re a Bryan Cranston fan or a “Breaking Bad” fan you can check out a couple of funny videos I did with him on that. Q. I was going to ask if he was going to be in the movie or not. A. Everybody’s asking me that, and the answer is I really don’t know. Might be able to get him to do a cameo. Q. What is the theme of the film? A. It’s called “Road Hard,” and it’s just about comedians that had a lot of success, were out on the road, moved to Hollywood, got a lot of deals, sitcom deals, film vehicles and all that. And now they’re older, divorced, a little fatter, balder, all the deals have dried up, and they’re forced to go back on the road and play those clubs they left so many years ago. Q. You also launched your “Week in Rage” blog a few months ago. Is there enough that you’re angry about to fill that every week? A. There’s usually enough complaining to go around in a seven-day week for me.

Write a summary based on this article: More than forty years after the first initiatives were taken to ban the use of PCBs, the chemical pollutants remain a deadly threat to animals at the top of the food chain. A new study, just published in the journal Science, shows that the current concentrations of PCBs can lead to the disappearance of half of the world's populations of killer whales from the most heavily contaminated areas within a period of just 30-50 years. Killer whales (Orcinus orca) form the last link in a long food chain and are among the mammals with the highest level of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) in their tissue. Researchers have measured values as high as 1300 milligrams per kilo in the fatty tissue (blubber) of killer whales. For comparison, a large number of studies show that animals with PCB levels as low as 50 milligrams per kilo of tissue may show signs of infertility and severe impacts on the immune system. Together with colleagues from a wide range of international universities and research institutions, researchers from Aarhus University have documented that the number of killer whales is rapidly declining in 10 out of the 19 killer whale populations investigated and that the species may disappear entirely from several areas within a few decades. Killer whales are particularly threatened in heavily contaminated areas like the waters near Brazil, the Strait of Gibraltar and around the UK. Around the British Isles, the researchers estimate that the remaining population counts less than 10 killer whales. Also along the east coast of Greenland, killer whales are effected due to the high consumption of sea mammals like seals. PCBs accumulate in the food chain The killer whale is one of the most widespread mammals on Earth and is found in all of the world's oceans from pole to pole. But today, only the populations living in the least polluted areas possess a large number of individuals. Overfishing and man-made noise may also affect the health of the animals, but PCBs particularly can have a dramatic effect on the reproduction and immune system of the killer whales. Killer whales whose diet includes, among other items, seals and large fish such as tuna and sharks critical accumulate PCBs and other pollutants stored at successive levels of the food chain. It is these populations of killer whales that have the highest PCB concentrations and it is these populations that are at the highest risk of population collapse. Killer whales that primarily feed on small-sized fish such as herring and mackerel have a significantly lower content of PCBs and are thus at lower risk of effects. PCBs have been used around the world since the 1930s. More than one million tonnes of PCBs were produced and used in, among other things, electrical components and plastics. Together with DDT and other organic pesticides -- PCBs have spread around the global oceans. Through the 1970s and 1980s, PCBs were banned in several countries and in 2004, through the Stockholm Convention, more than 90 countries have committed themselves to phase out and dispose of the large stocks of PCBs. PCBs are only slowly decomposed in the environment. Moreover, PCBs are passed down from the mother orca to its offspring through the mother's fat-rich milk. This means that the hazardous substances remain in the bodies of the animals, instead of being released into the environment where they eventually deposit or degrade. Global investigation of killer whales \\"We know that PCBs deform the reproductive organs of animals such as polar bears. It was therefore only natural to examine the impact of PCBs on the scarce populations of killer whales around the world,\\" says Professor Rune Dietz from the Department of Bioscience and Arctic Research Centre, Aarhus University, who initiated the killer whale studies and is co-author of the article. The research group, which includes participants from the United States, Canada, England, Greenland, Iceland and Denmark, reviewed all the existing literature and compared all data with their own most recent results. This provided information about PCB levels in more than 350 individual killer whales around the globe -- the largest number of killer whales ever studied. Applying models, the researchers then predicted the effects of PCBs on the number of offspring as well as on the immune system and mortality of the killer whale over a period of 100 years. More than 50% of the populations under threat \\"The findings are surprising. We see that over half of the studied killer whales populations around the globe are severely affected by PCBs\\" says postdoc Jean-Pierre Desforges from Aarhus University, who led the investigations. The effects result in fewer and fewer animals over time in these populations. The situation is worst in the oceans around Brazil, the Strait of Gibraltar, the northeast Pacific and around the UK. Here, the models show that the populations have virtually been halved during the half century where PCBs have been present. \\"In these areas, we rarely observe newborn killer whales,\\" says Ailsa Hall, who together with Bernie McConnell developed the models used by Sea Mammal Research Unit in Scotland. \\"As the effects have been recognized for more than 50 years, it is frightening to see that the models predict a high risk of population collapse in these areas within a period of 30-40 years,\\" says Jean-Pierre Desforges. A female killer whale may live for 60-70 years, and although the world took its first steps to phase out PCBs more than 40 years ago, killer whales still have high levels of PCBs in their bodies. \\"This suggests that the efforts have not been effective enough to avoid the accumulation of PCBs in high trophic level species that live as long as the killer whale does. There is therefore an urgent need for further initiatives than those under the Stockholm Convention,\\" concludes Paul D. Jepson, Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, England, who is another killer whale expert and co-author of the article. In the oceans around the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Alaska and the Antarctic, the prospects are not so gloomy. Here, killer whale populations grow and the models predict that they will continue to do so throughout the next century. ||||| Thank you for your interest in spreading the word about Science.

Although the poisonous chemicals, PCBs, have been banned for decades, they are still leaking into the seas. They become concentrated up the food chain; as a result, killer whales, the top predators, are the most contaminated animals on the planet. Worse, their fat-rich milk passes on very high doses to their newborn calves. PCB concentrations found in killer whales can be 100 times safe levels and severely damage reproductive organs, cause cancer and damage the immune system. The new research analysed the prospects for killer whale populations over the next century and found those offshore from industrialised nations could vanish as soon as 30-50 years. Among those most at risk are the UK’s last pod, where a recent death revealed one of the highest PCB levels ever recorded. Others off Gibraltar, Japan and Brazil and in the north-east Pacific are also in great danger. Killer whales are one of the most widespread mammals on earth but have already been lost in the North Sea, around Spain and many other places. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Killer whales hunting seals off the coast of northern Norway. Photograph: Audun Rikardsen/Science “It is like a killer whale apocalypse,” said Paul Jepson at the Zoological Society of London, part of the international research team behind the new study. “Even in a pristine condition they are very slow to reproduce.” Healthy killer whales take 20 years to reach peak sexual maturity and 18 months to gestate a calf. PCBs were used around the world since the 1930s in electrical components, plastics and paints but their toxicity has been known for 50 years. They were banned by nations in the 1970s and 1980s but 80% of the 1m tonnes produced have yet to be destroyed and are still leaking into the seas from landfills and other sources. The international Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants came into force in 2004 to tackle the issue, but Jepson said the clean-up is way behind schedule. “I think the Stockholm Convention is failing,” he said. “The only area where I am optimistic is the US. They alone produced 50% of all PCBs, but they have been getting PCB levels down consistently for decades. All we have done in Europe is ban them and then hope they go away.” The researchers said PCBs are just one pollutant found in killer whales, with “a long list of additional known and as yet unmeasured contaminants present”. Further problems for killer whales include the loss of key prey species such as tuna and sharks to overfishing and also growing underwater noise pollution. The new research, published in the journal Science, examined PCB contamination in 351 killer whales, the largest analysis yet. The scientists then took existing data on how PCBs affect calf survival and immune systems in whales and used this to model how populations will fare in the future. “Populations of Japan, Brazil, Northeast Pacific, Strait of Gibraltar, and the United Kingdom are all tending toward complete collapse,” they concluded.

Photograph: Audun Rikardsen/Science Lucy Babey, deputy director at conservation group Orca, said: “Our abysmal failures to control chemical pollution ending up in our oceans has caused a killer whale catastrophe on an epic scale. It is essential that requirements to dispose safely of PCBs under the Stockholm Convention are made legally binding at the next meeting in May 2019 to help stop this scandal.” Scientists have previously found “extraordinary” levels of toxic pollution even in the 10km-deep Mariana trench in the Pacific Ocean. Mariana trench live feed: engrossing viewing from deepest place on Earth Read more “This new study is a global red alert on the state of our oceans,” said Jennifer Lonsdale, chair of the Wildlife and Countryside Link’s whales group. “If the UK government wants its [proposed] Environment Act to be world-leading, it must set ambitious targets on PCB disposal and protect against further chemical pollution of our waters.” The research shows that killer whale populations in the high north, off Norway, Iceland, Canada and the Faroes, are far less contaminated due to their distance from major PCB sources. ”The only thing that gives me hope about killer whales in the longer term is, yes, we are going to lose populations all over the industrialised areas, but there are populations that are doing reasonably well in the Arctic,” said Jepson. If a global clean-up, which would take decades, can be achieved, these populations could eventually repopulate empty regions, he said, noting that killer whales are very intelligent, have strong family bonds and hunt in packs. “It is an incredibly adaptive species – they have been able to [live] from the Arctic to the Antarctic and everywhere in between.” He praised the billion-dollar “superfund” clean-ups in the US, such as in the Hudson River and Puget Sound, where the polluter has paid most of the costs: “The US is going way beyond the Stockholm Convention because they know how toxic PCBs are.” ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pollution threatens future of killer whales Killer whales are in deep trouble because of persistent chemical pollution in the environment, researchers say. A new study suggests the long-term viability of more than half of the different orca groups around the globe is now in question. Some populations, such as those around the UK, the Strait of Gibraltar, off Brazil, Japan and California, are almost certainly doomed. The assessment is in Science magazine. The issue is polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. These chemical compounds were once manufactured in vast quantities, and used in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment and sealants. But they are highly toxic and although banned decades ago have amassed in the environment, leaching into the ocean. Killer whales, or orcas, are top predators so they absorb all the PCB pollution taken in by the different prey in their food chain - from fish, right up to seals and sharks. The PCBs stunt the ovaries of female orcas, limiting their ability to produce calves. The chemicals also suppress the immune system. What is the outlook for orcas? The new study models the future of the killer whales' reproductive success and survivability against the chemical challenge. For those populations living in clean waters, it is positive. Orcas in places like the Antarctic and the Arctic should increase their numbers. But for those living in the most polluted seas, the next 30-50 years will be grim. The killer whales that live on the west coast of Scotland, for example, are now down to just eight individuals and they have not produced a calf in more than 20 years. Paul Jepson, from the Zoological Society of London, says this group will \\"disappear in my lifetime\\". \\"Over 50% of the populations that we've got data for will actually collapse in our model,\\" he told the BBC's Science In Action programme. \\"PCBs are such highly toxic chemicals, and they persist in the environment. And it's the killer whales that have by a long way the highest exposures now of any species on Earth; certainly any mammalian species.\\" Image copyright John Bowler/RSPB Scotland Image caption The Scottish orcas have been found to be heavily contaminated The curse of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs Image copyright Getty Images Polychlorinated biphenyls were manufactured from the 1920s Banned in the US in 1979, the UK in 1981 and the rest of the EU Europe produced some 300,000 tonnes from 1954 to 1984 The majority has yet to be destroyed or safely stored away PCBs were popular in coolant fluids in electrical apparatus They were used in building construction, especially in sealants Also in cutting fluids for machining, and carbonless copy paper Today, only North Korea still manufactures polychlorinated biphenyls Why are the animals so exposed? Everything in this story works against the killer whales. Not only do they accumulate contaminants because of their position as top predators, but the toxic effects hit them where they are particularly vulnerable - in their ability to reproduce. These are animals that take a long time to reach sexual maturity and even then have perhaps one calf every few years. This puts very precise pressure on a population. In addition, PCBs are soluble in fat - and killer whales are extremely fat-rich animals. A mother's milk will be loaded with PCBs which she will pass on to her offspring during lactation. Image copyright Audun Rikardsen How do we tackle the PCB legacy? Most PCBs have yet to be destroyed or safely stored away. Some countries have done better than others. In the US, where federal \\"superfunds\\" have been used to clean up the most heavily contaminated sites, PCB levels entering the ocean have come down. But there needs to be much more urgency in places such as Europe. \\"Improper disposal of PCB-containing equipment in landfills may lead to leakage and leaching of PCBs into nearby streams, river, estuaries, and ocean,\\" said lead author on the new report, Jean-Pierre Desforges from Aarhus University, Denmark. \\"We know that PCBs were used in paints and sealants in old buildings and for outer coating on ships, so if contaminated building materials are improperly disposed of they could also reach the environment, and demolition of buildings may cause PCBs to enter the air.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paul Jepson: \\"The killer whale is the most PCB-contaminated species on Earth\\" Can we help the orcas themselves? There is very little that can be done to recover the PCBs once they have reached the ocean. And the robustness of the chemicals means they will hang around in the environment for a very long time. But there are parallel problems we could conceivably fix, said co-author Ailsa Hall from the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St Andrews University, UK. \\"We should recognise that this is just one of many stresses on the animals,\\" she told BBC News. \\"There are things such as noise, changes in habitat, changes in the availability of prey - that we do have influence over. And if we do something about these factors, maybe we can reduce the overall burden of stress, and perhaps then our predictions won't be so dire.\\" Paul Jepson added: \\"I don't think there'll ever be another PCB story. \\"I think the chemical industries have learnt the lesson - we know that being fat-soluble is a big risk factor, because that allows things to bioaccumulate. \\"So, nowadays, no chemical with those properties would be allowed. But PCBs are so difficult to get rid of that we'll be dealing with the legacy for a long time.\\" Follow on Twitter: @BBCAmos and @Vic_Gill ||||| Most people thought the problem of polychlorinated biphenyls — known as PCBs — had been solved. Some countries began banning the toxic chemicals in the 1970s and 1980s, and worldwide production was ended with the 2001 Stockholm Convention. But a new study based on modeling shows that they’re lingering in the blubber of killer whales — and they may end up wiping out half the world’s population of killer whales in coming decades. “It certainly is alarming,” said Jean-Pierre Desforges, a post-doctoral researcher at Aarhus University in Denmark and the lead author on the new study published Thursday in the journal Science. Whales sit at the top of their food chain. Chemicals like PCBs are taken up by plankton at the base of the food chain, then eaten by herring and other small fish, which are themselves eaten by larger fish, and so on. At each step in this chain, PCBs get more and more concentrated. The most at-risk killer whales are those that eat seals and other animals that are themselves fairly high on the food chain and quite contaminated, Dr. Desforges said. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Despite being banned several decades ago, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) still threaten the survival of over half of the world's killer whale populations, researchers warn. A new study, published in the journal Science, found that highly toxic PCBs concentrate in killer whales, causing damage to their immune systems and reproductive organs, while also being passed on to offspring through milk. Among the populations most at risk are the UK's last pod of killer whales, some off Gibraltar, Japan and Brazil and in the northeast Pacific.

Movie title: Def by Temptation Context: The story is set in New York and revolves around the relationship between two childhood best friends: \\"Joel\\", who is raised by his religious grandmother after both of his parents are killed in an automobile accident, and \\"K\\" who abandons religion, moves to New York and becomes a movie star. Joel (now a minister like his deceased father), becomes somewhat disillusioned with Christianity and decides to take a trip to New York to visit his friend, K. While awaiting Joel's arrival, K (played by Kadeem Hardison) visits the local bar and meets the perfect woman (played by Cynthia Bond)--who in reality is a succubus seeking blood, and vengeance against any and all men foolish enough to be tempted by her. The audience is first given a taste of the demon's powers when shortly before meeting K, she seduces and then kills an employee of the local bar she uses as her hunting ground. Later, during sexual intercourse with a patron of the bar (a closeted homosexual), she transforms into a beast and kills him, horribly. During another seduction (and after having met K) she infects a married man with an incurable, flesh-eating disease before sending him home to his wife who promptly shoots him. Later, when K attempts to introduce her to Joel (played by James Bond III) he is astonished when she pretends to have never met him and spends the entire evening with Joel. It is then that K meets fellow bar patron \\"Dougy\\" an unsuccessful pickup artist (played by Bill Nunn). The next day when she calls on Joel at K's apartment, K decides to confront her and notices that she casts no reflection in the mirror. A frightened K stands passively by as she and Joel leave on a date. K heads to the bar hoping to find Dougy. After confiding in Dougy the day's events. Dougy reveals himself to be an undercover agent belonging to a special task force investigating a string of strange occurrences, disappearances and murders centered around the bar. Dougy and K pay a visit to a medium--Madame Sonia (played by Melba Moore), who goes into a trance and...","completion":"...reveals the succubus' true nature, her intentions, and the danger she poses to Joel and other men who fall victim to her temptations. The medium warns K and Dougy that they must act quickly, as the succubus grows more powerful with each victim she claims. K, feeling guilty for initially succumbing to the succubus' charms and endangering Joel, becomes determined to end the demon's reign of terror. K and Dougy embark on a mission to gather knowledge about succubi and ways to defeat them. They consult ancient texts, consult with religious scholars, and delve deep into the occult to uncover the key to vanquishing the succubus. Meanwhile, Joel, unaware of the danger he is in, starts falling for the succubus' allure. As their relationship deepens, Joel's faith in Christianity starts to waver. He questions the nature of good and evil and wonders whether the strict moral code of his faith is compatible with his desires. Over time, K and Dougy discover that to defeat the succubus, they must rely on their respective strengths: K's deep-rooted faith in Christianity that he had abandoned, and Dougy's knowledge and experience in dealing with supernatural threats. Armed with newfound wisdom and determination, they form a plan to confront the demonic entity and save Joel from imminent doom. Before they can execute their plan, the succubus senses that something is amiss and attempts to hasten her plans for Joel. She tries to completely sever his ties to Christianity, pushing him to the brink of abandoning his faith entirely. Joel, although conflicted, begins to realize that something sinister is going on and decides to confront the succubus himself. A climactic battle ensues between the succubus, Joel, K, and Dougy. Joel, now aware of the demon's intention, is forced to make a choice between surrendering to temptation or embracing the power of his faith. K, on the other hand, must come to terms with his abandonment of religion and rediscover the strength it once provided him. Ultimately, through an intense struggle, the power of friendship, faith, and redemption prevail. Joel and K manage to overcome the succubus by combining their strengths. The succubus, weakened and unable to sustain her hold over her victims, is banished back to the underworld from which she emerged. The damage she caused is undone, and Joel's faith in Christianity is restored. The movie \\"Def by Temptation\\" highlights the importance of faith, friendship, and self-discovery. It serves as a reminder that even when faced with unimaginable evil, one can find the strength needed to prevail, both in themselves and in the support of those around them. In the context of the movie, K is the one who abandons religion, which leads to the events that unfold throughout the story. This abandonment of faith puts both him and his friend, Joel, at risk from the succubus' sinister intentions. Through struggle, danger, and self-reflection, K eventually finds his way back to religion, which plays a pivotal role in defeating the supernatural threat facing them."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a passage, and you need to write an **implausible** answer to to fill in the place of \\"_\\".

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well.

Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The event you are referring to is the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which was a policy of the United States government in the 19th century whereby Native Americans were forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands in the eastern United States to lands west of the Mississippi River, thereafter known as Indian Territory. The Okchai tribe, which was a part of the Muscogee (Creek) Confederacy in Alabama, was one of the many tribes impacted by this policy. The Muscogee, also known as the Creek Indians, were a large group of tribes that lived primarily in the southeastern United States, encompassing areas that are now present-day Georgia, Alabama, Florida, and South Carolina. The Creek Confederacy was an alliance of Muscogee tribes that banded together for mutual protection and to maintain political and social organization. The Indian Removal Act was pursued under the administration of President Andrew Jackson, who advocated for the removal of Native American tribes from the southeastern United States in an effort to open up new lands for white settlers. The Act aimed at facilitating the relocation of Native Americans from their ancestral territories to lands in the western parts of the country, west of the Mississippi River. The implementation of the Indian Removal Act resulted in several tragic events known today as the Trail of Tears. From 1831 to 1838, thousands of Native Americans from various tribes, including the Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, and Seminole, were forcibly relocated from their ancestral lands. It is estimated that approximately 100,000 Native Americans were removed during this period, resulting in the deaths of thousands due to disease, starvation, exposure, and exhaustion during the forced marches to their new lands, which were often unsuitable for their traditional ways of life. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation, including the Okchai tribe, was one of the tribes most severely impacted by the Indian Removal Act. In 1832, the Treaty of Cusseta was signed between the United States government and the Creek tribe, which ceded all of the Creek lands in Alabama to the United States in exchange for individual allotments of land in the newly established Indian Territory, now known as Oklahoma. The removal of the Creek tribe, including the Okchai, began in 1836 and continued until 1837. During this time, the tribes were subjected to harsh conditions and forced to march hundreds of miles across treacherous terrain without adequate provisions, ultimately leading to the suffering and death of a significant number of tribal members. The forcible removal of the Okchai and other Muscogee tribes from their ancestral homelands marked a dark and painful chapter in American history, with the lasting effects of the Indian Removal Act still being felt by Native American communities today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hakea preissii, commonly known as the Needle tree, Needle bush and Christmas hakea, is a shrub or tree of the genus \\"Hakea\\" native to an area in the Pilbara, Wheatbelt, Mid West and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia. The Noongar name for the plant is Tanjinn. Can we draw the following conclusion? The needle tree (Hakea preissii) known also as Tanjinn, is common to Pilbara.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the Needle tree (Hakea preissii), which is also known as Tanjinn, is common to the Pilbara region of Western Australia, among others. The plant's natural distribution encompasses several regions, including but not limited to the Pilbara, Wheatbelt, Mid West, and Goldfields-Esperance areas. Hakea preissii, or the Needle tree, belongs to the Proteaceae family and is native to Western Australia. It usually grows as a shrub or a small tree, presenting a unique and characteristic appearance due its stiff, needle-like leaves. These leaves, which can measure up to 15 centimeters in length and about 1 millimeter in width, have axillary inflorescences, meaning the flowers arise at the intersection between the leaves and stems. The distinct flowers of the Needle tree are white or cream in color and are generally clustered in spherical inflorescences. This attractive floral display occurs between May and September, thus making the plant a particularly appealing addition to native gardens within its natural range. The beautiful flower display is followed by the production of woody seed capsules that measure between 2.5 and 3.5 centimeters long. In addition to being admired for its visual appeal, Hakea preissii possesses ecological significance, as it provides a vital food source for native bird species such as honeyeaters. Specifically, the flowers' nectar offers sustenance that attracts these birds and helps to facilitate pollination. Furthermore, the Needle tree has cultural importance, as evidenced by its Noongar name, Tanjinn. The Noongar people are Indigenous Australian inhabitants of the southwest corner of Western Australia, and the local name signifies the plant's presence in their cultural history and traditional knowledge. In conclusion, the Needle tree (Hakea preissii), also known as Tanjinn, is indeed common to the Pilbara region of Western Australia, along with the Wheatbelt, Mid West, and Goldfields-Esperance regions. Its unique appearance, ecological role, and cultural significance make it an essential component of the area's biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Process: - Plants and animals long ago died - They are buried under layers of soil - Pressure builds over time - The remains liquefy - The carbon atoms rearrange to become a new substance. Question: suppose more pressure builds over time happens, how will it affect MORE oil. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"A: more When more pressure builds over time, it can lead to the formation of more oil. This is because the increased pressure and heat cause the organic matter within the buried plants and animals to undergo a series of chemical reactions. As a result, these reactions break down the complex organic molecules into simpler hydrocarbon compounds, which then form crude oil and natural gas. Under optimal conditions of pressure and temperature, more crude oil can be generated, as the pressure continues to transform the organic material into oil. However, it's important to note that the process is not infinite, as it will eventually reach a point where the organic material is fully transformed, and no new hydrocarbon deposits can be generated. In conclusion, more pressure building up over time can lead to more oil being produced, as long as there is still organic material to be transformed.

The first sentence uses \\"the government\\" as its subject, while the second one simplifies it to \\"government.\\" This alteration preserves the primary message, indicating that the subject still revolves around the executive branch of government. 2. The use of the definite article \\"the\\" is also slightly different in the two sentences. In the first sentence, \\"the\\" is added before \\"deputy prime ministers.\\" However, it is omitted in the second sentence.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.

Please answer the following question: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. What did the engineer think about Fergus? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - She liked him - not enough information - She hated him - He's a rule breaker Answer:","completion":"She liked him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. TV - FOR BARYSHNIKOV, IT'S A HOLLYWOOD NIGHT - NYTimes.com MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV has used television well in his ascent to superstardom. He has recorded a few ballet programs for public television. He did ''The Nutcracker'' for CBS-TV. His ''Baryshnikov on Broadway'' special deservedly won a slew of awards. And now, in the same showcase vein, he is starring at 10 o'clock tonight on CBS in ''Baryshnikov in Hollywood.'' ''Baryshnikov on Broadway'' it isn't. The first special combined low-key charm with New York sophistication as it reviewed great stage musicals, from ''Oklahoma!'' to ''A Chorus Line.'' The new production, produced and directed by Don Mischer, focuses on the nutty superficiality of Hollywood. Mr. Baryshnikov and company - including Dom DeLuise, Shirley MacLaine, Bernadette Peters, Charles Nelson Reilly, Gene Wilder and, as the unseen narrator, Orson Welles - are limited largely to tongue-in-cheek romping, all of which is executed marvelously but finally tends to become a wee bit monotonous. The dance star is seen closing a season in New York and preparing for a Caribbean vacation. Enter the maniacal Mr. DeLuise as a producer determined to lure Mr. Baryshnikov to Silver Screen fame. ''Dancers always have trouble with their feet,'' the producer observes, ''actors hardly even have corns.'' In Hollywood, Mr. Baryshnikov is sent to a dialogue coach for his accent, but spends most of his performing time in nonspeaking roles, going from ''The Sheik'' and ''The Pirate'' to a casual but energetic history of old musicals. Dedicated with love and affection to James Cagney, the show is nearly always pleasant and, with choreography by Michael Kidd and Peter Anastos, never less than ebullient. That is one of the problems. When Mr. Baryshnikov takes time out for a quiet moment, recalling in acting class an incident from his childhood, it turns out to be the highlight of the hour. For the much of the rest of the time, he smiles impishly, is charmingly boyish and dances superbly. Doubtless, he will yet become America's sweetheart. With the season's audience-popularity ratings race just about settled - CBS on top, NBC on the bottom -and with another sweeps period, crucial to local stations and their advertising rates, about a week away, the schedule is heavy these days with documentaries, always the least likely candidates to attract massive audiences. One that sticks out from the others, however, is ''People Like Us,'' on CBS tonight at 8 o'clock. There is one overriding reason - the presence of Bill D. Moyers who, virtually alone among network correspondents, is allowed to bring a personal vision and voice to his reports. This time around, Mr. Moyers looks at the country's truly needy, the people who President Reagan said would not be hurt by cutbacks in Federal spending. The correspondent does not bombard the viewer with statistics, charts and man-in-the-street interviews. He simply interviews four very different people: a victim of cerebral palsy cut off the Social Security disability rolls, the mother of three children forced to give up a low-paying job and go back on welfare, a mother reluctantly sending her paralyzed daughter to a hospital because of changes in the Government rules for home health care and a priest overseeing free meals at his church, where the number of hungry guests has doubled in the last year. Mr. Moyers does what he does best - talking directly to the people. He sits with distraught families, he strolls with a gently optimistic youth, he probes the feelings of those forced to take charity. The camerawork of Tom Spain and Rick Thompson captures fleeting expressions that tell more than volumes of statistics. Mr. Moyers is fair to all sides, but he refuses to come down in the middle of the nowhere sometimes called ''balance.'' In his concluding remarks, he says: ''There's no question but that Federal programs which help the poor are riddled with waste and fraud. So are programs that help the middle class. So are subsidies to corporations. So are the billions being spent on the military-industrial complex. But the President and the Congress have chosen not to offend the rich, the powerful and the organized. It is easier to take on the poor. They have been asked to sacrifice because the economy is in trouble and because some people are cheating the system. But for all the fraud and waste, for all their inefficiencies, these programs are a life-support system for the poor. For many, we are pulling the program.'' In the too often anonymous world of television, Mr. Moyers has managed to develop and, more significantly, retain a distinctive presence.

What is the correct answer to this question?","completion":"The finger got burned due to a combination of factors involving the properties of metal and the process of heat transfer. To understand this phenomenon, we need to look into the characteristics of metals and the ways in which heat moves from one object to another. Metals, such as the one the spoon is made of, are good conductors of heat. This means that they allow heat to flow through them easily and quickly. This property is mainly due to the molecular structure of metals: they possess a lattice of positive ions surrounded by a \\"sea\\" of freely moving electrons. These electrons can transfer energy throughout the metal at a rapid pace, leading to effective heat conduction. Now, let's consider the process of heat transfer. Heat transfer can occur through three primary mechanisms: conduction, convection, and radiation. In the case of the metal spoon in the boiling soup, heat transfer takes place through conduction. 1. Conduction: When the metal spoon is placed in the boiling soup, the heat from the soup is transferred to the spoon by direct contact between the soup and the spoon. As the metal is a good conductor, the heat energy is quickly and efficiently transferred throughout the entire spoon, including the handle. 2. Convection: The continuous movement of the soup would also contribute to the flow of heat to the spoon, as the hotter soup particles rise around the spoon and transfer heat to it. The cooler particles move downwards. However, convection does not play a significant role in the transfer of heat to the spoon handle. 3. Radiation: The spoon and the soup would also emit thermal radiation, but this has negligible impact as they both are at similar temperatures. In summary, the primary reason the cook's finger got burned upon touching the metal spoon is that the heat from the boiling soup was efficiently transferred to the spoon through conduction due to its metal construction. The spoon, acting as a good conductor of heat, transferred the heat energy throughout its length, including the handle. When the cook touched the handle of the spoon, their finger was instantly exposed to the intense heat, resulting in a burn. To avoid such burns in the future, one should use heat-resistant utensils with insulating handles or use a protective barrier, such as an oven mitt or a cloth, to pick up the utensil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The phrase \\"Dans chaque capitale, la mission a tenu des réunions avec des dignitaires religieux\\" when translated to English states, \\"In every capital, the mission held meetings with religious dignitaries.\\" The sentence is primarily about a mission, which could refer to various types of missions, such as a diplomatic mission, a religious mission, or an exploratory mission, among others. Each capital city mentioned implies that the mission involved numerous countries or political entities, showcasing its international scope. It is likely that the mission's purpose and objectives demanded cooperation and discussions among various nations or regions in order to accomplish its goals. The meetings held with religious dignitaries in each capital suggest that religious leaders or representatives played a significant role in the mission as well. It may be inferred that the mission sought to gather input from or collaborate with religious authorities to address certain issues or concerns. Such involvement is not uncommon, as religious organizations and their leaders can often have considerable influence on local communities and can contribute valuable perspectives on social, cultural, or ethical matters. Moreover, the inclusion of religious dignitaries in these meetings highlights an effort to integrate religious considerations into the mission's overall approach. This could involve addressing religious sensitivities, aligning the mission's goals with religious values, or fostering dialogue that encompasses a broader range of viewpoints. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Dans chaque capitale, la mission a tenu des réunions avec des dignitaires religieux\\" describes a significant international mission that actively engaged with religious leaders and representatives in each capital city.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more pollution in the air happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let us consider the process step-by-step in the context of the perturbation hypothesis, i.e., an increase in the amount of air pollution. 1. Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes - With more pollution in the air, there will be more harmful particles and gases entering the lungs along with the air. 2. Air enters bronchioles - These harmful particles and gases will also enter the bronchioles, which might lead to inflammation and damage, making it more difficult for oxygen to flow through. 3. Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - The alveoli may also become inflamed or damaged due to the increased pollution, potentially limiting the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed. 4. Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Since alveoli might have a reduced ability to hold oxygen, the small blood vessels around them would receive less oxygen. 5. Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - The absorption of oxygen by small blood vessels could be negatively affected, resulting in a lower amount of oxygen being delivered to the entire body. 6. Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Due to the decreased absorption of oxygen, cells throughout the body will receive less oxygen, which may result in various health issues and reduced cellular functions. 7. Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - As the body tries to compensate for the lower oxygen levels, there may be an increase in the production of carbon dioxide, which will be transported back to the lungs. 8. Carbon dioxide released when you exhale - The increased production of carbon dioxide might make it more challenging for the lungs to release it efficiently during exhalation. To conclude, the perturbation hypothesis of more pollution in the air would indeed have a direct effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. The presence of pollutants can cause inflammation and damage to the respiratory system, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to absorb oxygen and leading to a decrease in the amount of oxygen delivered to the bloodstream. This could cause both direct and indirect consequences on overall health and cellular functioning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Soldier returns from Afghanistan to learn his beloved dog is gone updated 2:46 AM EDT, Sat July 27, 2013 1st Lt. Brandon Harker says he returned from deployment in Afghanistan to find the friend he'd left his dog, Oakley, with had given away the dog. (CNN) -- A purebred yellow Labrador retriever, Oakley likes to run, swim and get into most everything -- \\"whether it's trouble or not,\\" his owner 1st Lt. Brandon Harker affectionately says. And as much as anything, Oakley enjoys cuddling wherever, with whomever. That's just what Harker wanted to do with him this month, when he got back from a 9-month deployment to Afghanistan. Except Oakley was gone. The friend with whom Harker had left Oakley said he'd gotten rid of the dog. \\"I'd just like to get him back, safe and sound,\\" Harker said Friday night. \\"That's about it.\\" About a year after joining the Army, Harker got the playful lab over Memorial Day weekend in 2011, while he was at Fort Benning in western Georgia. Describing him sweetly as \\"a very big baby,\\" Harker said Oakley loved to snuggle. \\"It doesn't matter who it was, he'd try to crawl up on your lap.\\" Whenever Harker was in the United States, Oakley would go with him. And whenever he deployed, his beloved dog would be left with a friend. That's what happened last year, when the lieutenant left Oakley with someone he described as a \\"good friend\\" before he headed off to Afghanistan. \\"Every time, while I was gone, I asked about him,\\" Harker said, recalling how his friend would insist Oakley was \\"doing good (and) acting like his regular self. \\"I'd ask for a picture every now and then. But I never got any pictures sent to me.\\" Harker learned the truth as he was flying back to Joint Base Lewis-McCord in Washington. \\"What do you mean you got rid of my dog?\\" he told his friend. In the few days since coming back, Harker has been on a mission. He posted a plea to find Oakley on Craigslist, noting that he didn't know if the dog had been sold or given away -- something he'd been told happened in May, though Harker isn't so sure. That online item describes Oakley as being \\"good with kids and other dogs,\\" with darker yellow spots on his face and going down his sides and legs. He is registered to Harker and has a microchip identifying device, and is a few days shy of being 2 years, 4 months old.

Article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Supporters mob Armenian protest leader Nikol Pashinyan after PM resigns There were scenes of jubilation in the Armenian capital Yerevan after protests forced the resignation of Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan. Opposition supporters accused Mr Sargsyan, who was made prime minister last week after serving 10 years as president, of clinging to power. \\"The street movement is against my tenure. I am fulfilling your demand,\\" Mr Sargsyan said in a statement. Former prime minister Karen Karapetyan has taken over as acting PM. President Armen Sarkissian accepted Mr Sargsyan's and the government's resignation. Mr Sargsyan's announcement came soon after opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan was released from detention. Mr Pashinyan had been arrested on Sunday after he called for Mr Sargsyan's resignation during televised talks. As well as Mr Pashinyan, two other opposition politicians and some 200 demonstrators were held. Image copyright AFP Image caption Demonstrators rallied again in the capital Yerevan on Monday In his statement published on his website, Mr Sargsyan said he was \\"addressing all citizens of the Republic of Armenia... for the last time as leader of the country.\\" \\"Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,\\" he said. \\"The situation has several solutions, but I will not take any of them... I am leaving office of the country's leader, of prime minister.\\" His spokesman, Hovhannes Nikoghosyan, told the BBC that Mr Sargsyan was behaving responsibly and fulfilling the demands of the street movement which opposed his appointment as prime minister. \\"I think his resignation is a clear demonstration of a democracy in force. It's not that every demonstration in every corner of the world leads to the resignation of the authorities,\\" Mr Nikoghosyan said. Image copyright AFP Image caption Tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest Protesters chanted \\"Nikol, Nikol\\" in the streets on Monday, the 11th straight day of protests. They were joined by hundreds of uniformed soldiers, despite warnings from the defence ministry that any soldiers protesting would be harshly punished. Mr Pashinyan congratulated the people on their \\"victory\\" following the resignation. \\"You have won, proud citizens of the Republic of Armenia. And no-one can seize this victory from you. I congratulate you, victorious people,\\" he wrote on Facebook. Mr Sargsyan had faced criticism in Armenia over his close ties to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has also moved between roles as president and prime minister to maintain his grip on power. Mr Putin's spokesman said on Monday that Moscow was closely watching events in Yerevan. \\"We are very attentively observing what is happening in Armenia,\\" Dmitry Peskov told journalists, calling the country \\"extremely important\\" for Russia. Asked if Russia would intervene, Mr Peskov said the matter was \\"exclusively an internal affair\\" and Russian action would be \\"absolutely inappropriate\\". At the scene Rayhan Demytrie in Yerevan Jubilation filled the Republic Square in Yerevan as people cracked open bottles of champagne, dancing in the fountain, hugging and waving flags. \\"This is what victory feels like,\\" said Lena, wrapped in the Armenian tricolour. \\"This is a day to live for, this is the day to be here to witness history!\\" said her husband Armen. When Mr Pashinyan arrived at Republic Square after being released, the people chanted his name and \\"Victory!\\". Shortly after, news broke that Mr Sargsyan had resigned and it was as if a firework of joy had exploded in the square. Many here say it is a victory for the whole nation, that the people stood up for democracy and won. And it came on the eve of April 24, which Armenians worldwide mark as Remembrance Day for the victims of mass killings of Armenians at the turn of the 20th century in Ottoman Turkey. The events in Armenia are significant, because they demonstrate that in a post-Soviet country change is possible through a peaceful, organic, grassroots movement. The fact that the Armenian authorities showed restraint and did not use excessive force against the demonstrators is also an achievement. But it's important to remember that the new acting prime minister is an old ally of Mr Sargsyan. Only the leadership has changed. Why were there protests? In 2015, Armenians voted in a referendum to shift the country from a presidential to a parliamentary system, stripping powers from the president and giving them to the prime minister. The vote was marred by allegations of ballot rigging and claims Mr Sargsyan wanted to simply switch office after his presidency ended. The ex-president had formally stated he would \\"not aspire\\" to the prime ministerial position, but on Tuesday last week the country's parliament officially confirmed Mr Sargsyan in the post. Protesters poured into the streets in the days beforehand to try to stop the parliament from passing the measure, and clashed with police. On the day of the confirmation, Mr Pashinyan said the demonstrations constituted a \\"non-violent velvet revolution\\". Who is Serzh Sargsyan? Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Sargsyan has been criticised for his close ties to Russia Mr Sargsyan served two consecutive terms as president of Armenia, starting in 2008 and ending on 9 April this year. His initial election in 2008 prompted deadly clashes between the state and opposition supporters. At least eight people died. He won a second five-year term in 2013. Several of his opponents dropped out of the race and one candidate was shot in a suspected assassination attempt. Mr Sargsyan was also accused of failing to address continuing tensions with Azerbaijan and Turkey, as well as widespread poverty at home. ||||| SERZH SARGSYAN, who ruled Armenia as president from 2008 until this month, was a faithful client of Vladi­mir Putin. In 2013, after meeting with the Russian president, he abruptly dropped negotiations with the European Union and instead joined Moscow-led economic and security organizations. During a visit to Washington a couple of years later, he frankly told us that his small Caucasian country of roughly 3 million people had little choice, since Armenians working in Russia supplied one-fifth of the country’s gross domestic product and Russian companies monopolized its energy supplies. “Armenian cognac can’t really be sold in Paris,” he explained. Mr. Sargsyan underestimated his own citizens, however, when he attempted to emulate a classic Putin maneuver. Limited by the constitution to two terms as president, he pushed through a constitutional amendment transferring most executive powers to the prime minister, and then — having denied for years that he would do so — had the parliament name him to that post. The result was 11 days of mounting mass demonstrations that, on Monday, prompted Mr. Sargsyan to give up the position. “I was wrong,” he said in a statement. It’s not clear whether Mr. Sargsyan’s departure will prompt a genuine change in Armenia’s government or its servile stance toward the Kremlin. Thanks to manipulated elections, the ruling party has a commanding majority in parliament, while the leader of last week’s protests, veteran dissident Nikol Pashinyan, controls just nine of 105 seats. The popular revolt nevertheless is a blow to the authoritarian political model promoted by Mr. Putin, which has spread not only to other former Soviet Bloc states in Russia’s orbit but also to Turkey, where ruler Recep Tayyip Erdogan is hoping to complete the transition from prime minister to all-powerful president in June. No doubt Mr. Putin will misunderstand the rebuff. Consumed by cynicism, the Russian ruler and his clique are incapable of accepting that spontaneous political uprisings by outraged publics are possible. They assume that they must be, like Russia’s own interventions in Western democratic elections, the result of state-directed conspiracies. Mr. Putin blamed the CIA and other intelligence agencies for the revolts that overturned pro-Moscow governments in Ukraine and Georgia, and when thousands of Russians protested election fraud and his own shuttle from prime minister to president in 2012, he held Hillary Clinton personally responsible. In truth, it’s safe to say that the Trump administration had nothing to do with events in Armenia. The only U.S. response to the demonstrations was a weak statement from the embassy in Yerevan asking the government for “restraint” while calling on the protesters to “prevent an escalation of tensions.” What drove Armenians to the streets was not foreign provocations but the fact that Mr. Sargsyan’s bet on Russia failed to deliver. During his decade in office, the economy stagnated. About 10 percent of the population abandoned the country, while 30 percent of those who remained fall below the official poverty line. Mr. Putin can be expected to squeeze whoever succeeds Mr. Sargsyan as prime minister; in addition to its economic levers, Russia maintains a military base in the country. That, however, won’t improve the lives of Armenians. More likely it will increase their resistance to the thuggish, corruption-ridden and economically failed model that is Putinism. ||||| MOSCOW — Ten days of demonstrations that escalated throughout Armenia forced the resignation Monday of the man who has led the country for the past decade, creating the latest crisis in a post-Soviet state trying to overcome a legacy of weak democratic rule. The unexpected resignation prompted scenes of jubilation in the capital, Yerevan, and other cities. Tens of thousands of people flocked to the central Republic Square in Yerevan, where all afternoon and into the night they danced, cheered and waved the Armenian flag, a striped tricolor of red, blue and orange. Serzh Sargsyan, president since 2008, reached his legal two-term limit earlier this month. A constitutional referendum in 2015 had transferred most presidential powers to the role of prime minister, however, and the Parliament, dominated by his right-wing Republican Party, swiftly voted him into the post with no other candidate given a chance. “I was wrong,” Mr. Sargsyan said in a brief resignation statement carried by the official news agency. “The street movement is against my tenure. I am fulfilling your demand.” |||||Summary:","completion":"The Prime Minister of Armenia, Serzh Sargsyan, has resigned after 11 days of mass protests against his rule. Sargsyan, who had been president for the past ten years, was accused of attempting to cling to power after being made prime minister last week.

Does being rich contribute to your spiritual life and its possibilities? Is the gap between the rich and poor a religious problem as well as a social problem in desperate need of solutions? Jesus, Pope Francis, and brain scientists have asked these questions, and the answers are clear if unnerving. Wealth and power are dangerous for your mental health, your spiritual condition, and for society in general -- especially when they contribute to the neglect of the poor. New research explains how this works (more on this in a minute). Ridding the world of poverty is, of course, a fantasy. Jesus knew this: \\"You will always have the poor among you,\\" he said (Matthew 26:11). He also said, \\"God blesses you who are poor, for the kingdom of God is yours.\\" (Luke 6:20). Only a few verses before this moment in Luke, he cries (echoing the Old Testament): \\"The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring the good news to the poor.\\" (Luke 4:18). Is it any wonder that when a rich young man came to","completion":"Jesus seeking advice on how to attain eternal life, he was instructed to sell all his possessions, give the money to the poor, and follow Jesus in a life of simplicity and devotion? (Matthew 19:16-22). It's no secret that Jesus consistently championed the cause of the poor and warned against the corrupting influence of wealth. Even the early Christian church practiced communal living, sharing their resources to ensure that none among them suffered the pangs of poverty (Acts 2:44-45). This focus on the dangers of wealth and the importance of helping the poor is prevalent in many religious traditions, not just Christianity. Buddhism preaches the value of detachment from material possessions, and Islam requires giving of alms to aid the less fortunate as one of its five central pillars. The concern for the impoverished and the call to seek spiritual contentment rather than material wealth demonstrate the deep-rooted belief in a link between excessive wealth and spiritual decline. Contemporary research has begun to uncover more about the psychological impact of wealth and power on individuals and society. Studies have shown that the wealthy tend to exhibit traits such as narcissism and entitlement. Often, they also display a lack of empathy for those less fortunate, attributing their wealth to their own hard work and deservingness, while attributing the plight of the poor to laziness or incompetence. As a result, the wealthy may become detached from the struggles of the less fortunate and desensitized to their needs. This detachment creates a cycle that perpetuates income inequality, as those in power are more likely to support policies that maintain the status quo and further enrich themselves to the detriment of the lower classes. The widening wealth gap has significant societal consequences, including increased crime rates, political instability, and a lower overall happiness index across the population. Thus, the warnings of Jesus, Pope Francis, and brain scientists should not be taken lightly. Of course, not all wealthy individuals succumb to these negative traits, and there are many philanthropists who use their resources for the betterment of society. Nevertheless, it is crucial for those with wealth – and society as a whole – to be aware of the innate dangers and remain vigilant in guarding against the corrupting influence of excessive wealth and power. Addressing the religious and social implications of the wealth gap may not be easy, but the values ingrained in these time-honored teachings provide a roadmap for action. Humility, empathy, and a genuine concern for the well-being of the less fortunate must be given higher priority than the pursuit of wealth and power. Governments, institutions, and individuals must work together to create policies and programs designed to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor, thereby fostering a more compassionate and equitable society for all. In conclusion, the teachings of Jesus, the statements of Pope Francis, and the findings of brain scientists should serve as a wake-up call for modern society to reevaluate its priorities and address the wealth gap. By heeding their wisdom and recognizing the spiritual and societal dangers associated with wealth, we can work together to create a world that values empathy, compassion, and the well-being of all people over the accumulation of material possessions. Ultimately, this will not only lead to a more just and harmonious society but may also contribute to individual spiritual growth and fulfillment beyond the temporary thrill of material wealth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That gives us: (955 * s - 629 * s) + 8802 = 0 Now, we need to do the subtraction inside the parentheses. So, 955 - 629 = 326. Now our problem looks like this: 326 * s + 8802 = 0 To continue, we want to get \\"s\\" all by itself. So, let's subtract 8802 from both sides: 326 * s = -8802 Now, to find what \\"s\\" is, we simply divide both sides by 326: s = -8802 / 326 After doing the division, we find out that: s = -27 So, the solution to the math problem is s = -27."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Now, I have a new situation: Ben and Jerry were two friends with very different dietary habits. Jerry ate healthy food, and was always on top of his caloric consumption, while Ben overate because he loved fatty foods such as butter, bacon et al. Answer this question please: Which friend was at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided and the dietary habits of both friends, Ben was at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. This conclusion is based on several factors related to Ben's dietary choices and preferences. Excess dietary lipids are known to be harmful due to their high caloric content, which can lead to unhealthy weight gain. As Ben preferred fatty foods like butter and bacon, it can be deduced that his diet was high in lipids. Overconsumption of lipids contributes to increased lipid levels in the blood, which can in turn lead to cardiovascular problems. The dietary lipids of most concern for cardiovascular health include saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. Fatty foods such as butter and bacon are known to be high in saturated fats, which are closely linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Additionally, these fatty foods commonly contain considerable amounts of cholesterol, which is the main lipid responsible for narrowing arteries and causing atherosclerosis, a major contributor to cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, Jerry maintained a healthy diet, which is associated with numerous health benefits and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Being mindful of his caloric consumption suggests that Jerry likely controlled his intake of lipids, avoiding excessive consumption and promoting better overall health. In conclusion, Ben's preference for fatty foods, such as butter and bacon, and likely higher consumption of lipids, make him at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease when compared to Jerry, who opted for a healthier diet and managed his caloric intake. Maintaining healthy eating habits and controlling lipid consumption is essential for reducing the risk of cardiovascular problems and promoting overall health and wellbeing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots - It passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Sunlight is absorbed by a green chemical in the leaves. Question: suppose it is winter time happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"During the winter season, the overall process of photosynthesis and subsequent sugar and oxygen production will likely face challenges due to the environmental changes and reduced sunlight. The exact effect will depend on the plant species, as some plants are more adaptive to the colder months. Therefore, it is vital to examine each aspect of the photosynthesis process in relation to winter conditions to make a well-informed conclusion. 1. Carbon dioxide: The concentration of carbon dioxide in the air remains fairly constant irrespective of the seasonal changes. There might be less photosynthesis occurring in some plants due to freezing temperatures and reduced sunlight, which could decrease the overall intake of carbon dioxide in certain plant species. This could slightly contribute to less sugar and oxygen being produced. 2. Stomata: The stomata in plants' leaves are responsible for gas exchange in the process of photosynthesis. During winter, cold temperatures can result in additional water loss from plants, causing some plants to limit their gas exchange or close their stomata to conserve water. This may affect the amount of carbon dioxide entering the leaf and could lead to less sugar and oxygen being produced. 3. Water absorption: Water is essential for the photosynthesis process, but the winter months bring about unique challenges. Due to freezing temperatures, the water in the soil may freeze, making it difficult for some plants to absorb enough water through their roots. Consequently, insufficient water supply may hinder the transportation of nutrients and the overall photosynthesis process, resulting in less sugar and oxygen being produced. 4. Sunlight absorption: During winter, the intensity, angle, and duration of sunlight significantly decreases, especially at higher latitudes. Less available sunlight slows down the rate at which chlorophyll (the green chemical that absorbs sunlight for photosynthesis) can catalyze the reaction. In simpler terms, less sunlight during the winter months directly translates to a reduced rate of photosynthesis, leading to the production of less sugar and oxygen. 5. The second effect: The second effect mentioned pertains to water passing through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves. In winter, lower temperatures, potential freezing of soil water, and reduced transpiration from closed stomata due to water conservation efforts in plants can affect the water flow through the stem. Consequently, this would lead to less water, nutrients, and minerals being transported to the leaves, further affecting the overall rate of photosynthesis and resulting in less sugar and oxygen being produced. Based on the analysis of these key aspects of photosynthesis during winter, it can be concluded that there will likely be a significant reduction in the production of sugar and oxygen. However, it is important to note that the degree of reduction may vary depending on plant species' adaptability, location, and specific environmental conditions. In general, though, the winter season will more likely result in less sugar and oxygen being produced by most plants."},{"prompt":"What type of details about valdemar mota can be gathered from the following bio?

Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Superman is a popular pop fiction character that first appeared under which medium?\\" is in \\"European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination. No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.\\".

Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft.

Fact 2: Liquid waste passes through the blood and the urinary system . Given the two facts above, how does urine leave the body? The answer is:","completion":"Urine leaves the body through a comprehensive process that involves various components of the urinary system. Here is a detailed answer: First, let's understand the urinary system: it comprises two kidneys, two ureters, the urinary bladder, and the urethra. The primary purpose of this system is to eliminate waste from the body. Waste is filtered out from the blood and converted into urine through a complex process of excretion and re-absorption. Now, let's unfold the journey of urine from its formation to its exit from the body: 1. Filtration - The process begins in the nephrons, tiny functional units of the kidneys. Each kidney contains about a million nephrons. Blood from the renal artery enters the kidneys and is filtered through these nephrons. This filtration happens in the glomerulus, a tiny blood vessel located in the nephron, where waste products, water, salt, and some glucose are filtered out from the blood. Large molecules like proteins and blood cells are too big to pass through the filtration process and hence, remain within the blood vessel. 2. Reabsorption - As this filtered fluid passes through the nephron, most of the water along with vital nutrients and electrolytes like glucose, amino acids, and necessary ions are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. 3. Formation of Urine - After the reabsorption, the remaining waste forms a liquid called urine. This urine consists of wastes like urea (from protein catabolism) and uric acid (from nucleic acid metabolism), excess electrolytes, and water. 4. Transport - The urine then goes down from the nephrons into the renal pelvis - a funnel-shaped structure that exits the kidney. It then travels down the ureters - muscular tubes that propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. 5. Storage - In the urinary bladder, the urine gets collected until the bladder fills up. 6. Excretion - When there's a need to urinate, the filled bladder contracts, pushing the urine into the urethra. The urethra then expels the urine externally from the body through an outlet – in males, the outlet is the penis, and in females, it is the urethral opening located just above the opening of the vagina. By this process, the body maintains a stable balance of chemicals and water by removing harmful or unnecessary substances via urine. This reflects the involvement of the urinary system and the circulatory system in the production, transportation, storage, and excretion of urine from the body."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Background: The Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1970, by songwriters/multi-instrumentalists Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood with drummer Bev Bevan. Their music is characterised by a fusion of Beatlesque pop, classical arrangements, and futuristic iconography. After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's leader, arranging and producing every album while writing virtually all of their original material. For their initial tenure, Lynne, Bevan and keyboardist Richard Tandy were the group's only consistent members. Context: For the next six years, Harvest and Epic/Legacy reissued ELO's back catalogue. Included amongst the remastered album tracks were unreleased songs and outtakes, including two new singles. The first was \\"Surrender\\" which registered on the lower end of the UK Singles Chart at number 81, some 30 years after it was written in 1976. The other single was \\"Latitude 88 North\\". On 9 August 2010, Eagle Rock Entertainment released Live - The Early Years in the UK as a DVD compilation that included Fusion - Live in London (1976) along with never before released live performances at Brunel University (1973) and on a German TV show Rockpalast (1974). The US had a slightly edited release on 24 August 2010. The Essential Electric Light Orchestra artwork was re-jigged to feature two different covers. The US and Australian releases shared one design, while the rest of the world featured the other for a new double album release in October 2011. Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra was released on 8 October 2012. It is an album of new recordings of ELO's greatest hits by Lynne; along with a new song \\"Point of No Return\\", released to coincide with Lynne's second solo album release Long Wave. These new 2012 albums contained advertisement cards, announcing the re-release of expanded and remastered versions of both the 2001 album Zoom and Lynne's debut solo album Armchair Theatre, originally released in 1990. Both albums were re-released in April 2013 with various bonus tracks. Also released was the live album, Electric Light Orchestra Live, showcasing songs from the Zoom tour. All three releases also featured new studio recordings as bonus tracks. Lynne and Tandy reunited again on 12 November 2013 to perform, under the name Jeff Lynne and Friends, \\"Livin' Thing\\" and \\"Mr Blue Sky\\" at the Children in Need Rocks concert at Hammersmith Eventim Apollo, London.

No While it is true that coiled structures made of DNA and proteins, also known as chromosomes, are essential components of life, they do not exclusively determine life itself. Rather, they contain the genetic information necessary for the development, traits, and functioning of an organism. As such, they play a significant role in the overall makeup of life. The specific coiled structures that determine sex are called sex chromosomes, which vary in different species. In humans, these chromosomes are designated as X and Y. Males have one X and one Y chromosome, whereas females have two X chromosomes. The combination of these chromosomal structures influences the development of sexual characteristics in individuals.

Summarize: Mohammad Javad Zarif said the Saudi move was \\"positive\\" and urged talks and the formation of a new government. Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia has accused Shia-led Iran of backing the Houthis, something Tehran denies. Saudi defence chiefs said the focus would now shift towards finding a political solution to the crisis. But they said military force would still be used when needed. Mr Zarif tweeted: \\"Positive developments in Yemen should be followed by urgent humanitarian assistance, intra-Yemeni dialogue and broad-based govt. Ready to help.\\" Iran's foreign ministry had earlier welcomed the Saudi announcement. \\"Before this, we said the crisis in Yemen had no military solution, and... a halt to killing innocent and defenceless people is absolutely a step forward,\\" a spokeswoman said, according to the semi-official Isna news agency. Yemen has been in chaos since Houthi, or Zaidi Shia, rebels, seized the capital, Sanaa, in January and placed President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi under house arrest. Mr Hadi escaped and fled to the southern port city of Aden in February. He left the country at the end of March when the Houthis, backed by army units supporting former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, reached the outskirts of Aden. The Saudi-led coalition said its operation Decisive Storm had achieved its goals, \\"removing the threat to Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries\\". Coalition spokesman Brig-Gen Ahmed al-Asiri said a new phase called Restoring Hope was beginning with the aim of stopping Houthi rebels from \\"targeting civilians or changing realities on the ground\\". He said Decisive Storm had ended at the request of the \\"legitimate\\" Yemeni government. In a televised speech, Mr Hadi thanked his Saudi allies for supporting him as Yemeni president. \\"I express the deepest gratitude and respect to our Arab and Muslim brothers and friends in this exceptional strategic alliance in my name and on behalf of the Yemeni people,\\" he said. The US also welcomed the Saudi decision to end air strikes and urged talks to end the crisis. \\"We continue to support the resumption of a UN-facilitated political process and the facilitation of humanitarian assistance,\\" National Security Council spokesman Alistair Baskey said. The BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, says that although the Saudis have claimed victory in the first stage of their campaign, the Yemeni government has not been restored and the Houthi militia still controls the capital. The US has been increasingly concerned about the costs of the bombing campaign, he adds, especially the number of civilians being killed. The World Health Organization says that 944 people were reported killed and 3,487 wounded in the four weeks up to Friday. The US has also sent two warships - the USS Theodore Roosevelt and USS Normandy - to the region. The Pentagon said the ships were to ensure freedom of navigation but were also watching a flotilla of Iranian cargo vessels that had approached Yemen. On Tuesday, US President Barack Obama warned Iran not to send weapons to Yemen. \\"What we've said to them is that, If there are weapons delivered to factions within Yemen that could threaten navigation, that's a problem,\\" he said. \\"And we're not sending them obscure messages. We send them very direct messages about it.\\" The UN Security Council has imposed an arms embargo on the rebels.

This statement reflects several positive facets. Initially, mentioning \\"frank humanity\\" implies an honest and open revelation or exploration of human conditions, emotions, or experiences. This frankness or openness typically signifies a sense of acceptance or realization, which is generally connected with personal growth, development, and enlightenment. These are predominantly positive concepts. Just as important is the term \\"emotional recovery,\\" which very much encourages a positive sentiment. Recovery signifies a process of overcoming or moving beyond a certain negative state or condition. It may involve enduring, resilience, and eventual triumph over adversity. In the context of emotions, it could mean recuperating from emotional trauma, sadness, depression, etc., which is indeed a positive shift. Emotional recovery would usually involve feelings of relief, accomplishment, rejuvenation and a sense of returning to a state of emotional health and wellbeing. Even though it does hint that there might have been a period of suffering or hardship initially (as the need for recovery occurs after a problematic phase), the dominance of the healing and rejuvenation process leading to some form of better condition or state implies an overall positive sentiment. So, in general terms, this statement gives an impression of hope, strength, self-improvement, resilience, honesty, and positivity associated with human conditions, making the sentiment of this sentence predominantly positive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He believed that, by enabling the younger sister to rapidly mature, the siblings would then be on a more equal footing and better able to pursue their shared dream of conquering the magical realm they had discovered mere months ago. Daniel, a wise and experienced sorcerer, knew that in order to conquer the magical realm, the sisters required harmony between them and a shared understanding of both worldly and mystical knowledge. Providing Jessica with the elixir was just the first step to ensuring that they could make an impact in this unfamiliar world. As Jessica drank the potion, she was immediately infused with a magical energy that coursed through her veins, transforming her into a much more mature version of herself. Daniel watched closely as the change took place, making certain that the elixir didn't have any unforeseen side effects. To his surprise and relief, the transformation was seamless, and Jessica soon stood as a grown woman, nearly the same age as Monica. With the sisters now appearing as equals, they embarked upon the journey that lay ahead. Daniel, as their mentor, helped them acquire the knowledge and skills they would need to flourish in this new magical realm. Each day, they delved deeper into the world of sorcery, learning about the delicate balance between light and dark magic, the history of the realm, and the true meaning of power. Working together, Monica and Jessica soon found that their connection was stronger now that they were both adults. The challenges they faced no longer seemed insurmountable, and they tackled each obstacle with courage and conviction. As the sisters honed their magical skills, their love and respect for one another blossomed, inspiring them to strive for greatness in their quest for conquest. However, embracing their newfound abilities also served as a catalyst for unexpected discoveries. The sisters came to understand that the realm they sought to conquer had its own ancient history, filled with secrets and consequences that could change the course of their lives forever. Unbeknownst to them, the lessons they received from Daniel had led them into a world of complex moral dilemmas and fierce adversaries who were not so easily defeated. Despite these newfound challenges, Monica and Jessica remained unyielding, their strong bond propelling them forward on their journey of self-discovery and magical enlightenment. Daniel spotted the greatness within them and could sense that the world had not yet seen the true potential of the sisters' power. The elixir that he had given to Jessica had not only transformed her physically but had also ignited within both sisters an unstoppable force that would forever shape the course of the magical realm's history. As time went on, Monica and Jessica continued to excel at their magical endeavors, while their mentor, Sorcerer Daniel, guided them along their path. They would face triumphs and failures, adversaries and allies, all in the pursuit of their fondest wish. It was through this incredible journey that the sisters would ultimately discover the true meaning of power, friendship, and sacrifice, forever changing not just their lives but the very fabric of the magical realm in which they sought to conquer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The key to halting climate change: admit we can't save everything Climate change, and human resistance to making the changes needed to halt it, both continue apace: 2015 was the hottest year in recorded history, we may be on the brink of a major species extinction event in the ocean, and yet political will is woefully lacking to tackle this solvable problem. Related: Why don't we treat climate change with the rigor we give to terror attacks? | Ruth Greenspan Bell Given these dire ecological trends, limited public funding and legislative gridlock, the time is ripe for a budget-neutral, executive-branch approach for managing our natural resources: triage. A science-based triage approach should be used to classify areas and species into one of three categories: not at immediate risk, in need of immediate attention or beyond help. Refusing to apply triage implicitly assumes that we can save everything and prevent change, which we cannot. Prioritization will occur regardless, just ad hoc and shrouded. This triage system would replace the status quo of inadequately managing our full portfolio of over 1m square miles of public land and 1,589 threatened and endangered species. For areas or species not at immediate risk, we can delay action while monitoring to detect changes in that status. For example, increased temperatures and prolonged periods of drought may increase both wildfires and populations of tree-killing beetles in forests of the Pacific north-west. Knowing this, we can track these variables and explore management options that minimize risk without prematurely devoting disproportionate resources. For areas needing immediate help, we must act now. For the coral reefs of the Florida Keys and US Virgin Islands, all anthropogenic impacts (such as overfishing, pollution and coastal development) must be dramatically reduced. Otherwise, because the health of these coral reefs is currently so compromised, they are unlikely to survive the sea level rise, rising ocean temperatures and increasing acidification resulting from climate change. For species protections, it would be wise to focus on keystone species such as oysters (water filterers), parrotfish (algae eaters on overgrown coral reefs), bees (pollinators) and wolves (key predators). For areas we can no longer maintain, we must make the most difficult of choices – give up, and accept that change is not always preventable. In Alaska, it may be too late to prevent the climate change-induced shift from coniferous-dominated to deciduous-dominated stands, with unfortunate impacts on forest-dwelling species and the logging industry. In the ocean, entire fisheries can be lost from an area when species shift due to warming waters. This is not to say we should de-list endangered species or revoke area protections. Rather, management should account for shifts in climate and habitats and aim to maintain the services ecosystems provide (like pollination, soil fertility, air and water purification and recreation), but acknowledge it may be costly and futile to attempt to maintain a particular ecosystem configuration or species in a particular location. However, even degraded coral reefs can supply key ecosystem services such as fisheries and storm protection. A river can continue to be a source of clean, fresh drinking water and provide habitat for a diversity of species even if it is no longer suitable for trout or salmon. Related: The high court halted Obama's climate change plan. This doesn't bode well | Scott Lemieux For triage to be successful, categorization must be transparent, based on the best available science, and it must avoid politicization and subjectivity. This approach would require us to weigh the many benefits ecosystems provide against the cost effectiveness of various management options. Given the distribution of management authority and the value of local ecological knowledge, these discussions and decisions would need to be just as robust at the local and state levels as at the national level. Employing triage would enable us to holistically consider our natural resources, design strategic management, focus our energies and resources and save as much of our environment as possible for the benefit of this and future generations.

All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County.

The cabinet was emptier, leaving him to ponder how he could rearrange his belongings in order to fill the newly vacant space and keep the room organized. After a moment of contemplation, he realized that moving the stacks of books and old DVDs into the cabinet would not only free up space on other shelves but also protect them from dust and light damage. Furthermore, he was struck by the notion that his game accessories, such as controllers, could also be neatly stowed away in the cabinet, so they would be close to the console yet out of sight when not in use. With a newfound sense of excitement, he began the process of decluttering and transferring the items to their new respective locations. The books and DVDs fit seamlessly into the cabinet, and it was evident that he had made the right choice in repurposing the empty space. A feeling of satisfaction washed over him as he appreciated the more organized aesthetic of the room. Next, he moved onto the game accessories, wrapping the cords neatly and placing the controllers next to the organized bundles. As he did so, he made the decision to donate some of his older games and accessories that no longer held appeal, further reducing clutter and opening up even more space in the cabinet. After the rearrangement process, he stepped back to survey his work, admiring the efficiency of the new layout and its impact on the room's cohesion. He couldn't help but smile at the thought of inviting friends over soon for a gaming session - the space now felt welcoming and purposeful, all thanks to that once-emptier cabinet. In conclusion, while the initial challenge of fitting his gaming console in the cabinet might have been a source of frustration, it ultimately served as a catalyst for positive change in the room's organization and function. It was a lesson that sometimes a small issue can lead to a larger transformation that not only enhances the space but also brings a sense of accomplishment and pride in one's surroundings.

After this initial experience, Thomson and another colleague, William Broadhead, went on a two-month expedition, going up the Spanish River and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today Mississagi Provincial Park). Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his own original style of painting became apparent around this time.

Generate a question that has the following answer: Basil Sydney for the following movie plot: In the early years of the Second World War, aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis is struggling to develop a means of attacking Germany's dams in the hope of crippling German heavy industry. Working for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, as well as doing his own job at Vickers, he works feverishly to make practical his theory of a bouncing bomb which would skip over the water to avoid protective torpedo nets. When it came into contact with the dam, it would sink before exploding, making it much more destructive. Wallis calculates that the aircraft will have to fly extremely low (150 feet (46Â m)) to enable the bombs to skip over the water correctly, but when he takes his conclusions to the Ministry, he is told that lack of production capacity means they cannot go ahead with his proposals. Angry and frustrated, Wallis secures an interview with Sir Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris (played by Basil Sydney), the head of RAF Bomber Command, who at first is reluctant to take the idea seriously. Eventually, however, he is convinced and takes the idea to the Prime Minister, who authorises the project. Bomber Command forms a special squadron of Lancaster bombers, 617 Squadron, to be commanded by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, and tasked to fly the mission. He recruits experienced crews, especially those with low-altitude flight experience. While they train for the mission, Wallis continues his development of the bomb but has problems, such as the bomb breaking apart upon hitting the water. This requires the drop altitude to be reduced to 60 feet (18Â m). With only a few weeks to go, he succeeds in fixing the problems and the mission can go ahead. The bombers attack the dams. Eight Lancasters and their crews are lost, but the overall mission succeeds and two dams are breached.

A schoolboy who stunned his family with his bravery after he was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour, has died this morning. David Langton-Gilks, 16, who battled the disease for five years, had thought he had beaten the tumour in May this year. When he was told he had relapsed and would die in a matter of weeks, he stunned his relations by saying: 'You can’t win them all.' David slipped into a coma last Saturday and died at 6.10am today - six weeks after. doctors expected him to pass away. 'He died surrounded by love at home,' his mother Sacha, who is a singing teacher, said. Special evening: David was thrilled with the black limousine that arrived to take him to his school prom. David Langton-Gilks, earlier this year with the family dog Honey. She also revealed on. Twitter she found her son's will a few days before he died. He wanted. his things to be shared between his siblings, Rufus and Holly, with his. collection of jellybeans to go to his younger sister. His ukulele was to. go to a family friend. David was told at the beginning of June his condition was terminal and decided that he didn't want further chemotherapy. However, he was desperate to make his. school prom on June 28. His mother Sacha, 44, was able to tell friends. and supporters on Twitter that he fulfilled his ambition. 'DD's DONE it! Grinning in black tie by pristine black limo on our dirty, bumpy farm track,' she posted that evening. The limo was provided by the charity. Rays of Sunshine and marked the start of a very special night, during. which David won the award for 'Most Optimistic Person.' Mrs Langton-Gilk's Twitter updates also revealed David's wish to be cremated and have his ashes scattered at a local watering hole. She also paid tribute to his extraordinary philosophical attitude to life. The day after his prom he told her: 'It's funny how u (sic) realise the significance of your life just when you're about to lose it.' Later that day he said to his parents, Sacha, 44 and Toby, 46: 'I just want to say that I have very much enjoyed myself here; thank you very much.' David, pictured surfing in Cornwall. The trip was paid for by the charity Round Table Children's Wish Limited. The teenager, from Fontmell Magna, in. Dorset, had stopped going to school in May due to concentration problems. caused by the tumour and said his only regret was not being able to do. his Biology A level. His memory worsened as time went on which meant he had to replace reading and playing the guitar with simpler tasks such as cooking. But he still shared precious. exchanges with his family. His mother said his little sister would insist David play. with her saying: 'You can rest when you're dead.' David's mother, Sacha Langton-Gilks. She said David had shown her how to cope by being so strong. Then on 6 August, she recounted. another bittersweet conversation: 'DD 2 me: \\"Do I know u?\\" Me: \\"Yes, very well.\\" DD:. \\"You look very like my mother.\\" Me: \\"Yes I certainly do. She's. marvellous!\\"' The family were helped by Marie Curie nurses who provided much-needed nighttime relief and other support. They were also boosted by how well Team GB did at the Olympics, providing a much-needed distraction. Mrs Langton-Gilks and her family are backing the Headsmart awareness campaign run by The Brain Tumour Charity, to highlight the importance. of detecting brain tumours in children at an early stage. Although David displayed the symptoms. of the disease when he was 11, they were not simultaneous and it took. five-and-a-half weeks to get a diagnosis. Had. it been detected sooner, the tumour would have been around half the. size it was and David would have stood a much better chance of survival. The symptoms of the Medulloblastoma brain tumour include vomiting, headaches, and unusual eye movements. Children have the same risk of developing a brain tumour as meningitis. David's parents released a statement today that said: 'The Langton-Gilks family are determined that everyone knows how to spot the signs of a brain tumour in a child/young person. 'Supporting the HeadSmart Campaign is the fastest way to achieve this. This will save the lives of some of the two coachloads of children who die horribly every year from a brain tumour and massively improve the quality of life for those children, like David, who have to endure years of complex treatment.' They added: 'The family will never be able to express fully their gratitude & admiration to all of the doctors, nurses & support staff at Southampton General Hospital, Salisbury District Hospital & Shaftesbury Abbeyview Medical Centre as well as the following charities: CLICSargent, Marie Curie, the Teenage Cancer Trust and The Brain Tumour Charity who started HeadSmart.'

A:","completion":"Season 4 of The Flash originally aired on the CW Network in the United States from October 10, 2017 to May 22, 2018. This season, like its predecessors, focused on the adventures of Barry Allen, a forensic scientist with superhuman speed who fights crime as the superhero known as The Flash. At the end of Season 3, Barry had sacrificed himself to the Speed Force in order to keep it stable. Season 4 picks up six months later, with the team at S.T.A.R. Labs dealing with the absence of Barry, who emerges from the Speed Force in the season's premiere, albeit not without repercussions. Season 4 is also notable for introducing a new main antagonist who is not a speedster, unlike the previous seasons. The primary villain of this season is The Thinker, a hyper-intelligent metahuman with the power to control technology and calculate numerous future outcomes. This strategic and cerebral antagonist presents a unique challenge to Team Flash, which results in a more psychological battle in contrast to the physical confrontations of previous seasons. Season 4 also further explores the personal lives and challenges of the supporting characters, including Iris West, Cisco Ramon (Vibe), Caitlin Snow (Killer Frost), Joe West, and newcomer Ralph Dibny (Elongated Man), alongside Barry and a number of recurring characters. The Flash belongs to a larger shared universe of television series known as the Arrowverse, which also includes Arrow, Supergirl, and Legends of Tomorrow among others. These shows often have crossover events which may affect the storyline of each individual show, with one such event in Season 4 of The Flash titled \\"Crisis on Earth-X\\". Now, depending on the location, audiences who missed the original airing on the CW Network can catch up with Season 4 of The Flash on various streaming platforms such as Netflix.

You are given a new situation: Dan had two children: Karen which had sickle-cell anemia, and his son Bob, which was healthy. and a hint : The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. Please answer this question : Which child has a hemoglobin that gives rise to the crescent-shaped cells? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Karen has a hemoglobin that gives rise to the crescent-shaped cells. This is because she has sickle-cell anemia, a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene responsible for producing hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein that binds to oxygen and carries it throughout the body via red blood cells. In individuals with sickle-cell anemia, the mutated hemoglobin causes the red blood cells to clump together, leading to a distortion in their shape. This results in the cells taking on a crescent, or sickle-like appearance. The crescent-shaped cells characteristic of sickle-cell anemia can cause a range of health problems. These misshapen cells can obstruct blood flow in small blood vessels, leading to pain, tissue damage, and a reduced ability to transport oxygen to the body's tissues. This decreased oxygen delivery can result in fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. Sickle-cell anemia is a genetic disease, meaning it is passed down from parents to their children through their genes. In Dan's family, his daughter Karen inherited the gene mutation causing sickle-cell anemia, leading to her having the disease. On the other hand, his son Bob did not inherit this mutation and is therefore healthy, with normal hemoglobin and red blood cell shapes. In conclusion, it is Karen, the daughter with sickle-cell anemia, who has a hemoglobin that gives rise to the crescent-shaped cells. Understanding the specific changes in hemoglobin structure and genetics behind this disease has allowed for the development of various treatment options and management strategies to improve the lives of those affected by sickle-cell anemia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: SpaceX rocket explodes while trying to land on drone ship Elon Musk’s SpaceX has experienced another example of “rapid unscheduled disassembly” – which is Musk jargon for “my rocket exploded”. The spaceflight company has been testing a re-usable version of its Falcon 9 rocket, the sub-orbital rocket which it uses, among other things, to deliver supplies to the International Space Station (it started in 2012, making it the first private company to visit the ISS). Rockets are expensive, with a standard launch on the Falcon 9 costing 61m, but those costs can be reduced if the bottom stage of the rocket, which contains most of the engines, could be re-used. To that end, SpaceX has been attempting to land the rockets back safely on a stable surface, rather than letting them drop into the ocean as is typical for launches. It has a purpose-built unmanned “drone ship” built for the purpose (named “Just Read the Instructions” in honour of the science fiction author Iain M Banks) and the rockets are armed with small thrusters to control their descent. Unfortunately, landing a rocket is tricky. Almost exactly a year ago, a Falcon 9 rocket exploded after hitting the ship at a steep angle, causing Musk to coin the phrase “rapid unscheduled disassembly”. This year’s landing went much better, relatively speaking. The rocket landed vertically, and three of the four legs were successfully locked into place. Unfortunately, the fourth did not. Musk shared a video of the landing and subsequent explosion, adding: “Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn’t latch on one [of] the four legs, causing it to tip over post landing. Root cause may have been ice buildup due to condensation from heavy fog at liftoff.” Although the company hasn’t managed to land the rocket on the ship, it did successfully land on solid ground in December. Summary:","completion":"SpaceX experienced another setback as their Falcon 9 rocket exploded while attempting to land on a drone ship. The reusable version of the Falcon 9 rocket was being tested in hopes of cutting costs for space travel by reusing the bottom stage of the rocket, which contains most of the engines. This particular landing saw improvements from a year ago, as the rocket landed vertically and secured three of its legs in place. However, the failure of its fourth leg caused the rocket to tip over and explode."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Question: Running a sanding belt over polished metal creates less resistance then running one over raw metal. This means that the _____ is more rough (A) polished metal (B) raw metal","completion":"The statement given compares the resistance experienced when running a sanding belt over polished metal and raw metal. From the statement, it is understood that the polished metal creates less resistance than the raw metal. Based on this observation, we can infer that the raw metal is more rough. To gain a deeper understanding, let's define both the terms and delve into their properties: Polished Metal: Polished metal refers to metal that has undergone a finishing process using abrasive materials to improve its appearance, reduce surface imperfections, and provide a smoother surface. Through a series of steps, abrasives with different grit sizes are used to gradually refine and smoothen the surface. The result is a shiny, reflective surface with a high degree of smoothness. Examples of polished metal surfaces include high-quality kitchenware, pristine automobile parts, and ornamental objects. Raw Metal: Raw metal, on the other hand, is metal in its natural, unprocessed state, and it has not undergone any finishing or polishing processes. As a result, raw metal surfaces are typically characterized by unevenness, uneven texture, scratches, pits, or other surface imperfections. The roughness of raw metal surfaces makes them less suitable for certain applications, such as those requiring tight tolerances or an aesthetically pleasing appearance. Considering the characteristics of both polished metal and raw metal, it becomes clear why running a sanding belt over polished metal creates less resistance compared to raw metal. The surface smoothness and uniformity of polished metal cause the abrasive particles on the sanding belt to encounter fewer high spots, imperfections, or unevenness that would cause resistance. Conversely, raw metal, with its rougher and less uniform surface, provides more points of contact and causes the abrasive particles on the sanding belt to work harder in order to smooth the surface, thereby creating more resistance. So in conclusion, the correct answer is (B) raw metal. The raw metal is more rough, as evidenced by the higher resistance experienced when running a sanding belt over it compared to the polished metal. The inherent properties of raw metal surfaces, such as unevenness and surface imperfections, contribute to this increased resistance, making them less smooth than polished metal surfaces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye.

Please answer the following question: This article: Joséphine-Éléonore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn (1825–1860) married Albert de Broglie on 18 June 1845, and they had five sons together. Although not high royalty, on the occasion of their marriage, they styled themselves Prince and Princesse respectively. Pauline was a highly intelligent and religious woman, who was well read and wrote a number of texts in her lifetime. Her shyness was well known; she was widely considered strikingly beautiful and charming, but those around her would often avoid eye contact so as not to embarrass her. Albert was devoted to his wife, and commissioned the painting after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister, the Comtesse d'Haussonville. Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. Ingres dined with the de Broglie family in January 1850, and according to one eye witness, \\"seemed to be very happy with his model.\\"Although Ingres' main source of income came from portraiture, it distracted from his main interest in history painting, which early in his career, was far less lucrative. He found acclaim in the 1840s, when he became successful enough to no longer depend on commissions. This painting was Ingres' second-last female portrait, and final society portrait.Influenced by the working methods of Jacques-Louis David, Ingres began with a number of nude preparatory sketches, for which he employed professional models. He built up a picture of the sitter's underlying anatomical structure, as seen in the Musée Bonnat study, before deciding on how to build the lavish costume and accessories. Although there is no surviving record of the commissions, and the exact sequence of events is uncertain, the sketches can be dated from 1850, the year the style of her evening dress came into fashion. Ingres signed and dated the final picture at the left center \\"J. INGRES. pit 1853\\".Pauline died in 1860 aged 35 from tuberculosis.

The most logical next event after establishing what you need to do is to explore the various options available to you and choose the best one that caters to your schedule and requirements. Here are some steps to guide you in this process: 1. Research available resources: Start by researching local child care providers and facilities in your area that offer extended hours or overnight services. This can be done by searching online, using resources such as care.com or local government websites, or checking your community bulletin boards for information. 2. Ask for recommendations: Reach out to friends, family, or colleagues who may have experience with child care providers that operate outside of the usual business hours. Their insights and experiences can be valuable in determining the best option for your child. 3. Verify credentials and certifications: Ensure that the child care providers and facilities you are considering have the necessary certifications, accreditations, and licenses to operate legally. Be sure to verify their qualifications as per your state and local guidelines. 4. Investigate safety policies and procedures: Visit the childcare facilities you are considering and inquire about their safety policies and procedures. Make sure the facilities have adequate safety measures in place like emergency plans, fire safety equipment, and a secure environment. 5. Consider affordability and financial assistance: Compare the fees of the child care providers to see which one better fits your budget. If you are in need of financial assistance, explore government subsidies or programs that can help you reduce the cost of child care services. 6. Schedule a meet-and-greet: Set up appointments to meet with the providers and staff to ensure that you feel comfortable with the environment and are confident in the care your child will receive. This is also an opportunity to ask any questions you may have and observe how they interact with the children under their care. 7. Check for flexibility and convenience: Choose a child care provider who can accommodate your schedule, as well as the unexpected changes that can occur in your work routine. Look for facilities or programs that offer flexible drop-off and pick-up times, as well as those that provide a backup plan for care during unforeseen circumstances, such as a provider's illness. 8. Weigh pros and cons: After gathering all the necessary information, evaluate the pros and cons of each child care provider or facility based on their services, quality, safety, affordability, and convenience. Choose the one that best caters to your needs and preferences. 9. Talk to your child: Depending on your child's age, it's crucial to discuss and involve them in the decision-making process. Talk to your child about the new child care provider or facility, and make sure they feel comfortable and excited about the change. Consider their opinion and feelings when making your final decision. 10. Stay involved and maintain communication: Once you have selected a child care provider, establish an open line of communication with them. Regularly check-in to know about your child's progress and any concerns that may arise. Stay involved in your child's care by participating in the provider's activities or parent-teacher meetings when possible. Finding reliable, quality child care outside normal work hours can be a challenging task.

The script for episode four bears a date of April 2016, suggesting it was an early draft rather than the finished, filmed episode. Also made available were two episodes of upcoming HBO comedy show Barry and one of the Insecure show. Files containing log-in details for some HBO staff are also believed to have been made available. Several other large files were also put online but so far no-one has been able to work out what is in them. Panda Security urged people to avoid any website that made the stolen files available for copying. \\"Instead of the new season of a hit show, your system may end up getting infected with malicious software,\\" it warned. The security firm added that the hackers behind the breach, or those that share the files around, were not acting benevolently. It said: \\"They are money driven and would gladly steal your information too without any hesitation.\\" HBO is just the latest in a long list of media firms to be hit by hackers, or who have had data stolen. In May, unseen episodes of the Netflix show Orange Is The New Black were put online by a hacker after the media firm refused to pay a ransom for their return. Summary:","completion":"Hackers recently stole more than 1.5 terabytes of data from US television network HBO, including uploaded a text file of a Game of Thrones instalment and three episodes of popular HBO TV shows. The attack also resulted in the loss of some data. HBO is working with law enforcement and cybersecurity companies to investigate the incident, and has warned people to avoid any website advertising the stolen files. In May, unseen episodes of the Netflix show Orange is the New Black were leaked by hackers who were not paid a ransom for their return."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"A little kid climbs a red mat on a festive carpet.\\" if \\"A child is asleep.\\"?","completion":"No, it is not possible to conclude that \\"A little kid climbs a red mat on a festive carpet\\" if \\"A child is asleep.\\" These two statements present entirely different situations and cannot be logically connected based on the information provided. To fully explain the reason behind this, we will examine each statement individually and compare them. First, let us break down the statement, \\"A little kid climbs a red mat on a festive carpet.\\" This sentence describes a specific action being performed by a child – the act of climbing a red mat. Additionally, it also provides context for the setting, which is a festive carpet. Based on this information, we can gather that there is an active event taking place involving the child. Now, let us analyze the statement, \\"A child is asleep.\\" This situation presents a completely different scenario – a child is at rest and not actively engaging in any activity. Sleep implies a state of inactivity, and it is not possible for a child to be climbing a red mat while asleep simultaneously. To draw a connection or conclude one statement based on the information provided in the other, there should be some form of logical or contextual relationship between them. In this case, there is no common element or context that enables us to conclude that a little kid climbs a red mat on a festive carpet simply because a child is asleep. It is important to recognize that there could be further context or information that was not provided. For example, if there was an additional statement revealing that the festive carpet was in the child's dream, it could offer a logical connection between these two seemingly unrelated scenarios. However, based solely on the current information, we cannot make a connection between the sleeping child and the child climbing the red mat. In conclusion, without further information or context, it is not possible to establish a logical connection between \\"A little kid climbs a red mat on a festive carpet\\" and \\"A child is asleep.\\" The two statements, as they stand, describe separate and distinct scenarios that cannot be linked based solely on the information provided."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The flowers were always delivered to Victoria and not Megan, because","completion":"Victoria had a deep-rooted appreciation for the beauty and allure of flowers, cultivated from her early childhood years spent wandering through her grandmother's lush garden. This affinity for botanical delicacies was further strengthened by her innate understanding of the subtle, delicate language that each floral arrangement artfully communicated – a language that Megan, unfortunately, had neither the time nor inclination to learn. It seemed only fitting, then, that the flowers continued to find their rightful home in Victoria's tender embrace. Observed by an outsider, one might have even thought that the very flowers themselves appeared more vibrant and alive upon reaching Victoria's care, as though their ephemeral lives had gained renewed purpose. While some might attribute this phenomenon to mere coincidence or the whims of happenstance, those who knew Victoria well understood that her relationship with these floral tokens went far beyond the reach of human convention. In contrast, Megan approached life with a practical, no-nonsense attitude, leaving little room for the frivolity that she felt flowers often represented. Her priorities were firmly grounded in the tangible aspects of life, such as career success, financial stability, and a meticulous daily routine designed for maximum efficiency. While she couldn't deny the aesthetic appeal of a brilliantly arranged bouquet, Megan often struggled to see the inherent value in trading hard-earned currency for something with such a fleeting lifespan. Despite the marked differences in their individual values and outlooks on life, Victoria and Megan shared a bond that transcended those discrepancies. In many ways, their diverging perspectives intersected to create a harmonious balance – Victoria's penchant for finding joy in the details of life's natural beauty served to remind Megan of the importance of appreciating the quiet, simple moments, just as Megan's dedication to responsibility and pragmatism grounded Victoria when her whimsy threatened to carry her away entirely. Thus, in the grand tapestry of their intertwined lives, the continuous delivery of flowers to Victoria rather than Megan held a deeper significance, acting as a subtle nod to their unspoken understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses. By celebrating Victoria's ability to cherish the fleeting beauty of these delicate floral gifts – an art lost on Megan – they reaffirmed the value of those intricacies that made each of them who they were, and, ultimately, strengthened the cherished bond they shared."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How does The Chosen One train? Movie title: Kung Pow! Enter the Fist Movie plot: A man, called The Chosen One by the narrator, wanders from town to town to search for the man who killed his family and tried to kill him when he was a baby. In one town, he meets Master Tang, a very ill and slightly deranged sifu, and asks Tang to help him improve his already impressive martial arts ability. Master Tang is skeptical at first, but after seeing The Chosen One's mark (his sentient tongue, which he names Tonguey), he allows him to train at his dojo. The Chosen One is introduced to two other students: Wimp Lo, a young man who was deliberately trained incorrectly as a joke, and Ling, who has feelings for him. While training, The Chosen One shows cartoon-like feats of strength, and Wimp Lo deems him an enemy out of jealousy. Upon learning that Master Pain, the man who killed his parents, has just arrived in town, The Chosen One prepares to confront him. Master Pain draws a crowd and demonstrates his skills. He lets his henchmen kick him repeatedly in the groin, then subdues them all in one move. Impressed by Master Pain's skills, the town's mayor hires him, and he randomly changes his name to Betty. The Chosen One attempts to train himself by letting people kick him in the groin, but is knocked out after being hit. When he wakes up, a mysterious woman named Whoa warns him not to rush to fight Betty. After flirtily fighting The Chosen One, Whoa flies off into the sky. Ignoring the advice, The Chosen One sets off to find Betty. He comes across one of Betty's evil companions: Moo Nieu (pronounced \\"moon you\\"), a Holstein cow gifted in karate, with a large udder that can squirt milk as a weapon. They fight in a scene parodying The Matrix, and The Chosen One eventually incapacitates Moo Nieu by milking her until her udder is empty. He sees Betty at a waterfall and confronts him. Master Doe, Ling's Father, shows up and tries to stop the unprepared Chosen One, and is wounded by Betty. The Chosen One takes Master Doe to Master Tang; it turns out they are old friends. However, as Tang massages Doe's wound,... A:","completion":"The Chosen One trains mainly under Master Tang in his dojo. Initially, his training consists of improving his already impressive martial arts ability under the supervision and guidance of Master Tang. He gets to practice with other students, such as Wimp Lo and Ling, and showcases cartoon-like feats of strength during his training. However, The Chosen One also tries to train himself independently by mimicking some of the things he sees others do, like allowing people to kick him in the groin, which eventually only leads to him being knocked out. In addition, he is warned by the mysterious woman named Whoa not to rush into the fight against Betty, and she even engages him in a flirtatious fight, but he doesn't heed her advice and continues to seek Betty. The Chosen One also gains experience through the battles he encounters, like the one with Moo Nieu, where he learns to defeat his opponent by emptying her udder. In summary, The Chosen One trains through a combination of dojo training with Master Tang, independent practice, learning from encounters and experiences, and advice from other characters."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Both a modest homage to its writer and a melancholy look at a lost world. 3. Tati and Chomet are saying something complex but true here, testifying to the necessity of fakery while acknowledging that illusions can be cruel. The result is one beautiful movie -- and no less so for making a strong case that beauty is a lie. 4. A cliché-riddled nostalgia trip. 5. Touching, beautiful drama about the magic of friendship. 6. Although the plot is slight and the film's ending may polarize viewers (some will find it poignant while others may think it cynical), \\"The Illusionist\\" makes for enjoyable viewing as well as a loving tribute to a cinematic master. 7. If The Triplets of Belleville was a rollicking, proudly eccentric adventure, then The Illusionist is something much more bittersweet, a love letter to silent showmanship and a lament for its obsolescence on both stage and screen. 8. If 2-D animated films soon become relics, The Illusionist will be one of the final treasures of the art form. 9. From a technical perspective, Chomet's work is uncanny ... but [he] only captures the form of Tati without much of the function. 10. A return to the possibilities of animation as Fantasia, with its multiple tones, varied episodes and restless invention, timelessly realized. Summary:","completion":"The film under critique, seemingly \\"The Illusionist,\\" garners a sense of melancholic nostalgia and remembrance of a bygone era, with its aesthetic design and thematics paying tribute to the cinematic past while contributing to the bittersweet tone noted by several reviewers. As suggested in reviews one and two, the movie is appreciated as a 'mood piece' exuding a strong melancholic tone, providing a modest homage to its writer and offering a sorrowful view of a lost world. The unique approach taken by directors Tati and Chomet received commendation in the third review, with the implication that they delineate the paradox of necessary illusion, sometimes marked by cruelty. The movie, in achieving this feat, solidifies its position as a beautiful artistic piece, despite its underlining message questioning the authenticity of beauty. The fourth review critiques the movie for being oversaturated with clichés and overly nostalgic in its presentation. However, the fifth review steers away from this sentiment, focusing on the beautiful drama woven around the themes of friendship and magic. The sixth and seventh reviews highlight the film's role as a tribute, celebrating cinematic masters and the art of silent showmanship. They acknowledge a potential divide in audience opinion regarding the film's ending, hinting at the potential controversy regarding its viewpoint on pessimism and cynicism. A few reviews suggest that the movie can be seen as a final testament to the art form of 2-D animation, thus, positioning \\"The Illusionist\\" as a treasured piece of this soon-to-be obsolete medium. Not all reviews are in agreement, with the ninth review, in particular, critiquing Chomet's work for mimicking the form of Tati but failing to capture its function fully. Finally, the tenth review sees the film as a re-exploitation of the possibilities inherent in animation, likening its inventive approach to the classic 'Fantasia,' celebrated for its various tones, episodic layout, and timeless realization. Despite some critiques on its cliches and potential polarizing ending, \\"The Illusionist\\" is still largely regarded as a beautifully animated, bittersweet tribute to the cinematic past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

High-risk HPV types contribute to around 70% of cervical cancers. Therefore, this is a highly relevant option. <2> Endometrial cancer: While HPV has been detected in some cases of endometrial cancer, its role is not well-established, and the association is weaker than with cervical cancer. Thus, this option is less likely. <3> Ovarian cancer: There is minimal evidence supporting a strong association between HPV and ovarian cancer. The link between the two is not well-established, making this option less likely. <4> Breast cancer: Similar to endometrial and ovarian cancers, there isn't a strong and well-established association between HPV and breast cancer. Thus, it has less relevance compared to cervical cancer. <5> Burkitt lymphoma: This is a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and is not caused by HPV. It is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

Second question: What is wrong with genetically modified crops? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First, let me address whether the two questions are asking the same thing or not. While the questions are indeed quite similar, and both are related to potential issues surrounding genetically modified crops, there could be some nuances in how each question is approached. The first question, \\"What is so bad about genetically modified crops?\\" assumes that there is something inherently bad about genetically modified (GM) crops, while the second question, \\"What is wrong with genetically modified crops?\\" seems to be inquiring about the specific problems or issues with GM crops. Nonetheless, I will provide a detailed response addressing the concerns raised by both questions. Genetically modified crops have been a subject of debate for many years. Proponents of GM crops argue that they can help increase crop yields, improve resistance to pests and diseases, and contribute to global food security. On the other hand, critics raise various concerns including potential risks to human health, adverse environmental impacts, and socioeconomic issues. It's crucial to understand that assessing the potential negative implications of genetically modified crops isn't a straightforward process, as various factors determine their potential risks, including the specific traits engineered into the crops and the regulatory and management practices in place. 1. Human health concerns: Some critics argue that consuming genetically modified crops could have negative effects on human health. They mention potential allergic reactions, toxicity, and antibiotic resistance resulting from the insertion of new genes into various crops. However, numerous scientific studies and regulatory agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), have deemed genetically modified crops safe for human consumption after passing rigorous safety assessments. 2. Environmental impact: One of the main concerns regarding genetically modified crops is their potential to negatively impact the ecosystem and biodiversity. A key example lies in the development of pesticide-resistant crops, which has led to the emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds (also known as \\"superweeds\\") in some regions. Additionally, the use of pest-resistant GM crops may lead to the development of resistance in insects, rendering the crops ineffective in the long term. Critics also worry about the possibility of gene flow between GM crops and their wild relatives, which may result in the uncontrolled spreading of modified genes into the environment. Although most regulatory systems require containment measures to prevent gene flow, there's still the potential for unforeseen consequences. 3. Socioeconomic consequences: Genetically modified crops have raised concerns about the concentration of power and control in the hands of a few multinational corporations that develop, patent, and distribute GM seeds. These corporations often hold exclusive patents on their seeds, which may restrict farmers' choice and traditional practices of seed saving and trade. This could lead to a loss of agricultural diversity and make small-scale farmers reliant on a limited number of companies for their seeds. Furthermore, critics argue that genetically modified crops may lead to the overemphasis on a few high-yielding varieties, potentially reducing the variety of food crops available to consumers and farmers alike. Dependency on a narrow genetic base can make crops more vulnerable to diseases and pests, with potentially disastrous consequences for global food security. 4. Ethical and cultural considerations: Some people may have ethical or religious objections to consuming food derived from genetically modified organisms, based on personal values or cultural beliefs. For instance, modifying a plant's genetic makeup by introducing genes from animals may be considered unacceptable by some religious or cultural groups. It is worth noting that while these concerns are valid, GM crops may also offer some benefits, such as improved food security and reduced use of harmful chemical pesticides. Moreover, the issues associated with genetically modified crops could potentially be addressed by implementing stricter regulations, rigorous research and development, and enhanced transparency. Nevertheless, understanding and addressing the concerns surrounding genetically modified crops is crucial for making informed decisions as a society and weighing the potential benefits against the potential risks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Everything matters.\\" Does it follow that \\"Everything matters to me.\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"Everything matters\\" can be interpreted in various ways, depending on the context it is being used in. Generally, it implies that every aspect, element, or occurrence holds a certain level of significance, either individually or as part of a larger whole. However, this statement does not inherently imply that everything matters specifically to you or any one individual. To further examine how this statement applies to the notion of \\"Everything matters to me,\\" we must break it down into three different perspectives: personal, relational, and universal. 1. Personal perspective: From an individual point of view, the statement \\"Everything matters to me\\" implies that all aspects, variables, and events in life have a certain level of importance and impact on your personal experiences, thoughts, and emotions. It suggests that you recognize and embrace the interconnectedness of life and are open to learn, grow, and adapt from every experience or encounter. While this perspective fosters personal growth and promotes self-awareness, it is important to realize that not all individuals hold this belief. 2. Relational perspective: From a relational standpoint, the statement suggests that you value and acknowledge the importance of other people's experiences, thoughts, and feelings. This attitude encourages empathy, open-mindedness, and inclusiveness, fostering stronger relationships and a deeper understanding of the world and the people in it. However, this perspective still does not automatically imply that everything holds the same level of importance or impact for others as it does for you. 3. Universal perspective: From a broader, universal perspective, \\"Everything matters\\" communicates the idea that all aspects of existence, irrespective of time, space, or scale, are intrinsically intertwined and essential to the workings of the universe. This outlook emphasizes the interconnectedness and interdependence of all things and encourages a sense of unity, oneness, and collective responsibility. Nevertheless, while the notion of things intrinsically mattering in the universe might be true, it does not necessarily connote that everything matters to each individual in the same way. In conclusion, the statement \\"Everything matters\\" does not directly equate to \\"Everything matters to me.\\" The level of importance and impact that different aspects or events have on an individual's life may vary based on personal experiences, beliefs, and values. While embracing the idea that everything matters can lead to greater self-awareness, personal growth, and a more compassionate approach towards others, it is essential to remember that not everyone may share the same interpretation or indeed, everything might not matter equally to every person."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But I can definitely tell you about it in a simpler way. Using a sledgehammer would be like you using a much, much bigger version of your toy hammer. But instead of playing, people usually use it to break big things like walls or rocks. Here's how adults do it: 1. They start by standing with their feet apart, almost like they are ready to do a big jump! 2. They hold the sledgehammer with both hands, one hand at the top of the handle near their body, and other is near the bottom. 3. Then they lift the hammer over their shoulder just like you see in cartoons! 4. And then comes the fun part, they swing the hammer forward and hit the thing they want to break, just like hitting a piñata! But remember, even though it might seem fun, this is dangerous work and it should only be done by grown-ups when they're wearing the right safety equipment. You should never touch a sledgehammer without a grown-up with you, okay?"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Wealthy Londoners can now park their supercars in the city’s most exclusive area for just £2.30 a day - if they are willing to pay £85,000 for the spot. Three spaces in a car park on Park Lane in Mayfair, central London, have been put on the market on century-long leases for a combined £255,000. But despite the eye-watering price-tag, the parking spots in W1 work out considerably cheaper than if motorists wanted to pay per day. Pricey spot: Three spaces in this car park on Park Lane in Mayfair, central London, have been put on the market for a combined £255,000. Good value: Despite the eye-watering price-tag, the parking spots in W1 work out considerably cheaper than if motorists wanted to pay per day. It would normally cost £9 per hour, £49 for 24 hours or £3,600 for a 12-month parking ticket at the car park. These spaces work out at around £2.30 per day for the duration of the leases, which vary between 105 and 110 years. The spots, which cost the same as a new Porsche 911 and have 24-hour security, will pay for themselves in less than 23 years. They have also been described as an excellent investment with Mayfair parking in demand as more properties are returned to residential use. Shirley Humphrey, director at Harrods Estates, said: ‘Finding a secure and safe location to park your car in Mayfair is a rare find due to lack of space.

Translate to English","completion":"For the prudential supervision of the management company from section 2. The phrase \\"Za obezřetnostní dohled nad správcovskou společností od­ 2\\" is written in Czech. The translation to English highlights the importance of prudential supervision for the proper functioning of a management company. This supervision serves as a regulatory safeguard in order to ensure the stability, efficient operation, and ethical practices of the management company. Prudential supervision typically involves the oversight of financial institutions and organizations by national or international authorities. The main objective of this type of supervision is to maintain the integrity and stability of the financial system, as well as protecting investors, consumers, and the overall economy. In the context of a management company, prudential supervision encompasses a variety of duties and responsibilities. This can include monitoring the financial position, risk management processes, corporate governance, and business operations of the company. It also involves ensuring that the organization complies with all relevant regulatory requirements, laws, and standards. The role of prudential supervision in a management company is crucial because it helps to minimize risks and ensure the long-term viability and performance of the firm. A well-regulated financial system promotes investor confidence, fosters economic growth, and reduces the likelihood of financial crises and collapses. Some key aspects of prudential supervision in a management company include: 1. Capital adequacy: Ensuring that the management company maintains sufficient capital to absorb potential losses and continue its operations in the event of adverse market conditions or financial stress. 2. Risk management: Assessing and monitoring the company's risk profile, as well as ensuring that appropriate risk mitigation strategies, policies, and procedures are in place to manage and control risks effectively. 3. Corporate governance: Ensuring that the company adheres to strong corporate governance practices, including transparency, accountability, effective risk management, and a robust internal control system. 4. Compliance: Monitoring the company's compliance with regulatory requirements, reporting obligations, and standards of ethical conduct. 5. Financial reporting and disclosure: Ensuring that the organization provides accurate and timely financial information to regulators, investors, and other stakeholders to enable informed decision-making. 6. Prudential reporting and regulatory communication: Ensuring that the company maintains open lines of communication with regulatory authorities to facilitate ongoing monitoring and supervision, and to promptly address any concerns or issues that may arise. The reference to \\"section 2\\" in the translated phrase may suggest that this prudential supervision responsibility or guideline is part of a broader document, agreement, or regulatory framework. It is crucial for stakeholders, regulators, and management companies to understand and adhere to these prudential supervision requirements to maintain a safe and financially sound environment for all parties involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Sensing phantom phone vibrations is a strangely common experience. Around 80% of us have imagined a phone vibrating in our pockets when it's actually completely still. Almost 30% of us have also heard non-existent ringing. Are these signs of madness caused by digital culture? Not at all. In fact, phantom vibrations and ringing indicate a fundamental principle in psychology. Psychologists use a concept called Signal Detection Theory to guide their thinking about the problem of perceptual judgments. Working through the example of phone vibrations, we can see how this theory explains why they are a common and unavoidable part of healthy mental function. When your phone is in your pocket, the world is in one of two possible states: the phone is either ringing or not. You also have two possible states of mind: the judgment that the phone is ringing, or the judgment that it isn't. Obviously you'd like to match these states in the correct way. True vibrations should go with \\"it's ringing\\", and no vibrations should go with \\"it's not ringing\\". Signal detection theory calls these faithful matches a \\"hit\\" and a \\"correct rejection\\" But there are two other possible combinations: you could mismatch true vibrations with \\"it's not ringing\\" (a \\"miss\\"); or mismatch the absence of vibrations with \\"it's ringing\\" (a \\"false alarm\\"). This second kind of mismatch is what's going on when you imagine a phantom phone vibration. What does that mean in terms of your phone? We can assume that people like to notice when their phone is ringing, and that most people hate missing a call. This means their perceptual systems have adjusted their bias to a level that makes misses unlikely. The unavoidable cost is a raised likelihood of false alarms of phantom phone vibrations. The trade-off between false alarms and misses also explains why we all have to put up with fire alarms going off when there isn't a fire. It isn't that the alarms are badly designed, but rather that they are very sensible to smoke and heat and biased to avoid missing a real fire at all costs. The outcome is a rise in the number of false alarms. These are inconvenient, but nowhere near as inconvenient as burning to death in your bed or office. The alarms are designed to err on the side of caution. Question: The writer tries to explain phantom phone vibrations_.

It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters.

Don is sentenced to death and sent to prison, where he meets old rival Vardhaan (Boman Irani). He offers Vardhan a partnership, and they escape from prison after poisoning the other inmates. In Zurich Don meets trusted companion Ayesha (Lara Dutta), and they retrieve the contents of a locker accessible only by Vardhaan. In it is a tape of J.K. Diwan (Alyy Khan), vice-president of the Euro-printing DZB (Deutsche Zentral Bank), who was sent by Fabian Kohl to bribe Singhania (Rajesh Khattar) to kill a competitor; Singhania was killed by Vardhaan five years earlier. Don blackmails Diwan into giving him the bank's blueprints so he can steal the printing plates. Diwan misleads him and hires Jabbar (Nawab Shah), a deadly assassin. Don escapes, however, and baits Jabbar to working for him. With no other choice, Diwan gives Don the blueprints. Don and his team plan and execute a bank robbery, taking hostages. After stealing the printing plates he is betrayed by Vardhaan and Jabbar, but escapes. However, Sameer (a team member, played by Kunal Kapoor) calls the police and Don is arrested; he threatens Sameer for informing on him. Unable to enter the bank and free the hostages, the police are forced to work with Don in exchange for giving him German immunity. Don and Roma reach Vardhaan and Jabbar. When ordered by Vardhaan and Jabbar - and even Don himself - Roma is shot by Jabbar when she refuses to kill...

Q:SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Place a large pot onto a set of kitchen scales and set the display back to zero. Slowly scoop in or pour in your rendered animal fat until you have as close to 1 lb (450 g) as possible. Getting the measurements exactly right is crucial, as soap-making and glycerin making rely on a precise chemical reaction. Not having the right amount of fat can lead to caustic soap or glycerin that can be very harmful. If you want to alter the exact measurements for your own soap recipe and the type of fat you are using, look online for a soap making calculator. There are plenty that will allow you to enter the amount and types of fat you are using and give you precise instructions for the right ratios. In a separate jug or bowl, measure out 5 fluid ounces (150 ml) of room temperature water. Slowly add in 2 ounces (57 g) of lye, stirring constantly as you do so to incorporate it fully. Leave the lye and water mixture to react and cool down. The water and the lye will combine and create an exothermic reaction, meaning the mixture will heat up. You should always wear protective gloves and eyewear when working with lye, as it is a caustic substance that eats away at fat. If you get any lye on your skin, remove any clothing the lye may have touched and flush the skin with cold water for 15 minutes. Seek medical attention immediately. Lye may be available in the cleaning section of your local grocery store. It should be easily available online or at a specialty soap-making store. Use a candy or other food thermometer to check the temperature of your rendered animal fat. Place the pot over low heat to slowly bring the temperature up to 113 °F (45 °C) if it’s too cold, or leave it to cool down if the fat is too warm. Once it’s at the right temperature, remove it from any heat source. Keeping the temperatures exactly right will help the fat and the lye to combine properly, resulting in a smoother soap and clearer glycerin. With both the fat and the lye solution around 113 °F (45 °C), begin very slowly streaming the lye solution into the fat. Stir the solution in as you do, being careful not to splash the lye or get any on your skin. It may be easier to get someone to help you stir the fat while you pour in the lye. Work on a sturdy, flat surface so that you can continue stirring easily while the soap mixture thickens. Once the lye solution has been completely mixed into the fat, keep stirring in slow, regular motions. After around 15 minutes, the path of the spoon should remain visible in the soap mixture for a few seconds. This is known as tracing and is a sign that your soap mixture has thickened and is ready. Rather than stirring by hand, you could use an electric mixer or a stick blender to combine the lye and fat. Start at a low speed to avoid splashing the mixture around too much.","completion":"Okay, let me make it simple for you. When making soap, you need a big pot on a scale to weigh about 1 pound of animal fat. Measure everything carefully because it's important for soap and glycerin to work well. You can find help online for the right measurements. Next, mix water and lye in a separate bowl. Be super careful with lye, it can hurt your skin. If lye gets on your skin, wash it with cold water and get help from a doctor. You can find lye at the store or online. Now, check the fat's temperature and make sure it's 113 degrees Fahrenheit. When the fat and lye solution are both at the right temperature, slowly pour the lye into the fat while stirring. Mix it well until it becomes thicker. Then your soap mixture is ready! Using an electric mixer can also help with mixing. Just remember to always be careful and ask an adult for help."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Fact 2: Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What increases ultraviolet light?\\" with the following options: - heating liquids - clouds - smog - emissions - less ozone - gravity - sun's heat - photons A:","completion":"The correct answer to the question \\"What increases ultraviolet light?\\" given the two facts listed is less ozone. Let me explain this in more detail. Fact 1 states that ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. This means that as the ozone layer thins, more ultraviolet (UV) radiation can penetrate Earth's atmosphere, which leads to various environmental and health issues. Fact 2 states that ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation. Ozone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms (O3) and is found primarily in Earth's stratosphere. The ozone layer acts as a natural shield, protecting life on Earth from the harmful effects of UV radiation. Ozone molecules absorb the UV radiation, preventing most of it from reaching the surface of our planet. Given both facts and the options provided, we can conclude that \\"less ozone\\" is the most accurate answer. Now, I'll give you a brief explanation of each option and explain why they don't increase ultraviolet light: - Heating liquids: Heating liquids doesn't have a direct impact on UV radiation. Heated liquids may emit thermal radiation, but they do not increase UV levels in the atmosphere. - Clouds: Clouds can reflect, absorb, or scatter UV radiation, but generally, they do not significantly increase UV levels. Instead, they can sometimes lower the UV radiation reaching the surface depending on cloud thickness and other factors. - Smog: Smog can sometimes have a slight impact on UV radiation by scattering or absorbing it, but it is not a primary factor that leads to an increase in UV levels. - Emissions: Emissions indirectly contribute to less ozone by increasing greenhouse gases and creating an environment where ozone depletion may occur. However, emissions alone do not directly lead to an increase in UV radiation. - Gravity: Gravity does not have a direct relationship with UV radiation levels. It is a fundamental force that governs the interaction of matter but does not directly contribute to UV levels. - Sun's heat: UV radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is produced by the sun, but sun's heat (thermal energy) does not directly lead to an increase in UV radiation. - Photons: Photons are particles of light, including UV radiation, but they are a result of UV radiation and not a cause. In summary, given the two facts and the options provided, less ozone is the primary factor that increases ultraviolet light, as it allows for more UV radiation to reach the Earth's surface. The other factors listed do not directly lead to a significant increase in UV levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Possible A: relaxation, exhaustion, energetic, become stronger, use energy Why is \\"exhaustion\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"Exhaustion as an answer aligned with human common sense is rooted in the general understanding of how physical activity affects the human body in the short term. When an individual engages in exercise, their muscles, cardiovascular system, and respiratory system are all subjected to increased demands. The human body, in turn, responds by delivering necessary resources, such as oxygen and nutrients, to meet these demands. As a result, various physiological and biochemical processes take place, which can ultimately lead to the feeling of exhaustion. Several factors contribute to making exhaustion a logical, common-sense answer to the question, as detailed below. 1. Energy expenditure: Exercise involves the expenditure of energy, which is stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in our cells. During physical activity, ATP is broken down to provide the necessary energy for muscle contractions. As the intensity and duration of exercise increase, the body relies more heavily on its energy stores. Consequently, the depletion of ATP and other energy substrates can lead to the sensation of tiredness or exhaustion. 2. Muscle fatigue: Exercising activates specific muscle groups, which contract repeatedly during the activity. Prolonged muscle contractions cause the accumulation of metabolic byproducts, such as lactate, hydrogen ions, and inorganic phosphate in the muscle tissue. These byproducts contribute to muscle fatigue, which manifests as a reduced capacity for muscle force production. In other words, muscles feel weaker and less able to perform effectively, resulting in overall exhaustion. 3. Cardiovascular and respiratory adaptations: The human body must adapt quickly to the increased oxygen and nutrient demands of exercise. The heart pumps more blood, the blood vessels dilate, and the respiratory rate escalates to facilitate the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to working muscles. While these adaptations ensure that the body can meet the increased demands of physical activity, they can also be perceived in the form of elevated heart rate, heavy breathing, and, ultimately, exhaustion. 4. Central nervous system fatigue: Exercise affects not only the muscles but also the central nervous system. Prolonged or intense exercise can lead to the overstimulation of certain neurotransmitters, affecting cognitive functions and contributing to the feeling of tiredness or exhaustion. 5. Psychological exhaustion: Exercising can also be mentally taxing, as individuals need to concentrate, coordinate, and motivate themselves through challenging physical activities. The mental exertion required during exercise might lead to psychological fatigue, which can contribute to the overall sensation of exhaustion. 6. Recovery period: Lastly, it is essential to note that the body needs time to recover from exercise. After a workout, muscles, joints, and connective tissues need time to rest, repair, and adapt or grow stronger. Without sufficient recovery time, an individual may experience persistent exhaustion as they consistently engage in exercise without giving their body adequate time to recuperate. In conclusion, exhaustion is an answer to the question, \\"What does exercising immediately lead to?\\" grounded in human common sense because it is a natural and expected outcome of physical activity. The physiological, biomechanical, and psychological aspects of exercise ultimately contribute to the sensation of exhaustion at various levels, making it a relatable and sensible response. However, it is important to note that the degree and timing of exhaustion may vary depending on the individual, the type of exercise, and the intensity and duration of the activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Associated Press Reporter PUBLISHED: 00:00 EST, 26 December 2012 | UPDATED: 12:33 EST, 27 December 2012 While the U.S. stares over the 'fiscal cliff' and 536 billion in tax increases for all Americans, President Obama and the House of Representatives have been accused of acting like kindergarten students engaged in a dangerous dare of 'who goes first'. President Obama returned to Washington D.C. after cutting short his Christmas vacation and the Senate is going back into session, but the Republican ruled House is still out on recess as the deadline of January 1st looms that could damage a still fragile recovery. House Republican leaders on Wednesday said they remain ready to negotiate, but urged the Senate to consider or amend a OPTIONS: - Americans-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Associated Press-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Capitol-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Christmas-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Congress-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Hawaii-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - House-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - House of Representatives-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Obama-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Republican-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Senate-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Timothy Geithner-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - U.S.-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Washington D.C.-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates.","completion":"Correct Answer(s): - House-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - House of Representatives-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. Explanation: The correct answers are \\"House-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates\\" and \\"House of Representatives-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates\\" because the House of Representatives (also simply known as the House) is where bills of this nature would originate. The other choices are wrong because these entities (like individuals, locations, and other organizations) do not pass bills. In the U.S., bills are typically crafted and passed by legislative bodies such as the House of Representatives and the Senate. For instance, individuals such as President Obama or Timothy Geithner can suggest or endorse bills, but they can't pass them. Locations like Hawaii and Washington D.C. or organizations like Associated Press also don't pass bills. So remember, just like when we play a game, we have rules, same way in the government, only certain groups, like the House, can make these official rules or 'bills'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.) In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance... contains an answer for the question: What was the first name of the daughter of the man who premiered a stream of \\"desk drawer\\" works in 1953?, what is it ?

Read this and answer the question The path to independence for the white colonies of the British Empire began with the 1839 Durham Report, which proposed unification and self-government for Upper and Lower Canada, as a solution to political unrest there. This began with the passing of the Act of Union in 1840, which created the Province of Canada. Responsible government was first granted to Nova Scotia in 1848, and was soon extended to the other British North American colonies. With the passage of the British North America Act, 1867 by the British Parliament, Upper and Lower Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were formed into the Dominion of Canada, a confederation enjoying full self-government with the exception of international relations. Australia and New Zealand achieved similar levels of self-government after 1900, with the Australian colonies federating in 1901.

Some of our preferences are clearly psychological.Dark blue is the color of the night sky and therefore connected with calm, while yellow is a day color connected with energy and encouragement.Experiments have shown that colors, partly because they are connected with psychology, also have a direct effect on people's mind.People in bright red surroundings show an increase in breathing speed, heartbeat and blood pressure.Red is exciting.Pure blue has exactly the opposite effect; it is a calming color.Being exciting, red was chosen as the signal for danger, but a closer study shows that a bright yellow can produce a more basic state of alarm, so fire engines in some advanced areas are now rushing around in bright yellow colors that stop buses, trucks and cars.

So many kids, so many stories. Parents die, leaving kids devastated and unable to speak for days. Parents get deported, leaving kids despondent and hopeless. Children endure emotional, sexual, physical abuse. And more. The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters. After going around and around for a while with me and the principal, her mother said that her divorce had really affected this girl, and she had been fighting so hard all her life to get into Berkeley, and what did I have against her daughter? She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went. This young woman full of potential and energy, learned from her mother and my boss, that excuses rule the day.

Sentence: \\"John put books in the box.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"John put books in the box\\" to be acceptable linguistically. This evaluation is based on several factors, including syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Let's analyze each of these aspects to understand why the sentence is deemed linguistically acceptable. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence to create well-formed sentences in a language. In English, the general syntax of sentences often follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. In the given sentence, \\"John\\" is the subject, \\"put\\" is the verb, and \\"books\\" is the object. The prepositional phrase \\"in the box\\" provides additional information about where the action took place. Hence, the sentence adheres to the standard rules of English word order and appears syntactically well-formed. 2. Semantics: Semantics pertains to the meanings behind words, phrases, and sentences. The sentence \\"John put books in the box\\" conveys a clear and coherent idea—that the individual named John performed the action of putting books inside a box. Each word serves a specific purpose and carries an explicit meaning within the context of the sentence. As a result, the sentence is semantically acceptable. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics refers to the study of language in terms of its use and context, as well as its inferred meaning in different situations. The sentence \\"John put books in the box\\" can be easily understood in various contexts, such as moving to a new house, organizing a room, or packing up items. It is a straightforward sentence that does not require extensive contextual information to process its meaning. Therefore, it meets the criteria for pragmatic acceptability. In conclusion, a linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"John put books in the box\\" as acceptable linguistically due to its well-formed syntax, clear semantics, and understandable pragmatics. The sentence complies with the basic rules of the English language and conveys a coherent, situationally adaptable message."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Context: The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it’s because they’re just so easy to use. I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish.

MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. Question: What does the narrator most likely think that MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil should do with the plum color she bought? Answer: Choose your answer from: -Make it more pigmented and less shiny -Reformulate it to have more pearl in the color like it's advertised to have -Create a strictly plum color and a strictly pearl color -not enough information The answer is:","completion":"Reformulate it to have more pearl in the color like it's advertised to have."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails. There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University. Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails. 1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break. 2.Horizontal lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration. 3. Vertical lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging. 4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid. 5. Kidney and liver problems can create \\"half-and-half nails\\", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick. Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. “What was your worst makeup disaster?” Do fingernails count? I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening. So much for my attempt at appearing “classy” and “sophisticated”…. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Available options: 1). yes; 2). it is not possible to tell; 3). no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first one, we need to analyse if the information in the second sentence can be deduced from the first one. Sentence 1: \\"And I just don't like that\\" Sentence 2: \\"I really do not enjoy that.\\" Both sentences express a similar sentiment of disliking or not enjoying something. In Sentence 1, \\"And I just don't like that\\" shows a negative emotion towards something unspecified. Here, the dislike could imply a range of emotions from a mild distaste to a strong aversion. Similarly, Sentence 2, \\"I really do not enjoy that\\" also indicates a negative feeling towards something non-specific. The phrase \\"do not enjoy\\" could also cover a variety of negative thoughts or feelings, from mild dislike to strong aversion. So, even though the expressions of their sentiment differ slightly, the second sentence expresses the same general idea contained within the first – the speaker has a negative emotion towards something. Therefore, it can be said that the second sentence is entailed by the first one. The appropriate response would be: 1) Yes.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there.

The other options provided do not logically relate to the necessary actions a child must take to go outside. Here's why: - \\"Distracting\\": This option does not make sense in the context of going outside, as it refers to drawing attention away from something or someone. It does not relate to the physical action needed to exit a house. - \\"Wonder about\\": This option refers to thinking or pondering, which is not a required action for a child to go outside. Wondering about something does not directly lead to the act of exiting a house. - \\"Take shoes off\\": This option is actually counterintuitive. Generally, kids put on shoes before going outside to protect their feet and keep them clean. Taking off shoes does not help them go outside; instead, it prepares them to stay indoors. - \\"Become adults\\": This option is irrelevant because becoming an adult is not a prerequisite for going outside.

Answer the following question: - The blood travels into the neophrons - Waste is expelled via the neophrons - The waste goes to the bladder in the form of urine - The clean blood exits the kidneys. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process is the transportation of blood into the kidneys. This is facilitated by the renal arteries, which branch off from the abdominal aorta and carry oxygenated blood rich in waste products towards the kidneys. In order to understand this process, it is essential to comprehend the overall function of the kidneys and their role in maintaining the body's balance and health. The primary function of the kidneys is to filter waste products, excess water, and electrolytes from the bloodstream, which then form urine. This filtration process is essential for maintaining the body's proper chemical balance, blood volume, and blood pressure. In more depth, when the oxygen-rich blood enters the kidneys through the renal arteries, it first passes through a network of tiny blood vessels called the glomerulus. The glomerulus is part of a functional unit within the kidneys known as the nephron. Each kidney possesses millions of nephrons that work in parallel to filter the blood, remove waste products, and reabsorb useful substances back into the bloodstream. As the blood flows through the glomerulus, it is under high pressure, which forces small molecules, waste products, and excess water to be pushed out of the blood and into the Bowman's capsule, another component of the nephron. This filtrate, composed of water, glucose, amino acids, ions, and urea, then travels down the renal tubule. During its passage through the renal tubule, the filtrate undergoes several processes, including reabsorption and secretion. Essential substances like glucose, amino acids, and ions are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream, while other substances like hydrogen ions and drugs are secreted into the filtrate to be excreted. This process ensures that only the waste products and unneeded substances are expelled from the body. As the filtrate continues its course, it gradually becomes more concentrated, and excess water is reabsorbed, turning it into what we commonly know as urine. This urine then travels through the collecting ducts of each nephron, which ultimately merges to form the renal pelvis. From the renal pelvis, urine flows down the ureters and into the urinary bladder, where it is stored until it is eventually expelled from the body during urination. In summary, the first step of the process is the transportation of oxygen-rich blood loaded with waste products into the kidneys via the renal arteries. This step initiates the crucial filtration and urine formation processes that ultimately maintain the body's chemical balance, blood volume, and blood pressure."},{"prompt":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A young man, David (Whannell), is in an interrogation room talking to an unnamed, unsympathetic police officer (Paul Moder).

He founded two newspapers: one for the troops in his army and another for circulation in France. The royalists attacked Bonaparte for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator. All told, Napoleon's forces extracted an estimated 45 million in funds from Italy during their campaign there, another 12 million in precious metals and jewels; atop that, his forces confiscated more than three-hundred priceless paintings and sculptures. Bonaparte sent General Pierre Augereau to Paris to lead a coup d'état and purge the royalists on 4 September—Coup of 18 Fructidor. This left Barras and his Republican allies in control again but dependent on Bonaparte, who proceeded to peace negotiations with Austria. These negotiations resulted in the Treaty of Campo Formio, and Bonaparte returned to Paris in December as a hero. He met Talleyrand, France's new Foreign Minister—who later served in the same capacity for Emperor Napoleon—and they began to prepare for an invasion of Britain.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from the following. (a). no. (b). yes.","completion":"(b). yes. These two questions are indeed asking the same thing: the visual capability of cockroaches. They both seek an understanding of how well cockroaches can see. To address this inquiry, it is essential to consider the structure and function of a cockroach's eyes, as they play a crucial role in their vision. Cockroaches are insects belonging to the order Blattodea. They possess compound eyes, which are a common feature among insects. These eyes consist of several individual photoreceptor units called ommatidia. With hundreds of ommatidia covering the surface of their eyes, cockroaches can gather information about their environment and detect movement. Although cockroaches can see, their vision is significantly different from that of humans. Cockroach eyes are adapted to perceive light and movement rather than focusing on detailed images. Their eyes are more sensitive to light in comparison to human eyes, which enables them to function well in low-light conditions. This is an important adaptation for these nocturnal creatures, as they are more active during the night and often inhabit dark spaces. Cockroaches can see in a wider range than humans, thanks to their convex-shaped eyes. Besides providing a panoramic view of their surroundings, their compound eyes also allow them to detect rapid movements. This feature is essential for their survival, as it helps them to quickly escape from potential predators or dangers. In summary, cockroaches can see relatively well for their specific needs and environmental conditions. Their compound eyes provide them with excellent light sensitivity, wide-range detection, and rapid movement recognition. Despite their limited ability to perceive detailed images, their eyes offer them powerful adaptations for navigating and surviving in their environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One girl in our class always made fun of me because my dad was a plumber and hers was a lawyer , and she would say things like, \\"Ew, that's gross !\\" I must admit I was sometimes embarrassed by what my dad did, especially in my early teens, when the only thing I really cared about was what the other girls thought.

Her father, the lawyer called every plumber in the Yellow Page, but nobody would come and because we were having a major snowstorm. Her daughter told him that my father was a plumber, and he called, and my dad went right over---and took me with him.(Maybe he was hoping that the lawyer's daughter would be nicer to me.)

We've been to this Fleming's on several occasions, and tonight seemed to be a continuation of the progression downhill for this restaurant, in my opinion. We decided to make this a family of four dinner, bringing our 10 and 12 year olds. Obviously, we tried to stick with steak at this steak house. We came at opening, about 5pm, arriving at 4:50. They did have us wait until they were ready at 5pm, and that's okay. The opening, though, plays a big part later in this review. We stuck with water, as you can run up a really high bill very quickly. Our orders were taken late (about 15 minute wait) because we had not ordered drinks, and the waiters were busy brining out wine, etc, to the other tables. The bread was fresh, but the butter was not. It was dried out, like it had been frozen, and we were served the freezer burnt butter. I asked for the Crab Cake appetizer to be brought out at the same time as everyone else's plate. This was screwed up, and was brought out early. So everyone else had to watch me eat. I was having this as a \\"small plate\\" dish. The boys had the specials, which were a petite filet mignon along with 3 scallops. We asked for medium--they were undercooked, more along the lines of rare to medium-rare. The scallops were well cooked, but a little bland. The 10 year old did not like them, and he usually really enjoys seafood. I added on the Chipotle Cheddar Macaroni and Cheese for the kids, which they liked, along with Half and Half, which is shoestring fries with Onion Rings, both tasted okay. My wife had the Double Thick Pork Rib Chop. The sauce was very tasty, BUT the pork was underdone, and was visibly raw in the middle. This was unacceptable. We had to send the plate back, which was put under the broiler, and then brought back to us. I have to say this is the second time in a row that my wife's meat was raw at this Fleming's. I would've chalked it up to oven not being hot enough for the first dishes, but this seems to be a recurrent problem. I had a small plate, the Sliced Filet Mignon, which is served on Risotto. The meat was very well done, but the risotto was completely dried out and tasteless. I was very disappointed. As it took about another 10-15 minutes between when our plates were taken away and our waiter came with the dessert menu, we had decided to skip dessert and coffee and make our way to Starbucks, about two buildings away. I'm willing to forgive the delays due to them just opening up. Plus, it was Veteran's Day. However, the food being underprepared for the second time in a row is unforgivable, especially for as expensive a restaurant as Fleming's is. This is really starting to feel like a \\"chain\\" restaurant as it really is rather than an exclusive steak restaurant, which they strive to be. Overall, I think we're done with Fleming's.","completion":"The sentiment of the given review is negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction with their dining experience at Fleming's, citing various issues they encountered during their visit.

Summarize: When buying some Calpol in a large pharmacy chain, the poster said she had discovered, to her \\"amazement\\" that \\"if you register your details under the 'minor ailments scheme', all medicines etc for children are free\\". She added: \\"They are not allowed to advertise it, but you can save a small fortune on Calpol, Piriton, Sudocrem, plasters etc. I wish I had known eight years ago!\\" So, is it true? For a start, pharmacists would not prescribe Calpol. In some areas, they might give you the generic, unbranded equivalent, which is much cheaper and therefore less costly to the NHS. Plasters are not on the list of hand-outs either. Dressings for minor burns perhaps - but not children's plasters. So let's rewind a little. What help can pharmacists offer when it comes to common health problems? The \\"minor ailments scheme\\" provides the answer. It has been around for about 10 years in some local pharmacies. It is aimed at those who can't afford to pay for certain medicines or who can't access their GP easily. The idea is that local pharmacists take some of the pressure off busy GPs and packed A&E departments, by offering over-the-counter advice and consultations. This is particularly useful when GP practices are closed, in the evenings and at weekends, when pharmacies are often open. The scheme should enable people to get treatment or advice more quickly and more easily. The type of ailments they can treat may include coughs, colds, headaches, hay fever, insect bites and stings, eczema, earache and diarrhoea. So if you have a child with a high temperature on a Saturday afternoon (when else?), you can visit your local pharmacist to seek advice. The pharmacist will need to see the child, of course, and will then decide if prescribing a medicine is necessary. If you're elderly and worried about what you can safely take for a cold with other prescription medicines, then your pharmacist should also be the first port of call. The rules on paying for what's prescribed are not always straightforward. In general, if you don't pay for prescriptions - and children under 16 and adults over 60 don't - you will probably receive them free of charge, on the NHS, just as you would from a GP. If you normally pay a prescription charge, then you will be charged for this service too. But this doesn't apply to all minor ailment schemes, because they are not all the same across the country. In Scotland, all community pharmacies run the scheme, but in England, Wales and Northern Ireland the scheme is run by the NHS locally, so it won't be available everywhere. Some areas only provide the service free to parents who receive low-income related benefits. Other NHS areas may not fund dressings or provide anything for children who present with coughs and colds. To find out what your local scheme offers, it is advisable to contact your nearest pharmacy and ask. Neal Patel, from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, says people shouldn't get carried away. \\"You can't just walk into a pharmacy and stock up on Calpol for your kids. That's not the way it works.\\" Pharmacists, he says, have to make sure the treatment is appropriate, following a consultation similar to one carried out by a GP. If pharmacists aren't sure what they are dealing with or if a patient has a more serious concern, they will be referred to their GP. Ash Soni, a pharmacist in Streatham, south London, who runs the scheme in his pharmacy, said he often acts as kind of patient filter for GPs. \\"It's an opportunity for people to just walk in on the day and see a pharmacist for advice, rather than waiting for a GP appointment.\\" But he isn't there to hand out medicines, he explains. \\"You'll get it only if you need it.\\" In case the public is unsure what the minor ailment service is, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) has produced an animated video to explain more. The NHS Choices website has more information on common problems your pharmacist can help with and a way of searching for pharmacies in your local area to find out if they offer the service. The minor ailments scheme is clearly not widely known about because these web pages have experienced a massive rise in hits in the past week or so. NHS Choices told the BBC that the search term \\"minor ailments scheme\\" went from being outside the top 10,000 to the fifth most popular in the space of a few days. And research suggests the scheme, if rolled out nationally, could save the NHS in the region of Â£1bn. This is because the cost of a consultation with a GP is nearly three times higher than the cost of a consultation with a community pharmacist. So as long as the scheme is not abused and we use the pharmacists' service responsibly, the permanently cash-strapped NHS should benefit in the long run. Summary:","completion":"The \\"minor ailments scheme\\" is a service offered in some local pharmacies, aimed at those who are struggling to afford certain medications or have trouble accessing their doctor. By offering consultations and over-the-counter advice, pharmacists are able to alleviate pressure on GPs and emergency departments. The scheme is not available in all areas, with its implementation varying across Scotland, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Local pharmacies are the best point of contact to find out about what minor ailment schemes are accessible in a particular region. Pharmacists are able to provide consultation to those needing treatment or advice quickly and easily for ailments that include colds, coughs, bug bites, headaches, and eczema. However, it is important to remember that the pharmacists will only supply medication if deemed necessary after a consultation. Overall, if used responsibly, the minor ailments scheme could save the National Health Service a significant amount of money in the long term."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Light-emitting diode Among the challenges being faced to improve the efficiency of LED-based white light sources is the development of more efficient phosphors. As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor, with less than 10% Stoke shift loss. Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re-absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another 10% to 30% of efficiency loss. Currently, in the area of phosphor LED development, much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and higher operation temperatures. For instance, the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor.

Given the following context: John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert.

Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: I.Q. Movie plot: During the film opening, we see a man, presumably Einstein (Walter Mathau) playing a violin, as another man walks past a poster advertising Boyd's comet. We then see Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) with her fiance James Moreland (Stephen Fry). She's working on some math referring to the comet. He comments that she's babbling when she tries to tell him a story. The scene cuts back and forth with a group of elderly men arguing about whether time exists. Meg and James are in his convertible when it develops engine trouble. We see Einstein discussing with his friends (the elderly men), whether there are 'accidents' and he says, \\"I do not believe God plays dice with the universe.\\"Catherine and James pull into a garage, where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) is arguing with his boss, Bob (Tony Shalhoub), about the car they hear coming into the shop, what make and model it is and what the trouble with it is, based on what they can hear. Bob sends out Ed to check because he sees the couple and assumes they're \\"college people\\" meaning they come from Princeton College. As soon as Ed sees Catherine, he falls for her.James, obnoxiously asks if someone there can work on a British engine, and Ed says, \\"May I look under the bonnet?\\" James, reassured by the use of the word 'bonnet' consents. Ed looks at it, looks at Catherie and pronounces, \\"You have no spark.\\" There's clearly a double meaning here, referring to her relationship with James. James insists, \\"But what's wrong with it?\\" and Ed adds, \\"My guess is that you have a short stroke and premature ignition.\\" He turns to Meg Ryan and says, \\"Does it ever feel that way?\\" She replies, \\"I'm sure I don't know what you mean\\" but it's clear that she gets the double entendre. Ed says he'll go check with his boss about fixing it, and goes in to tell his boss that he's in love, that time and space stopped, that he could see himself kissing Catherine in the future. Ed tells Catherine that fixing the car will take days, and she uses his phone to call a cab, giving the cab company and Ed her address... My question: Who does Ed see his future with?

PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\". Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\" King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and \\"added too much singing\\". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: \\"There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me personally.

A study of 14,000 women concluded that those who drink in moderation were far more likely to reach 70 in good health than heavier drinkers or abstainers. Spreading consumption over the week is better than saving it for the weekend, the researchers say. Women who drank little and often fared better than occasional drinkers. Compared with non-drinkers, women in their mid-50s who drank 15-30g of alcohol (one to two drinks) a day had a 28% greater likelihood of achieving what the US researchers call \\"successful ageing\\", meaning good general health free of conditions like cancer, diabetes and heart disease in their 70s and beyond. And women who drank on 5-7 days of the week had almost double the chance of good overall health in old age compared with complete abstainers. Experts are not sure whether it is the alcohol itself that is conferring the benefit or whether it simply goes hand in hand with other things in the lives of the women that makes them healthier. The Harvard School of Public Health researchers said they tried to control for factors like smoking that might have affected the results. Other studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption - no more than the recommended two to three units a day for women in the UK - is linked with a lower risk of heart disease and some other health conditions. And research has shown alcohol can have a positive impact in the body, reducing insulin resistance, inflammation, high cholesterol and other harmful processes. However, drinking has been linked to other conditions, such as breast cancer. Experts welcomed the findings, saying they supported current recommendations concerning alcohol limits. Natasha Stewart of the British Heart Foundation said: \\"Moderate amounts of alcohol may offer some protection against heart disease, especially for women who have gone through the menopause, but it's very important not to go overboard. \\"Drinking too much doesn't offer any heart health protection at all and may actually lead to heart muscle damage, stroke and high blood pressure. And if you don't already drink alcohol, there is certainly no need to start now. \\"Clearly there are much better ways to look after your heart than drinking alcohol, like eating a healthy, balanced diet, getting active and by not smoking.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"This is about a study that looked at how drinking alcohol affects women's health as they get older. The study found that women who had a little bit of alcohol, like one or two drinks a day, were more likely to be in good health at age 70 and beyond than women who didn't drink at all or drank too much. It's better to drink a little bit every day rather than drinking a lot on the weekends. Researchers are not sure if it's the alcohol itself that makes the women healthier or if it's other things in their lives. Some experts say that drinking a little bit of alcohol can be good for your heart, but it's important not to drink too much, which can cause health problems. It's still better to take care of your heart by eating healthy, exercising, and not smoking."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both Time and Vulture highly recommend you check out Thank the Academy, an addictive website from grad student Rebecca Rolfe, who analyzed 207 acceptance speeches from actors and directors in order to come up with pretty much everything you could ever want to know about thank-you speech trends. Highlights: Average speech length has skyrocketed to nearly two minutes. It used to be just 44 seconds for men, 39 seconds for women. And the speeches given with notes are longer (2 minutes, 2 seconds on average) than those given without (1 minute, 23 seconds on average). Just 3% of directors cry while accepting their awards, while 21% of actors do. The trend started recently, with 71% of the tears happening since 1995. As for what to do with the statuette while you're busy talking, 26% of men hoist it over their heads and 47% of women clutch it with both hands. Just one person, Jack Palance, laid his on the podium while speaking. And as for who to thank, 61% thank production reps; 48% thank family; and 40% thank the Academy. The most-thanked person (other than God) is Harvey Weinstein, who has a dozen thank-yous to his name. Find out much, much more at Rolfe's website.

The website is called Thank the Academy, and it's really cool. A smart lady named Rebecca Rolfe, who is a grad student (that means she's studying a lot at school), made it. What she did was look at 207 speeches that actors and directors made when they won their Oscars. She wanted to find out lots and lots about the speeches they gave when saying thank-you. Wow! She came up with a bunch of fun facts. The average length of these speeches is almost two minutes now. Before, they used to be only 44 seconds for men and 39 seconds for women. That's like the time it takes to brush your teeth! She also found out that speeches where people read from notes are longer (about 2 minutes and 2 seconds) than those where people speak without notes (about 1 minute and 23 seconds). So, using notes is like someone telling a longer bedtime story! Another neat thing Rebecca noticed was that only 3% of directors cry when they get their awards, while 21% of actors do. And a lot of these crying moments started around 1995. If that statuette (that's the name for the Oscar award) gets heavy while they're talking, 26% of men lift it over their heads and almost half the women hold it with both their hands. Only one person, Jack Palance, ever put his statuette on the table while he spoke. And guess who people thank the most in their speeches? Well, other than thanking God, they often thank a man named Harvey Weinstein, as well as people who helped make the movie (that's 61% of the time), their family (48% of the time), and the Academy (40% of the time).

Answer the following question: Given the below context: Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher... Guess a valid title for it!

First, let's add 10 * p to both sides of the equation to move all the 'p' terms to the right side: -10 * p + 10 * p = 3 * p + 10 * p This simplifies to: 0 = 13 * p - 91 Now, we need to get rid of the 91. So, let's add 91 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 91 = 13 * p - 91 + 91 This simplifies to: 91 = 13 * p Lastly, to find the value of 'p', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 13: 91 / 13 = (13 * p) / 13 This simplifies to: 7 = p So, the answer is p = 7."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They have released two studio albums, St. Elsewhere (2006) and The Odd Couple (2008). St. Elsewhere was recorded on the Warner Music UK label, and contained their hit single \\"Crazy\\" which topped at number two on the US Hot 100, and topped the charts in the UK. It was also nominated at the 2007 Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, and was platinum certified for shipping over 1,000,000 records. In early March 2008, the duo's second album, The Odd Couple, was leaked over the internet prompting the duo to push the release date up from April 8. In an interview with Entertainment Magazine, Danger Mouse said that he \\"knew it [the leak] was coming...every day, I expected to get a call saying it leaked, and eventually I got a call saying it leaked.\\" On March 18, 2008, the album became available via download on the iTunes Store and Amazon MP3. Hard copies of the album were released on March 25. Prior to its official release, Green spoke to the album's anti-formulaic qualities, noting bluntly that \\"there's no formula to it,\\" and that to expect the same wild success of St. Elsewhere is to neglect the ever-present \\"risk factor in any artistic endeavor.\\" He called it something of an \\"act of faith\\" - a true, earnest attempt to create and disseminate a piece of art to those who would seek out its conception.

Explanation: Using a plunger involves dealing with water and possibly other bathroom wastes. A plastic grocery bag is a better choice than a paper bag because it is water-resistant and won't easily leak or tear if it gets wet. On the other hand, a paper bag absorbs water and can easily tear when wet, potentially leading to a mess on the floor which would defeat the initial purpose of keeping the floor clean. Therefore, the best solution to keep the floor clean is to sit the plunger in a grocery bag."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

For starters, I would like to say that I'm a fan of the American Pie series. Even though 'the naked mile' and this one are the two worst, this one seems to be the downfall of the whole series. First of all, the best part of the film was that it was an American Pie film, which is always appreciated. However, there are tonnes of bad things to say about this film. First of all, the story has a very stale 'arc' structure. First, there is the introduction of the characters, then the pledging of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each of which has exactly 25 minutes of length. Apart from the general staleness of the plot, there is little to no character development, which makes a double whammy of a bad plot. Apart from that, I deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film. That is, showing the jocks as the extremely cool, only-thinking-about-sex guys, and explicitly displaying the geeks as inferior. Also, it shows females only as sexual objects, and males as only wanting to treat the females as sexual objects. Apart from that, the acting was also poor. With perhaps the exception of Steve Talley. So, in the end, a generally horrid film, if seen from a critical point of view. If seen from a teen point of view, I guess that it's better, but this film is rated 18+ in most countries, so it shouldn't really be seen by minors.

Liu, 23, who is in her final year of a BSc in business administration at the University of Bath, is one of more than 80,000 Chinese students studying in UK universities. They are responsible for a large proportion of the more than PS10bn a year that international students contribute to the UK economy. However, research shows that where their academic attainment is concerned, the picture is not satisfactory. While nearly 58% of all students - and 45% of overseas students graduated with a first-class degree last year, this was true of only 35% of students from China. To find an explanation, Zhiqi Wang and Ian Crawford, lecturers at the University of Bath, compared the performance of Chinese and British undergraduates in each year of their degree. Taking a sample of 100 British and Chinese students and comparing their average marks and final degree classification, they found a dramatic drop in performance among the Chinese students between year one, when they performed better than their UK counterparts, and year two, when they performed worse. They believe the drop results from two factors. First, Chinese students fail to adapt their approaches to learning and so their performance declines in the later years when the complexity of the work increases. Second, many young people in China enroll in higher education due to pressure from family rather than their own motivation. Professor Sedghi thinks part of the problem may be the changing socio-economic background of Chinese undergraduates. While 85% of Chinese students at British universities before 2000...

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Elena took great photos with a camera of Christine because","completion":"Elena was a talented and passionate photographer. She had an artistic eye for capturing the beauty of life in its purest forms. Ever since she was a little girl, Elena had been mesmerized by the intricacies of light and shadows, colors and textures, and the emotions that a single photograph could convey. It was this driving passion that led her to pursue a career in photography, and she never looked back. Christine, on the other hand, was a contemporary dancer. Her graceful movements and fluidity had won over many hearts and earned her both critical acclaim and a steadily growing fan base. A true artist, Christine was constantly searching for new ways to express herself, always pushing her own boundaries and seeking out new creative outlets. Somehow, their paths had crossed, and it was as if their talents were destined to intertwine. Elena met Christine at a small art exhibition where Christine was performing an experimental dance piece. Enamored by the dancer's ability to convey so much through movement, Elena could see the possibilities of showcasing Christine's unique movements and expressions through her photography. After the performance, Elena wasted no time in approaching Christine, eager to propose the idea of collaborating on a project that would blend their artistic visions. The excitement shared between the two as they discussed the potential of their collaboration was tangible. Their idea was to create a series of photographs that would capture the essence of Christine's dance movements, portraying the elegance and power of the human form in motion. They imagined a collection that would push the boundaries of conventional dance photography, highlighting the dancer's poetic expressions through the lens of Elena's keen artistic eye. As the project commenced, the two worked tirelessly on the concept, scouting the most visually striking locations to serve as the perfect backdrops to Christine's performance. They visited abandoned warehouses, lushly overgrown gardens, stark industrial settings, and even serene lakeshores to capture the desired atmosphere for their innovative collection. On one particularly memorable shoot, Elena and Christine ventured to a secluded ancient ruin – a beautifully haunting place that had caught the photographer's eye months ago. Elena envisioned the crumbling walls and moss-covered stones to perfectly compliment Christine's fluid movements, offering a stark contrast between the power of nature and the delicacy of the human spirit. The day was filled with excitement, laughs, and an endless stream of creative energy. As Christine danced across the overgrown terrain, the sunlight filtered through the ruins, casting a near-mystical glow over her. With each click of the shutter, Elena captured stunning images that were both evocative and enchanting, illustrating the harmony between movement and stillness. The partnership between photographer and dancer forged something truly magical, elevating their individual art forms to even higher realms. Over time, their collaboration evolved, each shoot further pushing their creativity and resulting in a series of breathtaking images. The bond between the two grew stronger, their mutual respect for each other's craft forming a connection that transcended their professional partnership. And with each photograph that Elena captured of Christine, their shared vision culminated in a work of art that was both powerful and deeply personal. The resulting collection of photographs garnered widespread praise from critics and enthusiasts alike. Exhibitions showcased their work, highlighting the arresting beauty of Christine's dance, enriched by the captivating talent of Elena's photography. As their success grew, so did a new-found friendship, an unbreakable bond that would continue to shape their artistic journeys as they ventured forward into the world hand in hand. But success, as remarkable as it was, was not their primary accomplishment. Rather, it was the lasting impact they had left on one another and the countless individuals who had been touched by their unique partnership, leaving an indelible mark on the world of art and beyond. And all of this had sprung from a single moment when Elena took great photos with a camera of Christine — igniting an artistic collaboration that would reverberate and inspire generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Those are about the worst words in the world, because they mean Doc's gotta put stuff to right in there, and he might not have what he'd like in order to get it done. But when he stands back, after the sponge count had to be done twice, and the tool count is right, and the belly is stapled closed, and everyone in the room is still breathing… Just let it be known that the roving nurse has extra sponges for dad's nose.

The staff were friendly and attentive, making me feel welcome as soon as I walked in. The interior design of the place is cozy and inviting, offering a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy my meal. I ordered the vegetable lasagna, and I must say, it was absolutely delicious. The portion size was generous, and the flavors were well-balanced and mouth-watering. I also tried their signature iced tea, which was truly refreshing. Overall, I highly recommend the Sunshine Café to anyone looking for delicious food and outstanding service.\\""}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],j={key:0},E={key:1};function R(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
