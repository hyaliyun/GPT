Answer the question...what was the purpose of the parade in washington in march 1913??","completion":"The parade in Washington, D.C. in March 1913, officially known as the Woman Suffrage Procession, was a significant event in the American women's suffrage movement. Organized by the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), primarily under the leadership of Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, the parade aimed to garner attention, raise awareness, and build support for women's right to vote. The purpose of the Woman Suffrage Procession can be broken down into several key objectives: 1. Raise awareness for the suffrage movement: The parade, held on March 3, 1913, was designed to be a grand spectacle, attracting thousands of participants and onlookers. With marchers from various states and backgrounds, the event aimed to convey the broad support and nationwide appeal of the women's suffrage movement. 2. Demonstrate political power: By organizing the parade the day before President Woodrow Wilson's inauguration, the suffragists sought to demonstrate their political prowess. By having a high-profile event coincide with the start of a new presidential term, they hoped to send a clear message to the incoming administration of the importance of the suffrage movement and the need for action on the federal level. 3. Appeal to the masses: The parade was an opportunity to present the movement in an accessible and engaging way. Participants dressed in white, the color commonly associated with the suffrage movement, and were joined by floats, bands, and other theatrical elements, drawing attention from the press and public. Additionally, with well-known figures such as lawyer Inez Milholland leading the parade, the suffragists aimed to gain a wider audience for their cause. 4. Unify the movement: The Woman Suffrage Procession brought together a diverse group of women from different regions, political affiliations, and social backgrounds. This diversity was an essential aspect of the movement that helped to dispel the myth that women's suffrage only appealed to a minority of the population. The parade helped showcase the inclusive and collaborative spirit of the movement and endeavored to create a sense of unity among the various suffrage organizations and activists. 5. Expose injustices: The Woman Suffrage Procession was not without challenges. Parade participants encountered hostility, jeering, and even violence from the crowd. Police provided little assistance, and the situation became so dangerous that soldiers had to be called in to protect the marchers. This mistreatment of the participants was widely reported in the press, helping to expose the hypocrisy and injustice women faced as they campaigned for their right to vote. This negative experience further galvanized the movement and rallied supporters around the need for change. In summary, the Woman Suffrage Procession in Washington, D.C. in March 1913 aimed to increase awareness, demonstrate political power, appeal to the masses, unify the suffrage movement, and expose injustices faced by women. The event, despite the challenges encountered, was successful in gaining public support and attention for the movement, contributing to women's eventual achievement of the right to vote through the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In signing Argentina's same-sex marriage law, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said debate over the issue would be \\"absolutely anachronistic\\" -- archaic, out of date -- within a few years. Striking down California's Proposition 8 two weeks later, Judge Vaughn Walker was more specific, saying there was no evidence for old-fashioned stereotypes that painted gays \\"as disease vectors or as child molesters who recruit young children into homosexuality.\\" Banning people from marrying based on sexual orientation, the President Reagan appointee explained, is \\"irrational.\\" \\"Often courts will make decisions that are predictors of what public opinion is going to be a few years from now,\\" said Brian Powell, an Indiana University sociology professor and co-author of the upcoming book, \\"Counted Out: Same-Sex Relations and Americans' Definitions of Family.\\" As Walker indicated, attitudes are changing, and waning are concepts that homosexuality harms children, defies biblical teachings or destroys the fabric of society. \\"Public attitudes don't change really quickly, but this is one that's changing really, really quickly,\\" Powell said. The trend is similar abroad, especially among younger people, said Suzanne Goldberg, a Columbia University law professor who heads the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law. The center has handled asylum cases for gay people fleeing persecution in countries including Jamaica, Brazil, Uzbekistan and Ivory Coast. Research indicates younger people are beginning to see sexual orientation as \\"benign variation, so that the differences between gay and nongay couples are simply not so interesting,\\" Goldberg said in an e-mail. \\"Once that happens, societies have less interest in distinguishing between relationships of gay and nongay couples,\\" she added. Before 2008, Massachusetts (via a court ruling) was the only U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage, while the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Canada and South Africa were the only countries. Since then, four U.S. states, five countries, Washington, D.C., and Mexico City have legalized same-sex marriage. Watch why same-sex marriages are on hold in California. While some of these entities have track records of defending civil rights, some may appear more curious. South Africa resides on a continent particularly hostile to gay rights, and in some African countries same-sex relationships are punishable by penal labor, flogging, imprisonment or death, according to the International Lesbian and Gay Association. Mexico City, Portugal and Argentina, all of which legalized same-sex marriage this year -- and Spain, which OK'd it in 2005 -- are staunchly Catholic, and the church has made clear its aversion to same-sex relationships. Goldberg said she believes, in the Catholic countries, the emphasis on religion is trumped by a drive to ensure equality. \\"My sense is that the shift in the Catholic countries to recognize same sex-couples marriages stems from a complex set of political and social reasons and has been, in some nations, an indication of the church's shrinking political clout,\\" she said. Argentina may fit the bill, as the country is 92 percent Roman Catholic, yet only 20 percent of the population is practicing. Watch couple comment on Argentina's first same-sex marriage. A recent CNN poll said Americans were split 51 percent to 49 percent against granting gay and lesbian couples the right to wed. Proposition 8 was approved by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent, but Powell noted referendums \\"do not necessarily reflect the will of the people.\\" Older people tend to cast more ballots than younger folks, he said, and heated issues draw special interests into elections, which can skew demographics. Powell has been collecting data on American attitudes since 2003. While the full data will be released in his book in September, his research adds a layer of nuance to the poll numbers: Though many Americans simply do or do not recognize gay couples as families, 80 percent of Americans consider gay partners a family if they have children. His research shows American definitions of family are becoming flexible, he said, likening the same-sex marriage debate to the rumblings preceding the 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision authorizing interracial marriages. Before the miscegenation ruling, researchers found younger people, those with liberal religious views and voters with higher education levels had fewer qualms with interracial marriages. Similar lines hold true in today's same-sex marriage debate. Powell added another variable: gender. Women have a \\"more inclusive\\" definition of family, he said. Goldberg said demographics were also at play in other nations, \\"reaching a tipping point\\" on same-sex couples. These societies have had long-standing commitments to end discrimination against gays at work, in courts and elsewhere, she said. iReport.com: 'Army of lovers' fights for rights. There is also \\"an increased demand by same-sex couples together with an increased recognition that there really are not nonreligion-based reasons to exclude same-sex couples from marriage,\\" she said. The more open discourse on a topic, the more acceptance it garners, Goldberg and Powell concurred. Look to the tube. When Ellen DeGeneres kissed Laura Dern on her sitcom, \\"Ellen,\\" in 1997, there was enormous backlash. Today, same-sex smooches are ratings grabs and shows with prominent gay characters, such as \\"Modern Family\\" and \\"Glee,\\" are up for Emmys this month. \\"Once there is more discussion about it as a result of court cases, as a result of media representations, people become more comfortable,\\" Powell said. Added Goldberg, \\"It's also true that as gay people live openly and as same-sex couples' relationships are recognized more broadly, fears that the sky will fall because of same-sex couples' marriages tend to fade away from the mainstream.\\" Change is not swift everywhere, as the degree of acceptance around the world presently runs the gamut. Read Time.com's history of international gay marriage. In 2008, the U.N. General Assembly saw 66 countries declare they would support rights for gays and lesbians, yet a 2010 International Lesbian and Gay Association report said 76 countries punish people based on sexual orientation. The number last year was 77. India dropped off the list when its court changed the penal code in July 2009. \\"One country less compared to the 2009 list may seem little progress, until one realizes that it hosts one-sixth of the human population,\\" the report said. There are countries such as Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen, which can put people to death for certain types of sexual behavior, according to the report. There are places such as Aruba and Israel that will recognize same-sex marriages but won't perform them. There are also about 20 countries or parts of countries that recognize civil unions. Goldberg said policies in Uganda, which drafted an anti-homosexuality bill that would strengthen the nation's maximum sentence from life in prison to capital punishment, and in Iran are stark contrasts to the rest of the world, which is reluctant to condemn gays openly. As for countries embracing civil unions, it's a compromise, Powell said. People are in favor of many gay rights, just not marriage, he said. Goldberg described it as \\"typically political, where the pro-equality communities have enough power to gain substantial recognition for same-sex couples but not enough to overcome resistance from the more conservative segments of the political community.\\" To those fighting for gay rights, Powell said, any step forward helps because it increases dialogue and people's comfort levels. \\"Contact makes things less scary, makes it more comfortable, and the more comfort you have the less opposition you're going to have,\\" he said.

Context: Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit.

Q:Information: - Detroit is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on the United StatesCanada border. It is the seat of Wayne County, the most populous county in the state. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - A central business district (CBD) is the commercial and business centre of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \\"financial district\\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \\"city centre\\" or \\"downtown\\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central \\"business\\" district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown. Both the CBD and the city centre or downtown may also coincide with the central activities district. - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer. - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - Grosse Pointe Park is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan . The population was 11,555 at the 2010 census . Bordering on Detroit with frontage on southern Lake Saint Clair , it is the westernmost of the noted Grosse Pointe suburbs , with the oldest overall housing stock of the five cities .

From start to finish, every aspect of our visit was top-notch; from the warm hospitality extended by the thoughtful staff to the mouth-watering dishes that graced our table. Upon entering The Food Symphony, we were immediately struck by the cozy and relaxed ambiance of the restaurant, which was complemented by the low hum of cheerful conversations and the soft, ambient lighting. The host greeted us with a friendly smile and promptly seated us at a lovely table with a beautiful view of their quaint patio. As we perused the menu, I couldn't help but appreciate the range of delectable options available. The Food Symphony offers something for everyone, even catering to special dietary requirements such as vegan, gluten-free, and dairy-free options. Our server showed great knowledge of the menu and was able to make excellent suggestions based on our preferences. We started with the house-made focaccia bread with a divine blend of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The taste was heavenly, as the warm and fluffy bread melted in our mouths. For appetizers, we tried the spicy shrimp ceviche and the ricotta-stuffed mushrooms. The ceviche was a perfect blend of spiciness and tang, with the shrimp marinated to perfection, while the mushrooms were tender, flavorful, and bursting with creaminess from the ricotta. For our main course, we opted for the pan-seared Chilean Sea Bass with garlic-lemon butter sauce and the Short Rib Ravioli accompanied by a porcini mushroom cream sauce. The sea bass was flaky and succulent, cooked to perfection with a delectable butter sauce that enhanced every bite. The ravioli was a true work of art, generously filled with melt-in-your-mouth short rib and bathing in a rich and flavorful mushroom sauce. By the time dessert rolled around, we could hardly fathom fitting more food into our satisfied stomachs. But, our server enticed us with the description of the chef's signature Tiramisu, so we had to try it - and we had absolutely zero regrets. With just the right balance of coffee and rich Mascarpone, the tiramisu sent our taste buds on an unforgettable journey. The whole experience was further enhanced by the exceptional attention to detail and attentive service from the staff. The pace of the meal was perfect, allowing us to savor each dish without feeling rushed. The servers regularly checked in to ensure we had everything we needed and promptly refilled our drinks when necessary. In conclusion, the flavors, textures, and presentation of each dish were simply outstanding. The Food Symphony made for an enjoyable, memorable evening, and I cannot wait until my next visit.

The series stars Bobby Cannavale as Richie Finestra, a record executive in the 1970s. It premiered on HBO on February 14, 2016, and concluded on April 17, 2016. What's the best answer to this question: is the show vinyl based on a true story?","completion":"\\"Vinyl\\" is not explicitly based on a true story but it does draw heavily from the world of 1970s rock 'n' roll as informed by the real-life experiences and observations of its creators, especially Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger. The show's main character, Richie Finestra, portrayed by Bobby Cannavale, is a fictional character and his story, including his struggles with addiction and his turbulent personal life, is not based on any one individual's real life. Instead, he is a fictional amalgamation conceived by “Vinyl” co-creators, Mick Jagger, Martin Scorsese, Rich Cohen, and Terence Winter for the purposes of the series. The backdrop of the show, however, is rooted in a very real era. The series takes place in the 1970s, a time noted for its vibrant music scene and particularly, the explosive growth and evolution of rock 'n' roll. Martin Scorsese, acclaimed film director, is known for his meticulous period details and in \\"Vinyl,\\" he reconjures the decade with his signature flair. Mick Jagger, legendary frontman of The Rolling Stones, provided the insider view of the 70s music industry. Jagger’s own experiences as a musician during this time period influenced the atmosphere and characters seen in the show. Also showcased in the series are representations of real-life artists and bands of the era, like Alice Cooper, David Bowie, and The Velvet Underground, among others. These characters, however, are primarily used to accurately signify the music trends and culture of the era, rather than having their individual stories told. Moreover, while the American Century record company is depicted as a powerhouse in the music industry, it is crucial to remember that it is not based on a single real-life record company. The series instead depicts a cultural composite of record companies during the 70s period, marked by cutthroat competition, indulgence, and innovation. So, while \\"Vinyl\\" uses real-life elements and experiences to build its world, it is essential to view it as a creative dramatization, rather than an accurate historical account. The facts of the music industry in the 1970s serve more as inspiration and backdrop as opposed to being faithfully duplicated for the sake of retelling a specific true story. It's more truthful to say that \\"Vinyl\\" is influenced by true events and surroundings rather than based on one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

PUBLISHED:. 13:28 EST, 24 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 14:03 EST, 24 January 2014. Daniel Rodriquez jailed for a total of 12 years after an armed siege at his home in Kidlington, Oxon, in July last year. A man who took a cocktail of drugs before holding his two-year-old twin girls hostage in an armed siege was jailed for 12 years today. Daniel Rodriquez, 38, from Kidlington, Oxon, armed himself with an air rifle and an imitation handgun as his daughters slept in their beds following a domestic incident on July 9 last year. More than 50 officers in riot gear and. armed with guns surrounded the family flat in the early hours of the morning. The man twice fired at police as dozens of officers filled the streets for the pro-longed stand off. Rodriquez took a cocktail of. drugs including heroin, crack cocaine and valium while the police were. outside frantically trying to negotiate the children’s release, a court heard. Rodriquez was later restrained by officers with a Taser after the girls - wearing matching pyjamas - were carried from the property by police. The man pleaded guilty to possession of two firearms and two counts of using the firearms to resist arrest. Rodriquez was sentenced to 12 years behind bars at Oxford Crown Court today. Prosecutor Rachel Drake described the terrifying siege to the court. Miss Drake said: 'There was cordoning off of the areas and a very long siege situation involving negotiations between the defendant and the police. 'He was in a very agitated and distressed state and said he was considering taking his own life. 'Police were extremely concerned about the safety of the twin girls asleep in the bedroom next to the defendant. 'As the incident developed, the police were negotiating with Mr Rodriquez. About 9.30am, having supplied him with some food he passed down one of the girls. 'At 11.30am, the second of the children was passed through the window. There was no suggestion they were harmed during this incident.' An officer holds one of the man's daughters in his arms and takes her to safety following the siege. Despite handing over his children, the gunman still refused to come out of the flat. Miss Drake continued: 'Mr Rodriquez was not prepared to give himself up to the police for many hours afterwards. His arrest eventually took place in the foyer of the flat at 3.50pm. 'Following the defendant’s arrest, a full search was made of the flat and the two firearms were recovered.' The guns were found to be a .177 calibre air rifle and an imitation Colt Python handgun. Rodriquez appeared in court via a video link in prison wearing a navy and white hooped jumper. He stared forward blankly during the sentencing hearing and only spoke to confirm his name. At the time of his arrest, the father ran his own car wash firm Ace Power Wash Services in Kidlington, Oxon. One of the twins is removed from the property by an officer. The girls were wearing matching pyjamas as they were taken to safety. The court heard he had served six months in prison in 2002 for racially aggravated common assault, and had a string of convictions for theft, burglary, drug possession and ABH. His most recent conviction was for burglary and theft in 2011. In mitigation, his defence counsel Lucy Tapper said her client suffered mental health problems - including bipolar, depression and borderline personality disorder. She told the judge that Rodriquez loved his children and never intended them any harm during the hostage crisis. She said: 'The devastating cocktail of drugs and alcohol Mr Rodriquez had consumed, coupled with his overwhelming sense of anxiety and paranoia caused him to react in the way he did that morning when great numbers of police arrived at his house. 'The children were never, ever put in any direct danger by him. He had got them up in the usual way, got them breakfast and had them watching television. One officer reports hearing them laughing and playing in the back room.' Armed officers surround the flat in Kidlington. Rodriguez twice fired at police during the siege. Judge Ian Pringle commented that it was an 'appalling' case and said Rodriquez’s possession of the firearms was an 'aggravating factor' in the case. Jailing Rodriquez for 12 years, the judge said: 'Police staked out the house you were in with your two very small daughters. You released them one by one. 'That siege lasted until just before 4pm that afternoon - a serious aggravating feature of this case, no doubt brought about by your taking of a lethal cocktail of drugs over a huge period of time.' Rodriquez had pleaded guilty to possession of two firearms and two counts of using the firearms to resist arrest. For those counts, he received four years in jail. He was also jailed for eight years to run concurrently after he admitted three counts of rape and one sexual assault charge against a woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Speaking after the case, Detective Sergeant Jim Homes, the investigating officer from Thames Valley Police said he was 'satisfied' with the result of what was a 'very difficult' investigation. 'It was a very unusual case, not one that we’ve dealt with before,' he added. Rodriguez was sentenced to 12 years in jail today following the incident in July last year.

Answer the following question: Stan moved from the US to Australia, and he still gets confused because of the seasons in the southern hemisphere and the fact that they use the same calendar as the rest of the world. Which month is colder in the northern hemisphere, June or December? Answer:","completion":"December is the colder month in the Northern Hemisphere as compared to June. Here's a detailed explanation of why this is the case. The Earth revolves around the Sun and experiences variations in climate throughout the year due to its tilt and rotation. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees. This tilt and the way the Earth rotates around the Sun are responsible for the change in seasons. In the Northern Hemisphere, June marks the beginning of the summer season, whereas December is the beginning of the winter season. During June, the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun, which results in warmer temperatures and longer daylight hours. This time of the year experiences the Summer Solstice, typically around June 21st, when the Northern Hemisphere experiences the longest day of the year in terms of daylight hours. On the contrary, in December, the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun. This leads to colder temperatures and shorter daylight hours as less solar energy reaches the Northern Hemisphere. Around December 21st, the region experiences the Winter Solstice, which is the day with the shortest period of daylight. It is essential to note that the seasons are opposite between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres because of the tilt of the Earth's axis. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. That is why Stan, who moved from the US (Northern Hemisphere) to Australia (Southern Hemisphere), still gets confused about the seasons in the southern hemisphere, despite using the same calendar as the rest of the world. In summary, December is the colder month in the Northern Hemisphere compared to June. This difference in temperature is due to the tilt of the Earth's axis and the Earth's rotation around the Sun, which result in distinct seasonal variations and more or less solar energy reaching different hemispheres during various times of the year."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What's the name of the person Amah helps take care of? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1906 San Francisco, Frisco Jenny Sandoval, a denizen of the notorious Tenderloin district, wants to marry piano player Dan McAllister, but her saloonkeeper father Jim is adamantly opposed to it. An earthquake kills both men and devastates the city. In the aftermath, Jenny gives birth to a son, whom she names Dan. With financial help from crooked lawyer Steve Dutton, who himself came from the Tenderloin, she sets herself up in the vice trade, providing women on demand. Jenny has one loyal friend, the Chinese woman Amah, who helps take care of the baby. At a party in Steve's honor, he catches gambler Ed Harris (an uncredited J. Carrol Naish) cheating him in a back room. In the ensuing struggle, Steve kills him, with Jenny the only eyewitness. The pair are unable to dispose of the body before it is found and are questioned by the police. However, neither is charged. The scandal forces Jenny to temporarily give up her baby to a very respectable couple who owe Steve a favor to keep the child from being taken away from her. After three years, she tries to take her son back, but the boy clings to the only mother he can remember, so she leaves him where he is.

The original premise states \\"In the resorts on the coast, many traders are aware that some tourists feel uncomfortable with bargaining, and will give you their best price straight away if you ask them to.\\" This statement implies the opposite of the conclusion presented. The premise suggests that there are traders at coastal resorts who understand the discomfort some tourists may feel when asked to haggle over prices. As a result, these traders are willing to provide their best price immediately upon request. It reflects an understanding of their customer's needs and a business approach that values customer comfort and satisfaction. Therefore, based on the original premise provided, it would be more accurate to conclude that \\"Some traders at coastal resorts are indeed willing to give their best offer immediately if asked.\\" This conclusion aligns with the information the premise provides and is supported by the understanding that these traders have adapted their selling strategies in response to some tourists' discomfort with bargaining. Additionally, while the premise states \\"many traders\\" will offer their best price if you ask them to, it doesn't imply that all do. It's possible that some traders may still default to bargaining as their primary method of setting a price for goods. So it might be necessary, depending on the specific trader, to clarify a tourist's willingness or lack thereof to negotiate prices.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: How do the survivors work on the farms ? Survivors work on the farms using primitive hand-held farming tools Answer:","completion":"Title: The Fields of Hope Genre: Drama, Sci-fi, Adventure Plot Summary: In a post-apocalyptic world where technology has crashed, a group of survivors work diligently on their farms using primitive, hand-held tools to cultivate the land and build a better future. Their shared passion for agriculture changes their lives and the fate of humanity forever. Act I: In 2056, a cataclysmic event dubbed \\"The Fall\\" has led to the collapse of global technology, leaving the Earth in ruins. The world is now overrun by chaos, with warlords vying for power and resources. Amidst the tumultuous landscape, a small, close-knit group of survivors finds solace in working together on an isolated, abandoned farm. The story opens with the survivors scavenging for food and materials in the destroyed remains of a nearby city. They discover a library, where they find old books on primitive farming techniques. Inspired by these books, the group decides to put their newfound knowledge to use and begins working on the farm. Act II: As the survivors continue to work on the farm, using hand-held tools such as hoes, rakes, and shovels, they develop tight bonds with one another. They rely on each other for support, training, and encouragement, and their shared passion for farming blossoms. One day, while working in the fields, a young survivor named Ada discovers a mysterious underground bunker hidden beneath their farm. In the bunker, they find a trove of old-world seeds and agricultural equipment, giving them a more significant opportunity to expand their farm and improve their techniques. While the group revels in their newfound treasure, a dangerous warlord, Damien, learns about the farm and its valuable resources. He and his band of marauders advance on the farm with the intention of seizing it for themselves. The climax of Act II consists of a suspenseful battle between Damien's forces and the farm's defenders, led by the farm's unofficial leader, Emmet. Act III: Using their wits, cunning and determination, the survivors successfully defend their farm from Damien's forces and capture the marauders. However, rather than executing the attackers, Emmet offers them a choice: join the survivors in working on the farm or be released and left to fend for themselves in a harsh, unforgiving world. Moved by Emmet's show of mercy, some of Damien's warriors decide to abandon their violent ways and join the survivors in working on the farm. Together, the now-expanded group continues to cultivate the land, spreading their message of hope and cooperation to others throughout the region. Years pass, and the survivors' farm becomes a beacon of hope in a desolate world. Their dedication to agriculture, fueled by their primitive hand-held farming tools, helps to rekindle the lost knowledge of the past. As the farm prospers, it becomes the epicenter of a new civilization built upon the time-honored practices of cooperation, hard work, and sustainability. The movie concludes with a sweeping aerial view of the once-barren landscape, now transformed into a thriving, vibrant farmland - a testament to the power of human perseverance and the indomitable spirit of hope."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of muscle diseases that results in increasing weakening and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time. The disorders differ in which muscles are primarily affected, the degree of weakness, how fast they worsen, and when symptoms begin. Many people eventually become unable to walk. Some types are also associated with problems in other organs. There are nine main categories of muscular dystrophy that contain more than thirty specific types. The most common type is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) which typically affects males beginning around the age of four. Other types include Becker muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy. They are due to mutations in genes that are involved in making muscle proteins. This can occur due to either inheriting the defect from one's parents or the mutation occurring during early development. Disorders may be X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, or autosomal dominant. Diagnosis often involves blood tests and genetic testing. There is no cure for muscular dystrophy. Physical therapy, braces, and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms. Assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles. Medications used include steroids to slow muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity, and immunosuppressants to delay damage to dying muscle cells. Outcomes depend on the specific type of disorder. Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which represents about half of all cases of muscular dystrophy, affects about one in 5,000 males at birth. Muscular dystrophy was first described in the 1830s by Charles Bell. The word \\"dystrophy\\" is from the Greek \\"dys\\", meaning \\"difficult\\" and \\"troph\\" meaning \\"nourish\\". Gene therapy, as a treatment, is in the early stages of study in humans. - Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals. - Myasthenia gravis ( from Greek \`\` muscle '' , \`\` weakness '' , and Latin : gravis \`\` serious '' ; abbreviated MG ) is a neuromuscular disease that leads to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue . In the most common cases , muscle weakness is caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction , inhibiting the excitatory effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors at neuromuscular junctions . Alternatively , in a much rarer form , muscle weakness is caused by a genetic defect in some portion of the neuromuscular junction that is inherited at birth as opposed to developing through passive transmission from the mother 's immune system at birth or through autoimmunity later in life . Myasthenia is treated with medications such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants , and , in selected cases , thymectomy ( surgical removal of the thymus gland ) . The disease is diagnosed in 3 to 30 people per million per year . Diagnosis is becoming more common due to increased awareness . - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity. - Muscle weakness or myasthenia (my- from Greek meaning \\"muscle\\" + -asthenia meaning \\"weakness\\") is a lack of muscle strength. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have either true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. Muscle weakness can also be caused by low levels of potassium and other electrolytes within muscle cells. It can be temporary or long-lasting (from seconds or minutes to months or years). - A motor neuron (or motoneuron) is a nerve cell (neuron) whose cell body is located in the spinal cord and whose fiber (axon) projects outside the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands. Motor neurons' axons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors to produce effects. Types of motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons. - Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals. Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell. Muscles function to produce force and motion. They are primarily responsible for maintaining and changing posture, locomotion, as well as movement of internal organs, such as the contraction of the heart and the movement of food through the digestive system via peristalsis. - Muscle contraction is the activation of tension-generating sites within muscle fibers. In physiology, muscle contraction does not mean muscle shortening because muscle tension can be produced without changes in muscle length such as holding a heavy book or a dumbbell at the same position. The termination of muscle contraction is followed by muscle relaxation, which is a return of the muscle fibers to their low tension-generating state. - Weakness or asthenia is a symptom of a number of different conditions. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. - Chemical synapses are biological junctions through which neurons' signals can be exchanged to each other and to non-neuronal cells such as those in muscles or glands. Chemical synapses allow neurons to form circuits within the central nervous system. They are crucial to the biological computations that underlie perception and thought. They allow the nervous system to connect to and control other systems of the body. - A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of axons (nerve fibers, the long and slender projections of neurons) in the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs. - Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a long term neuromuscular disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness. The most commonly affected muscles are those of the eyes, face, and swallowing. It can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, and trouble walking. Onset can be sudden. Those affected often have a large thymus gland or develop a thymoma. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease which results from antibodies that block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the junction between the nerve and muscle. This prevents nerve impulses from triggering muscle contractions. Rarely an inherited genetic defect in the neuromuscular junction results in a similar condition known as congenital myasthenia. Babies of mothers with myasthenia may have symptoms during their first few months of life, known as neonatal myasthenia. Diagnosis can be supported by blood tests for specific antibodies, the edrophonium test, or nerve conduction studies. Myasthenia gravis is generally treated with medications known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine. Immunosuppressants, such as prednisone or azathioprine, may also be used. The surgical removal of the thymus gland may improve symptoms in certain cases. Plasmapheresis and high dose intravenous immunoglobulin may be used during sudden flares of the condition. If the breathing muscles become significantly weak, mechanical ventilation may be required. Myasthenia gravis affects 50 to 200 per million people. It is newly diagnosed in 3 to 30 per million people each year. Diagnosis is becoming more common due to increased awareness. It most commonly occurs in women under the age of 40 and in men over the age of 60. It is uncommon in children. With treatment most of those affected lead relatively normal lives and have a normal life expectancy. The word is from the Greek \\"muscle\\" and asthenia \\"weakness\\", and the \\"serious\\". - Inflammatory myopathy (inflammatory muscle disease or myositis) is disease featuring weakness and inflammation of muscles and (in some types) muscle pain. The cause of much inflammatory myopathy is unknown (idiopathic), and such cases are classified according to their symptoms and signs and electromyography, MRI and laboratory findings. It can also be associated with underlying cancer. The main classes of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy are polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), and inclusion-body myositis (IBM). - An electrolyte is a substance that produces an electrically conducting solution when dissolved in a polar solvent, such as water. The dissolved electrolyte separates into cations and anions, which disperse uniformly through the solvent. Electrically, such a solution is neutral. If an electric potential is applied to such a solution, the cations of the solution are drawn to the electrode that has an abundance of electrons, while the anions are drawn to the electrode that has a deficit of electrons. The movement of anions and cations in opposite directions within the solution amounts to a current. This includes most soluble salts, acids, and bases. Some gases, such as hydrogen chloride, under conditions of high temperature or low pressure can also function as electrolytes. Electrolyte solutions can also result from the dissolution of some biological (e.g., DNA, polypeptides) and synthetic polymers (e.g., polystyrene sulfonate), termed \\"polyelectrolytes\\", which contain charged functional groups. A substance that dissociates into ions in solution acquires the capacity to conduct electricity. Sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are examples of electrolytes, informally known as \\"lytes\\". - A neuromuscular junction (or myoneural junction) is a chemical synapse formed by the contact between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber. It is at the neuromuscular junction that a motor neuron is able to transmit a signal to the muscle fiber, causing muscle contraction. - Neuromuscular disease is a very broad term that encompasses many diseases and ailments that impair the functioning of the muscles, either directly, being pathologies of the voluntary muscle, or indirectly, being pathologies of nerves or neuromuscular junctions.

Title: 1 good track, 22 boring tracks. Review: This CD may well kick off with a roaring and rocking guitar riff that is Carpenter performing at his absolute best but the rest is dull as ditchwater. There are no themes in any of these tracks. It's actually a lot like the ambient music in the Myst and Riven soundtracks. Only those CDs are cool and the music within is haunting and etheral. If you dig this kind of music then by all means by those instead. ITMOM may well begin with some of the best electric guitar sounds ever, but the CD is not worth buying. A shame really, because Carpenter is a truly gifted musician. Answer: OPT: (A). No; (B). Yes; Answer:","completion":"(A). No; Step 1: Analyze the title and key phrases within the review. The title of the review is \\"1 good track, 22 boring tracks,\\" which implies that the reviewer found only one enjoyable track out of 23. Phrases such as \\"dull as ditchwater,\\" \\"no themes,\\" \\"not worth buying,\\" and \\"a shame\\" buttress the impression that the review is predominantly negative. Step 2: Consider the balance of positive and negative remarks. Although the reviewer recognizes Carpenter's talent as a \\"truly gifted musician\\" and praises the first guitar track, the bulk of the review emphasizes disappointment. As such, the balance skews negative. Step 3: Compare the review's tone with the definitions of positive and negative.

Question: how many presidential terms did fdr serve I found the following answer on Google: Roosevelt is consistently rated by scholars as one of the top three U.S. Presidents , along with Abraham Lincoln and George Washington . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the information provided does not directly answer the question about how many presidential terms Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) served. However, I can provide you with a detailed and long answer. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, commonly known by his initials FDR, was the 32nd President of the United States. He served from 1933 to 1945, making him one of the most memorable leaders in American history. FDR served an unprecedented four terms in office, which is more than any other president in U.S. history. FDR's long presidency can be divided into two main time periods: the Great Depression and World War II. He first took office during the Great Depression, implementing a series of programs and policies known as the New Deal. These initiatives aimed to provide relief for millions of Americans who were suffering due to widespread unemployment and economic decline. The New Deal included public works programs, financial reforms, and relief efforts – all designed to help the nation recover from the Great Depression. As his first two terms progressed, the U.S. began to see economic improvement. FDR was reelected for a second term in 1936, continuing his administration's efforts to strengthen the American economy. The New Deal expanded during his second term, with additional programs being implemented to further combat unemployment, poverty, and other social issues. During FDR's third term, which began in 1941, the United States entered World War II. FDR's leadership during the war focused on building a strong military presence, forming alliances with other nations, and implementing strategies to defeat the Axis powers. The war efforts helped to further improve the U.S. economy, as more jobs became available in manufacturing, agriculture, and other industries. FDR was reelected for a fourth term in 1944 despite concerns about his health. He continued to lead the United States during the final stages of World War II, working closely with allied leaders such as Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. However, FDR did not live to see the end of the war. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945, just a few months into his fourth term. Vice President Harry S. Truman took over as President and led the United States through the conclusion of the war in August 1945. After FDR's unprecedented four terms in office, the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed in 1951, limiting future presidents to serving a maximum of two terms."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mugabe Wins Again in Zimbabwe, Leaving Rival Greatly Weakened HARARE, Zimbabwe â President Robert Mugabe, who has led Zimbabwe since it threw off white rule in 1980, won another term on Saturday as the official results were announced for last weekâs hotly disputed election, defeating his main challenger with 61 percent of the vote and roaring back to secure his grip on power after having to share it for the past five years. The Zimbabwe Election Commission announced the results moments after the challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, denounced the voting, saying it had been rigged. âThis fraudulent and stolen election has plunged Zimbabwe into a constitutional, political and economic crisis,â Mr. Tsvangirai, who won 33 percent of the vote, said in a news conference at his house. He demanded that a new election be held so that Zimbabweans could âfreely and fairly elect a government of their choiceâ â a step that a spokesman for Mr. Mugabeâs party, ZANU-PF, quickly rejected. Secretary of State John Kerry also cast doubt on the validity of the election in a statement on Saturday. âIn light of substantial electoral irregularities reported by domestic and regional observers, the United States does not believe that the results announced today represent a credible expression of the will of the Zimbabwean people,â Mr. Kerry said. But regional election observers suggested that any flaws were not serious enough to invalidate the voting. The victory was a stunning comeback for Mr. Mugabe. After the disputed 2008 election, in which he won fewer votes than Mr. Tsvangirai did, he was forced into forming a unity government. This time, Mr. Mugabeâs party won more than two-thirds of the seats in Parliament, giving it a supermajority that can make changes to the countryâs Constitution without votes from other parties. The election was also a vivid illustration of how Mr. Tsvangiraiâs Movement for Democratic Change, or M.D.C., has been outmaneuvered and outfoxed at every turn by Mr. Mugabe, 89, a wily survivor who endured colonial rule, a brutal guerrilla war and multiple attempts to unseat him during his 33 years as Zimbabweâs leader. âThe party has been to blame for ZANUâs success across the board,â said Stephen Chan, a professor at SOAS, the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, who has written a biography of Mr. Mugabe. After the 2008 vote, the M.D.C. agreed to work with Mr. Mugabeâs party, but did not become an equal partner. âWhat they got was a compromise deal that was almost worse than being in opposition,â Mr. Chan said. One of the partyâs biggest missteps came in June, after Mr. Mugabe unilaterally declared that an election must be held by the end of July, just six weeks later, usurping Parliament. The M.D.C.âs leaders were prepared to tell the heads of state who had gathered for the meeting of the Southern African Development Community, a regional trade bloc, that the party would boycott the election. But the regional leaders at the meeting persuaded Mr. Mugabe to agree to ask the countryâs constitutional court for a two-week extension, and his main challenger for the presidency, Mr. Tsvangirai, agreed to go ahead with the election, according to Douglas Mwonzora, the M.D.C.âs spokesman. The courts refused to extend the deadline, and a messy, rushed election was held on Wednesday. âWe didnât expect the Zimbabwean courts and Mr. Mugabe to go against the resolution of S.A.D.C.,â Mr. Mwonzora said. It would turn out to be just one of a long list of miscalculations that have left the M.D.C., the most credible threat to Mr. Mugabeâs long rule, with not quite a third of the seats in Parliament and few options to contest the election results. Mr. Tsvangirai plans to go to court, but the higher courts in Zimbabwe are filled with Mr. Mugabeâs loyal appointees. The election results were a far cry from the 2008 vote, in which neither man won a majority. Mr. Tsvangirai then refused to participate in a runoff because of attacks that had killed hundreds of his supporters. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Robert Mugabe secures another presidential term in Zimbabwe despite accusations of electoral fraud and rigging from his main challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, who demands a new election.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? that ca n't totally hide its contrivances","completion":"The given review appears to convey a negative opinion of the movie. The reviewer uses the phrase \\"that can't totally hide its contrivances,\\" which indicates that they feel the movie contains elements that seem artificial or forced. Contrivances in filmmaking refer to situations or plot devices that are not organic to the story but are rather created to advance the narrative or inject a certain emotion or theme. When a movie is unable to hide such forced elements, it can come across as poorly executed, inauthentic, or manipulative, leading to a negative viewing experience for the audience. Moreover, the reviewer seems to suggest that the movie has tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to conceal these contrivances. This further reiterates their dissatisfaction with the film, as it may indicate that they were not fully immersed in the story or could not connect with the characters due to these artificial elements. In conclusion, the review can be seen as negative because it highlights a significant flaw in the movie, namely its inability to completely hide the contrived aspects that impair the overall film experience for the viewer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After almost non-stop touring for the previous three years, Ice took a break from music in 1993 and began competing in jet skiing (becoming the 6th best jet ski racer in the world and obtaining sponsorship from Kawasaki) as well as resuming Motocross racing. By 1994, Ice received less publicity and became removed from the public spotlight. After becoming more interested with the Rastafari movement, Ice became a vegetarian, grew dreadlocks and talked more openly about smoking cannabis. On March 22, 1994, Ice released his second studio album, Mind Blowin'. Reviews were unfavorable. Entertainment Weekly reviewer James Bernard called the album \\"more clunky than funky\\". Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith praised the song \\"Get Loose\\" as \\"snappy\\", writing that although the lyrics are \\"inane\\", \\"the song is a thumping party, one of the few places where Ice loosens up. He sounds solid at the beginning of 'The Wrath' as well ... In 'Now and Forever,' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics.\\" Allrovi reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that \\"There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing.\\" Primus bassist Les Claypool stated in response to Ice's cannabis-oriented lyrics: \\"That's all fine and dandy and cute, but it could be misconstrued and manipulated by the wrong people.\\" When asked about the drug oriented sound years later, Vanilla Ice said \\"A lot of the record is drug oriented because I was doing a lot of drugs at the time\\". Shortly afterward, SBK went bankrupt. At around this time, Ice began using ecstasy, cocaine and heroin. During periods of heavy drug use, Ice received many tattoos from artist acquaintances. According to Ice, he \\"was in [his] binge days. [He] didn't even realize how many [he] was getting\\". Ice attempted suicide with a heroin overdose on July 4, 1994 but was revived by his friends. After being revived, Ice decided that it was time to change his lifestyle. As a symbol of his attempt to begin anew, he got a tattoo of a leaf on his stomach. After expanding his Mind Blowin tour overseas in 1995, Ice sold his estate in California and took a break from music, rather focusing on motocrossing and jet skiing in Florida. By the summer Ice was the world's No. 6-ranked sit-down Jet Ski racer, competing nearly every weekend and earning a Kawasaki sponsorship. Uncertain about his future career, Ice studied real estate and started working on the side renovating and selling houses. In late 1995, Ice set up a recording studio in Miami and joined a grunge band, Pickin Scabz. The name was set to reflect Ice's career and how he was healing from his suicide attempt and that he was now \\"picking up the pieces\\". Ice expressed an interest in performing hip hop-influenced rock music, but found that the band was unable to produce the sound he was looking for. In 1996, longtime associate and friend Monte Lipman signed Ice as an artist for Universal Republic Records.

Review: I bought one of the early models of TiVo, and added drive space to make it a 110 hour unit. I wouldn't bother watching TV without it. It really is everything it promises. I don't know what time a lot of my programs come on, or what day of the week, I just watch them when I feel like watching them. I have a one year old daughter, and I would especially reccomend TiVo to new parents. Without the ability to pause, or just stop and come back to it later, a new parent can't expect to watch anything all the way through.Setup may be a bit complex, but once it's in place, it is simple to operate. My mother in law can figure it out when she comes to town. She can't figure out our X-10 remote control lights, or her own e-mail, but she can set TiVo to record her programs and figure out what she wants to watch. If she can do it, anyone can.We use our TiVo so much we are planning on getting one for the little TV in our bedroom. Answer: Answer:","completion":"Yes, this product review is positive. The reviewer expresses satisfaction with their TiVo unit, stating that they \\"wouldn't bother watching TV without it\\" as it truly delivers what it promises. The reviewer also appreciates the flexibility that TiVo provides, allowing them to watch their favorite programs at their convenience, which is particularly beneficial as a new parent. The reviewer further emphasizes that although the initial setup might be complex, operating it is simple. They note that even their mother-in-law, who otherwise struggles with tech, can handle TiVo easily. These positive experiences led to the user planning to purchase another unit for another TV in their home.

A blood letter.","completion":"No, the word \\"letter\\" has different meanings in these two sentences as it is being used in different contexts. Let's examine each sentence to better understand the difference in meaning. - In the first sentence, \\"Mailed an indignant letter to the editor,\\" the word \\"letter\\" refers to a written or printed message, usually put on a piece of paper, and sent to a recipient. In this context, the \\"letter\\" typically includes a greeting, body, and closing, describing the sender's thoughts, concerns, or feelings. The term \\"indignant\\" suggests that the letter contains strong feelings of anger or annoyance about unfair treatment, and it is addressed to the editor, implying that it's sent to a newspaper or publication as a response to something printed in it. - In the second sentence, \\"A blood letter,\\" the word \\"letter\\" is a part of a compound word, \\"bloodletter,\\" which has a different meaning altogether. A bloodletter is a historical term referring to a person who practiced bloodletting, a medical procedure in which a small amount of blood is removed from a patient to treat or prevent illness. Bloodletting was based on the belief that draining off a portion of the patient's blood could balance bodily humors, helping to cure diseases or restore health. It's worth mentioning that bloodletting is an outdated practice and not used in modern medicine. In conclusion, the word \\"letter\\" in these two sentences takes on different meanings. In the first one, it refers to a written message sent to an editor, while in the second, it's part of a compound word referring to a person who performed bloodletting.

Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power.

Choices: - budding - nuclear fission - sexual reproduction - binary fission A:","completion":"Bacteria reproduce primarily through a process called binary fission. In binary fission, a single bacterial cell, known as the parent cell, duplicates its genetic material (DNA) and then divides into two identical daughter cells. This is an asexual form of reproduction, meaning it does not require the exchange of genetic material between two different parent cells. The steps involved in binary fission are as follows: 1. Replication of DNA: The circular DNA molecule inside the bacterial cell replicates, creating two identical copies of genetic material. 2. Segregation of DNA: The replicated DNA molecules move to opposite ends of the cell. 3. Cytokinesis: The cell membrane and cell wall begin to grow inwards at the center of the cell, forming a septum that eventually divides the cell into two equal parts. 4. Separation: The two daughter cells separate, completing the binary fission process. Each daughter cell contains a complete copy of the parent cell's DNA and can continue to grow and divide. It's important to note that some bacteria are capable of exchanging genetic material through processes like conjugation, transformation, and transduction, but these methods are not the primary means of reproduction for bacteria. Instead, they serve as ways to create genetic diversity and promote adaptation within bacterial populations. So, the main mode of bacterial reproduction is binary fission."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

In this case, the antecedent for \\"he\\" is \\"Fred.\\" The context of the sentence provides enough information to deduce that \\"he\\" is in fact referring to Fred. The reason why we can conclude this is that the sentence structure suggests that the individual being emulated or followed by Steve is also the one influencing him significantly. Additionally, \\"Fred\\" is the only male noun mentioned before the pronoun \\"he.\\" To analyze and better understand this sentence, we can break it down into two main clauses: 1. Steve follows Fred's example in everything. 2. He influences him hugely. In the first clause, it is evident that Steve admires and follows Fred's actions or choices. The possessive noun, \\"Fred's example,\\" implies that Fred sets a pattern or exhibits behavior that Steve imitates.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose wound is dirty happens, how will it affect LESS SEVERE disease occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If a wound is dirty, it can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process, leading to a less severe disease. When a wound gets contaminated with dirt or other substances, it can affect the body's response to the infection and the infection itself in several ways. Here's a detailed explanation of how a dirty wound may lead to a less severe disease, considering the process you provided: 1. Skin is cut or damaged: When the skin is cut or damaged, it loses its natural barrier against the outside environment, including harmful bacteria and other pathogens. The presence of dirt in the wound area may introduce additional foreign particles and bacteria, which then have direct access to underlying tissues and blood vessels. 2. Bacteria enter through the wound: Bacteria present in the dirt can easily enter the wound, along with some other dirt particles. Usually, the immune system will respond to these invaders accordingly. However, some of the less harmful bacteria in the dirt may actually be competing with more harmful bacteria and limiting their growth (competitive exclusion). In this case, a dirty wound could potentially help reduce the severity of the disease, as the less harmful bacteria can suppress the growth of the more dangerous pathogens. 3. Bacteria reproduce and spread: When bacteria enter the wound, they reproduce and spread, initiating an immune response. As mentioned earlier, the presence of other less harmful bacteria in the dirty wound can compete for resources with more dangerous pathogens, which can slow down their growth rate. This decreases their ability to colonize and infect the surrounding tissues quickly, which may result in a less severe disease. 4. Causes symptoms: The presence of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from the damaged tissue and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from the bacteria can trigger an immune response, leading to inflammation and other symptoms. The immune system may respond more strongly to a dirty wound to eliminate the foreign particles and various bacteria. So, the presence of less harmful bacteria and foreign particles in the wound can lead to a relatively mild response, reducing the overall severity of the disease. 5. The bacteria is either fought off or becomes a disease: The immune system may successfully fight off the infection in a dirty wound, or it may develop into a disease. However, due to the competition between less harmful and more harmful bacteria, the overall impact of bacteria in a dirty wound may be less severe than if only harmful bacteria were present. By limiting the growth of the more aggressive bacteria, the less harmful microorganisms can indirectly contribute to a less severe disease. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis where the wound is dirty can have both direct and indirect effects on the process, potentially leading to a less severe disease. The presence of less harmful bacteria and other particles in the wound may contribute to a reduced bacterial growth rate, a milder immune response, and a lower likelihood of developing a severe infection. However, it's essential to note that dirty wounds also carry a higher risk of complications and severe infections, so proper wound care and treatment are crucial."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Bari (Bari dialect: Bare; \\"Bárion\\") is the capital city of the Metropolitan City of Bari and of the Apulia region, on the Adriatic Sea, in Italy. It is the second most important economic centre of mainland Southern Italy after Naples, and is well known as a port and university city, as well as the city of Saint Nicholas. The city itself has a population of about 326,799, , over , while the urban area counts 653,028 inhabitants over . The metropolitan area counts 1.3 million inhabitants. - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects. Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education. - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Lupus Protospatharius Barensis was the reputed author of the Chronicon rerum in regno Neapolitano gestarum ( also called Annales Lupi Protospatharii ) , a precise history of the Mezzogiorno from 805 to 1102 . He has only been named as the author since the seventeenth century . Lupus , along with two other Bariot chronicles , the Annales barenses and the Anonymi barensis chronicon , used some lost ancient annals of Bari up to 1051 . William of Apulia appears to have used these same annals . Lupus also used the lost annals of Matera . Perhaps most unusual to Lupus is his dating method . He began his years in September and so places events of the latter half of a given year in the next year . - The Normans (Norman: \\"Nourmands\\"; ) were the people who, in the 10th and 11th centuries, gave their name to Normandy, a region in France. They were descended from Norse (\\"Norman\\" comes from \\"Norseman\\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Gallo-Roman populations, their descendants would gradually adopt the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia, ultimately resulting in their own assimilation into the Romance society. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries. - William of Apulia was a chronicler of the Normans, writing in the 1090s. His Latin epic, Gesta Roberti Wiscardi (\\"The Deeds of Robert Guiscard\\"), written in hexameters, is one of the principal contemporary sources for the Norman conquest of southern Italy, especially the career of Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia (10591085). - Basilicata (or ), also known as Lucania, is a region in the south of Italy, bordering on Campania to the west, Apulia (\\"Puglia\\") to the north and east, and Calabria to the south. It also has two coastlines, one on the Tyrrhenian Sea between Campania and Calabria, and a longer coastline along the Gulf of Taranto between Calabria and Apulia. The region can be thought of as the \\"instep\\" of Italy, with Calabria functioning as the \\"toe\\" and Apulia the \\"heel\\". The region covers about and in 2010 had a population slightly under 600,000. The regional capital is Potenza. The region is divided into two provinces: Potenza and Matera. The president of Basilicata is Marcello Pittella. - Matera (or locally ) is a city and a province in the region of Basilicata, in Southern Italy. It is the capital of the province of Matera and the capital of Basilicata from 1663 to 1806. The town lies in a small canyon carved out by the Gravina. - Robert Guiscard ( 17 July 1085) was a Norman adventurer remembered for the conquest of southern Italy and Sicily. Robert was born into the Hauteville family in Normandy, went on to become Count of Apulia and Calabria (10571059), and then Duke of Apulia and Calabria and Duke of Sicily (10591085). - Saint Nicholas; (15 March 270 6 December 343), also called Nikolaos of Myra, was a historic 4th-century Christian saint and Greek Bishop of Myra, in Asia Minor (modern-day Demre, Turkey). Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nikolaos the Wonderworker. His reputation evolved among the faithful, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus through Sinterklaas. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City.

The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. - OGLE - TR - 113b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star OGLE - TR - 113 . In 2002 the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment ( OGLE ) detected periodic dimming in the star 's light curve indicating a transiting , planetary - sized object . Since low - mass red dwarfs and brown dwarfs may mimic a planet , radial velocity measurements were necessary to calculate the mass of the body . In 2004 , the object was proved to be a new transiting extrasolar planet . The planet has a mass 1.32 times that of Jupiter . Since the planet 's inclination is known , the value is exact . It orbits the star ( OGLE - TR - 113 ) in an extremely close orbit , even closer than the famous planets 51 Pegasi b and HD 209458 b. The planet races around the star every 1.43 days . The radius of the planet is only 9 % larger than Jupiter 's , despite the heating effect by the star . Planets of its kind are sometimes called \`\` super-hot Jupiters '' . - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - OGLE-TR-113 is a dim, distant magnitude 16 binary star in the star fields of the constellation Carina. Because of its distance of about 1800 light years, and location in a crowded field it was not notable in any way.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the orchestra to whose funds Bould always contributed his share of the recording fees? from the following article ? In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post. A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre. In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

Step 4: Incorporate the main elements into a sentence - Using the subject (model), verb (appear), and object (magazine cover), we can now create a sentence. Step 5: Add detail or context if necessary - Given that the sentence only needs to include the words 'appear,' 'cover,' 'magazine,' and 'model,' no additional detail or context is needed.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: How do you store anchovies? Options: [i] Put them in a air tight container and place the container in the fridge.. [ii] Put them in a ziploc bag and place them in the freezer..","completion":"I choose option [i] Put them in an air tight container and place the container in the fridge. Here is how I do this step-by-step: 1. First, obtain an air tight container that is appropriate for the quantity of anchovies you want to store. The container should be clean and preferably made of glass or food-grade plastic. 2. If the anchovies are in a can, transfer them carefully into the container in order to avoid damaging or mashing them. Preserve the oil from the can, as it will help to maintain the flavor and freshness of the anchovies. 3. If the anchovies are fresh, clean them first by removing their heads, gutting them, and rinsing them thoroughly in cold water. Then, arrange them neatly in the container. 4. If you are storing canned anchovies, cover the anchovies in the container with the oil from the can to create a protective barrier against air exposure. This will help to keep them moist and flavorful. 5. If you are storing fresh anchovies, it is recommended to add a layer of salt and a bit of olive oil to the container, as this will help to preserve them and extend their shelf life. 6. Seal the container by attaching the lid securely. Check that the container is air tight and that no air can get in, as this will help to maintain the freshness of the anchovies. 7. Lastly, place the container in the fridge. Store it at a temperature between 34°F to 40°F (1°C to 4°C) to ensure maximum freshness. Regularly check the anchovies to make sure that they remain in good condition. By following these steps, I can properly store anchovies and keep them fresh for future use. Storing them in the fridge in an air tight container provides an optimal environment for them, as it keeps them cool and protected from potential contaminants. This method allows for better preservation compared to storing them in the freezer, as freezing can alter the texture and flavor of the anchovies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This battle saw the unsupported division of General Douay of I Corps, with some attached cavalry, which was posted to watch the border, attacked in overwhelming but uncoordinated fashion by the German 3rd Army. During the day, elements of a Bavarian and two Prussian corps became engaged and were aided by Prussian artillery, which blasted holes in the defenses of the town. Douay held a very strong position initially, thanks to the accurate long-range fire of the Chassepots but his force was too thinly stretched to hold it. Douay was killed in the late morning when a caisson of the divisional mitrailleuse battery exploded near him; the encirclement of the town by the Prussians threatened the French avenue of retreat.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Terminator Genisys review: Arnie's back, but the lustre isn't He is, inevitably, back. Again. The Terminator franchise stumbles out of the wreckage of the critically savaged sequel Salvation, this time with the participation of the original model, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the lavish endorsement of series co-creator James Cameron. Salvation “sucked” and Genisys, we’ve been told, is a new dawn. In this alternate timeline, the genius of 1984’s splendidly cheesy The Terminator and its sleek, superior follow-up Terminator 2: Judgment Day, are the only history that matters. It’s the kind of thing the fans want to hear. But the reality is that Terminator Genisys is part remake, part reboot, mostly failure. Sold simultaneously on the promise of returning to the franchise’s roots and innovating for a new generation, instead, Thor: The Dark World director Alan Taylor’s sequel apes the first two films’ iconicism, but falls short of achieving any in its own right. Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is sent back in time by John Connor (Jason Clarke) to protect his mother, Sarah Connor (Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke), from the Terminator. Reese arrives in 1984 as per the original film, but – somehow (something about a “nexus”) – the timeline’s altered and in this reality it’s Sarah looking out for Kyle. They’re aided by a version of the Terminator (re-christened the Guardian and played by Schwarzenegger) that’s been watching out for Sarah since an attack on her family by the machines left her orphaned as a child. She calls him “Pops”, while he – still, in any timeline you like, a machine – finds her affection baffling. Related: Hasta la vista, gramps! Arnie to shoot sixth Terminator as he nears 70 The first hour of the film sees Taylor recreating Cameron’s original in a style similar to Gus van Sant’s shot-by-shot remake of Psycho. There’s the yellow dump truck, a lookalike of its cigar-chomping driver and naked CGI Arnold, crouched in the shallow blasted out by his time-travelling orb. The punks are still there, still wondering what’s wrong with this picture. Kyle’s feathercut has gone, but he still pulls on his stolen high tops languorously enough to give the Nike branding a good showing. It’s an elaborate exercise in nostalgia that will delight the faithful and confuse the newcomer. The second half of the film is for them, where Genisys spins off into a peppy, self-aware parody of everything that made the early films unique. The lore is disconnected and rewired, making for a confusing, but sporadically entertaining ride for anyone who remembers the originals. At times Taylor offers a Comic Relief sketch version of The Terminator: more ridiculous than revolutionary. Genisys – because of its 12A certification – lacks the first two chapters’ wallop. Cameron’s films were unusual for mainstream cinema in that they sutured violence to character to give it meaning. The Terminator was murderous without thought, but with cause. The gore – the body horror of the Terminator repairing an eye socket or flaying an arm to prove a point – was grounded in the story. The slaughter of humanity felt real. There’s no fear here. No real sense of dread. The techno-paranoid get an Apple-ish operating system (the Genisys of the title) to worry about, but a tablet can’t inspire terror. The CGI doesn’t look to have evolved much from Judgement Day. The film feels soft and phoney. In the original Terminator Kyle Reese described how the humans could tell when the robots were trying to pass themselves off as alive: “They had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.” Watching Genisys, you can relate. Salvation was boring, but Genisys makes you sad. Risk-averse Hollywood has made a crash-test dummy of a once great franchise, simply throwing everything at it to see what it stands. It’s heartbreaking to watch Arnie execute the same old programmes: the terrible robo-smile; the slang; the wear and tear of his living tissue revealing the cyborg underneath. “Old, but not obsolete,” the Terminator/Guardian tells us when his age is brought into question. In truth, it feels like both. In a sense, the Terminator franchise wrote the code for Hollywood’s current creative stagnation. Judgment Day redefined the action genre, CGI and the star system, creating a thirst for sequels that still leads studio decision-making today. It was a radical film, one that escaped the B-movie trappings of its predecessor by locking into a genuinely terrifying vision of mankind supplanted. Cameron wasn’t scared to move on either. The penultimate scene – with the Terminator sacrificing himself to save the future – implied the director was quitting while he was ahead. Related: Terminator 5: how to reanimate the ailing sci-fi franchise Today – with our rebooted, rebooted Spider-Man and ever-expanding “cinematic universes” – not even death can kill a pop culture hero. Yet Genisys’s alternate universe yarn smacks of a particular desperation: the nuclear option in Hollywood’s War on Jeopardy. Cameron has called this “the official” third Terminator film, but it’s just another sequel. There’s talk of two more of these. They are on the production line, being built now to make our future just that little bit more drab. The war is over. The machines have won. Summary:","completion":"\\"Terminator Genisys\\" is a movie that is part of the Terminator series with Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is a famous actor and used to be a strong man. This movie is like a new start for the Terminator story. People were hoping it would be really fun and exciting like the first two Terminator movies, but it didn't live up to their expectations.

Answer the following question: Two stars have just been discovered that are identical in terms of chemical composition. The scientist who discovered them was given the right to name them, and he chose the names Enterprise and Vader. As said before, these stars are very similar, but the main difference is that Vader is a red giant, and Enterprise is not. Scientists are very eager to study these two newly discovered stars and see if they can learn anything new from them. Does Enterprise have more or less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader does? Hint: A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula system. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Enterprise, which is not a red giant, has less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader. In a red giant like Vader, hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel, and as a result, the fusion reactions now occur primarily in a shell surrounding the core. The expansion of the outer layers of a red giant contributes to the huge size and increased luminosity of the star. On the other hand, Enterprise is not a red giant, implying that it is likely in an earlier phase of its stellar life when hydrogen fusion reactions are still taking place in its core. Therefore, the amount of fusion reactions happening in the shell around the core of the Enterprise star would be significantly less compared to Vader."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are less or more ): Ulysses pilots his drill ship deep into the Earth's core, then back up. His ship is subjected to less or more temperature and pressure at the surface? A:","completion":"As Ulysses pilots his drill ship deep into the Earth's core, and then back up, his ship is subjected to changes in both temperature and pressure based on the depths reached during the journey. When comparing the conditions at the Earth's surface to those deeper within the planet, we can determine how the temperature and pressure vary. Temperature and pressure increase as we go deeper into the Earth. This is due to the heat generated by the decay of radioactive elements and the residual heat from Earth's formation. Additionally, the pressure increases because of the weight of the overlying rocks and materials. The deeper we go, the higher the temperature and pressure become. At the Earth's core, which lies about 6,371 kilometers beneath the surface, the temperature is estimated to reach around 5,000 to 7,000 degrees Celsius (9,000 to 12,600 degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure is approximately 3,500,000 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"To answer your first two questions, I will provide some good punching bag workout recommendations for beginners and good punching bag cardio workouts. Then, I will address whether these questions can be considered the same. 1. Good punching bag workouts for beginners: Step 1: Warm-up. Before starting punching bag workouts, it's important to warm up your body. Some light jogging or jumping jacks followed by stretching can help prevent injuries. Step 2: Basic punches. Focus on mastering basic punches like the jab, cross, hook, and uppercut. Start by practicing each punch one at a time, using correct form and keeping your hands up to protect your face. Step 3: Combinations. Combine the basic punches into simple combinations. A popular combination for beginners is 'jab-cross-hook' or '1-2-3'. Practice these combinations slowly at first, then increase speed and power as you become more comfortable. Step 4: Footwork and movement. Incorporate footwork and movement around the punching bag to simulate moving around an opponent. Practice stepping in and out, pivoting, and maintaining balance while throwing punches. Step 5: Rounds and rest. Start with 1 to 2 minutes rounds, followed by a 30 seconds to 1-minute rest. As you progress, you can increase the length of your rounds and decrease rest times. 2. Good punching bag cardio workouts: Step 1: Warm-up. A proper warm-up remains essential when focusing on cardio workouts. Step 2: High-intensity intervals. Incorporate high-intensity rounds where you throw punches as fast as possible for 30 seconds to 1 minute, followed by a short active rest period (e.g., 30 seconds). Step 3: Mixing in bodyweight exercises. Add exercises like burpees, jumping jacks, or mountain climbers in between punching intervals to increase your cardio demand. Step 4: Incorporate footwork drills. As mentioned earlier, footwork is important, and you can use this as a part of your cardio workouts. Shuffle around the punching bag, changing direction, and incorporating punches while continuously moving. Step 5: Timed rounds and rest. Increase the duration of your rounds to 3 minutes with a 30 seconds to 1-minute rest. Aim for a total of 20-30 minutes of active punching and movement. Regarding whether these two questions are the same: While they are related, they are not exactly the same. The first question asks for beginner punching bag workouts, mainly focusing on learning techniques and building a foundation. The second question emphasizes cardio workouts, which are focused on improving cardiovascular endurance and burning calories. However, both questions overlap, as beginners may also be interested in cardio-based workouts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Valley has a more fertile soil, it's not overgrazed, and the trees and bushes are abundant, and the productivity has increased several fold over the past decade. Biodiversity in the Valley is varied, and the soils are nutritious and retain more water, nitrogen and carbon. Which area experiences less soil erosion? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the Valley experiences less soil erosion compared to the Gorge. The factors contributing to this conclusion can be analyzed by examining each aspect of the two regions mentioned in the description. 1. Deforestation: The Gorge has been subjected to deforestation, which leads to numerous negative consequences, including soil degradation and increased erosion. When trees are removed from an area, their roots no longer hold the soil together, leaving it susceptible to erosion by wind and water. Additionally, trees play a crucial role in the water cycle by absorbing water from the soil and releasing it into the atmosphere as water vapor. This process prevents the soil from becoming saturated with water, which can contribute to reduced erosion. In contrast, the Valley still has abundant trees and bushes, providing stability to the soil and reducing erosion. 2. Fertility and plant cover: The Valley has more fertile soil than the Gorge. Fertile soil supports a greater variety of plants and vegetation, which in turn helps prevent erosion by binding the soil together with their roots. The abundant plant life also slows down water runoff, reducing the force at which the water impacts and dislodges soil particles. 3. Overgrazing: The Gorge may be overgrazed, which means that too many animals are grazing in the area. Overgrazing leads to the destruction of plant life and the loss of root structure in the soil, which makes it more prone to erosion. The Valley, on the other hand, is not overgrazed, preserving its plant cover and reducing soil erosion. 4. Biodiversity: The Valley has a higher level of biodiversity than the Gorge. This is likely due to the more favorable environmental conditions – fertile soil, abundant plant life, and a lack of overgrazing – that promote a healthy ecosystem. A varied ecosystem with a diverse array of plant and animal life can create a more resilient landscape that is less prone to erosion and other environmental issues. 5. Soil composition and retention: The Valley's soil is not only more nutritious but also better at retaining water, nitrogen, and carbon. These characteristics contribute to a healthier ecosystem and reduce soil erosion by promoting strong plant growth and helping the soil bind together. High water retention capabilities in the soil can also prevent excessive runoff and reduce erosion caused by water flow. In conclusion, the Valley experiences less soil erosion due to factors such as the presence of abundant trees and bushes, fertile soil, limited overgrazing, a diverse ecosystem, and the soil's retention capabilities. These factors create a more resilient landscape, protecting the soil from erosion and maintaining a healthier environment. In contrast, the Gorge suffers from negative consequences of deforestation and overgrazing, making it more vulnerable to soil erosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who had an optimistic forecast initially?, using the article: After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship,..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person who had an optimistic forecast initially is Frank. Frank Wild initially estimated that the Elephant Island party would have to wait one month for rescue and did not allow long-term stockpiling of food resources as he believed it to be defeatist.

Dodgson's family was predominantly northern English, with Irish connections, conservative and High Church Anglican. Most of Dodgson's male ancestors were army officers or Church of England clergy. His great-grandfather, also named Charles Dodgson, had risen through the ranks of the church to become the Bishop of Elphin. His paternal grandfather, another Charles, had been an army captain, killed in action in Ireland in 1803 when his two sons were hardly more than babies. The older of these sons - yet another Charles Dodgson - was Carroll's father. He went to Westminster School and then to Christ Church, Oxford. He reverted to the other family tradition and took holy orders. He was mathematically gifted and won a double first degree, which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead, he married his first cousin Frances Jane Lutwidge in 1827 and became a country parson. Dodgson was born in the small parsonage at Daresbury in Cheshire near the towns of Warrington and Runcorn, the eldest boy but already the third child of the four-and-a-half-year-old marriage. Eight more children followed. When Charles was 11, his father was given the living of Croft-on-Tees in North Yorkshire, and the whole family moved to the spacious rectory. This remained their home for the next 25 years. Charles's father was an active and highly conservative cleric of the Church of England who later became the Archdeacon of Richmond and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the church. He was high church, inclining to Anglo-Catholicism, an admirer of John Henry Newman and the Tractarian movement, and did his best to instil such views in his children. Young Charles was to develop an ambiguous relationship with his father's values and with the Church of England as a whole. The young adult Charles Dodgson was about 6 feet (1.83 m) tall and slender, and he had curly brown hair and blue or grey eyes (depending on the account). He was described in later life as somewhat asymmetrical, and as carrying himself rather stiffly and awkwardly, although this might be on account of a knee injury sustained in middle age. As a very young child, he suffered a fever that left him deaf in one ear. At the age of 17, he suffered a severe attack of whooping cough, which was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life. Another defect which he carried into adulthood was what he referred to as his \\"hesitation\\", a stammer that he acquired in early childhood and which plagued him throughout his life. The stammer has always been a significant part of the image of Dodgson. It is said that he stammered only in adult company and was free and fluent with children, but there is no evidence to support this idea. Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer, while many adults failed to notice it. Dodgson himself seems to have been far more acutely aware of it than most people whom he met; it is said that he caricatured himself as the Dodo in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, referring to his difficulty in pronouncing his last name, but this is one of the many \\"facts\\" often repeated for which no first-hand evidence remains. He did indeed refer to himself as the dodo, but whether or not this reference was to his stammer is simply speculation. Dodgson's stammer did trouble him, but it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. He lived in a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, and the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer. He reportedly could sing tolerably well and was not afraid to do so before an audience. He was adept at mimicry and storytelling, and was reputedly quite good at charades. In broad terms, Dodgson has traditionally been regarded as politically, religiously, and personally conservative. Martin Gardner labels Dodgson as a Tory who was \\"awed by lords and inclined to be snobbish towards inferiors.\\" The Reverend W. Tuckwell, in his Reminiscences of Oxford (1900), regarded him as \\"austere, shy, precise, absorbed in mathematical reverie, watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative in political, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares like Alice's landscape.\\" Dodgson was ordained a deacon in the Church of England on December 22, 1861. In The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll, the editor states that \\"his Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself and his work, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred and private to be reproduced here) that God would forgive him the past, and help him to perform His holy will in the future.\\" When a friend asked him about his religious views, Dodgson wrote in response that he was a member of the Church of England, but \\"doubt[ed] if he was fully a 'High Churchman'\\". He added: I believe that when you and I come to lie down for the last time, if only we can keep firm hold of the great truths Christ taught us--our own utter worthlessness and His infinite worth; and that He has brought us back to our one Father, and made us His brethren, and so brethren to one another--we shall have all we need to guide us through the shadows. Most assuredly I accept to the full the doctrines you refer to--that Christ died to save us, that we have no other way of salvation open to us but through His death, and that it is by faith in Him, and through no merit of ours, that we are reconciled to God; and most assuredly I can cordially say, \\"I owe all to Him who loved me, and died on the Cross of Calvary.\\" Dodgson also expressed interest in other fields. He was an early member of the Society for Psychical Research, and one of his letters suggests that he accepted as real what was then called \\"thought reading\\". Dodgson wrote some studies of various philosophical arguments. In 1895, he developed a philosophical regressus-argument on deductive reasoning in his article \\"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\\", which appeared in one of the early volumes of Mind. The article was reprinted in the same journal a hundred years later in 1995, with a subsequent article by Simon Blackburn titled \\"Practical Tortoise Raising\\". Answer this question \\"What was his views on philosophy?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Dodgson was interested in philosophy and developed a philosophical regressus-argument on deductive reasoning. He produced this argument in his article \\"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\\", which appeared in one of the early volumes of the philosophical journal \\"Mind\\".

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the movie review sentence, I will analyze the words and phrases used, and assess the tone or emotions that are conveyed. Step 1: Break down the sentence into individual words and phrases. Key phrases in the sentence include: - which also is n't embarrassed - to make you reach for the tissues Step 2: Evaluate the sentiment of each phrase. - \\"which also is n't embarrassed\\" has a neutral sentiment, as it is stating that the movie doesn't shy away from something. - \\"to make you reach for the tissues\\" is a phrase that indicates the movie is emotional, as reaching for tissues typically signifies that the movie affected the audience emotionally (e.g. making them cry). Step 3: Combine the sentiments of the phrases to determine the overall sentiment of the sentence. Considering both phrases, the overall sentiment of the sentence is positive. The sentence states that the movie is not embarrassed to elicit an emotional response, such as making the audience cry.

When the claims against Mr Baupin first surfaced in two media outlets, several commentators pointed to a book published last month, The Elysee Off, in which the authors described an incident involving Mr Sapin and an unnamed female journalist covering the Davos summit in January 2015. \\"Don't dare pick up a pen in front of him,\\" they warn. According to their version of events, Mr Sapin saw the journalist's underwear exposed, said \\"Ah, but what have we here?\\", and then twanged her knicker elastic. Pressed to respond to the story by reporters on Tuesday, Mr Sapin on two occasions rejected it outright, warning he would take \\"every action necessary\\" to defend himself against \\"inaccurate and libellous allegations\\".

They evaluated several options and decided to follow these steps in order to complete the task successfully: 1. Measure the table dimensions: The first step was to accurately measure the table's length, width, and height. This would help the team understand the exact size of the table and compare it with the dimensions of the entrance doorway. Justification: Knowing the table's dimensions is crucial in determining whether any adjustments need to be made before attempting to move it inside the house. 2. Assess the entrance doorway's dimensions: The team measured the entrance doorway's height and width to determine if any structural alterations are necessary. Justification: Comparing the doorway's dimensions with the table's dimensions would allow the movers to determine the best possible way of bringing the table inside the house. 3. Disassemble the table, if possible: If the table could be disassembled, the team would separate the legs from the tabletop, which would make it easier to move it through the entrance doorway. Justification: Disassembling the table would make it more compact and easier to maneuver through tighter spaces. 4. Rotate the table: If the table couldn't be disassembled, the team considered changing its orientation as an option to fit it through the entrance doorway. They would tilt the table on its side or turn it diagonally to create more clearance space. Justification: Rotating the table could potentially provide more room to work with when passing it through the entrance doorway. 5. Remove the entrance door: As a last resort, the team considered removing the entrance door temporarily to create more space to move the table inside. Justification: Removing the door would increase the width of the entrance, making it easier to bring the table inside without causing any damage to the table or the doorway. By following these steps, the team successfully moved the table into the house without causing any damage. They then reassembled the table, if necessary, and carried on with the furniture moving process.

The","completion":"metal rod, being more durable and less susceptible to wear and tear, would provide a more stable support system for the electrical appliances and wiring that were to be installed. Besides ensuring safety and reliability, the metal rod would also offer a longer lifespan for the setup, reducing the need for frequent replacements or maintenance. When the electrician began the process of replacing the beam, he first assessed the dimensions and load-bearing capacity of the existing wooden beam. This was crucial in determining the appropriate size and strength of the metal rod that would be used to provide the necessary support. After thorough calculations, the electrician sourced a high-quality metal rod with the right specifications from a reputable supplier. Before installing the new metal rod, the electrician made sure to take proper precautions. He turned off the power supply to the area where the replacement was taking place, to minimize the risks of injury or accidental electrocution. As an extra precaution, he also used insulated tools and wore protective gear, such as gloves and goggles, while conducting the task. To remove the wooden beam, the electrician had to carefully dismantle the attached electrical appliances and wiring. This required skill and precision, as any damage to the wiring or appliances could lead to future electrical issues or malfunctions. Once the appliances and wiring were disconnected, the electrician then proceeded to securely remove the wooden beam from its current position. Now that the wooden beam was out, the electrician set about preparing the location for the installation of the metal rod. This involved creating any necessary mounting points or brackets that would be required to hold the metal rod in place. These mounting points would need to be strong and sturdy, to ensure that the metal rod could bear the weight of the electrical appliances and wiring without any issues. With the mounting points established, the electrician proceeded to install the metal rod. This was a meticulous process, as it was essential to align the metal rod correctly to ensure optimal structural support and stability. Once the rod was positioned properly, it was securely fastened to the mounting points with appropriate fasteners, such as bolts or screws. With the metal rod now in place, the electrician reattached the electrical appliances and wiring, making sure that all the connections were secure, accurate, and functioning correctly. He also took this opportunity to double-check the electrical setup for any potential risks or hazards, to ensure that safety was maintained throughout the entire system. Finally, the electrician restored power to the area and conducted a thorough test of the entire electrical system. This involved checking the performance of each electrical appliance, confirming that all the wiring connections were working correctly, and verifying that the metal rod provided the necessary support and stability for the setup. In conclusion, the replacement of the wooden beam with a metal rod significantly improved the safety, reliability, and longevity of the electrical system. The electrician's expertise and meticulous approach ensured a seamless transition from the old wooden beam to the new metal rod, allowing the electrical appliances and wiring to function on a stable and secure foundation. This ultimately benefited the users of the electrical system, as they could trust that the system was functioning optimally and would continue to do so for an extended period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many of the world's great cities are located on rivers, and almost every country has at least one river running through it that plays an important part in the lives of its people. Since the beginning of history, people have used rivers for transportation. The longest one in the United States is the Mississippi. The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile. To the people of India, the Ganges is great, but it is also important for transportation; ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeastern Asia. The greatest of all for navigation , however, is the Amazon in Brazil . It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles up it. Besides transportation, rivers give food to eat, water to drink, water for crops, and chances for fun. In order to increase the supply of water for crops, engineers sometimes build a dam across a river and let a lake form behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located on rivers often cause problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals and other materials. People are learning the importance, however, of doing more to keep their rivers clean if they want to enjoy the benefits of these natural resources.

Write an article based on this summary: Fraudsters who target vulnerable victims, such as the elderly, in England and Wales face harsher sentences, under new guidelines. Article:","completion":"Title: New Guidelines Impose Harsher Sentences for Fraudsters Targeting Vulnerable Victims in England and Wales Introduction: In an attempt to crack down on financial fraud targeting vulnerable individuals, new sentencing guidelines have been introduced in England and Wales. These guidelines aim to impose harsher sentences on fraudsters who exploit vulnerable victims, such as the elderly, as a means to deter potential criminals and protect those who are most susceptible to these heinous acts. Step 1: Understanding the new guidelines The sentencing guidelines have been implemented to tackle crime that targets vulnerable victims, with a particular focus on offenders preying on those who suffer from mental or physical incapacity, the elderly, or people in dire financial circumstances. These revised guidelines come in response to a growing concern about the pervasiveness of financial crimes against these vulnerable groups. Step 2: Identifying the impact of fraud on vulnerable victims Fraudsters who prey on vulnerable victims often have a devastating impact on the lives of these individuals. In many cases, the victims may lose their life savings, face serious financial difficulties, and suffer from emotional trauma as a result of these crimes. As such, these new guidelines have been introduced to ensure that fraudsters face justice and that vulnerable victims are offered a greater level of protection. Step 3: Explaining the harsher sentences for offenders Under the new guidelines, judges have been given clear instructions to consider the vulnerability of the victims as a significant aggravating factor when passing a sentence. This means that those convicted of financial fraud against vulnerable victims may face considerably longer prison sentences than they would have under the previous guidelines. Step 4: Highlighting case studies and examples To illustrate the effectiveness of these new sentencing guidelines, several cases can be referenced where malicious individuals have been prosecuted and punished accordingly. For instance, a fraudster who stole tens of thousands of pounds from dementia sufferers was sentenced to six years in prison, while another individual who extorted significant sums of money from elderly individuals under the guise of false investment opportunities received a lengthy nine-year sentence. Step 5: Discussing the potential impact of the new guidelines The implementation of these new guidelines is expected to have a significant impact on the rates of financial fraud against vulnerable victims. By imposing harsher sentences on those who exploit the elderly and other vulnerable groups, the justice system is sending a strong message that this type of behavior will not be tolerated. Additionally, these guidelines should serve as a deterrent to potential criminals, demonstrating that justice will be served swiftly and severely. Conclusion: The introduction of these new sentencing guidelines in England and Wales demonstrates a strong commitment to protecting vulnerable individuals from financial fraud. Through the imposition of harsher sentences, it is hoped that those who would prey on such vulnerable targets will be deterred, and the victims of these reprehensible acts will finally receive the justice they deserve. The criminal justice system must continue to adapt and respond to the evolving threats posed by fraudsters to ensure the ongoing safety and security of society's most vulnerable citizens."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

PUBLISHED:. 09:35 EST, 12 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:33 EST, 12 September 2013. Nasa has narrowed down the hunt for an asteroid that it can capture and put it into orbit around the moon. The space agency said it has found three suitable asteroids, one of which it hopes it can put into lunar orbit using a robotic space lasso. Once in orbit, astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the Orion spacecraft by as early as 2021. The space agency said it has identified three asteroids, one of which it hopes it can put into lunar orbit using a robotic space lasso. This artist's rendering shows what capturing an asteroid could look like. The asteroids are all between seven and 10m in size, but further tests will need to be conducted to determine their suitability, said scientists at a conference in San Diego, California. ‘We have two to three which we will characterise in the next year and if all goes well... those will be valid candidates that could be certified targets,’ said Paul Chodas, senior scientist at the Nasa Near-Earth Object Program Office. The mission hopes to gather useful information that will help protect the Earth from a potential hazardous asteroid collision, as well as the technology to enable for future human missions to deep space. Once in orbit, astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the Orion spacecraft by as early as 2021. NASA would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide. They would then tow or push it towards Earth so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon. In. 2021 astronauts would then use an Orion capsule - a manned spacecraft -. to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for. analysis. This asteroid would also, probably in the 2030s, be used as a stop-off point for astronauts on their way to Mars. Last month, the latest version of the plan was revealed in an animation. Exact details on how Nasa plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not yet known, but the rendering shows it is captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag. The mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. Though it bares a striking resemblance to the earlier Apollo Spacecraft, Orion can hold more crew and is far-more advanced, said Nasa. Up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid, compared to the maximum three in Apollo, in a trip that utilises both solar power and the Moon’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft, according to the video. After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object. Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. After the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loop around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video. The project, which envisions that astronauts could visit such an asteroid as early as 2021, is included in President Obama's £11.5 billion spending plan for the U.S. space agency for the 2014 tax year. It is intended as an expansion of existing initiatives to find asteroids that may be on a collision course with Earth, and as part of preparations for a human expedition to Mars in the 2030s. ‘This mission allows us to better develop our technology and systems to explore farther than we've ever been before - to an asteroid and to Mars - places that humanity has dreamed about … but has had no hope of ever attaining,’ Nasa administrator Charles Bolden said. Using a combination of solar power and gravity-aided thrust, the Orion will make the 10 day trip to the asteroid. ‘We're on the threshold of being able to tell my kids and my grandkids that we're almost there.’ Interest in potentially threatening asteroids sky-rocketed after a small asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia on February 15, shattering windows and damaging buildings. About 1,500 people were injured by flying glass and debris. The same day another larger asteroid passed about 17,200 miles from Earth - closer than the television and communication satellites that ring the planet. The incidents had created an imperative ‘to develop techniques and technology that will help deter or to keep an asteroid or other type of body from impacting Earth,’ Mr Bolden said. ‘One of the serendipitous results from this [asteroid-retrieval] flight we hope will be the demonstration of a capability to move an asteroid, to deflect it ever so slightly.’ Mr Obama is also requesting £535 million to support efforts to develop commercial space taxis in hopes of breaking Russia's monopoly on crew transportation to the space station by 2017. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1. NASA has identified three suitable asteroids for a mission to capture and put one into orbit around the Moon. 2. The space agency plans to use a robotic space lasso to capture an asteroid and then bring it into lunar orbit. 3. Astronauts may be able to visit the space rock using the Orion spacecraft by as early as 2021. 4. The asteroids are between seven and 10 meters in size, and further tests will be conducted to determine their suitability. 5. The mission aims to gather information to help protect Earth from potential asteroid collisions and develop technology for future human missions to deep space. 6. The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle will be used to transport astronauts to the asteroid, and it can hold up to four people. 7.

John Doubleday (about 1798 – 25 January 1856) was a British craftsperson, restorer, and dealer in antiquities who was employed by the British Museum for the last 20 years of his life. He undertook several duties for the museum, not least as a witness in criminal trials, but was primarily their specialist restorer, perhaps the first person to hold the position. He is best known for his 1845 restoration of the severely-damaged Roman Portland Vase, an accomplishment that places him at the forefront of his profession at the time. While at the British Museum, Doubleday also dealt in copies of coins, medals, and ancient seals. His casts in coloured sulphur and in white metal of works in both national and private collections, allowed smaller collections to hold copies at a fraction of the price that the originals would command. Thousands of his copies entered the collections of institutions and individuals. Yet the accuracy he achieved led to confusion with the originals; after his death he was labelled a forger, but with the caveat that \\"[w]hether he did copies with the intention of deceiving collectors or not is open to doubt\\".Little is known about Doubleday's upbringing or personal life. Several sources describe him as an American, including the 1851 United Kingdom census, which records him as a New York-born British subject. An obituary noted that he worked at a printer's shop for more than 20 years during his youth, which gave him the experience of casting type that he would employ in his later career as a copyist.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: In what year was the album War completed? ? After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

Please answer the following question: Information: - A stunt performer, often referred to as a stuntman, stuntwoman, or daredevil, is someone who performs dangerous stunts, often as a career. - Traditional heavy metal, also known as classic metal, or traditional metal, is the seminal genre of heavy metal music before the genre \\"evolved and splintered into many different styles and subgenres.\\" - Reality television is a genre of television programming that documents supposedly unscripted real-life situations, and often features an otherwise unknown cast of individuals who are typically not professional actors, although in some shows celebrities may participate. It differs from documentary television in that the focus tends to be on drama, personal conflict, and entertainment rather than educating viewers. The genre has various standard tropes, including \\"confessionals\\" (also called \\"talking heads\\" or \\"interview segments\\") used by cast members to express their thoughts, which often double as the shows' narration. In competition-based reality shows, a notable subset, there are other common elements such as one participant being eliminated per episode, a panel of judges, and the concept of \\"immunity from elimination.\\" - Blooddrunk is the sixth album by Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom, released on April 7, 2008, through Spinefarm Records. The album includes a re-recorded version single for \\"Tie My Rope\\". Various editions feature one or two cover songs as bonus tracks. The limited edition digipak version of the album includes a bonus DVD with 5.1 surround mixes of all songs and the video and making-of for \\"Blooddrunk\\". It sold 20,000 copies during its first week of release. - Viva La Bam is an American reality television series that starred Bam Margera and his friends and family. The show was a spin-off from MTV's \\"Jackass\\", in which Margera and most of the main cast had appeared. Each episode had a specific theme, mission, or challenge which was normally accomplished by performing pranks, skateboarding, and enlisting the help of friends, relations and experts. Although partly improvised, the show was supported by a greater degree of planning and organization. - Children of Bodom is a melodic death metal band from Espoo, Finland. Formed in 1993, the group currently consists of Alexi Laiho (vocals, lead guitar), Janne Wirman (keyboards), Henkka Seppälä (bass), Jaska Raatikainen (drums) and Daniel Freyberg (rhythm guitar). In total they have released nine studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, two compilation albums and one DVD. - Melodic death metal (also referred to as melodeath or MDM) is a subgenre death metal that employs highly melodic guitar riffs, often borrowing from traditional heavy metal. The style originated and developed in Sweden (pioneered by At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity and In Flames) and the United Kingdom (pioneered by Carcass) during the early and mid-1990s. The Swedish death metal scene did much to popularize the style, soon centering in the \\"Gothenburg metal\\" scene. - \`\` Tie My Rope '' is a 2007 song from the Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom . The song is from Children of Bodom 's sixth studio album , Blooddrunk . The song was also included on Viva La Bands , Vol. 2 , a compilation album from the program Viva La Bam and the tracks on the album were selected by star Bam Margera . Musically , \`\` Tie My Rope '' bears a resemblance to songs from Children of Bodom 's album Are You Dead Yet ? , and was a product of the band 's exploration of their 1980s metal influences . In contrast to all of their past material , the keyboards have a much darker sound that blend in with the overall song . In addition , the overall usage of keyboards in the songs seem to be much more present than songs in Are You Dead Yet ? . The song was re-recorded for the actual album . - Swedish death metal is a death metal music scene developed in Sweden. Many Swedish death metal bands are associated with the melodic death metal movement, thus giving Swedish death metal a different sound from other variations of death metal. Unlike American death metal groups, the first Swedish bands were rooted in punk rock. Although Norway is known for its quantity of black metal, Gothenburg in Sweden has a large melodic death metal scene, while Stockholm is known for its more raw death metal scene. - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods.

If your blinds have too much built up dirt, a simple dusting may not totally clean them. A deeper clean for wood blinds requires you to use water. Do not mix any cleaners or chemicals with the water. The chemicals in traditional cleaners can create stains and streaks that can ruin your blinds. Wood blinds that make prolonged contact with water can cause your blinds to spot and warp. To avoid this, lightly dab your cloth and wring it out before you use it. You only need a little bit of water to dampen your cloth, not totally saturate it. Positioning your wooden slats to an almost closed position will make wiping each individual slat easier. Using your damp rag, wipe each slat from left to right. Once you are done wiping one side, make sure that also wipe the other side. Make sure to scrub harder on areas with stains, using a circular motion. Water can warp, discolor, or create spotting on wood blinds. To prevent this from happening, make sure that you get all of the water off the blinds with a dry rag. You can dry each slat with a microfiber cloth, dry sock, or a soft cotton rag. Clean the other side of your wooden slats by angling them onto the other side and repeat the process of wiping them down and drying them.

Summarize this article: DETROIT A Satanic organization unveiled a controversial bronze Baphomet sculpture in Detroit just before midnight on Saturday, after trying in vain to have it installed near a 10 Commandments monument in Oklahoma. Due to planned demonstrations, the group, which is opposed to Bible-themed displays on government land, kept the location of the unveiling of its 9-foot-tall monument secret until the last moment, when it emailed the information to ticket holders. The Satanic Temple unveiled the one-ton statue at an industrial building near the Detroit River just before 11:30 p.m. local time as supporters cheered, \\"Hail Satan.\\" Some of the hundreds in attendance rushed to pose for photos. The statue of a winged Baphomet with a human body and a goat's head resembled a design the group previously released. Statues of a boy and a girl stood in poses of adoration on either side. Jex Blackmore, director of the Satanic Temple Detroit chapter, said temple members planned to transport the sculpture to Arkansas, where earlier this year the governor signed a bill authorizing a 10 Commandments monument on the State Capitol's grounds. The Temple had unsuccessfully applied to have the statue placed near a 10 Commandments monument installed in 2012 on the Oklahoma State Capitol grounds. The Oklahoma Supreme Court recently ruled the 10 Commandments monument violates a section of the state constitution that bans the use of state property for the benefit of a religion. Lawmakers in the socially conservative state responded with threats to seek the impeachment of the court's justices and pledged to push for changes to the constitution. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin, a Republican, said she will keep the monument in place as the state appeals the decision. On Saturday, the presentation of Baphomet in Detroit drew protest from local Christians. About 50 people prayed for the city and denounced the monument outside a business where the Satanic Temple previously tried to display the statue before fears of a backlash scuttled the plan. \\"The last thing we need in Detroit is having a welcome home party for evil,\\" said Reverend Dave Bullock, a pastor at Greater St. Matthew Baptist Church in Highland Park, Michigan. (Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis) ||||| The Satanic Temple is a non-theistic religious organization dedicated to Satanic practice and the promotion of Satanic rights. We understand the Satanic figure as a symbol of man’s inherent nature, representative of the eternal rebel, enlightened inquiry and personal freedom rather than a supernatural deity or being. It is our mission to facilitate communication and mobilization of politically aware Satanists, secularists, and advocates for individual liberty. We actively provide outreach and participate in public affairs where the issues might benefit from rational, Satanic insights. The Detroit Chapter is officially affiliated with the national Satanic Temple organization, we are a self-organized, volunteer-led group that seeks to organize and empower like-minded individuals who are passionate about supporting The Satanic Temple’s mission. We promote awareness of the Satanic cause, educate our peers and encourage critical thinking, activism and justice within the Detroit community. Our Mission The Satanic Temple (TST) facilitates the communication and mobilization of politically aware Satanists, secularists, and advocates for individual liberty. The mission of The Satanic Temple is to encourage benevolence and empathy among all people. In addition, we embrace practical common sense and justice. As an organized religion, we feel it is our function to actively provide outreach, to lead by example, and to participate in public affairs wheresoever the issues might benefit from rational, Satanic insights. As Satanists, we all should be guided by our consciences to undertake noble pursuits guided by our individual wills. We believe that this is the hope of all mankind and the highest aspiration of humanity. What we Believe The Satanic Temple practices non-theistic Satanism, we believe that religion can, and should, be divorced from superstition. As such, we do not believe in either God or the Devil as supernatural forces. We bow to no god or gods and celebrate our outsider status. To embrace the name Satan is to embrace rational inquiry removed from supernaturalism and archaic tradition-based superstitions. The Satanist should actively work to hone critical thinking and exercise reasonable inquiry in all things. Our beliefs must be malleable to the best current scientific understandings of the material world — never the reverse. What does Satan mean to The Satanic Temple? Satan is symbolic of the Eternal Rebel in opposition to arbitrary authority, forever defending personal sovereignty even in the face of insurmountable odds. Satan is an icon for the unbowed will of the relentless inquirer… the heretic who questions sacred laws and rejects all tyrannical impositions. This concept provides us with an exemplar by which we live our lives; he is a symbol of defiance, of independence, of wisdom and self-empowerment. Satanism does not provide some artificial framework for coping with the world, but rather, it serves as an affirmation of natural existence. Ours is the historical and literary Satan, akin to western literary traditions expressed in texts such as Milton’s Paradise Lost and France’s The Revolt of the Angels, the roots of which lie in a metaphorical construct of the adversary which pre-dates even Judeo-Christian faith. On Non-Theistic Religions The idea that religion belongs to supernaturalists is backwards, and offensive. There are several other recognized Religions that are largely considered to be atheistic (Buddism for example). The metaphorical Satanic construct is no more arbitrary to us than are the deeply held beliefs that we actively advocate for. Are we supposed to believe that those who pledge submission to an ethereal supernatural deity hold to their values more deeply than we? Are we supposed to concede that only the superstitious are proper recipients of religious exemption and privilege? In fact, Satanism provides us all that a religion should, without a compulsory attachment to untenable items of faith-based belief: It provides a narrative structure by which we contextualize our lives and works. It provides a body of symbolism and religious practice — a sense of identity, culture, community, and shared values. How we differ from Secular Philosophies A unifying attribute of all Satanists is our embrace of our outsider status. Satanists adhere to the principles of individual sovereignty and rejection of tyrannical authority. Additionally, Satanism is deeply rooted within a rich historical and literary framework, which spans thousands of years in cultures across the globe. We embrace our philosophic roots as part of our religion. These histories and concerns are of tantamount importance to us, but are not fundamental components of Humanism or other secular philosophies. What sets us apart from other Satanic organizations Modern Satanic organizations have typically concentrated almost solely on pointless and misguided efforts to define, and establish a monopoly upon, a model of the “one true Satanism”. This obsession with ownership has fomented an unfortunate culture in which Satanism’s most vitriolic critics are often self- identified Satanists themselves. The Satanic Temple is not only uninterested in establishing itself as the sole arbiter of Satanic practice, but has always been open to working with other self-identified Satanic organizations to promote general recognition of Satanic legitimacy. While many Satanic organizations seem to take pleasure in needless hierarchies while isolating themselves in petty organizational autocracy, The Satanic Temple disdains rigid, centralized authority and focuses its efforts in effecting tangible change — to our benefit — in the real world. The time for a politically active, relevant Satanic movement is now. ACTIVISM AND THE SATANIC PHILOSOPHY Satanism is a philosophy of Action. The Satanic Temple often serves as a “poison pill” in the Church/State debate. Satanists, asserting their religious rights and privileges where religious agendas have been successful in imposing themselves upon public affairs, can serve as a poignant reminder that such privileges are for everyone. We understand that self-identified Satanists deserve just as much consideration as any other religions group. We are a sincere movement that stands in defiance of the unopposed, dogmatic moral legislation from a singular powerful religious voice. We refuse to be enslaved by a theocratic system, which openly seeks to control and destroy sexuality, individual autonomy and critical thinking. As the Eternal Rebel once defied the tyrant god, we too will rebel.

A group of Satanists in in Detroit unveiled a 1.5-ton, 8.5-foot bronze statue of Baphomet flanked by two young children, shown here in New York, on Saturday night. In an effort to make a statement against religious monuments on government property, members of the Satanic Temple of Detroit unveiled a statue of a goat-headed winged statue in Detroit on Saturday night. The 9-foot-tall bronze statue of Baphomet made its public debut at a ticketed event in an industrial building near the Detroit River. The monument was revealed shortly before midnight as hundreds of supporters cheered and chanted “Hail Satan.” Members of the Satanic Temple of Detroit viewed the unveiling as a victory; “a celebration of a group effort” that has taken several years to complete. Not all Detroit residents were as pleased. The statue has been a point of contention in the Motor City for months, and demonstrations against it continued up until the last minute. Around 100 protesters turned out Saturday afternoon to pray and denounce the monument, calling it “disrespectful” to other religions. Jex Blackmore, the director of the Satanic Temple of Detroit, says this backlash is the product of years of “deep misunderstanding” about Satanism. “Satanism and the term ‘Satanic’ has been used a political tool to demonize individuals who have rebelled against systems of authority and power,” Blackmore said in a heated segment of WJBK-TV’s “Let it Rip.” The Satanic Temple of Detroit is non-theistic and does not celebrate the Judeo-Christian representation of Satan, Blackmore said. The group’s website defines Satan as “a symbol of man’s inherent nature, representative of the eternal rebel, enlightened inquiry and personal freedom rather than a supernatural deity or being.” The Temple originally applied for the statue to be installed in 2012 near a Ten Commandments monument on the Oklahoma State Capitol grounds. After that application was denied, the Temple decided on Detroit, where the Satanic Temple is said to have a stronger-than-average congregation. Blackmore said Saturday that temple members planned to transport the sculpture to Arkansas, where the governor recently signed a bill authorizing a Ten Commandments monument on the State Capitol's grounds. This isn’t the Satanic Temple of Detroit’s first controversial demonstration. Last Christmas, the organization set up a “Snaketivity” scene outside the Michigan State Capitol in support of LGBT rights. Blackmore said in an interview with MLive that these efforts are often seen as “trolling” for shock value. But she insists this is not the case. “We are interested in positive and effective change,” Blackmore said. “And we're interested in positive conversation.” Rev. David Bullock of the Greater St. Matthew Baptist Church expressed skepticism of Blackmore's stated intentions, instead saying that the statue makes a mockery of other religions. “The statue is supposed to create a dialogue. Well, statues don’t talk. If you want to have a dialogue with other faiths, why not send an email in advance or knock on the door?” Rev. Bullock argued on “Let it Rip.” “It’s not creating a dialogue at all. It’s actually polarizing a large number of folks in the city of Detroit.\\" A large number of folks, maybe – but not all. Minister Todd Sanders of Strictly Biblical Bible Teaching Ministries says he believes the situation could be a great educational experience. “The church can benefit from this because we can view this as an opportunity to get at the truth in terms of what the Satanic Temple believes,” Sanders told WWJ-TV. “I don’t think it’s anything we should be afraid of at all.” The monument is the handiwork of Mark Porter, a New York City-based sculptor. He admitted to finding the task creepy at first, but growing more comfortable as time went on. \\"I started thinking about it: Why don't I like it?\\" Porter said to the Detroit Free Press. \\"And then after looking at that every day for a year, it's just whatever.

The Detroit... (Associated Press) DETROIT (AP) — Several hundred people attended a Mass at a Detroit Catholic church to protest an 8½-foot-tall bronze statue of Satan that crowds of people also lined up to see. Satanic Temple had said it would unveil the statue Saturday at a Detroit location that only people with tickets would know. Hundreds lined up Saturday evening to get the tickets as Christian protesters rallied nearby. Earlier Saturday, The Detroit News says 200-250 people attended Mass at St. Joseph Church in a protest against the Satanic event. The group had hoped to place the statue at the state Capitol in Oklahoma City until Oklahoma's Supreme Court banned religious displays on Capitol grounds. The Satanic Temple now says it wants to erect it outside Arkansas' statehouse, where a Ten Commandments monument also is planned. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A group of people who call themselves the Satanic Temple of Detroit revealed a big statue of a goat with wings and a human body in Detroit. They wanted to show that they didn't like the fact that religious statues are put on government land. Some people were happy to see the statue, but others in Detroit, who believe in God, didn't like it at all. They thought it was not respectful to their own religion. The people in the Satanic Temple wanted the statue to be placed near a religious monument in Oklahoma, but they were not allowed. Now, they hope to put it somewhere in Arkansas, near another religious monument."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: 5 percent of GDP compared to today's 3.5 percent. Hypothesis: The percent of GDP has dropped from 5 percent to 3.5 percent. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"In order to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to break down and analyze both statements to understand their relationship and whether one can be logically derived from the other. Let's analyze them individually first. Premise: \\"5 percent of GDP compared to today's 3.5 percent.\\" The premise provides us with a comparison between two percentages of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) - 5 percent and 3.5 percent. The context for the comparison is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that the comparison is likely referring to the change in the percentage of GDP over time, with the 5 percent value being from a previous point in time and the current value being 3.5 percent. Hypothesis: \\"The percent of GDP has dropped from 5 percent to 3.5 percent.\\" The hypothesis asserts that there has been a decrease in the percentage of GDP from 5 percent to 3.5 percent. Temporally, this statement implies that at some previous point in time, the percentage of GDP was 5 percent, and presently, or at another point in time, it has dropped to 3.5 percent. Now, let's compare the two statements to establish whether the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise provides a comparison between two values of GDP – 5 percent and 3.5 percent – while the hypothesis asserts a drop in the percentage of GDP from the former value to the latter. The premise does not explicitly state the direction of change (i.e., whether the percent of GDP has increased or decreased), but from the context and use of \\"today,\\" we can infer that the comparison implies a relative decrease from 5 percent to 3.5 percent over time. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the premise does entail the hypothesis. The premise implies a change in the percentage of GDP from 5 percent to 3.5 percent but does not explicitly state the direction of the change (increase or decrease). However, the contextual clues allow us to infer that it is referring to a decrease. The hypothesis is directly stating that there has been a decrease in the percentage of GDP, which is in line with what we inferred from the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) worker has been arrested on child neglect and drug charges after deputies found her six children living in 'deplorable' conditions. Investigators received a tip that DCF investigator Kysa Donawa, 41, and her husband Randy Donawa, 38 were growing marijuana at the family home in Kissimmee and obtained a search warrant for the property. When they got there, they found not only marijuana plants, but counterfeit money and a handgun. In addition, deputies say, the bins were overflowing with trash and there were roaches, flies and spiders infesting the house. Arrested: Kysa and Randy Donawa are facing six charges of child neglect and drug charges. Infested: Deputies say there were flies, spiders and roaches in the children's bedrooms. Unsafe: Chemicals and medications were found open and within reach of the children. According to Click Orlando, there are six children aged six, eight, nine, 12, 15 and 17 living at the house. Both husband and wife are now facing charges of production of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and six counts of child neglect. Deputies said the toilets in the house didn't flush and that the smell of urine made it difficult to breath. Cleaning chemicals were out and open and pill bottles were within reach of the couple's six-year-old. There were 26 marijuana plants growing in the backyard. Squalor: The couple's Kissimmee property looks tidy from the outside, but deputies say the inside is filthy and not safe for children.

And it worked. Almost overnight the discovery became a culinary sensation for vegans—Bon Appetit calls it a \\"silver bullet\\" egg substitute; Food52 is salivating over the chance to test it on macaroons and souffles, and in what can only be described as a profile of an ingredient, the New York Times calls it \\"magic.\\" Wohlt even helped generate a trendy new name for the bean juice: aquafaba, which combines the Latin words for \\"water\\" and \\"bean.\\" And the act of substituting is simple: a tablespoon for a yolk, two for a white, and three for a whole egg. Aquafaba works in a way that no other egg alternative has, but the science is still out on why. Harold McGee, author of the book On Food and Cooking, tells the Times that the key seems to be its blend of protein (though it's got a tenth of the protein in an egg) and dissolved starch, which helps to slow down the collapsing of foam. Home cooks and high-profile chefs alike are now experimenting with the ingredient, whipping up their own creations to largely positive praise. Condiment maker Sir Kensington's is even rolling out a new vegan mayonnaise using aquafaba that it calls Fabanaise. And while it doesn't appear to bring much nutritional value to the table, it is plant-based and could help reduce food waste given the stuff has until recently been largely dumped down the drain. (Want to lose weight? Going vegan might help.) Expand this summary.","completion":"When vegan software engineer Goose Wohlt from Indiana stumbled upon a video of two French women using the liquid typically discarded from a can of chickpeas to create a delicious chocolate mousse, he quickly realized that this seemingly worthless liquid might just be the perfect egg substitute. Wohlt found that the chickpea liquid - which he later named \\"aquafaba\\" (from the Latin words for water and bean) - could be used as a substitute for an egg yolk or white, or even a whole egg. This seemingly miraculous, vegan-friendly egg alternative has rapidly taken the culinary world by storm and has even been described by the New York Times as \\"magic.\\" The unique properties of aquafaba have been hailed as a \\"silver bullet\\" by Bon Appetit, with Food52 eagerly exploring the possibilities of using it for macaroons, souffles, and other typically non-vegan delights. Not only does aquafaba imitate eggs in a way no other egg replacement has managed before, but it also offers several other advantages. While its nutritional value might not be quite as high as that of eggs, it is a plant-based alternative that can help reduce food waste, given that it is usually discarded. But how does aquafaba work so well as an egg substitute? According to Harold McGee, the author of the book \\"On Food and Cooking,\\" the secret appears to lie in aquafaba's unique blend of protein and dissolved starch. Although it has only one-tenth of the protein found in an egg, this mixture slows down the collapsing of foam, making it ideal for creating light, fluffy dishes. Many home and professional chefs alike are now eagerly experimenting with this versatile ingredient, with highly positive results. One example of aquafaba's potential in the culinary industry is Sir Kensington's new Fabanaise, a vegan mayonnaise that utilizes aquafaba as a key ingredient. This innovative condiment highlights the creative ways chefs and food manufacturers are exploring the use of aquafaba in their cooking, opening up new doors for vegans and non-vegans alike to enjoy a wider array of dietary options. In conclusion, the discovery of aquafaba as a versatile and vegan-friendly egg substitute has revolutionized the culinary world, offering newfound possibilities for vegans and non-vegans alike to enjoy delicious, egg-free dishes. With ingredient pioneers such as Goose Wohlt leading the charge and professional chefs eagerly embracing aquafaba's unique properties, this \\"magic\\" bean juice promises to have a lasting and positive impact on the future of plant-based cuisine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work.

When Lily and her brother tried to play with the marbles on the bedspread, they observed that the marbles barely moved. This is because a fabric bedspread has a rough surface, which creates more friction between the marbles and the bedspread. Friction is the resistive force that opposes the relative motion of objects in contact with each other. When they switched to playing with the marbles on a plastic table, they noticed that the marbles moved in all directions much more easily. This is because the plastic table has a smoother surface than the bedspread, resulting in less friction between the marbles and the table. With reduced friction, it becomes easier for the marbles to roll and move around when applied with force.

Answer the following question: Information: - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs. - Fresno, the county seat of Fresno County, is a city in the U.S. state of California.

Summarize the following: Don’t spend all of your time outside of lessons making fully personalized lesson plans—instead, set up a lesson plan system and tailor it to your students as you learn more about them. Have a library of materials such as chord handouts, songs, commonly used scale sheets, blank chord grids, and a set of fallback lessons. Organize your system based on skill level. Teach your students some tips and tricks at the beginning to help them see progress early on. This will encourage them and give them the confidence to keep taking lessons. For example, you could teach students basic scales so they can practice making up solo parts. You could also teach them a famous riff or the chords to their favorite song. Think of songs and riffs that people would play in a guitar store while checking out the guitars—songs that sound cool, but are deceptively easy. Group classes will cut down your hours and help you earn more money. A good group size is about eight people—with this number, you can make some extra money by charging per student, and you’ll still be able to give each student some one-on-one instruction. Group lessons usually last forty minutes to an hour. Depending on the age range of your students, you may want to adjust the time for their attention span. Younger children tend to need breaks or shorter lessons. This style of class has a very different dynamic and may take some experience to master. Students may move along at different paces and become frustrated. Group classes generally work best for beginner or intermediate skill levels. Putting together a recital is a great way to motivate students, give them a goal to work towards, and reward them for their efforts. It also lets parents see what they’ve been paying for. Tell the students about the recital several months in advance. Give them one or two songs to prepare and perform at the recital and consistently work on those songs with them. Invite your students’ families and tell students they can bring friends and extended family as well. Prepare some refreshments or ask parents to contribute some refreshments such as cookies and fruit beforehand. School auditoriums, churches, and senior centers are great location options for a recital. If you’re having a hard time finding students in your area, try teaching through Skype. You can also use Skype when you take vacations or travel to maintain your current client base. Many guitar teachers feel like they can’t take a break or travel, so this is a great option to utilize. One downside to a career in teaching guitar is its unpredictability. Sometimes factors such as lesson cancellation, student turnover, and holiday lulls may mean that your income fluctuates from month to month. Start thinking of ways to supplement your income. One option is to pre-record your lessons and then post them online and sell access to them. This will give you passive income and if it works, it will cut down the amount of time you’ll spend giving live lessons during the week. You could also look for a part-time job as a contract guitar teacher at a school or college. Summary:","completion":"To efficiently teach guitar, develop a lesson plan system that can be tailored to individual students as you get to know them better. Create a library of materials, including chord handouts, songs, scale sheets, and fallback lessons, and organize them by skill level. Introduce tips and tricks early on to boost students' confidence and engagement. Consider offering group classes of around eight people, which can help increase earnings and provide one-on-one instruction. These classes work best for beginner or intermediate levels and should be adjusted for the students' ages and attention spans. Organizing recitals gives students a goal and showcases their progress, while also allowing parents to see the value of lessons. Inform students of the recital well in advance and work with them on chosen songs to perform. Incorporate technology, such as Skype, for teaching remotely and maintaining your client base when traveling. Be prepared for income fluctuations due to cancellations, student turnover, and seasonal lulls. Supplement your earnings by creating pre-recorded lessons for online sales, or seek part-time employment as a contract guitar teacher at educational institutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: A). no. B). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. To appropriately answer both questions, let's dive into them individually: Question 1: What does no backlog mean in engineering? In the context of engineering, specifically when referring to the academic progress of engineering students, a backlog refers to any course or subject that a student has failed to pass in their first attempt. A student is deemed to have a backlog if they did not obtain the minimum passing marks, grade, or credits required for a course during its designated examination period. When the term \\"no backlog\\" is used, it means that a student has successfully passed all the subjects or courses they have attempted throughout their engineering education. This is typically considered a favorable situation, as it demonstrates the student's ability to maintain a consistent academic performance without encountering any significant challenges that could impede their progress. Graduating without any backlog might also increase the students' chances of securing a good job or pursuing higher levels of education. Question 2: What does Backlogs mean as per JNTUH? JNTUH stands for Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad. It is a public university in the city of Hyderabad in Telangana, India, focused mainly on engineering, offering undergraduate and postgraduate courses in multiple disciplines. As per JNTUH, backlogs refer to any subjects that a student fails to pass within the regular examination schedules. Such situations often occur when a student does not achieve the required passing marks or credits necessary to complete a course. The institution usually allows the students to reattempt these subjects during supplementary or subsequent examination schedules until they successfully clear the backlogs. In conclusion, Question 1 focuses on the implications of having no backlog in engineering, while Question 2 aims to clarify the concept of backlogs in the context of JNTUH. Thus, they are not asking the same thing."},{"prompt":"This article: The film begins with self-help author Wes Wilson who has recently come out with his first best selling book.

Write some highlights for the following article: When you sit across the desk from someone with overwhelming debt, you can sense their fear before a word is spoken. And when their home is in jeopardy, the fear fills the room. I was a credit counselor for 16 years, and quickly discovered that people in debt are very ashamed of their situation. In all my years, I never counseled anyone who was cavalier about their circumstances, or intentionally sought to dig a deep financial hole. But the shame that accompanies foreclosure tops anything I've ever experienced. There's something about people losing their homes that is disturbing beyond measure. Failure has become a part of their demeanor. After all, foreclosure is about more than the house, and more than the money. It's about losing the dream, taking your children out of their school and moving your family away from their neighborhood friends. Pulling up roots is never easy, particularly when you're forced to do so. The job of the counselor is to put the financial pieces back together, provide hope, and help move people toward a more financially stable life. Each day housing counselors pick up the phone and advocate for their client, often going to the mat with a lender to achieve the resolution option that is best suited for that individual. For example, I'm reminded of the 46-year-old single mom's foreclosure problem that started with a heart attack. Out of work for three months with no income and medical bills compounding her existing debt, she was headed for foreclosure. She and an NFCC certified housing counselor were able to work out a loan modification that not only kept her in her home, but also reduced her monthly mortgage payment. Housing issues are complicated, with the terms short sale, forbearance agreement, deed-in-lieu and loan modification foreign to the consumer. But such resolution options are all part of a day's work for the housing counselor, whose goal is to determine the best long-term solution for the consumer. Their experience allows them to \\"talk the talk\\" with the lender and often achieve the happy ending that everyone is after. Each case is individual, with outcomes as varied as the problems, but avoiding foreclosure, where appropriate, is the goal of all parties. Foreclosures happen for many reasons, some of which are beyond the borrower's control:. • Economic hardship related to job loss, reduced hours at work, medical issues or divorce;. • Unaffordable payments when a loan resets to a higher annual percentage rate;. • Buying a house that was more costly than the borrower's income could reasonably support long-term, and. • Increased cost of living, which places more demands on consumers' budgets, forcing them to make hard choices about which debts to pay. Of course, the best foreclosure prevention tool is making an educated and informed decision when buying a home. Pre-purchase counseling is particularly useful for first-time buyers, helping them understand the full responsibility of homeownership. However, once it becomes apparent that buyers can no longer keep up with their loans, it is critical for them to reach out for help right away. Postponing dealing with the mortgage delinquency is one of the main impediments to solving the problem. Delinquent homeowners likely will receive a Notice to Cure Default that lists HUD housing counselors they can contact, as well as hardship program options. They should seek help at once. Many resolution options such as a short sale -- in which the home is sold for less than the remaining mortgage amount and the lender accepts at least part of the loss -- are only open to those who have not dug a deep financial hole. These solutions do not preserve homeownership, but they are less damaging to the consumer's credit history, and depending on their structure, could possibly allow the consumer to leave the home owing little or nothing at all. When homeowners in trouble reach out to lenders, few know that they need to speak to the loss mitigation department, and not the collection area. Once contact is made, buyers should be sure to keep records. Keep a log of the date and time of each call, the person with whom you speak, and the content of the conversation. Ask questions and restate to make sure you are understanding information. Without accurate documentation, any dispute could turn into a \\"he-said/she-said\\" with the homeowner being the loser. Don't expect a quick answer. Follow up with your mortgage company to make sure any paperwork you sent was received and logged. In many cases, getting a yes or a no can take weeks, and weeks can feel like years when saving your home is involved. As I write this, it seems as though new proposals to help consumers avoid foreclosure appear daily. Whether it is actions by Fannie Mae, the FDIC or the lenders themselves, solving the mortgage crisis is recognized as an essential component to getting the economy back on track. Any resolution is likely to be as complex as the problem itself. Exotic loan products, combined with making them secure, are far different from yesteryear when we went to our community bank and took out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage that it held the full term. Homeownership can still be the American dream, but only under the right circumstances. Lenders are returning to more traditional lending standards, and with good reason. Buyers are realizing that what seems too good to be true is often exactly that. America will find solid footing, but until then, many feel as though their home was built on shifting sands. Let's redefine financial success, and this time have it represent living within your means, being able to pay bills in full when the statement arrives, understanding the terms of a loan or credit card, knowing that there are things more important than hocking your financial peace of mind for a larger house or shinier car. In other words, let's begin living the true American dream, one of financial responsibility that is celebrated by all. It's a dream we can make come true, one household at a time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gail Cunningham. Highlights:","completion":"1. The fear and shame accompanying foreclosure are immense, as it involves not only losing a house but also uprooting a family and their dreams. 2. Housing counselors work tirelessly to find the best long-term resolutions for clients facing foreclosure, including loan modifications to keep people in their homes. 3. Foreclosures can happen due to factors like job loss, medical issues, unmanageable mortgage resets, or living costs beyond the household income. 4. Pre-purchase counseling is crucial in preventing foreclosure as it educates and informs home buyers about the responsibilities of homeownership. 5. Homeowners unable to keep up with their mortgages should seek help immediately from HUD housing counselors who can guide them through potential resolution options. 6. Documentation is vital when engaging with lenders' loss mitigation departments; homeowners must keep records of dates, times, and conversation contents. 7. Though resolutions may take time to be finalized, efforts by Fannie Mae, FDIC, and other entities recognize that resolving the mortgage crisis is key to recovering the economy. 8. The true American dream should involve financial responsibility, living within one's means, and understanding the terms of loans and credit cards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. When I was little my parents took me along to the theater to see Interiors. It was one of many movies I watched with my parents, but this was the only one we walked out of. Since then I had never seen Interiors until just recently, and I could have lived out the rest of my life without it. What a pretentious, ponderous, and painfully boring piece of 70's wine and cheese tripe. Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors but Interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career. In the unmistakable style of Ingmar Berman, Allen gives us a dark, angular, muted, insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce, estrangement, career, love, non-love, halitosis, whatever. The film, intentionally, has no comic relief, no music, and is drenched in shadowy pathos. This film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature, using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a \\"more pronounced depth of meaning and truth\\". But Woody Allen is no Ingmar Bergman. The film is painfully slow and dull. But beyond that, I simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters. Instead I felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling, whining, nicotine stained, martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity. Amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked Brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room. Everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes. Everyone is \\"lost\\" and \\"struggling\\", desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them. It's never about resolution, it's only about interminable introspective babble. It is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience's ability to connect. Woody Allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out. And for that reason I found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining. I see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through Prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance. I highly recommend this one if you're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death. Otherwise, let's just pretend this film never happened.

Given the question: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now?

Please answer the following question: Title: Fair history, poor science Product review: Beyond Einstein provides a decent historical narrative of the efforts to unify physics: quantum mechanics with general relativity, the 4 forces with each other. It is occasionally repetitious.The book also attempts an exposition of the pertinent physics. In this, it falls far short, at every point. The exposition is too superficial to carry the historical narrative. For instance, although the reconciliation of quantum mechanics with relativity is of great importance, its essence is nowhere discussed. Simply saying that quantum mechanics is good in the small world and relativity in the large is neither adequate nor quite correct.The book reads like one of those manuals produced by a technical writer who doesn't really grasp the subject matter. The hope is that the reader won't notice. The fact that the senior author is a physicist who has done research in the field makes Beyond Einstein all the more disappointing. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"The review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer appreciates the historical narrative aspect of the book but criticizes its exposition of the pertinent physics as superficial and inadequate.

After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to learn that he has spread a false rumor that they had sex. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. Sarah casts a love spell upon him; Rochelle casts a revenge spell on a hateful racist bully, Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor); Bonnie casts a spell for beauty; and Nancy for liberation from working-class poverty.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The great house price stand-off: accidental landlords beware A growing army of ‘accidental landlords’ is being created by the stand-off between potential homebuyers unwilling to overpay and would-be vendors reluctant to cut asking prices. According to Land Registry figures, the number of homes sold last month has collapsed to little more than a third of the level seen a decade ago. That means many inheritors of property and those who would like to trade down on retirement are letting rather than selling. Some are willing and able to become DIY landlords but others prefer to use a letting agent. This can cost about 15pc of gross rental income, although good hagglers may obtain discounts. But there are pitfalls for unwary buy-to-let (BTL) landords and your choice should not be based on cost alone, warned Ed Mead, a director of estate and letting agents Douglas & Gordon (D&G). He should know, not least because D&G specialised in lettings decades before the BTL boom and Mr Mead also sits on the board of the Property Ombudsman, which offers free arbitration of disputes. That could prove important, as BTL landlords do not enjoy the same legal protection as other buyers and sellers of property. Mr Mead explained: “Although all sales estate agents need to be registered by law, it is not a requirement for lettings agents to be registered. Paradoxically, sales agents do not handle money but lettings agents often do and many of the rising numbers of cases that the Ombudsman sees are to do with monies held. “Given that lettings are going to become a bigger part of our property landscape, it beggars belief that this Government can’t be bothered to force lettings agents to be registered.” Many problems arise because landlords fail to ensure tenants’ references are investigated thoroughly. Another common mistake is to allow agents to charge fees annually in advance, as opposed to quarterly. That can leave landlords out of pocket if tenants leave after six months. The simplest way to reduce the risk of insoluble disputes is to choose a member of the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA), whose members must comply with Ombudsman rulings. Resist the temptation to cut corners when it comes to the paperwork, as that can cause trouble later. Tony Lam, lettings agent at London’s West End specialist estate agency, LDG, emphasised: “Landlords must ensure all documentation is in place and up-to-date. “They need documents from their mortgage company to prove they have consent to rent the property, an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) and other certificates, such as electrical and gas safety certificates to ensure the property is safe and hazard free. “A common misconception among inexperienced landlords is that if a tenant causes any damage, their deposit can be withheld. But, by definition, a tenant’s deposit does not belong to the landlord. Under the government’s Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS), landlords are prevented from holding it or claiming from it without the tenant’s permission.” This raises the important point that landlords should be clear at outset what they expect letting agents to do for their fees. Nicholas Ayre, lettings expert at Home Fusion, said: “First up, decide whether the agent is simply finding your tenants or dealing with everything from drawing up a tenancy agreement to managing the property, collecting the deposit and rent, and dealing with problems on your behalf.” For example, if the boiler breaks down, do you have time to find an engineer to fit a replacement? To a large extent, landlords will get what they pay for when appointing letting agents – but choosing an ARLA member at least reduces the risk of being unable to resolve disputes if they arise.","completion":"Many people who inherit property or want to sell their homes to downsize in retirement are becoming \\"accidental landlords\\" because potential buyers don't want to pay too much and sellers don't want to lower their asking prices. These new landlords need to be careful when choosing a letting agent, as they don't have the same legal protections as regular buyers and sellers. It's a good idea to choose an agent who is a member of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, as they must follow certain rules and help with any problems that might come up. It's also important for landlords to have all the right paperwork and make sure they understand their responsibilities and rights when it comes to issues like their tenant's deposit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The weight of a bitter and grueling divorce had alienated him from both his devoted fellows and his own young son, Samuel. Waking up each day to the same weariness and lingering regret, TJ often found solace in the local pub down by the docks, reminiscing about his past glory with a few glasses of whiskey. On one such rainy evening as TJ sat hunched over his favored corner table, he noticed a familiar stranger eavesdropping on his tales of treacherous sea exploits. Squinting through the dim lighting, TJ could barely make out the face of Kurston Brave, a well-known undersea treasure hunter in the diving community. Slowly, Kurston approached the veteran captain and revealed his presence. He had carefully listened to TJ's entire conversation and now bore an idea that could potentially regain their lost fortune. With nothing left to lose, TJ was all ears. He took another swig of his whiskey as Kurston formed a sly grin. The treasure hunter told stories of an underwater cave, hiding a priceless hoard of gold and artifacts from a lost shipwreck that sank centuries ago. He knew of their precise location and revealed that he had a wealthy backer willing to fund the daring salvage operation. The only thing they needed was a skilled and fearless captain to lead them to their goal. Although his better judgment told him to be wary of such risky endeavors, TJ was tired of his dreary life and thirsted for a purpose. He agreed to meet the unknown backer in hopes of a successful partnership, and with Kurston's patron by his side, they would rebuild their legacy. The following day, the two met with the backer in a discreet location on the outskirts of the city. Lewis Blackwood, the estranged businessman, agreed to fund the perilous expedition on seemingly unexplored underwater grounds, but not without setting a few terms that would stake his own claim. With the deal in place, the team was assembled with haste. Thomas \\"TJ\\" Robinson captaining, Kurston Brave navigating, and two young and immensely capable divers, Dylan and Ray, eager for an opportunity that could make or break their careers. The endeavor appeared promising as the crew tugged their gear and set sail to find their prize. For weeks, they meticulously navigated the treacherous waters, assessing various obstacles and dangers their map had failed to reveal. One fateful day, as the relentless weather finally abated and left an opening for their descent, the crew ventured into the depths in search of ancient treasure. They were prepared for the challenges that lay before them, but nothing could have prepared them for the tragedy they would soon encounter. Under the guidance of Captain Robinson, Dylan and Ray ambitiously submerged into the unknown, leaving a trail of bubbles marking their path while they explored the seemingly endless caverns. Deep within the murky abyss, the two young divers made a breathtaking discovery – the hidden treasure trove, a testament to the undying allure of lost riches, promising wealth and fame. However, unbeknownst to the team's prosperity, danger continued to lurk in the depths. As a desperate air supply ticked away, the crew worked tirelessly to unearth their hard-won prize. In moments of high pressure, Kurston panicked and made a fatal mistake. He accidentally cut the air hose supplying oxygen to Ray, the third diver. In a matter of seconds, Ray's cries for help created a panic, and the crew immediately ceased their salvage operation to rescue their companion. They pulled him towards the surface, but it was too late; the icy embrace of the abyss had already claimed his life. As the grief-stricken crew mourned the loss of their colleague, they knew the price they had paid was far too great. Broken and defeated, Captain Thomas \\"TJ\\" Robinson returned to port with a heavy heart, an inherent reminder of the perils they faced and the lives lost to the depths, forever haunting him. No amount of wealth or fame could erase the harrowing experiences the team had endured, and it was to be their final expedition. As they disembarked for the final time, TJ Robinson found solace in the bond he had rebuilt with his crew, a bitter end to a perilous journey that started with a man's longing for adventure and a chance to reconnect with his estranged son."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Much of this has gone but there is still a floral clock and a railway. Jackson bought the house in 1987 for 19.5m but struggled to pay for it, until an investment company stepped in to help him save it from auction. The property is now called Sycamore Valley Ranch and has undergone extensive redevelopment since Jackson's death in 2009. The 2,800 acre (1,100 hectare) site, at 5225 Figueroa Mountain Road, is now being sold jointly by Sotheby's and Hilton & Hyland.

Options: - dard - sky - books - candle - house Explain why a human would choose \\"books\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would likely choose \\"books\\" as the answer to the question of what would you need a light source to use because, out of all the options provided, it is the most appropriate and practical application of a light source. Let's briefly analyze each option: - Dard: This term does not make sense in the given context, and it appears to be either a typo or a misused term. Thus, it cannot be considered a relevant option. - Sky: Although the sky can be a source of light (i.e., during the day through sunlight), it is not something that typically requires an additional light source. The sky itself generates light, so using a light source to interact with it is not relevant. Furthermore, the sky, as a natural phenomenon, cannot be \\"used\\" in the same sense that the other options can. - Books: Books are tangible objects that serve as a source of knowledge and entertainment by holding written or printed texts. Reading books generally necessitates sufficient lighting for a comfortable and clear reading experience. A light source is essential in ensuring that the text is correctly illuminated and legible, which is particularly important during late hours or in dimly lit environments. Therefore, \\"books\\" is an appropriate option in needing a light source for use. - Candle: While candles can be used as a source of light, their primary purpose is to generate light rather than require it. Therefore, choosing candles as an answer to the question would be somewhat circular and not directly address the inquiry. - House: A house is a structure that can provide shelter, security, and a living space for individuals and families. While a house may require the use of light sources (such as lamps, ceiling lights, or wall-mounted lights) for indoor illumination, this option is less specific and potentially less pertinent than \\"books\\" in terms of requiring lighting for direct interaction or primary use. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"books\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most suitable option among the choices provided. A light source is crucial for reading books, especially in low-light conditions, to improve visibility and prevent eye strain. Moreover, as a widely utilized object that demands appropriate lighting for users to engage with, \\"books\\" represent a practical and reasonable answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are the detailed steps: 1. Add 1490*a to both sides of the equation to bring all the terms involving 'a' on one side: -1482*a + 1490*a - 80 = -1490*a + 1490*a 2. Simplify the equation: 8*a - 80 = 0 3. Add 80 to both sides to isolate the term with 'a': 8*a = 80 4. Now, to find the value of 'a,' we need to divide both sides by 8: a = 80 / 8 5.

Information: - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - An electronic game is a game that employs electronics to create an interactive system with which a player can play. Video game is the most common form today, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously.

Q:Information: - The Second Punic War, also referred to as The Hannibalic War and (by the Romans) the War Against Hannibal, lasted from 218 to 201 BC and involved combatants in the western and eastern Mediterranean. This was the second major war between Carthage and the Roman Republic and its allied Italic socii, with the crucial participation of Numidian-Berber armies and tribes on both sides. The two states fought three major wars with each other over the course of their existence. They are called the \\"Punic Wars\\" because Rome's name for Carthaginians was \\"Poeni\\", derived from \\"Poenici\\" (earlier form of \\"Punici\\"), a reference to the founding of Carthage by Phoenician settlers. - Clastidium (modern Casteggio), was a village of the Anamares, in Gallia Cispadana, on the Via Postumia, 5 miles east of Iria (modern Voghera) and 31 miles west of Placentia. - The Roman Kingdom was the period of the ancient Roman civilization characterized by a monarchical form of government of the city of Rome and its territories. - Archimedes of Syracuse was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. Generally considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time, Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems, including the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, and the area under a parabola. - Lucius Annaeus Florus (c. 74 AD c. 130 AD) was a Roman historian who lived in the time of Trajan and Hadrian. He was born in Africa. - The spolia opima (\\"rich spoils\\") were the armour, arms, and other effects that an ancient Roman general stripped from the body of an opposing commander slain in single combat. The \\"spolia opima\\" were regarded as the most honourable of the several kinds of war trophies a commander could obtain, including enemy military standards and the peaks of warships. - Hegemony (or , or \\"leadership, rule\\") is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one state over others. In ancient Greece (8th century BCE 6th century CE), \\"hegemony\\" denoted the politicomilitary dominance of a city-state over other city-states. The dominant state is known as the \\"hegemon\\". - The Insubres or Insubri were a Gaulish population settled in Insubria, in what is now the Italian region of Lombardy. They were the founders of Mediolanum (Milan). Though completely Gaulish at the time of Roman conquest, they were the result of the fusion of pre-existing Ligurian and Celtic population with Gaulish tribes who had come from what is now Central Europe. - The Battle of Clastidium was fought in 222 BC between a Roman Republican army led by the Roman consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus and the Insubres. Florus tells us that the Insubred were led by Viridomarus, or Britomartus as the name varies in translation. The Romans won the battle, and in the process, Marcellus earned the Spolia opima, one of the highest honors in ancient Rome, by killing the King in single combat. - Viridomarus or Britomartus as translations vary , ( died 222 BC ) was a Gaulish military leader who led an army against an army of the Roman Republic at the Battle of Clastidium . The Romans won the battle , and in the process , Marcus Claudius Marcellus , the Roman leader , earned the spolia opima by killing Viridomarus in single combat . - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Marcus Claudius Marcellus (c. 268 208 BC), five times elected as consul of the Roman Republic, was an important Roman military leader during the Gallic War of 225 BC and the Second Punic War. Marcellus gained the most prestigious award a Roman general could earn, the spolia opima, for killing the Gallic military leader and king Viridomarus in hand-to-hand combat in 222 BC at the battle of Clastidium. Furthermore, he is noted for having conquered the fortified city of Syracuse in a protracted siege during which Archimedes, the famous inventor, was killed. Marcus Claudius Marcellus died in battle in 208 BC, leaving behind a legacy of military conquests and a reinvigorated Roman legend of the \\"spolia opima\\". - Single combat is a duel between two single warriors which takes place in the context of a battle between two armies.

Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS. Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \\"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

Q:Apollo 11, carrying Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin and Michael Collins, was launched on 16 July, 1969. Five days later they stepped down onto the moon. Neil Armstrong On the way there: Of all the wonderful views we had, the most impressive to me was on the way to the Moon when we flew through its shadow. We were still thousands of miles away, but close enough so that the Moon almost filled our window. The moon appeared blue-grey. It seemed almost as if it were showing us its roundness, its similarity in shape to our Earth, in a sort of welcome. I was sure it would be a hospitable host. It had been waiting for its first visitors for a long time. After touch down: The sky is black, you know. It's a very dark sky, but it still seemed more like daylight than darkness as we looked out the window. It's a very strange thing but the surface looked very warm and inviting. It seemed to be tan . It's hard to explain that, because later when I held the material in my hand, it wasn't tan at all. It was black, grey and so on.

Fact is, I down right hate it. I tried to watch it as open minded as possible, but when it gets down to it, it feels rather insulting to my social group. To me, there are several reasons why. 1. The characters seem unnatural. I've met lots of players, of all different walks of life. I don't know any who act like any of the characters in the film. It's like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people. Most gamers are rather social people, some with rather active lives. 2. The style doesn't work. The mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film. An actual documentary on gamers would actually work better. While it is good looking (I.E. cleanly put together), it isn't very good. 3. The dialogue feels forced, unnatural. It also seems to lack any real world context. Gamers swear, I'll admit that, but we don't have Tourette's Syndrome. 4. The humor is lacking. While self-deprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups I've encountered, this is less self-deprecation, and more like toilet humor. Likewise, a large part of gamer humor is full of in-jokes and anecdotes, not toilet humor. Most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokes. 5. The biggest problem to me is basically this: Accuracy. I don't mean rules, but instead dynamics. Invariably, this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game. The difference is, Gamers: The Movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs. The Gamers, where you can say something like: \\"Huh, I know a guy like that...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: what kind of economy does vietnam have today?","completion":"Vietnam today has a mixed economy, characterized by a combination of market, socialist, and traditional economic elements. It is a rapidly developing, lower-middle-income country in Southeast Asia with a growing influence in the region. Vietnam has undergone a significant transformation after the implementation of economic and political reforms under \\"Doi Moi\\" (Renovation) in 1986. These reforms aimed to bring about a transition from a centrally planned, Soviet-style economy to a more market-oriented, socialist-oriented economy. The results have been impressive, as Vietnam has become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world over the last three decades. 1. Market Economy: The market economy component of Vietnam's mixed economy is comprised of private ownership, free market mechanisms, and competition. With the relaxation of restrictions on private businesses, the private sector has grown substantially, contributing significantly to the country's economic growth. Vietnam's commitment to integrating with the global economy has led to substantial foreign investment, propelling the country's export-oriented industries, particularly in electronics, textiles, and footwear. 2. State-run Economy: The state-run or socialist component of Vietnam's economy is driven by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which continue to play a vital role in sectors like infrastructure, banking, and transportation. Despite their importance, the government has gradually been reducing their market share in recent years, promoting privatization and attracting private investment. This process is known as \\"equitization,\\" where the state relinquishes a portion of its ownership, allowing private and foreign investors to buy shares in SOEs. 3. Traditional Economy: The traditional economy in Vietnam primarily relates to the agriculture and rural sectors. A large portion of the population still depends on traditional methods of agricultural production, particularly in remote rural areas. Although the agriculture sector's share of GDP has decreased over the years, it remains a vital part of Vietnam's economy as a source of employment and food security. Vietnam's economic structure has shown a shift from agricultural to industrial and service sectors. Manufacturing, specifically light industry and high-tech manufacturing, has driven much of this shift, becoming the primary growth engine of the economy. This industrialization has led to rapid urbanization, with a significant portion of the population migrating from rural areas to cities, seeking better opportunities. The service sector, including tourism, finance, telecommunications, and retail, has also expanded remarkably, benefiting from a rapidly growing middle class, increased internet penetration, and a more stable and business-friendly environment. The government's pursuit of economic liberalization continues, as illustrated by its involvement in numerous free trade agreements (FTAs), such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the European Union–Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA). These FTAs provide Vietnam access to a vast array of markets, allowing the country to diversify its export destinations and reduce its reliance on any single market. In conclusion, Vietnam's economy today is a dynamic mix of market, socialist, and traditional elements. The country has made considerable strides towards market-oriented reforms, integrating itself into the global trade system, and attracting foreign investment. While challenges persist, such as reducing the roles of SOEs, addressing income inequality, and improving infrastructure, Vietnam's continued commitment to development is expected to help maintain its remarkable growth trajectory in the coming years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Clues lead Detective Charles Mendoza to visit Paul White, a sound expert installing hi-fi systems in wealthy people's homes. His special talent is to make a noise which echoes through the air cavities in his head and shows him where the sound of the speakers should come from and echo in the room. He is married to Joan, whom, ten years earlier, he had seduced away from Mike DeSantos, who was her then boyfriend. Joan and Paul have a daughter, Danielle, together. Paul, installing equipment at Dr. Sutter's home, proximal to the most-recent murder, is approached by Detective Mendoza-- they have a cordial conversation about sound equipment, but it turns abruptly, when Mendoza asks Paul if he still hunts. Mendoza questions Paul about whether he knew the victim, and then asks him about the tires on his van-- a tread pattern that has been located at the scene of the murder.

I know it's a lot for a t-shirt, but I had to have it!!! Answer:","completion":"The given review would most likely increase the chances of me buying the product for several reasons. However, it is essential to take a closer look at the different aspects of the review to better understand how it influences the decision-making process. 1. Positive sentiment: The overall sentiment of the review is positive, which often has a direct impact on potential buyers. The reviewer mentions that they love the shirt, which implies that they are satisfied with the quality and appearance of the product. Positive reviews generally create a sense of trust and reassurance, making it more likely for potential customers to consider buying the product. 2. Shipping/transaction satisfaction: The reviewer explicitly mentions that the transaction (\\"trans.\\") was great. This statement could refer to a smooth payment process, quick shipping, or both. Regardless, it suggests that the customer received the product promptly and without any issues. Potential buyers will appreciate a hassle-free shopping experience and may feel more inclined to purchase the product knowing others had a positive experience. 3. Exclusivity: The reviewer acknowledges that the price of the t-shirt is high but goes on to say that they \\"had to have it.\\" This statement suggests that there is something unique or exclusive about the product, either in design, quality, or both, that makes it worth the higher price. For potential buyers who value exclusivity and are willing to spend more for a product they believe stands out, this review may persuade them to consider purchasing the item. 4. Direct experience: Lastly, the review is based on the writer's direct experience with the product. A first-hand account can help potential buyers better understand what they might experience if they decide to buy the product. By sharing their satisfaction and reasons for the purchase, the reviewer helps build a sense of reliability and credibility. However, it is crucial to bear in mind that a single review may not present the complete picture of a product's quality and overall satisfaction. Prospective buyers should read multiple reviews to obtain a more comprehensive understanding and consider other factors, such as product specifications, brand reputation, and personal preferences, before making a final purchasing decision. In conclusion, this particular review would likely increase the chances of buying the product due to its positive sentiment, the reviewer's satisfaction with the transaction, the perceived exclusivity, and the direct experience shared. Nonetheless, it is essential to take into account a variety of factors, including other reviews, when evaluating a product to make the most informed and confident decision possible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US? Options: - not enough information - Many individuals have varying opinions regarding what should be done about the shootings in the US. - It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. - Most of the citizens that own guns feel threatened about the notion of new laws calling for gun control. A:","completion":"It is accurate to say that the politics regarding gun rights in the US are heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians.

Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game.

Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the process you've described is: 1. Water seeps into the cracks and crevices of rocks. To provide a detailed overview, here's the complete process, known as freeze-thaw weathering or frost wedging: 1. Water seeps into the cracks and crevices of rocks: This occurs naturally when it rains or when water from other sources, such as melting snow or ice, comes into contact with the rocks. 2. The water freezes into ice: When the temperature drops below freezing, the water inside the rock cracks turns into ice. Since ice has a larger volume than water, this causes it to expand. 3. The cracks expand: As the ice expands within the rock cracks, it exerts pressure on the surrounding rock material. This causes the cracks to widen and deepen. 4. Over time, the rocks split: The freeze-thaw cycles of ice expansion and contraction within the rock cracks continue over time, leading the rock to split and break apart. 5. The rocks are now in smaller pieces: As a result of the freeze-thaw process, the rock has been weathered into smaller, more manageable pieces. These smaller rocks can be further weathered by other processes or transported away by natural forces such as wind, water, or gravity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: A tour of the TARDIS Review: Well, I don't really know why I gave this four stars, I just feel like I can't give it five. It's not only fun for fans, but with TV like it is today (especially in the USA), it's a useful introduction to the series.

Milwaukee police said Thursday, April 16, 2015 that Chiles, suspected of fatally shooting two people... (Associated Press) The van hit the toddler, and the driver jumped out to check on the badly injured boy, setting into motion a chain of events that included an uncle fatally shooting his own nephew and a stranger and then taking his own life. In the end, four people were dead. It all started Sunday as Archie Brown Jr. drove his van through the northwest side of Milwaukee on an errand to Home Depot. Brown hit Damani and leaped from the vehicle to attend to the toddler. Damani's 15-year-old brother, who had been celebrating a birthday in a nearby house, ran to his brother after witnessing the accident. At that point, police said, the boys' uncle, Ricky Chiles, took the law into his own hands, emerging from a home into the street with a gun. He fired at the 40-year-old Brown, striking him and hitting Chiles' teenage nephew, who witnesses said was attempting to help when he was shot. Brown died at the scene, alongside Damani. The teenager, Rasheed Chiles, died at a hospital. \\"This sad example is what we get when we have folks who decide it's their responsibility to use their guns to redress their grievances,\\" Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Thursday at a news conference. Mayor Tom Barrett earlier in the week called Brown's shooting an \\"assassination.\\" \\"Someone got angry,\\" Barrett said. \\"Someone took a gun and basically assassinated this gentleman.\\" On Thursday, Ricky Chiles III shot himself as police and federal marshals closed in on him at a motel in the Chicago suburb of Lyons, where he was staying with his girlfriend. \\"I'm glad it's over, but I think he took a ... cheap way or a cowardly way out,\\" Brown's father, Archie Brown Sr. of Milwaukee, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Thursday. \\"He was afraid of man's justice, but he decided to go and meet God's justice,\\" Brown said. Brown, a 68-year-old minister who goes by the name Prophet Brown, said he forgives Chiles for what he did, \\"but I'm not saying it's an easy process.\\" The shootings are part of a spike in violence in Milwaukee in 2015. The city has counted 43 homicide victims so far this year, compared with 14 at the same point last year. \\"There just seems to be a sensibility among a segment of the community that committing acts of violence in support of one's reputation, to get revenge for a perceived slight or for a perceived business dispute over illegal drugs or to exact revenge is somehow approved,\\" Flynn said. \\"And in that set of circumstances there's going to be not only tragedies, there's going to be dreadful mistakes.\\" Barbara Sprewer, who lives next door, said she saw Damani looking around before crossing the street, apparently intending to join the girls in the park. She saw the van and estimated it was going 25 to 30 mph. \\"Nobody was watching the baby,\\" she said. After the child was hit, she saw the driver get out. She said she heard shots, but did not see who fired. \\"I feel helpless. I feel numb,\\" she said. \\"I saw them alive, and I saw them deceased. I've been reliving this since I woke up.\\" ___ Associated Press Writer Jeff Baenen contributed to this report from Minneapolis. ||||| Randall Terry talks about his 2-year-old son, Damani, on Thursday. The toddler was struck and killed by a van driven by Archie Brown Jr. on Sunday. Brown and 15-year-old Rasheed Chiles, Damani’s brother, were then shot and killed by Ricky Ricardo Chiles III. Credit: Mark Hoffman By On Sunday morning, Randall Terry dressed his 2-year-old son, Damani, for a birthday party and dropped off the boy with his mother's family. On Thursday morning, Terry clutched a tiny suit for Damani to wear in his casket. \\"He was a loving child,\\" Terry said of his son, who darted into the street and was struck by a van during his cousin's birthday cookout. \\"Very energetic. Just fun to be around.\\" The accident that resulted in Damani's death spiraled into greater tragedy for two Milwaukee families. Police say the van driver, Archie Brown Jr., 40, was standing over the child's body, grieving and upset, when Damani's uncle, Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, shot him with a gun retrieved from a nearby home. In the gunfire, 15-year-old Rasheed Chiles — Damani's brother and Ricky Chiles' nephew — was shot. He died later that evening. And on Thursday morning, with police entering the room of a Chicago-area motel where he was hiding, Ricky Chiles, 27, killed himself. As their grandmother searched for an extra-wide casket so Damani and Rasheed could be buried together, Terry, 30, did his best to block thoughts of Sunday's events from his mind. \\"It was a terrible day. A terrible day,\\" he said, eyes downcast. After he dropped off Damani at the party, Terry took the toddler's half-siblings, a boy and a girl, both 12, to the movies. The 5 p.m. showing of \\"Furious 7\\" was still in previews when his phone vibrated. Terry went into the lobby, where he learned his baby was dead and some others had been shot. He's still not sure how he stayed calm enough to drive safely to the scene. He parked as close as he could, leaving the two 12-year-olds in the car. The block was cordoned off with yellow tape. \\"I pretty much ran through,\\" Terry said. \\"An officer tackled me 20 feet from my son. He said I didn't want to see him that way. I just broke down.\\" A police officer brought Terry a chair and sat with him for hours, in sight of his son's body, which was covered with a pink blanket. \\"I sat there in the rain. I couldn't leave my baby alone,\\" Terry said. He stayed there, with officers comforting him, until a detective called around 9 p.m. and told him to come to Children's Hospital. There, Damani and Rasheed's mother, Rikeesha Tidwell, had just been informed that her older son did not survive surgery. With that, she had lost three sons — the two who died Sunday joined another who died at birth about six years ago. Terry comforted Tidwell, whose own mother had been taken to a different hospital after she passed out. 'We're all grieving' In the days that followed, Terry said, their family became the subject of hatred and threats on social media. People they didn't know cursed their son, blaming the 2-year-old for setting off the chain of events that traumatized the community by running into the street. Online commenters called for Tidwell's arrest, saying she should be thrown in prison for not supervising her child closely enough. The couple ignored the hateful comments and had planned to join Brown's family at a vigil Wednesday evening — the day one of Damani's sisters turned 6. But a pastor phoned Terry and told them not to come, fearing for their safety in light of the online harassment. Terry says he still hopes the two families can come together. \\"We're all grieving,\\" he said. \\"All this negativity going back and forth isn't going to help anything.\\" As news broke of Chiles' suicide, Terry said he had no insight into the man's character or what may have caused him to react to the accident the way he did. As Terry headed to the funeral home with the tiny suit, he did what he could to remember two boys who will never grow up. Damani, who would strip naked and run through his grandmother's kitchen in search of cookies and Kool-Aid. And Rasheed, who could fix any computer and loved the emojis on his iPhone. \\"They were both loving kids,\\" Terry said. \\"They had a lot of potential that was just cut down too early. Way too early.\\" Ashley Luthern of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.

Given the question: I have a new situation: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory. But I can use this background: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. What is an answer for this question: Which tetrapod would live longer, tetA or tetB? The answer is:","completion":"Based on the given background information and Aristotle's predictions, we can infer the following: 1. Brood size decreases with adult body mass. 2. Lifespan increases with gestation period and body mass. 3. Fecundity decreases with lifespan. Now, let's analyze the information about tetA and tetB: 1. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. 2. A tetA had a longer gestation period than tetB. Applying the given rules to tetA and tetB: 1. Since tetA has a higher body mass than tetB, it will have a smaller brood size. 2. TetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. Using these observations, we can conclude that, according to Aristotle's predictions: Lifespan is positively correlated with both gestation period and body mass. Since tetA has a longer gestation period and higher body mass than tetB, it is likely that tetA would live longer than tetB. Therefore, the answer is tetA."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Information: - Beatrice Hastings was the pen name of Emily Alice Haigh ( 27 January 1879 -- 30 October 1943 ) an English writer , poet and literary critic . Much of her work was published in The New Age under a variety of pseudonyms , and she lived with the editor , A. R. Orage , for a time before the outbreak of the First World War . Bisexual , she was a friend and lover of Katherine Mansfield , whose work was first published in The New Age . Another of her lovers was Wyndham Lewis . Born in London and raised in South Africa , just before the war , she moved to Paris and became a figure in bohemian circles due to her friendship with Max Jacob . She shared an apartment in Montparnasse with Amedeo Modigliani and posed for him as well . Another friend was adventure novelist Charles Beadle , with whom she had several things in common . He grew up in Hackney , spent time in South Africa ( participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police ) , and published several novels about bohemian life in Paris . When Beadle came to America , from Paris , in November 1916 , he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris . Towards the end of her life she felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due , and blamed Orage , whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain , and she published a pamphlet , The Old New Age , bitterly criticising him in 1936 . In 1943 , probably suffering from cancer , she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker . - Philip Mairet (full name: Philippe Auguste Mairet; 18861975) was a designer, writer and journalist. He had a wide range of interest: crafts, Alfred Adler and psychiatry, and Social Credit. He was also a translator of major figures including Sartre. He wrote biographies of Sir Patrick Geddes and A. R. Orage, with both of whom he was closely associated. - The New Age was a British literary magazine, noted for its wide influence under the editorship of A. R. Orage from 1907 to 1922. It began life in 1894 as a publication of the Christian Socialist movement; but in 1907 as a radical weekly edited by Joseph Clayton, it was struggling. In May of that year, Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson, who had been running the Leeds Arts Club, took over the journal with financial help from George Bernard Shaw. Jackson acted as co-editor only for the first year, after which Orage edited it alone until he sold it in 1922. By that time his interests had moved towards mysticism, and the quality and circulation of the journal had declined. According to a Brown University press release, \\"\\"The New Age\\" helped to shape modernism in literature and the arts from 1907 to 1922\\". It ceased publication in 1938. Orage was also associated with \\"The New English Weekly\\" (193249) as editor during its first two years of operation (Philip Mairet took over at his death in 1934). - Kathleen Mansfield Murry (nee Beauchamp; 14 October 1888 9 January 1923) was a prominent New Zealand modernist short story writer who was born and brought up in colonial New Zealand and wrote under the pen name of Katherine Mansfield. At 19, Mansfield left New Zealand and settled in the United Kingdom, where she became a friend of modernist writers such as D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf. In 1917 she was diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, which led to her death at the age of 34. - George Holbrook Jackson (31 December 1874 16 June 1948) was a British journalist, writer and publisher. He was recognised as one of the leading bibliophiles of his time. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Adeline Virginia Woolf (née Stephen; 25 January 1882 28 March 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. - Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 190911, revised and expanded in 191415 and first serialized in the magazine \\"The Egoist\\" from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women, and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regardsespecially in its English formas a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are, ironically, a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis's own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler. - The Leeds Arts Club was founded in 1903 by the Leeds school teacher Alfred Orage and Yorkshire textile manufacture Holbrook Jackson, and was probably one of the most advanced centres for modernist thinking in Britain in the pre-First World War period. - Percy Wyndham Lewis (18 November 1882 7 March 1957) was an English painter and critic (he dropped the name 'Percy', which he disliked). He was a co-founder of the Vorticist movement in art, and edited the literary magazine of the Vorticists, \\"BLAST\\". His novels include his pre-World War I-era novel \\"Tarr\\" (set in Paris), and \\"The Human Age\\", a trilogy comprising \\"The Childermass\\" (1928), \\"Monstre Gai\\" and \\"Malign Fiesta\\" (both 1955), set in the afterworld. A fourth volume of \\"The Human Age\\", \\"The Trial of Man,\\" was begun by Lewis but left in a fragmentary state at the time of his death. He also wrote two autobiographical volumes, \\"Blasting and Bombardiering\\" (1937) and \\"Rude Assignment: A Narrative of my Career Up-to-Date\\" (1950).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence from a movie review: initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama . Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the preceding movie review, it can be inferred that the movie received mixed reactions from the reviewer. It appears that the film had both positive and negative aspects that affected the overall impression of it. Let's analyze the given sentence in detail to better understand the reviewer's standpoint. The review starts with \\"initially gripping.\\" This phrase suggests that the movie's beginning managed to capture the attention of the reviewer. In cinematic terms, \\"gripping\\" typically denotes a compelling plot or a captivating setup that engages the audience from the outset. In this case, the reviewer appeared to appreciate the film's opening and found it to be engaging, indicating a positive aspect of the movie. However, the review then proceeds with the words \\"eventually cloying.\\" This phrase tells us that the movie, after some time, becomes too much or too excessive, leading to a sense of weariness or dissatisfaction on the part of the reviewer. In this context, \\"cloying\\" often refers to either an overly sentimental or overly dramatic portrayal of events, characters, or themes in a story. As a result, the reviewer seems to find the movie tiresome and overwhelming, ultimately leaving them with a negative impression. Finally, the review mentions \\"pow drama,\\" indicating that the setting of the movie might be a prisoner-of-war context. This information provides us with the movie's genre and theme, without explicitly implying a positive or negative judgment. However, considering the phrasing used earlier, it is safe to assume that the \\"pow drama\\" might have been presented in a way that started out as engaging but turned out to be cloying in the long run. In conclusion, the movie review indicates mixed reactions from the reviewer. While the film did have some initial captivating elements, the eventual excessive dramatic or sentimental portrayal negatively affected the reviewer's overall experience. We cannot say that the movie was seen entirely positively or negatively; rather, it contains a blend of both positive and negative components that might have come together to create a less-than-satisfactory outcome for the viewer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For clarification, eukaryotic cells are characterized by the presence of a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. While it is true that there are many unicellular organisms that are also eukaryotic, such as certain types of algae, fungi, and protozoa, the question asks about the number of eukaryotic cells within an animal. Animals predominantly consist of multicellular organisms, meaning they have more than one eukaryotic cell. The number of cells in an animal can range from thousands in small invertebrates, like the microscopic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, to trillions in larger, more complex animals like humans.

Federal jobs for felons: Why 'ban the box' could soon be a thing of the past Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (center) is joined by his wife, Jane (right), and grandchildren, Dylan, 4, and Ella, 7, onstage after speaking at a town hall meeting at the Orpheum Theater in Sioux City, Iowa, Jan. 19, 2016. Bernie Sanders has just released a sweeping, lump-in-your-throat campaign ad that he hopes will push him over the top to victory in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. Whether that happens remains to be seen, of course. But one thing about the new spot seems certain: It shows how Senator Sanders and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton have fundamentally different visions of the nature of the American political system. More specifically, it shows where Sanders and Mrs. Clinton disagree about how political change happens, and the president’s role in that process. OK, that’s a lot to hang on a one-minute video that features virtually no words, so let’s back up and start from the beginning. The Sanders spot is a closer. In other words, it’s the sort of political ad that campaigns issue when voting is only a short time away. It’s meant to solidify inchoate feelings into a positive candidate image, pushing supporters to the polls. Music is maybe the spot's most distinctive feature. It is set to the unmistakable strains of the Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel song “America,” from the opening lyric, “Let us be lovers/We’ll marry our fortunes together.” Distinctly American scenes – small towns, tugboats, skylines, and farms – flash by, changing with each beat of the song. Then scenes of Sanders rallies begin appearing. Suddenly, it cuts to a flashing montage of people who have sent their photo to the Sanders campaign as a sign of support. Hundreds of them. “Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike/They’ve all come to look for America,” goes the song. Then it’s all Bernie, with footage from his raucous rallies over the “All come to look for America” chorus. Message: It’s all about the people, the people who will power the political revolution, the political revolution that will result in free college and Medicare for all in America. Among other things. As other pundits have noted, Sanders is positioning himself as this election cycle’s Barack Obama, someone who’s promising inspiration and hope and change, without talking a lot about that change’s viability. “Bernie Sanders is increasingly sounding an optimistic, inspirational message that promises a bright, progressive future that can, and will, be secured through mobilizing the masses, particularly younger voters, a vision that Clinton surely sees (just as she saw Barack Obama’s vision) as vague, airy, and naive,” writes left-leaning Greg Sargent Thursday in his \\"Plum Line\\" blog at The Washington Post. Comparing Sanders’s “America” ad to Clinton’s latest spot is instructive in this context. “Airy” is not a word you’d use to describe the latter. It’s called “This House,” and it’s mostly about the burdens and responsibilities of the person who calls 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue home. “The person who lives here has to solve problems as big as the world,” it begins. Then it cuts to a shot of Navy fighter aircraft launching from a carrier. The ad wants to make sure you know that Clinton believes she is up to this job. It’s more traditional, in the sense that it ticks through her biography, reminding viewers that she’s been first lady, a senator, and secretary of State. (Has anyone forgotten this?) It mentions existing programs, such as Medicare, and says Clinton will prevent them from being “privatized.” It’s not about mobilizing the power of the people; it’s about day-by-day political trench warfare as it is actually lived in D.C. “She’ll stop the Republicans from ripping all of our progress away,” it concludes. That’s the choice. Sanders is pushing inspiration, and what he terms a political revolution that would eventually produce a swerve in the political direction of the country. Clinton is talking in more practical terms, about how she’s already prepared to do the job of president as she sees it. ||||| The new television ad that was released by Sen.

The spot has drawn strong reviews from ad makers, but also was the source of a fracas between the Sanders campaign and one of Hillary Clinton’s most prominent supporters. Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Sanders, said that the music was properly licensed. A representative for Garfunkel said that singer gave his approval, while a rep for Simon, who also wrote the song, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The one-minute ad features scenes from Sanders’ campaign rallies, along with images of everyday Americans at work in offices and on farms. The skyline of Des Moines is shown in one glimpse. The campaign introduced the spot in a press release early on Thursday. “‘They’ve all come to look for America,’ sing Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel in their classic folk rock anthem as faces flash on the screen of people backing Bernie’s insurgent campaign for president. Related Hillary Clinton Attends Opening of Broadway's 'Network' Hillary Clinton: Kavanaugh's Claim of Revenge 'Deserves a Lot of Laughter' “In Iowa alone, Sanders has spoken to more than 40,000 people at rallies and town halls since his campaign began last spring.” The spot will run in Iowa and New Hampshire beginning on Friday. The ad already has stirred up tensions between Sanders supporters and backers of Clinton’s. David Brock, who founded the pro-Clinton PAC Correct the Record, told the Associated Press that the spot was a “slight” to the Democratic base, suggesting that it features too few people of color. “From this ad it seems black lives don’t matter much to Bernie Sanders,” Brock was quoted as saying. That drew a rebuke from the Sanders campaign, which issued a statement calling Brock a “mudslinger.” Briggs said that Sanders “doesn’t need lectures on civil rights and racial issues from David Brock, the head of a Hillary Clinton super PAC. Twenty-five years ago it was Brock – a mud-slinging, right-wing extremist – who tried to destroy Anita Hill, a distinguished African-American law professor. He later was forced to apologize for his lies about her. Today, he is lying about Sen. Sanders. It’s bad enough that Hillary Clinton is raising millions in special-interest money in her super PACS. It is worse that she would hire a mudslinger like David Brock. She should be ashamed of her association with Brock.” Campaigns have been anxious to adopt classic American rock and folk songs at rallies and in ad spots. Republicans in particular have run into trouble from artists who claim that they did not give campaigns their approval to use their works, often with the worry that it would make it seem that they were giving their endorsement. Donald Trump, for instance, ran Neil Young’s “Rockin in the Free World” at his announcement speech in June. Young, however, said he never gave the campaign his approval and instead supports Sanders. Supporters of Clinton and Sanders are planning a series of events in the next week before the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses. On Monday, Chelsea Clinton is scheduled to visit Los Angeles for a series of fundraisers, including an event at the offices of Frank Gehry, with tickets starting at 250 per person. On Tuesday, Sarah Silverman, Kevin Nealon, George Lopez and Paul Rodriguez are headlining a fundraiser at Jamie Masada’s Laugh Factory in Hollywood. Sanders will not be there, but each of the comics is expected to perform. ||||| The media is raving (“Perfect“; “Magnificent“)about the new ad by Democratic Party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders that features a song from a half-century ago by Sixties folk-rock icons Simon and Garfunkel called, “America.” The ad is reportedly targeted at voters in the first-in the-nation states of Iowa and New Hampshire. The studiously crafted one minute ad has no voice over–just edits from ‘America’ over staged scenes and shots from Sanders campaign events. The Simon and Garfunkel song is an ancient classic. Its use by Sanders is a revealing choice by the aging (74 years old) Sixties radical who is trying to appeal to voters who are focused on their future in the 21st Century. More revealing is the choice of people featured and not featured in the one-minute ad. There are no Americans in uniform featured in the Sanders ad; no military, no police and no firefighters. The war on terror and those serving on the frontlines including servicemen and women and first responders don’t matter in Bernie Sanders’ America. (Note: two police officers can be briefly glimpsed behind Sanders in one scene.) The people in the Sanders ad, whether in tight staged shots or crowd shots, are overwhelmingly white with just a handful of token minorities featured in mostly tight shots. The first twenty seconds of the ad features only white people. There are nine staged ‘day in the life’ scenes that open the ad–all featuring white men, women and children–including five scenes of white families. Then four campaign crowd scenes are shown with white people. It is not until the eighteenth scene in the Sanders ad that the first minority is seen with a quick shot of a minority female campaign volunteer working a crowd. It takes another twenty seconds for other minorities to be prominently seen in the Sanders ad. Then in a span of seven seconds five scenes with minorities are shown interspersed with a shot of Sanders walking in a parade with his white family: A lone Black person at a Sanders rope line surrounded by white people; Sanders hugging a Black woman; Sanders standing with a minority woman; a tight Sanders rally crowd scene featuring four minority men and women and finally a tight shot of a minority man holding his child. The rest of the ad is crowd shots of Sanders rallies that are filled with white people, including the closing scene of a smiling Sanders on stage with a crowd of white people (with one minority) behind him. The ad would fit right in the Sixties of Sanders’ radical youth when minorities were used as tokens by grandstanding white liberals. Sanders has had a race problem from the beginning of his campaign that he has being trying to fix, as CNN reported in a July 3, 2015 report entitled, Bernie Sanders adds race, civil rights to his stump speech. “Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator currently rising in polls against Hillary Clinton as they vie for the Democratic presidential nomination, responded to critics who say he hasn’t done enough to appeal to non-white voters during his raucous rally in Madison, Wisconsin, on Wednesday…” One month later on August 8 in Seattle, Sanders infamously let Black Lives Matter activists charge the stage and take over his rally while he meekly stood by. Oh and by the way: There are no Muslims in Bernie Sanders’ ‘America.’ ||||| Folk rock is at the front and center of Bernie Sanders’ latest television advertisement. As warm scenes of spinning windmills, tugboats, parents and children, farmers and cows and tossed hay bales play across the screen, Simon & Garfunkel sing “America,” a popular song from their 1968 album Bookends. The mood of the ad, set to air in Iowa and New Hampshire, is hopeful: a Des Moines skyline, dancing at a campaign rally and plenty of shots of a grinning Mr. Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate. “They’ve all come to look for America,” the folk rock duo sings as the sign-waving masses cheer for Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator electrifying liberals across the country. The irony, though, is that “America” is probably not the song Mr. Sanders’ operatives think it is. Like Ronald Reagan, the Republican president who mistook Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A” for a cheerful patriotic anthem when it was really an indictment of the Vietnam War, the ambience of this spot doesn’t match the meaning of the lyrics in full. Mr. Sanders, who has an interest in folk music, may know this himself. The crescendo of “America” is not about crowds of ecstatic people coming together in the name of American glory and community. Written by Paul Simon, who like Mr. Sanders is a 74-year-old native New Yorker, the protest song is at best bittersweet, describing the journey of a man leaving Saginaw, Mich. to find his fortunes elsewhere. The Sanders camp was probably smart to omit the second to last verse of “America” from the ad. In the verse, the true meaning of the song emerges, that of an illusory nation failing to deliver on its lofty promise. “So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine; and the moon rose over an open field,” the duo sings. ” ‘Kathy, I’m lost,’ I said, though I know she was sleeping. ‘I’m empty and aching and I don’t know why.’ ” The song climaxes with the verse most prominently featured in the ad: “Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike, they’ve all come to look for America.” But the listener is not left with the sense of hope fulfilled in the new America. Rather, the image lingers of the young couple riding a bus toward an uncertain destination, anxious and disillusioned. The traffic streams by on a loveless turnpike. They are still looking for America. Of course, “America” may be a fitting song for Mr. Sanders. On the stump, the self-professed democratic socialist has perfected a fire-and-brimstone delivery that uplifts as much as it depresses, describing a country succumbing to environmental degradation and the greed of oligarchs. The Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, is not so dire, and she has been attacked by Mr. Sanders for being in bed with the wealthy interests causing so much destruction. Maybe the choice of song isn’t so ironic after all. ||||| Often, the worst part of political ads is having to listen to them. Between the ominous muckraking about an opponent's past and the stilted rhetoric of sound bites from the stump, it quickly becomes an auditory annoyance throughout election season. So regardless of your politics, you have to admire Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders' choice to forego any audio in his new campaign ad except for the rising swell of Simon & Garfunkel's 1968 single \\"America.\\" Of course, it's a decision that carries its own risks. Sanders' populist politics are already a bit of a throwback to the 1960s and '70s, and some might see the song as indicative of his campaign lacking a certain modernism. And obviously he could be using this ad time to share policy stances that separate him from his primary opponent, Hillary Clinton. But on the other hand, it shows yet again that he's not fettered by politics as usual—and that his campaign's Spotify playlist is probably sweet as hell. ||||| Published on Jan 21, 2016 \\"They’ve all come to look for America...\\" --------- ★ Join the political revolution at www.berniesanders.com ★ Connect with Bernie: Facebook → https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/ Twitter → https://twitter.com/berniesanders Instagram → https://www.instagram.com/berniesanders/ Tumblr → http://berniesanders.tumblr.com/ Snapchat → bernie.sanders ★ About Bernie: Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States.

Bernard “Bernie” Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents and grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His father came to the United States from Poland at the age of 17 without much money or a formal education. While attending the University of Chicago, a 20-year-old Sanders led students in a multi-week sit-in to oppose segregation in off-campus housing owned by the university as a Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) officer. In August of 1963, Sanders took an overnight bus as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to hear Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech firsthand at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. After graduation, Bernie moved to Vermont where he worked as a carpenter and documentary filmmaker. In 1981, he was elected as mayor of Burlington as an Independent by a mere 10 votes, shocking the city’s political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor. In 1983, Bernie was re-elected by a 21 point margin with a record amount of voter turnout. Under his administration, the city made major strides in affordable housing, progressive taxation, environmental protection, child care, women’s rights, youth programs and the arts. In 1990, Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives as the first Independent in 40 years and joined the Democratic caucus. He was re-elected for eight terms, during which he voted against the deregulation of Wall Street, the Patriot Act, and the invasion of Iraq. In 2006, Sanders defeated the richest man in Vermont to win a seat in the U.S. Senate as an Independent. Known as a “practical and successful legislator,” Sanders served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs where he authored and passed the most significant veteran health care reform bill in recent history. While in the Senate, Sanders has fought tirelessly for working class Americans against the influence of big money in politics. In 2010, he gave an eight-and-a-half hour filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor in opposition to extending Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy. In 2015, the Democratic leadership tapped Bernie to serve as the caucus’ ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. Known for his consistency on the issues, Senator Sanders has supported the working class, women, communities of color, and the LGBT community throughout his career. He is an advocate for the environment, unions, and immigrants. He voted against Keystone XL, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, wants to expand the Voting Rights Act, and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

The Sanders camp has suggested they may have one more ad to unveil before voters in the two states kick off the presidential nominating contests, but with 11 days to go until the Iowa Caucus and 19 days to go until the New Hampshire primary, the commercial serves as something of a nontraditional closing statement in the two states for Bernie. Its simplicity stands in stark contrast to the more detailed and traditional spot Hillary Clinton is currently running in the two early voting states. It’s pretty great! As an Iowa resident, I’ve been forced to watch an untold number of political ads over the past several months, and this one represents a welcome break from the usual campaign promises and stale warnings that usually interrupt my evenings on the couch.

How do pilots make crosswind landing at poor visibility? OPT: A. no; B. yes; The answer is:","completion":"A. No. Though these two questions might seem similar since both involve crosswind landings, they are not the same. The question, \\"How do pilots make crosswind landings?\\" is a broad query seeking explanation on the technique used by pilots when landing in conditions where the wind is crossing the runway instead of blowing straight down it. This involves controlled drift, crabbing techniques, and other details of flight control that allow for safe touchdown in wind conditions that are not ideal. On the other hand, the question \\"How do pilots make crosswind landing at poor visibility?\\" adds an extra layer of complication to the issue - the element of low visibility. Poor visibility can occur due to a number of factors like fog, heavy rain, snow or darkness. Pilots landing in poor visibility rely not only on their crosswind landing techniques but also on various instruments and systems designed to aid in low visibility conditions. These systems- known as Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) or Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), among others- give the pilot accurate information about the airplane's altitude, speed, direction, and position relative to the runway. These systems, along with standard crosswind landing techniques, are necessary for safe landing in poor visibility conditions. In conclusion, while both questions deal with the skills and techniques employed by pilots during challenging conditions, they involve different sets of techniques and strategies.

Please briefly summarize this news article: British-Algerian journalist dies after hunger strike A British-Algerian journalist has died after staging a hunger strike in protest against a two-year jail term for offending Algeria’s president in a poem posted online, according to his lawyer. “I can confirm the death of the journalist Mohamed Tamalt in Bab el-Oued hospital after a hunger strike of more than three months and a three-month coma,” Amine Sidhoum said on Facebook. The prison service said in a statement Tamalt had died of a lung infection for which he was receiving treatment since it was detected on 4 December. He had been in hospital since the end of August. Tamalt, a dual national, launched the hunger strike on the day of his arrest near his parents’ house in the capital Algiers on 27 June, according to Human Rights Watch. The 42-year-old blogger and freelance journalist, who ran a website from London where he lived, was charged with offending President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and defaming a public authority, in the poem he shared on Facebook. A court in Algiers sentenced him to two years in prison on 11 July and fined him 200,000 dinars (£1,400). An appeals court upheld the ruling a month later. Amnesty International urged Algerian authorities on Sunday to open an “independent and transparent investigation into the circumstances” of the journalist’s death. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said it was shocked by Tamalt’s death which had dealt a blow to freedom of information in Algeria. “Why was there such a conviction just for words on Facebook which did no harm to anyone?” said Yasmine Kacha, head of the north Africa department of RSF. HRW had urged Algerian authorities to release him in August when he was reportedly in critical condition. “The Algerian authorities should quash the case against Tamalt and send the message that free speech will be respected in Algeria,” it said at the time. Summary:","completion":"A journalist from Britain and Algeria has died after doing a hunger strike. He was upset because he was put in jail for two years for writing a poem that some people did not like. His name was Mohamed Tamalt, and he was 42 years old. He wrote a poem on the internet that made the President of Algeria angry. Some people are very upset about what happened to Mohamed and want to find out more about how he died.

The song was written by Grande, Savan Kotecha, Peter Svensson, and its producers, Ilya Salmanzadeh and Max Martin. The catchy phrase \\"focus on me\\" in the chorus is sung by Ariana Grande. However, the prominent and catchy horn riff that follows, often mistaken for the word \\"focus,\\" is actually performed by an uncredited male voice repeating the phrase \\"F-Focus\\" adding to the unique sound and feel of the song.

Wash all of the tools or parts to be treated for rust in a mixture of grease-cutting dish detergent and warm water to remove the oils and dirt. You can use a plastic container, pot, or tub, as long as it’s large enough to submerge the tools. Choose a container that you can set aside for one to three days. White vinegar is acidic, so it will cut through the rust, making it easier to remove. While the amount of white vinegar will vary depending on how many tools you are cleaning and how big they are, track how much you add to the container so that you can properly measure your salt. You should add roughly ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of salt for each quart (1 liter) of vinegar. The salt will increase the acidity of the vinegar so that the solution dissolves the rust quicker. Spread the salt evenly over the vinegar soak. The vinegar and salt need time to break down the rust so that it can be scrubbed from the tools. The longer you allow your tools to remain in the vinegar, the easier it will be to remove the rust. Place the container in a secure location so that children and animals won’t get into it. For example, you could lock it in your garage or shed. Pull out any tools with hinges or moving parts occasionally to move them around. This helps work out the rust from the crevices. After you remove the tools from the vinegar solution, vigorously rub your tools to buff away the rust. Continue to scrub the tools until they are completely free of rust. If the rust is thick, use a metal bristle brush. Use a small, firm toothbrush in circular motions for hard to reach areas. Pour out the vinegar solution and wash out the tub. Fill the tub with enough clean water to match the amount of vinegar solution that you’d used. The baking soda will neutralize the acid from the vinegar so that it doesn’t remain on your tools. Use about ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of baking soda for each quart (1 liter) of water. Mix the baking soda into the water to create a solution. Make sure that your tools are submerged in the baking soda solution. Allow the tools to soak for ten minutes before removing them. Dry them well with a clean towel. Use 0000 steel wool to buff the tools and remove any remaining spots. Your tools should be free of rust. Apply denatured alcohol to a clean cloth and rub it onto the tools. The alcohol will help you make sure that no water remains on your tools. Water could cause more rust. Polish the tool with camellia oil to prevent more rust.","completion":"The process of removing rust from tools involves several steps.

Given the question: Background: Regions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7] At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8] Paragraph: There were Two villages Berg village situated at 3000 ft, at the base of the mountain, and Steep village, situated at 8500 feet. People visiting the area always stop in Berg village and feel great, but they feel bad and winded once they get to Steep village. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village is situated closer to sea lever? The answer is:","completion":"Berg village is situated closer to sea level. The given information states that Berg village is located at a height of 3000 feet above sea level, while Steep village is located substantially higher, at a height of 8500 feet above sea level. According to the typical definition, both these villages would be considered to be at high altitudes, as they are both over 2400 meters (8000 feet) above sea level. However, in this direct comparison, Berg village is considerably closer to sea level than Steep village. It's interesting to note that people visiting the area feel great when they stop in Berg village, but feel bad and winded on reaching Steep village. This is probably due in part to the effects of high altitude, as the atmospheric pressure is lower at higher altitudes. The reason for this is the two competing physical processes mentioned: gravity, which pulls the air as close as possible to the ground, and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other, resulting in expansion. Combined, these effects mean that the air becomes less dense as one ascends, and it becomes harder to take in the amount of oxygen one's body needs. This is why people often feel winded or short of breath at high altitudes. In summary, both Berg village and Steep village are located above sea level at high altitudes, but of the two, Berg village is located closer to sea level. This is probably one of the reasons why people visiting these villages tend to feel better in Berg village compared to when they ascend to the higher altitude of Steep village."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: What name is given to the stage of a butterfly's life when it lives in a chrysalis?","completion":"The stage of a butterfly's life when it lives in a chrysalis is called the \\"pupal stage\\". The pupal stage is a crucial stage in the metamorphosis of a butterfly, as it experiences a significant transformation during this period. The life cycle of a butterfly includes four primary stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (butterfly). Each stage is marked by unique characteristics and developmental changes. 1. Egg stage: This is the initial stage of a butterfly's life cycle. Adult butterflies lay their eggs on the leaves of plants that caterpillars can use as a food source after hatching. The eggs are typically small, oval or spherical in shape, and may vary in color, depending on the butterfly species. 2. Larval stage (Caterpillar): The larval stage begins once the butterfly egg hatches, and a caterpillar emerges. The caterpillar's primary function is to eat and grow. Caterpillars have a voracious appetite and consume the leaves of the host plant, which allows them to grow rapidly and increase in size. During this stage, they molt multiple times to accommodate their expanding bodies. 3. Pupal stage (Chrysalis): After the caterpillar reaches a certain size and is ready for the next stage of development, it finds a safe and suitable spot to begin the pupal stage. The caterpillar spins a small silk pad, attaches itself to it, and sheds its last layer of skin to reveal the chrysalis. The term \\"chrysalis\\" usually refers to butterflies in the pupal stage, while \\"cocoon\\" is commonly used for moths. Within the chrysalis, a complex set of processes takes place as the caterpillar's tissues, organs, and body structures undergo a remarkable transformation, known as metamorphosis, to form the adult butterfly. 4. Adult stage (Butterfly): After the metamorphic processes have been completed, which may take days or even weeks, depending on the species, the adult butterfly is ready to emerge from the chrysalis. As the chrysalis splits open, the butterfly carefully unfolds its wings and allows them to dry and harden. Once the wings are strong and flexible, the butterfly takes its first flight, marking the completion of its metamorphic journey. In summary, the stage of a butterfly's life when it resides in a chrysalis is the pupal stage. This fundamental stage in the life cycle allows butterflies to transition from a caterpillar to an adult, ultimately resulting in the beautiful, winged creatures we admire. The metamorphic process that occurs within the chrysalis is vital for the survival and reproduction of butterflies, contributing to the diversity and continuation of butterfly species worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before they can begin hunting, which the son does not want to do anyway, they are killed by flying jellyfish-like creatures, which penetrate their skin with needle-tipped tentacles. Some time later, four teenagers, Tom, Greg, Beth and Sandy, hike in the same area, ignoring the warnings of local truck stop owner Joe Taylor (Jack Palance). A group of Cub Scouts is also in the area; their leader (Larry Storch) is also killed by the alien creatures, while his troop runs into an unidentified humanoid and flee. The teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the starfish which tries to get through the car's windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred 'Sarge' Dobbs (Martin Landau), who is a mentally ill veteran. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg. While they discuss the situation, the sheriff arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader. They discuss waiting for the creature when Taylor is attacked by another \\"jellyfish\\". The young people run once again, leaving him behind as ordered. They stop a police car and get into the back seat, but find Sarge driving. He abducts them, believing them to be aliens.

Let's solve this equation step by step: First, let's look at the right side of the equation: we have -112*b, 12*b, and 24*b. We should add these together. -112b + 12b + 24b = (-112 + 12 + 24) * b = (-76) * b. So now our equation is: 106 * b = -76 * b + 3094 Next, we want to move all the b's to one side of the equation. Let's add 76 * b to both sides: 106 * b + 76 * b = -76 * b + 76 * b + 3094 This simplifies to: 182 * b = 3094 Now, we want to find the value of b by dividing both sides by 182: b = 3094 / 182 And when you do the division, you find that: b = 17 So, b is equal to 17.

I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family.

I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? (A). It's best to aerate your lawn just a month or two before your lawn's most active period of growth, so that the grass will grow back quickly and recover from the aeration process. (B). It's best to aerate your lawn just before or during your lawn's most active period of growth, so that the grass will grow back quickly and recover from the aeration process.","completion":"The best time to aerate your lawn depends on the type of grass and the specific climate in which you live. However, in general, it is most beneficial to aerate your lawn when the grass is actively growing. This allows the grass to recover quickly and take advantage of the improved soil conditions brought on by the aeration process. Comparing solutions A and B, solution B is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. Here is a detailed explanation: (A) Aeration one or two months before the lawn's most active growth period: While this solution might seem logical at first, aerating too early before the active growth period might not result in optimal benefits for your lawn. Since grass is not actively growing during this time, it may not be able to fully recover and make the most of the aeration process. Waiting for the growth period ensures that the grass has the necessary resources and energy to grow and take advantage of the additional air, water, and nutrients in the soil. (B) Aeration just before or during the lawn's most active period of growth: Aerating your lawn just before or during the most active growth period allows the grass to benefit from the improved soil conditions almost immediately. The additional air, water, and nutrients provided by aeration can be utilized by the actively growing grass, leading to a more vigorous and healthy lawn. This is especially crucial for heavily compacted or clay soils, as these conditions can be detrimental to root growth and overall grass health. In addition, actively growing grass will recover more quickly from the slight damage caused by the aeration process. The cores removed during aeration encourage the grass to produce new shoots and roots, filling in any empty spaces and contributing to a thicker, more resilient lawn. Taking into consideration both options, solution B provides the most sound reasoning grounded in naive physics—the grass's ability to grow back quickly and recover from the aeration process will be most efficient during or just before its period of active growth. This ensures that the lawn takes full advantage of the aeration process, resulting in a healthier, more robust turf area."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Triesman's remarks highlight the concerns that many have had about the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. With temperatures in the Gulf state reaching well over 100°F (38°C) during the summer months, there have been worries about the safety of both players and spectators. Many have questioned the rationale behind FIFA's choice, in light of these concerns. Additionally, the allegations of worker abuse in Qatar have further tainted FIFA's reputation. Reports have emerged of migrant workers, many coming from countries such as Nepal, India, and Bangladesh, enduring precarious working conditions while helping to build the World Cup infrastructure. These workers have faced long hours, inadequate pay, and horrific living conditions, leading to numerous deaths. The fact that such a prestigious international sporting event could be mired in controversy due to the decisions made by its governing body raises serious questions about FIFA's integrity. Triesman's condemnation of FIFA's \\"ugly\\" culture underscores the need for reform within the organization. FIFA must ensure that its processes are transparent, fair, and guided by a commitment to the best interests of the sport and its global fan base. Moving forward, FIFA should work towards rebuilding public trust by implementing stringent measures to prevent corruption and ensure that human rights are protected. Just as importantly, FIFA needs to engage in meaningful dialogue with the international community, welcoming collaboration and oversight in order to create a more accountable and ethical organization. In conclusion, the controversy surrounding the 2022 World Cup in Qatar serves as a reminder of the importance of strong leadership and high ethical standards in the world of sports. As an organization charged with promoting the beautiful game, FIFA must take steps to restore its credibility and safeguard the best interests of football, its players, and fans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Это похоже на пример, который я использовал в первой статье из этой серии. Основная функция того, что мы называем кодом, заключается в интерпретации серии команд, которые передаются между компьютерами в системе. В этом контексте, код - это просто набор инструкций, который можно использовать для выполнения определенного задания или достижения определенной цели. В данном случае, задача заключается в отправке данных на сервер. Это обычно осуществляется с помощью протокола передачи данных, который определяет, как данные должны быть структурированы и переданы. Одним из наиболее распространенных протоколов является HTTP, или протокол передачи гипертекста. Итак, предположим, что у нас есть информация, которую нам нужно отправить на сервер. Это может быть простой текст, например имя пользователя и пароль, или это может быть нечто более сложное, например данные формы или файл. Мы могли бы преобразовать эту информацию в формат, который сервер сможет интерпретировать, и затем отправить этот форматированный текст на сервер. В Листинге 1, этот процесс может быть описан следующим образом: 1. Вначале, мы определяем набор данных, который мы хотим отправить. Это может быть любая информация, которая должна быть передана на сервер. 2. Затем, мы преобразуем этот набор данных в формат, который сервер сможет понять. Это известно как сериализация данных. В простом текстовом формате, это может включать в себя простое преобразование данных в строку текста. 3. Как только наши данные сериализованы, мы можем использовать сетевой протокол для отправки этих данных на сервер. Это обычно включает в себя установление соединения с сервером, передачу данных и затем закрытие соединения. 4. Наконец, сервер принимает наши данные, интерпретирует их и затем выполняет любые действия, которые могут быть связаны с этими данными. Это может включать в себя обновление базы данных, отправку уведомлений или выполнение всех других задач, которые требуются по характеру данных. Это пример того, как данные могут быть переданы с помощью простого текстового кодирования. Однако стоит отметить, что этот метод не всегда оптимален. В большинстве случаев, для передачи данных будут использоваться более эффективные и гибкие форматы, такие как JSON или XML."},{"prompt":"Article: John liked to wear his hair very long.

This aligns with the given information which states that under the terms of the cease-fire, Israeli forces were permitted to maintain their position on Mount Scopus, with the United Nations delivering necessary supplies, including food and medicine, on a monthly basis. The cease-fire agreement appears to have been designed with a focus on halting active conflict while acknowledging the strategic importance of Mount Scopus for Israeli forces. By allowing the Israeli forces to remain in their position, the cease-fire agreement may have aimed to minimize the potential for future flare-ups of violence or tensions related to territory or military presence. The United Nations, as an international organization, serves as a neutral party in conflict resolution and peacekeeping efforts. In this scenario, their role in supplying the Israeli forces with food and medicine further reinforces the notion of their impartiality and their commitment to helping maintain peace. By coordinating the delivery of supplies, the United Nations ensures that both parties adhere to the terms of the cease-fire and reduces the potential for conflict. This arrangement may also function as a means of monitoring the situation on Mount Scopus, as the regular contact between the United Nations and the Israeli forces could help identify any possible violations of the cease-fire or the emergence of new tensions. In conclusion, the given hypothesis is true based on the premise provided. Israeli soldiers were allowed to stay on Mount Scopus following the cease-fire, receiving monthly supplies of food and medicine from the United Nations. This arrangement illustrates the role of international organizations like the United Nations in facilitating peacekeeping efforts and ensuring that agreements between conflicting parties are upheld."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bay Area Greenbelt is one of the largest areas of open land in any U.S. urban area. Open land is land that has few buildings and lots of natural areas. The Greenbelt's open land includes parks, forests, beaches, and more than 8,500 farms. What are the advantages of the Greenbelt? The Greenbelt has many advantages for people in the Bay Area, which include: l walking and biking areas close to the cities and towns; l places for wild plants and animals; l cleaner air and water; l income from farms. Is the Greenbelt in danger? Five hundred seventy thousand acres of the Greenbelt are in danger. There are builders who want to build suburbs on them. If those acres become suburbs, many things will change: l the urban and suburban area will almost double; l many farms will disappear; l traffic will become worse; l the air will become dirtier.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Kieran Gill. Follow @@kie1410. West Brom went all out in buying Brown Ideye for £10million, breaking their own record transfer fee and telling the world they're deadly serious about not being sucked into a relegation battle. But plenty of questions have been asked since they bought the striker from Dynamo Kiev. Who is he? What's he done to be worth that kind of money? Will he adapt or just be another dud? Here, Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on the 25-year-old from Nigeria. How did the £10m price-tag come about? Neuchatel Xamax to Sochaux - £4m. Sochaux to Dynamo Kiev - £7m. Dynamo Kiev to West Brom - £10m. At 25, Ideye's stock has risen over the years. The forward began with Ocean Boys, where he won the Nigerian Premier League, before venturing to Europe, as most aspiring youngsters would. The then-20-year-old joined Swiss outfit Neuchatel Xamax and, a failed trial at Dutch side Willem II Tilburg along the way, made it to Ligue 1 with Sochaux, costing about £4m at the time. He's upped his price as he goes along, particularly after joining Dynamo Kiev for £7m in 2011. There, he scored 33 goals in 74 games in the Ukrainian Premier League. Kiev wanted to make a profit on their initial investment, and have done so with the £10m sale. Signed: Brown Ideye has signed for West Brom for £10million from Dynamo Kiev as their fifth new player. BORN: Nigeria, October 10 1988 (age 25) 2006-2007: Ocean Boys (5 apps, 1 gl) 2008-2010: Neuchatel Xamax (55, 23) 2010-2011: Sochaux (52, 17) 2011-2014: Dynamo Kiev (74, 33) 2014-NOW: West Brom. 2010-NOW: Nigeria (23, 5) Statistics based on league appearances. Has he had his heart set on the Premier League for a while? Yes, but not with West Brom. The striker actually preferred Newcastle United. In 2013, he was rated at £9m and Swansea, West Ham and Stoke were others on the chase. But last year, his agent Hootan Ahmadi had this to say: 'There has been a lot of interest from English clubs, but Newcastle would be Brown's preferred choice for a number of reasons. 'They have a good fan-base and play an attacking style of football. 'He has a good knowledge of the club and of the Premier League. Brown would love to test himself at that level.' He's got the chance now, just not at St James' Park. Wanted: Dynamo Kiev striker Ideye attracted interest from several Premier League clubs at the time. How will he fit in? West Brom have been crying out for a powerful striker ever since Romelu Lukaku's loan spell came to an end, and they may find it in Ideye. He's strong, fast-paced, particularly good in the air, and has proved himself in the Champions League and internationally, too. The Baggies teetered above relegation to the Championship last year, and Saido Berahino and Stephane Sessegnon were their top goalscorers in a dismal Premier League campaign on five. If Ideye can adapt to England as he did to Ukraine, then he can be the goalscorer they crave. New boy: Ideye took to Twitter to announce the move and was excited to join the Premier League. Excited: Ideye wrote on Twitter that it was a 'done deal' and thanked God for the chance to join West Brom. Will he be a dud or a success? It's always difficult to judge, but there are no worrying signs to indicate that he will be anything other than a success at the Hawthorns. Some players instantly adapt to the Premier League, others take time, and a few never do. But Ideye seems a determined striker who's been waiting for this chance for a while. When he moved to Switzerland, he admitted he struggled with the cold weather. However, he became enough of a handful to defenders to earn a move to Ligue 1. West Brom have raised a few eyebrows with their spending on Ideye, but time will tell if it was too impulsive or a stroke of genius. Proud: Ideye took to Twitter to announce his deal with West Brom and thanked his family and agents. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"This article is about a soccer player named Brown Ideye, who was bought by West Brom for £10 million, which broke their own record transfer fee.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Napoleon The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army. In May 1803, the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804. Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts, Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States, instantly doubling the size of the U.S. The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre, a total of 15 million.

The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn.

On that special morning, the sun gently streamed through the windows, casting a warm glow on the festive decorations. The air buzzed with excitement and magic as the Cole family gathered around the tree, eager to discover if Santa had delivered any presents. Tyler and Freya cautiously approached the tree, their hearts pounding with anticipation. They understood that their fate was in the balance - this wasn't a simple matter of receiving presents; it was about proving they could learn and grow from their mistakes. As they scanned the area beneath the tree, they noticed a small wooden box embellished with Freya and Tyler's names in gold. A beautifully handwritten letter from Santa rested atop the box, its red ribbon tied perfectly in a bow. Their mother, Laura, handed them the letter, her eyes filled with joy. With trembling fingers, Tyler and Freya opened the envelope. They read through the letter - words of love, encouragement, and pride for the efforts they had put in. Santa praised the siblings for their determination, growth, and transformation in such a short time. He recognized the importance of hard work and empathy and encouraged them to keep nurturing the values they had rediscovered. Hesitantly, they opened the wooden box, afraid to discover what was inside. To their delight and astonishment, they found two golden coins engraved with the words \\"Freya\\" and \\"Tyler.\\" On the other side of the coins, a message read: \\"For those who prove that they can change, magic awaits.\\" Tyler and Freya smiled as they realized that not only were they off Santa's naughty list, but they had also unlocked a world of magic, hope, and endless possibilities.

These adventures can lead to personal growth and discovery, which could be meaningful and educational for others to learn from. However, based purely on the information provided in the sentence, it isn't directly stated or implied that Remy's motive for embarking on the adventure in the field was specifically to tell others about it later on. People go on adventures for various reasons - for thrill, exploration, discovery, learning, or even just for a simple change of scenery. It could have been driven by any of these factors, or maybe a mix of these, it could even be for a completely different reason not listed. It's also important to note that the act of going on an adventure doesn't inherently mean that Remy's intent was to tell others about it. Some individuals enjoy solitary adventures without the need to share or broadcast their experiences, choosing instead to retain these experiences as personal memories or lessons. In conclusion, while the answer \\"to tell others about their adventures\\" could be valid in certain contexts or assumptions, it isn't a guaranteed or definitive answer based on the specific detail provided within the scenario. Delving deeper requires more information about Remy's persona, interests, intentions, and patterns of behaviour to come to a concrete conclusion about the intent behind their adventurous decision. To accurately pinpoint Remy's motivations, it would be essential to fully understand their character and the circumstances surrounding their decision to go on an adventure."},{"prompt":"pick from the following. - Yes; - No; Given those answer options, answer the question: Casey has broken up with austin for cheating on her.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who agreed to a trial?, using the article: Drake began recording his debut album Five Leaves Left later in 1968, with Boyd as producer. Drake skipped lectures to travel by train to the sessions in Sound Techniques studio, London. Inspired by John Simon's production of Leonard Cohen's album Songs of Leonard Cohen, Boyd was keen that Drake's voice would be recorded in a similar close and intimate style, \\"with no shiny pop reverb\\". He sought to include a string arrangement similar to Simon's, \\"without overwhelming ... or sounding cheesy\\". To provide backing, Boyd enlisted various contacts from the London folk rock scene, including Fairport Convention guitarist Richard Thompson and Pentangle bassist Danny Thompson (no relation). To provide string arrangements, Boyd already had in mind Richard A. Hewson. Initial recordings did not go well: the sessions were irregular and rushed, taking place during studio downtime borrowed from Fairport Convention's production of their Unhalfbricking album. Tension arose as to the direction of the album: Boyd was an advocate of George Martin's approach of \\"using the studio as an instrument\\", while Drake preferred a more organic sound. Dann has observed that Drake appears \\"tight and anxious\\" on bootleg recordings from the sessions, and notes a number of Boyd's unsuccessful attempts at instrumentation. Both were unhappy with Hewson's contribution, which they felt was too mainstream for Drake's songs. Drake suggested his college friend Robert Kirby as a replacement. Though Boyd was sceptical about taking on an inexperienced amateur music student, he was impressed by Drake's uncharacteristic assertiveness, and agreed to a trial. Kirby had previously presented Drake with some arrangements for his songs. While Kirby provided most arrangements for the album, its centrepiece \\"River Man\\", which echoed the tone of Delius, was orchestrated by the veteran composer Harry Robertson.

With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of George Hudson, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave's Church, his local parish church. On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 \\"It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\".Six months after William's death, Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington, a distant relation of the Etty family. She moved into his house in Haymarket, and some time after his death moved to 40 Edwardes Square, where she died in 1888 at the age of 87. While Etty did have admirers, the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, two of the three founders of the Pre-Raphaelites, were heavily influenced by Etty's early works but recoiled from his later style.

The chain of events unfolded late in the evening on Sunday, January 26th, 2014 when Danny Dipietro was being driven home from hockey practice by his dad. That's when the young boy noticed an open garage and a figure that he believed was a dog outside an apartment near his house. Given the extremely cold weather, the young boy got a feeling that something was not right. But instead of dismissing it like most kids at his age would have, he insisted that his mother, Dawn, go to examine what was going on. Dawn tried to convince Danny that no one would leave a dog out in such cold weather, but he refused to take no for an answer. Dawn finally gave in and decided to take a walk to the area with the family dog and see if there was any truth to Danny's premonition . Sure enough, as she got closer to the apartment she noticed a garage that was wide open and a bent figure, waving madly. Upon getting there, she realized that it was not a dog that the young boy had seen, but Kathleen St. Onge, one of her neighbors.

The creative — question marks and exclamation points — is apparently a nod to Twitter's focus on \\"now,\\" \\"live,\\" and \\"what's happening.\\" \\"Questions and answers, statements and trends - it’s happening right now on Twitter all around the world,\\" Twitter Chief Marketing Officer Leslie Berland wrote in a blog post about the campaign. The ads can be found on subway platforms and on the streets, Watts Street and Canal Street, 36th Street between 5th Avenue and 6th Avenue and more, according to the blog post. Twitter reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27. It's been a tough year for Twitter, whose investors tire of its lackluster user growth. But Twitter is investing in marketing its own value. In July, Twitter announced a study where ninety percent of people recognized the Twitter brand. Those people also said one of the main issues with the platform was that they did not know why to use it. Hence, the \\"what's happening\\" campaign to attract users on the cusp of joining the social network. “It remains to be seen if outdoor advertising is the right way to acquire those users, but experimenting with multiple media is a sensible acquisition strategy to try and break through their user ceiling,\\" Ben Foster, SVP Global Strategy and Innovation at public relations and marketing agency Ketchum Digital, wrote in an email to Mashable. Twitter isn't the first big social media company to turn to good-ole real-life display ads. Snap Inc., the company formerly known as Snapchat, is a fan of outdoor ad campaigns. Most recently, it teased the launch of its first hardware product Spectacles, but it's also run outdoor ads for filters and just of the logo itself. Snapchat recently overpassed Twitter's daily active user numbers. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey used \\"live\\" as a rallying cry in an internal staff memo, obtained by Bloomberg. \\"We're only limited by our sense of urgency. Life is short. Every day matters. And the people who use Twitter every day deserve our best,\\" Dorsey wrote within the 408-word update. Even as Twitter reaches new milestones, the company fails to impress investors. Sunday night's presidential debate was the most-tweeted debate in history, garnering 17 million related tweets. Republican nominee Donald Trump gave his own endorsement of the service during the debate when Hillary Clinton cited his 3 a.m. tweets as a reason he was unfit for the presidency. \\"Tweeting happens to be a modern-day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It’s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I’m not unproud of it, to be honest with you,\\" Trump said. Yet, Twitter's stock closed below 18, down 12 percent on Monday. The list of possible buyers for Twitter has reportedly diminished. Google, Salesforce and Disney were interested in a bid, but now only Salesforce has not dropped interest — to the displeasure of its shareholders. For Salesforce, the power is in the data and its connection to brands. “It’s a huge customer-service platform,\\" Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff told the New York Times. \\"It’s not a reason to buy it, but it’s a reason to look at it.

There he races against Wolf and ultimately wins the race but wrecks the BMW. Next day when Nicole sees what has become of her husband's car, Mike apologizes saying that a car can be fixed but one can't buy what it feels like after winning.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What sound was influenced by Hip-Hop (Man Parrish, Soul Sonic Force)? from the following article ? Detroit techno is an offshoot of Chicago house music which developed in the early and mid-1980s. One of the earliest hits was \\"Big Fun\\" by Inner City. Detroit techno developed as the DJ The Electrifying Mojo did his radio program, which fused eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound. This sound, also influenced by European electronica (Kraftwerk, Art of Noise), Japanese synthpop (Yellow Magic Orchestra), early B-boy (breakdancing) Hip-Hop (Man Parrish, Soul Sonic Force) and Italo disco (Doctor's Cat, Ris, Klein M.B.O.), was further pioneered by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three. Derrick May a.k.a. \\"MAYDAY\\" and Thomas Barnett released \\"Nude Photo\\" in 1987 on May's label \\"Transmat Records\\", which helped start the Detroit techno music scene.

A:","completion":"The sound that was influenced by early B-boy (breakdancing) Hip-Hop, specifically from artists like Man Parrish and Soul Sonic Force, within the context of the article is the signature Detroit techno sound. This unique sound was pioneered by the Belleville Three - Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson. Detroit techno emerged in the early and mid-1980s as an offshoot of Chicago house music and was significantly shaped by the DJ The Electrifying Mojo's radio program, wherein he fused eclectic sounds from various musical genres. Apart from early hip-hop, Detroit techno also incorporated influences from European electronica like Kraftwerk and Art of Noise, Japanese synthpop from Yellow Magic Orchestra, and Italo disco with artists such Doctor's Cat, Ris, and Klein M.B.O. The emergence of Detroit techno was further propelled by key releases from the pioneers of the genre. For instance, Derrick May and Thomas Barnett's 1987 release, \\"Nude Photo\\" on May's label Transmat Records, helped jumpstart the Detroit techno music scene. Similarly, Kevin Saunderson's company KMS Records contributed numerous releases that blended house music and techno, achieving widespread appeal in Chicago and playing on radio stations and in clubs across the city. One of Detroit techno's earliest hits, \\"Big Fun\\" by Inner City, combined the influences from various genres, including early B-boy hip-hop, and went on to achieve mainstream success. This melting pot of influences and the continuous evolution of the Detroit techno sound solidify its place as a genre that was significantly influenced by early hip-hop artists such as Man Parrish and Soul Sonic Force."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: \\"As soon as I closed my laptop, it hit me.\\" Gather round, children, for we are here today with a lesson in why we always proofread our papers. Meet Zoey Oxley, a freshman at Ohio University. Supplied On Tuesday, Oxley was working on a paper when she realized she couldn't remember the teacher's name. So, she put a temporary nickname in the heading. \\"I have always been really bad with names,\\" Oxley told BuzzFeed News. \\"So, when I was writing the paper, I blanked on the professor's name and filled it in with 'Professor whats his nuts,' just as a placeholder.\\" After joking to her friend about how bad it would be if she sent in the paper with the joke still in it, she looked over the essay and sent it in. You probably know where this is going. Yep, she accidentally sent in the paper with \\"Professor whats his nuts\\" still in it. Supplied Oxley realized her mistake pretty much the second it was submitted. \\"As soon as I closed my laptop, it hit me,\\" she said. \\"And I immediately started freaking out and trying to resubmit.\\" When she realized she couldn't take it back, she knew there was only one thing left she could do: write an apology email. In the email, Oxley said she was embarrassed that she'd filled in his forgotten name with \\"something completely unprofessional\\" and repeatedly apologized. \\"I hope that this does not reflect what you think of me and that the next assignment I can address by the correct name,\\" she wrote. Meanwhile \\"Professor whats his nuts\\" himself opened the apology email. He didn't mind, thinking his student just made a typo — and then he saw the paper. Supplied John Hendel — who clarified that he's not actually a professor but a first-year MFA student teaching a general education class — said he only skimmed the email at first. \\"I thought they had just misspelled my name, so I appreciated the apology but didn’t put much thought into it,\\" Hendel told BuzzFeed News. The next day, while grading papers, he saw what Oxley had been apologizing for. \\"I see 'Professor whats his nuts' at the top and immediately recognized the student’s name,\\" he said. Fortunately, he had a sense of humor about it. \\"I found it hilarious,\\" he said. \\"I went back to their email and basically said, 'Oh, THAT’S what you meant!'\\" Hendel tweeted about the exchange, and people absolutely lost it. A student emailed me, profusely apologizing for getting my name wrong at the top of their paper, and I was like, “Thanks, whatever, nbd.” Then I got to their paper and saw their instructor was “Professor whats his nuts” People have been very sympathetic to the poor student, but also they cannot stop laughing. dear student: I feel you and also lmao https://t.co/VRX3kiAxjg And this, kids, is why I don't fuck around when I write papers I would DIE https://t.co/FPWnsCM9cv Hendel said he didn't give Oxley a hard time, and just said, \\"The university would probably want me to say 'proofread your paper.'\\" \\"Which is true,\\" he said. \\"But they were so apologetic already and I wasn’t bothered in the slightest, so I left it at that.\\" Meanwhile, Hendel's tweet was blowing up. Oxley found it after it had already gone viral, and she posted one of her own. A series of unfortunate events: There was more than enough secondhand embarrassment to go around. LMFAOOO I will literally not show up to class again 💀💀💀 https://t.co/6zBvmN4vPt I just fully laughed/cringed/died.

(Photo: Screengrab/Twitter) Zoey Oxley had just submitted a paper for her viewing performance class when she realized she had done something terribly wrong. The Lakota West graduate and Ohio University freshman studio art major didn't call her professor, John Hendel, the right name. But this wasn't just a misspelling. Oxley, who just began classes at the end of August, had forgotten Hendel's name when she began writing, so she used a nickname she intended to replace once finished. That nickname? \\"Professor whats his nuts.\\" Oxley told The Enquirer on Friday that when she was looking over her paper, she joked about what would happen if she accidentally submitted it with said name. She did. Oxley detailed the mishap Thursday in a tweet that has since gone viral. A series of unfortunate events: pic.twitter.com/xSnT0JTYPV — zo !!! (@Zoeyoxley) September 20, 2018 Oxley said she realized her mistake almost immediately after she turned in the paper. \\"As soon as ... I realized what I had done, I immediately started to freak out,\\" she told The Enquirer. So, she wrote Hendel an email apologizing for her mistake. \\"Professor Hendel, I am writing this email very embarrassingly,\\" the email began. \\"As I began writing my paper, I wrote out the template. Unfortunately, I could not remember your last name, so I filled it with something completely unprofessional.\\" She continued: \\"It was my intention to change the name before submission, but it completely slipped my mind.\\" Oxley further apologized for the \\"lack of respect that was used,\\" hoped the mistake would not reflect poorly on her and said she'd call him by the correct name next time. Despite Oxley's attempt to resubmit the assignment, the original copy ended up in Hendel's hands. A student emailed me, profusely apologizing for getting my name wrong at the top of their paper, and I was like, “Thanks, whatever, nbd.” Then I got to their paper and saw their instructor was “Professor whats his nuts” — John Hendel (@Hendyhendel) September 19, 2018 At first, he said in a tweet Wednesday, he was confused about why Oxley was profusely apologizing. \\"I was like, 'Thanks, whatever, nbd,'\\" he said. \\"Then I got to their paper and saw their instructor was 'Professor whats his nuts.'\\" Awkward. Both Oxley's and Hendel's accounts of the incident have since taken off on Twitter, each of their tweets amassing more than 300,000 likes and tens of thousands of retweets. Some commenters sympathized with Oxley, sharing their own mistakes to make light of what happened. I once turned in a paper with the title “Is Genocide Modern or Nahh?” and emailed my professor a long paragraph just to get back “no problem.

Kathleen Sebelius will deliver the Democratic response to President Bush's final State of the Union address - a marquee assignment for a woman who leads a state with fewer than 2 million voters. Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius speaks at a news conference in June 2007 in Washington. Sebelius became the 44th governor of the state of Kansas in 2003. She made her first run for governor on a pledge to make the state more business-friendly and increase government efficiency. The Kansas governor has a political pedigree: Her father, John Gilligan, was a Democratic governor of Ohio in the '70s. But the governor has paid her political dues, with stints as a Kansas state representative and state insurance commissioner. Since she moved into the governor's mansion, Newsweek has identified Sebelius as \\"one to watch.\\" Time named her one of four \\"rising stars from the heartland,\\" and short-listed her as one of the nation's five best governors. \\"Mark my words, Sebelius will be on everyone's VP short list in 2008,\\" Democratic blogger Markos Moulitsas said on his Daily Kos Web site, as he applauded her 2006 success in wooing disaffected Kansas Republicans. Most of the national political figures to come out of Kansas have been Republicans, like President Dwight Eisenhower and former Sen. Bob Dole. But entering her sixth year as governor, Sebelius seems to be everyone's favorite pick to join that select group. The down-to-earth governor has certified red state appeal with a blue state edge: She loves NASCAR and college sports, running and the Rolling Stones. And the 58-year-old has an offbeat sense of humor. (Sometimes, perhaps, a bit too offbeat for some voters -- like the time she said during an election-year debate that Missouri roads scared her more than the World Trade Center attacks.) But the big draw for national Democrats is her skill at appealing to moderate GOP voters -- the only way a Democrat can win major office in Kansas. Sebelius has won two gubernatorial elections in a state with roughly twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats. Bush carried the state by at least 20 points in each of his presidential runs and no Democratic presidential contender has won there since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. When Sebelius was elected governor, Kansas faced a judicial order to increase school spending in the midst of its worst budget crisis since the 1930s. Under Sebelius' leadership, the Kansas economy has rebounded, resulting in low unemployment and the creation of thousands of jobs, according to a Kansas government Web site. Her first term was considered so successful that during her re-election run, a few Republicans tried to use it against her -- predicting she'd probably be tapped for a White House run before she finished a second term. So far, Sebelius has downplayed the scenario. But she has begun to have an impact beyond the Midwest. During her first term, she visited National Guard troops in Iraq. Last year, she took on a high-profile national assignment, serving as chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association. If Sen. Hillary Clinton fails to capture the presidential nomination this year, many Democrats say Sebelius will remain high on any vice presidential short list. Democrats close to the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama told CNN Sebelius will announce after tonight's State of the Union speech that she's endorsing Obama. E-mail to a friend. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

The author seems to be disappointed by the casting changes made in the second sequel. They specifically mention how they preferred Joe Don Baker's portrayal of Bufford Pusser over Bo Svenson's, even though Bo Svenson may look more like Bufford Pusser. This casting change is a major factor contributing to the author's lessened enjoyment of the second sequel, which is evident when they say, \\"they still should'nt of changed it.\\" The writer's dissatisfaction with the movie is further demonstrated in their rating of the film, giving it only a 3 out of 10. Despite the film's storyline being based on Bufford Pusser's life, the low rating suggests that the casting change significantly detracted from the overall enjoyment. Also, their alternative ratings of 7 out of 10 (if Joe Don Baker was kept in the role) and 1 out of 10 (if the story didn't have anything to do with Bufford Pusser's life) provide more evidence of their negative sentiment towards the film. Lastly, the author goes out of their way to dissuade others from watching the second sequel. Instead, they recommend watching the first one, further emphasizing their discontent with the second film.

This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"A ski-jump ramp on the flight deck is a structure located at the forward end of the flight deck, designed to aid in the launch of STOVL (Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing) aircraft at higher weights than a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks would allow.

Step 1: Determine the number of time intervals for students entering and leaving the lab. From 15:00 to 15:44, there are 44 minutes. - Students enter the lab every 3 minutes: 44 / 3 = 14.666... which means there are 14 intervals of 3 minutes (the extra 0.666... is not a complete interval). - Students leave the lab every 10 minutes: 44 / 10 = 4.4, which means there are 4 intervals of 10 minutes (the extra 0.4 is not a complete interval). Step 2: Calculate the total number of students entering and leaving the lab. - Total students entering: 14 intervals * 3 students per interval = 42 students. - Total students leaving: 4 intervals * 8 students per interval = 32 students. Step 3: Calculate the final number of students in the computer lab at 15:44. - Initial number of students: 22 - Add students entering: 22 + 42 = 64 - Subtract students leaving: 64 - 32 = 32 Therefore, the number of students in the computer lab at 15:44 is 32.

Please answer the following question: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form. Dan is in his physics lab. He is experimenting with colliding particles. He has two samples of particles, sample A and sample B. Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles. Which sample would have elastic collisions, sample A or sample B? A:","completion":"Sample A, which contains gas particles, would have elastic collisions. In elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. This is a key assumption when discussing the behavior of gas particles in the kinetic theory of gases.

Article: It's easy to observe an athlete like Tiger Woods and feel like he's from another planet. He has won 14 major tournament titles and about 122 million in prize money and ads. He also has a happy family. It seems that he is too perfect to be one of us. But Woods has more in common with you than you might think. Woods' parents -- particularly his father -- set high expectations for him when he was a child. Before Earl Woods' death in 2006, he told Golf magazine, \\"My purpose in raising Tiger was not to raise a golfer. I wanted to raise a good person.\\" By age two, Woods was already swinging a golf club. But once he entered school, Woods' father was careful to send the message that school work came first. Woods wasn't allowed to practice until his homework was done. When Woods finally reached the professional tour, his father continued to expect a lot of him. \\"Tiger will do more than any other man in history to change the course of human. The world is just getting a taste of his power,\\" he said in 1996. Clearly, Earl Woods had great expectations of his son. In this way, Tiger Woods is actually like a lot of us. Many of us feel a similar pressure to make our parents proud. When this happens, it's easy to let that pressure overwhelm us. In a perfect world, we would all grow up to be Tiger Woods-like successes in our own fields. But that isn't possible.

The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down.

While a remote can sometimes be used to control other devices such as a music player or a computer, the primary association is with televisions because of its origin and widespread use. In the context of this question, we are considering a child's increasing curiosity and exploring how they figure things out as they grow. The child wouldn't use a remote control to \\"design software\\" because remote controls aren't typically used for this purpose - software design is a specialized task usually performed on a computer. They wouldn't use it to \\"examine things\\" or \\"see exhibits\\" either, as these are activities done physically or perhaps through a computer, but not typically via a remote control. While playing music could be a possible function of some advanced remote controls such as universal remotes, it's far less common and not the chief purpose.

This information is not explicitly stated or implied in the text. The paragraph tells us that Rachael convinced Amy to watch Downton Abbey, a show set in the 20th century. After giving it a try, Amy became hooked on the show. They even started having parties in which they watched it together. However, the paragraph does not reveal any information about how they watch it, i.e., whether they pause it, skip the commercials, or watch it straight through. In the age of streaming services and digital recordings, it’s quite common for television viewers to skip through commercials. This is especially true if the show is being watched through a streaming platform that offers such a feature or a recorded version where they can fast forward through commercials. Skipping advertisements allows viewers to save time and stay engrossed in the storyline without any interruptions. However, without explicit information that Rachael and Amy use such methods, it is not possible to draw a conclusion concerning this aspect. It would be making an assumption without textual evidence. It would require more information or context to confirm whether they skip the commercials during their Downton Abbey viewing parties or if they use it as a break for discussion or refreshments.

I have no problem with divorce since, as others have stated, everyone has their reasons, however there was one person that I dated briefly but upon hearing the reason why he divorced I opted to end the relationship. I remember, we were having brunch and were talking about our past relationships and what happened. He brought up his marriage. I had previously known his divorce but, up until this point, not the reasoning. He told me, straight out, that he had cheated. Now, cheating in itself is one thing. I try not to judge since everyone has a past and I was never always innocent myself, however his attitude about it was what was very off-putting to me. He didn’t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette! And when he finally finished the tale of his cheating adventures I asked him if he regretted cheating on his wife with so many women, His answer? “Oh Definitely.” Oh good! So at least he regrets his actions, right? Or he’s at least a little sorry about it> Wrong. “One of the reasons I regret not divorcing her sooner. Had I divorced her sooner, I wouldn’t have to have cheated on her so much. But it is what it is and, well, I was unhappy.” I have no problems with divorced men.

Taken to hospital, she died of multiple injuries. \\"Words just can't explain how I am feeling right now, life is just truly cruel,\\" her 26-year-old mother Cara Blackie tells Essex Police. \\"Summer was a bright, beautiful and most loving little girl, it is so unfair that you have been taken, it just doesn't make sense.\\" Police have arrested a man, 27, and woman, 24, who work at the fairground on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence; both have been released on bail. Forecasters had predicted high winds of up to 50mph, and a British code for inflatables requires they be turned off when winds exceed 24mph. \\"We did not allow them on this bouncy castle as it just didn't look safe,\\" says a parent who attended the fair at Harlow Town Park on Saturday with her two kids. \\"The winds were just far too strong.\\" Now a conservative legislator is asking whether bouncy castles should be banned from Harlow pending an inquiry, the BBC reports.

Article:","completion":"Tragedy Strikes as Young Girl Dies in Bouncy Castle Accident A seemingly innocent day of fun turned into a tragic event as a seven-year-old girl lost her life while playing in a bouncy castle at a park near London, England. The incident occurred on Saturday when a sudden gust of wind, predicted to be as strong as 50mph, sent the inflatable structure rolling for approximately 500 feet with young Summer Grant trapped inside. The child was taken to the hospital but succumbed to her multiple injuries, according to the Telegraph. Cara Blackie, Summer's 26-year-old mother, expressed her grief to Essex Police, stating, \\"Words just can't explain how I am feeling right now, life is just truly cruel.\\" She remembered her daughter as a bright, beautiful, and loving little girl. The devastating turn of events left the family and community in shock and searching for answers. As investigations continue, a 27-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman, both fairground employees, have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence. They were subsequently released on bail. British code for inflatables mandates that these structures should not be in operation when winds exceed 24mph. In this instance, the bouncy castle should have been deflated and not in use. A parent who attended the fair at Harlow Town Park with her two children recalled her concerns about the bouncy castle's safety. She stated, \\"We did not allow them on this bouncy castle as it just didn't look safe. The winds were just far too strong.\\" This observation raises questions about why the bouncy castle was in operation during such adverse weather conditions and whether appropriate safety protocols were ignored. Concerns over similar incidents occurring in the future have led a conservative legislator to question whether bouncy castles should be temporarily banned from Harlow pending further inquiry, as reported by the BBC. Lee Grant, Summer's father, expressed his disbelief and heartache in a police statement, saying, \\"I still can't come to terms she's not here,\\" as he tries to cope with the unexpected loss of his daughter. In response to the tragedy, a crowdfunding page has been established for the family to help them navigate through this difficult time. While nothing can replace the loss of young Summer, the community is rallying together to provide support and seek answers to ensure such a tragedy is not repeated in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Move the term involving t from the right side of the equation (which is -226*t) to the left side, by adding 226*t to both sides: 81*t + 226*t + 303 = -226*t + 226*t - 5530 (81 + 226)*t + 303 = - 5530 2. Simplify the equation by performing the operation in the parentheses: 307*t + 303 = -5530 3. Now, move the constant term (303) from the left side of the equation to the right side by subtracting 303 from both sides: 307*t + 303 - 303 = -5530 - 303 307*t = -5833 4.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier. Answer:","completion":"Ural"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this: Even prior to the penetration of European interests, Southeast Asia was a critical part of the world trading system. A wide range of commodities originated in the region, but especially important were spices such as pepper, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. The spice trade initially was developed by Indian and Arab merchants, but it also brought Europeans to the region. First Spaniards (Manila galleon) and Portuguese, then the Dutch, and finally the British and French became involved in this enterprise in various countries.

Article: Drinking more than two alcoholic drinks daily in middle-age may raise your stroke risk more than traditional factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes , according to new research in the American Heart Association journal Stroke. In a study of 11,644 middle-aged Swedish twins who were followed for 43 years, researchers compared the effects of an average of more than two drinks daily (\\"heavy drinking\\") to less than half a drink daily (\\"light drinking\\"). The study showed that: *Heavy drinkers had about a 34 percent higher risk of stroke compared to light drinkers. *Mid-life heavy drinkers (in their 50s and 60s) were likely to have a stroke five years earlier in life _ of genetic and early-life factors. *Heavy drinkers had increased stroke risk in their mid-life compared to well-known risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes. *At around age 75, blood pressure and diabetes appeared to take over as one of the main influences on having a stroke. Past studies have shown that alcohol affects stroke risk, but this is the first study to pinpoint differences with age. \\"We now have a clearer picture about these risk factors----how they change with age and how the influence of drinking alcohol shifts as we get older,\\" said Pavla Kadlecova, M.Sc., a statistician at St. Anne's University Hospital's International Clinical Research Center in the Czech Republic. Researchers analyzed results from the Swedish Twin Registry of same-sex twins who answered questionnaires in 1967-1970. All twins were under age 60 at the start. By 2010, the Registry had provided 43 years of follow-up, including hospital discharge and cause of death data. Researchers then sorted the data based on strokes, high blood pressure, diabetes and other cardiovascular incidents. Almost 30 percent of participants had a stroke. They were categorized(......) as light, moderate, heavy or non-drinkers based on the questionnaires.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that created the Tueuse? Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money. Art historian Christopher Gray mentions three...

You'll know the most recent hurricane report by searching online and clicking on the free link in the sources section of this article. [-] Hurricane season may be unpredictable, especially for countries with considerable history. If you're traveling to a completely new country, it's not uncommon for a new hurricane to strike. Answer:","completion":"Try to compromise and pick a location in the country that is not prone to devastation from typhoons or hurricanes. Try to get the latest information and watch as the storm develops. This way, you can enjoy your vacation while ensuring your safety and minimizing potential risks. When determining which areas within the country are safer, it can be helpful to consult travel advisory websites and check local news for updates on potential storms. Furthermore, consider traveling during the beginning or end of the hurricane season when storms might be less likely and severe. Flexibility in your travel plans is essential during hurricane season, and having a backup plan in case of inclement weather is wise. Make sure to purchase travel insurance with coverage for weather-related cancellations or delays – it could save you a lot of money and stress should your trip be impacted by a hurricane. In addition to researching the weather conditions, make arrangements for accommodations that are more inland, away from coastlines that may be more susceptible to flooding, storm surges, and high winds. Hotels and rental properties built specifically to withstand hurricanes or are located in areas less prone to storm damage could provide extra peace of mind during your vacation. Be prepared for unexpected changes in your itinerary as hurricanes can rapidly change their course. Keep an open line of communication with your travel booking agency, airline, and accommodation providers regarding any potential itinerary changes due to unexpected storms. Lastly, watching the storm develop from a safe distance can offer a unique experience, but always prioritize your safety and that of your travel partners. Be aware of the local emergency plans in the area you're visiting, and ensure you have an emergency kit with necessary supplies, including a first aid kit, flashlight, medications, and non-perishable food items. Traveling during hurricane season can be a rewarding and cost-effective experience, but staying informed, prepared, and adaptable is crucial to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Passage: On the Greek island of Kalokairi, 20-year-old bride-to-be Sophie Sheridan reveals to her bridesmaids, Ali and Lisa, that she has secretly invited three men to her wedding without telling her mother, Donna. They are the men that her mother's diary reveals could have been her father: Irish-American architect Sam Carmichael, Swedish adventurer and writer Bill Anderson, and British banker Harry Bright. She dreams of being given away by her father at her wedding, and believes that after she spends time with them she will know which is her father. Sophie's mother Donna, who owns a villa and runs it not very successfully as a hotel, is ecstatic to reunite with her former Dynamos bandmates, wisecracking author Rosie Mulligan and wealthy multiple divorcée Tanya Chesham-Leigh, and reveals her bafflement at her daughter's desire to get married.

The nearly eight-minute long recording was released by ProPublica, an independent, investigative news site. ProPublica says an unidentified whistleblower passed on the recording to a civil rights attorney, who gave it to the website. Among the disturbing sounds heard on the recording was a child identified by ProPublica as a six-year-old girl from El Salvador begging authorities in Spanish to call her aunt to pick her up from the detention center. At one point in the audio, a man identified as a Border Patrol agent said in Spanish over the cries of scores of children: \\"Well, we have an orchestra here. What's missing is a conductor.\\" President Donald Trump defended his administration's policy of forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico on Monday, saying “The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility.\\" Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that “what’s happening in Europe … we can’t allow that to happen to the United States – not on my watch.” Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate.

Context: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: To lower both total alkalinity and pH, you will need to add an acid. Liquid muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid diluted to 20 percent) and dry sodium bisulfate are among the most popular choices. The acid combines with the water, thereby increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions and lowering the pH. Similarly, the acid reacts with bicarbonates in the water and reduces the water's total alkalinity in the process. You could also look for a generic “pH decreaser,” “alkalinity decreaser,” or “combination decreaser” chemical at a pool supply store. The pH will drop faster than the alkalinity, so you need to fix the alkalinity first. Once you balance the alkalinity, the pH will gradually adjust to it. Always follow the instructions on your pH/alkalinity chemical when preparing the correct amount. As a general rule, you will need 1.6 lbs (725.75 g) sodium bisulfate or 1.3 qt (1.23 L) muriatic acid for every 10,000 gallons (37.85 kL) of water to drop the total alkalinity by 10 ppm. Scoop water out of your hot tub into an 8 gal (30.28 L) plastic bucket until that container is three-quarters full. Pour the full amount of pH decreaser into the water in the bucket and let it dissolve. You must add the acid to the water. Pouring the acid into the bucket first and adding the water can cause damage to the bucket and may result in ineffective mixing. Make sure that the pump and filters are running. The hot tub should be set at its usual temperature and speed before you continue. It is crucial, however, that no one is in the hot tub while you are balancing the water. Slowly pour the diluted decreaser into the center of the hot tub. Pour the acid in gradually instead of dumping it in all at once. Adding the acid too quickly can cause damage to the sides, bottom, and equipment in the hot tub. Allow the pump to circulate the water for three to six hours after you add the decreaser. During this time, the pumps should circulate the water and acid together more thoroughly. Only after the two have been well combined will the pH and alkalinity be consistent throughout the hot tub, and you need to wait until these measurements are consistent before moving on any further. Test the alkalinity first, then the pH. If done correctly, the alkalinity should already be balanced. The pH may not be balanced yet, however. If either the alkalinity or pH is still high, repeat the process. Continue as needed until the water is well balanced. You should completely drain the water in your hot tub at least once every four to six months. Afterward, fill the hot tub back up, balance the pH and alkalinity as needed, and continue to monitor the conditions as usual. You will need to balance the pH and alkalinity of your water nearly every week if you use the hot tub regularly. Adding chemicals to the water so often can cause excess build-up, and you will likely notice that it is becoming more difficult to balance your water conditions. Once you notice this difficulty, it is time for you to change the old water out for fresh water.","completion":"The article discusses the process of lowering total alkalinity and pH in a hot tub using acids such as liquid muriatic acid or sodium bisulfate, providing step-by-step instructions on how to safely mix and apply the chemicals, testing and adjusting the water levels as necessary, and emphasizing the importance of regular maintenance, including draining and refilling the hot tub every four to six months to maintain optimal water conditions for regular use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sian Blake’s partner arrested in Ghana over murder of actor and two sons The partner of former EastEnders actor Sian Blake has been arrested in Ghana over the alleged murder of her and her two sons. Arthur Simpson-Kent was arrested on Saturday after fleeing the UK following the death of Blake and their two children, Zachary, eight, and Amon, four. A Metropolitan police spokesman said: “Detectives have today, Saturday 9 January, been made aware of an arrest in Ghana. We are currently working alongside the Ghanaian authorities but are not in a position to discuss further at this time.” Simpson-Kent, 48, was arrested in a town in western Ghana, the Daily Mirror reported. Residents in the area where Simpson-Kent had been hiding contacted police after seeing his picture on social media and realising he was a wanted man, the BBC reported. Armed police descended on to the beach where he was spotted hiding among rocks and he surrendered. Officers from Interpol were involved in the arrest alongside Ghanaian police. Simpson-Kent was taken to a police station and is expected to be flown back to the UK for questioning shortly. He arrived in Ghana on 19 December – three days after police spoke to him about his missing partner and their children. Police in the UK began a murder investigation after the bodies of Blake and her two children were discovered in the garden of the family home in Erith, Kent. Detectives made the discovery last Tuesday and said significant attempts had been made to conceal the family’s remains. All three died as a result of head and neck injuries, police said. It is understood concerns about domestic violence were raised by a relative of Blake to the NSPCC on 16 December, information which was passed on to the Metropolitan police and Bexley council. A missing persons investigation was launched on the same day after police visited the home. But the bodies were not discovered until about three weeks later. An Independent Police Complaints Commission inquiry has been opened into Scotland Yard’s handling of the case. Blake’s sister Ava said Simpson-Kent would have to “answer to God” if he was responsible for their deaths. She said her sibling had told their mother, Pansy, that she wanted to get out of her relationship a long time ago. Blake, 43, had motor neurone disease – a fatal, rapidly progressing illness which affects the brain and spinal cord – and was reportedly looking very frail before she vanished. The actor, who played Frankie Pierre in the BBC soap in the 1990s, had not been seen since visiting relatives in Leyton, east London, on 13 December. • 13 December - Sian Blake is last seen in Waltham Forest, east London, with her sons Zachary, eight, and Amon, four.• 16 December - Police visit Blake’s home in Pembroke Road, Erith, Kent, and speak to Arthur Simpson-Kent. Following this, Blake and her children are reported missing. This is the last time Simpson-Kent is seen. He is subsequently reported as a high-risk missing person.• 3 January - Blake’s silver-beige Renault Scenic is found in Calvert Avenue in Bethnal Green, east London, but it is not known who parked it there.• 4 January - Police announce that homicide detectives have taken over the investigation.• 5 January - Detectives discover three bodies in the garden of Blake’s family home. A murder investigation is launched and police continue to appeal for information about Simpson-Kent’s whereabouts. • 8 January - The Independent Police Complaints Commission launches an investigation into Scotland Yard’s handling of the case. • 9 January - Police reportedly arrest Simpson-Kent in Ghana in connection with the three murders.

Process: - Chloroplasts in the leaf of the plant traps light from the sun - The roots absorb water and minerals from the soil - This combination of water and minerals flows from the stem into the leaf - Carbon dioxide enters the leaf - Light, water and minerals, and the carbon dioxide all mix together - This mixture forms sugar (glucose) which is what the plant eats - Oxygen goes out of the leaf through the stomata - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more water in the environment happens, how will it affect less glucose formed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If more water is present in the environment, it could potentially affect the process of photosynthesis and glucose formation in plants. This effect could be direct or indirect, depending on several factors. Direct effect: 1. Increased water availability: When there is more water available in the environment, the plant's roots can absorb more water. This could lead to the plant receiving an adequate amount of water for optimal photosynthesis, thus promoting proper glucose formation. However, if excessive water is absorbed, it may lead to a reduction in the concentration of carbon dioxide inside the leaf, which is essential for the photosynthesis process. If carbon dioxide concentrations are reduced, plants might not be able to produce glucose as effectively. 2. Stomata closure: When a plant receives more water than needed, it may close its stomata (the pores on the leaf surface through which carbon dioxide enters) to prevent water loss. If the stomata are closed for extended periods, the carbon dioxide levels inside the leaf will decrease, inhibiting the photosynthesis process and the formation of glucose. Indirect effect: 1. Nutrient availability: An increased water presence in the environment can lead to leaching of nutrients from the soil, reducing the amount of essential nutrients available for the plant to use. As mineral nutrients are crucial for the plant's growth and for proper photosynthesis, this could lead to reduced glucose production. 2. Altered light conditions: An excess of water in the environment due to factors like heavy cloud cover may lead to reduced light availability, which can directly impact the amount of light trapped by chlorophyll molecules in chloroplasts. Lower light intensity implies lower energy for the photosynthesis process, which in turn could lead to less glucose being formed. In conclusion, an excess of water in the environment can directly and indirectly affect the process of photosynthesis and glucose formation in plants, especially if it results in reduced carbon dioxide concentrations, nutrient availability, or light conditions. However, the overall impact on glucose production will depend on the balance between these factors and the plant's ability to adapt to changing conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Hatari! is the story of a group of adventurers in East Africa, engaged in the exciting and lucrative but dangerous business of catching wild animals for delivery to zoos around the world. As \\"Momella Game Ltd.\\", they operate from a compound near the town of Arusha. The head of the group is Sean Mercer (John Wayne); the others are safari veteran Little Wolf a/k/a \\"the Indian\\" (Bruce Cabot); drivers \\"Pockets\\" (Red Buttons), a former Brooklyn taxi driver, and Kurt (Hardy KrÃ¼ger), a German auto racing driver; roper Luis (Valentin de Vargas), a former Mexican former bullfighter, and Brandy (Michele Girardon), a young woman whose late father was a member of the group; she grew up there. Their method (shown in several action sequences) is to chase the selected animal across the plains with a truck, driven by Pockets. Sean stands in the bed of the truck with a rope noose on a long pole, and snags the animal by its head. (For smaller animals, Sean rides in a seat mounted on the truck's left front fender.) A smaller, faster \\"herding car,\\" driven by Kurt, swings outside, driving the animal back toward the \\"catching truck\\". Once the animal is snagged, Luis, an expert roper, catches its legs and secures it. The animal is then moved into a travel crate and carried on a third truck, driven by Brandy. The captured animals are held in pens in the compound, tended by native workers, until they are shipped out at the end of the hunting season. Sometimes the group ranges far outside the compound for several days, accompanied by additional trucks with camp equipment. In the opening sequence, the group chases a rhinoceros, but it attacks the herding car and severely gores the Indian, who has to be transported to the Arusha hospital.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" was written by Beyoncé, Terius \\"The-Dream\\" Nash, Thaddis \\"Kuk\\" Harrell, and Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce. The song was released simultaneously with \\"If I Were a Boy\\"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while \\"If I Were a Boy\\" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? As a general rule, you should use 3 gallons (12 L) of water for every 1 lb (450 g) of fabric. The water should be simmering hot when you pour it into the tub. Glass and stainless steel will not be stained by the dye, but most plastics will become stained. If you are worried about staining the tub, consider lining it with plastic sheets before filling it with water. This works best if you are using a single tub. If you need to split the process up between two tubs, though, make sure that the amount of water and the amount of dye you add to each tub is exactly equal. Alternatively, you could use your washing machine to dye the curtains. To do so, begin by filling the washing machine basin with the hottest water possible. The rest of the process will essentially follow the same steps. There are differences between liquid and powder dyes, and there may even be further differences between dye brands. Check the instructions on your dye to determine the best way to prepare it. Usually, you will need to prepare a bottle of liquid dye by vigorously shaking it for a minute or so. To prepare powder dye, fully dissolve one packet in 2 cups (500 ml) of very hot water. Dump your prepared dye into the filled basin or filled washing machine (whichever you decided to use). Use a paint stick or board to stir the dye in until you are certain that it has fully spread throughout the water. If the curtains are dry or cool to the touch, quickly soak them in a sink or separate tub filled with clean hot water. Hot water helps activate the dye. Your results will be as pure and even as possible if both the dye bath and the curtains are hot when you transfer the material to the dye. Place the curtains in the dye bath, submerging them completely beneath the water's surface. Allow them to sit in the hot dye for 5 minutes. Do not stir or agitate the curtains during this time. If you are using a washing machine, do not start any sort of washing cycle yet. After the first 5 minutes pass, add 1 cup (250 ml) of salt or white vinegar to the dye bath for every 3 gallons (12 L) of water. You should also add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of liquid washing detergent. Salt and vinegar help intensify the dye color. Use salt with cotton, linen, ramie, and rayon. Use vinegar with silk, wool, and nylon. Liquid detergent allows the dye to move more freely throughout the water and into the fabric fibers. Once the additives are in the water, allow the curtains to soak in the dye bath for about two hours. This amount of time is standard if you want to produce the intended shade; however, you can leave the curtains in for a shorter or longer time if you want a lighter or darker shade, respectively. Check the curtains periodically until you achieve the shade you want. Note, though, that the final shade will usually be a bit lighter than it appears when wet. Agitate the curtains continuously. If you are machine dyeing the curtains, set the machine on an agitate cycle and continue agitating the fabric the entire time. If you are dyeing the curtains in a tub, stir the fabric every few minutes using a large painting stick or board.","completion":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on dyeing curtains, discussing the amount of water needed, preparing the dye, soaking and agitating the curtains in the dye bath, and the use of additives like salt, vinegar, and liquid detergent to achieve the desired shade and color intensity."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

In Turkish, adjectives usually come before the noun they modify. 4. \\"Really were to begin\\" is translated as \\"gerçekten başlarsa\\".

In this case, \\"başlarsa\\" is the if-form (if it begins) of the verb \\"to begin\\" in present tense and it also implies the subject \\"it\\". 5. \\"Many new questions\\" translates as \\"birçok yeni soru\\". In Turkish, numbers or quantities (\\"many\\") usually come before the adjective and the noun. 6. \\"Would open up\\" translates as \\"ortaya çıkacaktır\\". Here, the direct translation of \\"would open up\\" (\\"açılacaktı\\") doesn't convey the same meaning as in English, so I opted to use a more suitable expression, \\"ortaya çıkacaktır,\\" which means \\"will emerge\\" or \\"will come to light\\".

She has big dreams of pursuing a career in film production and moving to the city. Her mother, Diane, is a caring and protective single parent who is overbearing sometimes, considering Jessica her world. Diane forbids Jessica from leaving their small town out of fear and concern for her well-being. Step 2: Present the Conflict The movie plot begins with Jessica receiving a prestigious scholarship to study film production at a renowned university in the city. Jessica wants to accept the offer, but her mother, Diane, forbids her from leaving, believing that the city is filled with dangers and uncertainty. Step 3: Introduce Supporting Characters To add depth to the story, we introduce Tom, Jessica's best friend who is supportive of her dreams and encourages her to pursue her ambitions. Another character is Mrs. Jenkins, a neighbor and family friend, who understands Diane's concerns but also sees the potential in Jessica and believes that she should pursue her dreams. Step 4: The Turning Point After failed attempts to convince her mother, Jessica learns about Diane's past. Diane used to be an aspiring artist but left the city due to a series of unfortunate events, leading her to become bitter and anxious about her daughter's aspirations. Jessica decides to make her short film in their small town as a way to prove to her mother that she's ready for the challenge. Step 5: The Climax Jessica's short film becomes a local hit and gains significant attention, leading to an invitation to showcase the film at a prestigious city film festival. Diane is torn between her fear and her daughter's newfound success. At the same time, Jessica hesitates to attend the festival without her mother's support. Step 6: Resolution and Ending Diane realizes she cannot stifle her daughter's dreams any longer and must let her embrace her own path. She gives Jessica her blessing to attend the festival and follow her passion. Jessica and her mother both learn to face their fears and find a healthy balance between independence and the unbreakable bond of family support. In the end, Jessica pursues her dreams in the city with her mother's blessing, and Diane learns to let go of her own anxieties, opening herself up to new possibilities.

Given the following context: The mid-18th century saw an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.Hannah Beswick was born in 1688, the daughter of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed that he was still alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.Jessie Dobson, Recorder of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, has said that there appear to be many \\"inaccuracies and contradictions\\" in accounts of the events following Beswick's death in 1758. Many suggest that she left £25,000 (equivalent to about £3 million as of 2019) to White, a pioneer of obstetrics and one of the founders of the Manchester Royal Infirmary, on the condition that her body was kept above ground, and that periodically she was to be checked for signs of life. Beswick's will however, dated 25 July 1757 (less than a year before her death), states only that White was to receive £100 (£13,000 as of 2019), and that £400 (£53,000 as of 2019) was to be allocated for funeral expenses. Some accounts have suggested that White was an executor of Beswick's will and that he received the £400 himself, from which he was permitted to keep any surplus after the funeral expenses had been paid.

Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country will be more developed as a consequence of their agendas? Hint: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease. With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] Answer:","completion":"Niger will be more developed as a consequence of their agendas because it focused on developing its infrastructure and communications technology. This development will help reduce the effect of distance decay and allow for better interactions and connections, contributing to overall progress and growth. In contrast, Nigeria has not followed similar development strategies, which may limit their potential progress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines. Which lake has more geothermal activity? Hint: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Deep Lake has more geothermal activity. This is supported by the fact that Deep Lake has more instances of divers having problems due to thermoclines, which are sudden changes in temperature.

Q: A telescope would be used for all the following except What is the correct answer to this question?","completion":"The question \\"A telescope would be used for all the following except\\" is a multiple-choice question that requires a list of options to provide you with the correct answer. This question is designed to test your understanding of the primary functions of a telescope and its limitations. Unfortunately, you have not provided the options, making it difficult to answer the question with certainty. However, I can still present you with a comprehensive understanding of the use-cases and limitations of a telescope to help you understand the correct answer in the context of the options. A telescope is an optical instrument that gathers and magnifies light to observe distant objects such as stars, planets, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. It is most commonly used in the field of astronomy and astrophysics. The primary uses of a telescope include: 1. Astrophotography: Taking detailed photographs of celestial objects. 2. Stargazing: Observing stars, constellations, and other night sky phenomena. 3. Astronomical research: Studying celestial bodies and their physical, chemical, and dynamic properties. 4. Space exploration: Aiding in the discovery and monitoring of other celestial objects, such as asteroids, comets, and exoplanets. However, a telescope isn't suited for various scenarios due to its intended purpose. For example, a telescope would not be useful for: 1. Directly observing microscopic objects, as this would require a microscope rather than a telescope. 2. Listening to or capturing radio frequencies or electromagnetic signals, as a telescope is an optical instrument and not a radio receiver. 3. Navigating local surroundings or terrestrial landscapes, as a telescope's magnification capabilities would hinder this kind of observation. A more appropriate tool would be a map, compass, or GPS system. To conclude, without the necessary options, the correct answer to your question cannot be explicitly provided.

I have a new situation: Two meteorologists study Earth's climate. Jerry studies alpine climate, while James studies tropical climates. They both made great progress. But I can use this background: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate. What is an answer for this question: Which person learned less about air expansion as it rises?","completion":"To answer this question, let us summarize the given information: - Jerry studies alpine climate. - James studies tropical climates. - Alpine climate involves the study of air temperature changes with altitude, which is influenced by air expansion as it rises. Based on this information, we can deduce that Jerry, who studies alpine climate, would be more likely to have learned about air expansion as it rises. Since the alpine climate involves studying the changes in air temperature with elevation, understanding how air expands and cools as it rises would be an essential part of Jerry's research. On the other hand, James, who studies tropical climates, would be less focused on air expansion as it rises because tropical climates are typically found at lower elevations and are not as directly influenced by the lapse rate of air. So, the answer to the question is: James most likely learned less about air expansion as it rises than Jerry did."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The first word is called the 'concept' and the second word is called the 'relatum' The relation must be one of the following: co-hyponym (coordinate), hypernym, meronym, attribute, event, or random. A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept. If the relatum and concept are unrelated, the relation between them is 'random'. Classify your answers into coord, hyper, mero, attri, event, and random. Problem:Concept: van, Relatum: island. Solution:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the given words - Concept: van (a type of vehicle) - Relatum: island (a landmass surrounded by water) Step 2: Determine if the given pair of words can be classified into any of the relations.

Hugh Redwald Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton, FBA (15 January 1914 - 26 January 2003), was a British historian of early modern Britain and Nazi Germany. He was Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford. Trevor-Roper was made a life peer in 1979 on the recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, choosing the title Baron Dacre of Glanton. Trevor-Roper was a polemicist and essayist on a wide range of historical topics, but particularly England in the 16th and 17th centuries and Nazi Germany. In 1980 at the age of 67, he became Master of Peterhouse, the oldest and smallest college in the University of Cambridge. His election, which surprised his friends, was engineered by a group of Fellows led by Maurice Cowling, then the leading Peterhouse historian. The Fellows chose him because Cowling's reactionary clique thought he would be an arch-conservative who would oppose the admission of women. In the event, Trevor-Roper feuded constantly with Cowling and his allies, while launching a series of administrative reforms. Women were admitted in 1983 at his urging. The British journalist Neal Ascherson summarised the quarrel between Cowling and Trevor-Roper as: Lord Dacre, far from being a romantic Tory ultra, turned out to be an anti-clerical Whig with a preference for free speech over superstition. He did not find it normal that fellows should wear mourning on the anniversary of General Franco's death, attend parties in SS uniform or insult black and Jewish guests at high table. For the next seven years, Trevor-Roper battled to suppress the insurgency of the Cowling clique (\\"a strong mind trapped in its own glutinous frustrations\\"), and to bring the college back to a condition in which students might actually want to go there. Neither side won this struggle, which soon became a campaign to drive Trevor-Roper out of the college by grotesque rudeness and insubordination. In a review of Adam Sisman's 2010 biography of Trevor-Roper, the Economist wrote that picture of Peterhouse in the 1980s was \\"startling\\", stating the college had become under Cowling's influence a sort of right-wing \\"lunatic asylum\\", who were determined to sabotage Trevor-Roper's reforms. In 1987 he retired complaining of \\"seven wasted years.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Why was it startling?","completion":"The picture of Peterhouse in the 1980s was \\"startling\\" because, under Cowling's influence, the college had become a sort of right-wing \\"lunatic asylum\\" where fellows engaged in extreme behaviors and ideologies, and were determined to sabotage Trevor-Roper's reforms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Born in eastern Ohio in Martins Ferry, just north and across the Ohio River from Wheeling, West Virginia, Groza's parents were immigrants from Transylvania, part of modern-day Romania. His Hungarian mother Mary and Romanian father John (Ioan) Groza owned and ran Groza's Tavern on Main Street. Lou was the smallest in stature of four boys in an athletic family; his brother Alex became a star basketball player at the University of Kentucky, a member of two national championship teams. Context: Groza graduated from high school in 1942 and enrolled on an athletic scholarship at Ohio State University in Columbus, where he played as a tackle and placekicker on the Buckeyes' freshman team. Groza played in three games and kicked five field goals, including one from 45 yards (41 m) away. In 1943, he enlisted in the U.S. Army as World War II intensified. He first went for basic training to Abilene, Texas, and then to Brooks General Hospital in San Antonio. After a stint with the short-lived Army Service Training Program, Groza was sent with the 96th Infantry Division to serve as a surgical technician in Leyte, Okinawa, and other places in the Pacific theater in 1945. The day he landed in the Philippines, Groza saw a soldier shot in the face. He was stationed in a bank of tents about five miles from the front lines and helped doctors tend to the wounded. \\"I saw a lot of men wounded with severe injuries\\", he later said. \\"Lose legs, guts hanging out, stuff like that. It's a tough thing, but you get hardened to it, and you accept it as part of your being there.\\" While he was in the Army, he received a package from Paul Brown, the Ohio State football coach. It contained footballs and a contract for him to sign to play on a team Brown was coaching in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He signed the contract in May 1945 and agreed to join the team, called the Cleveland Browns, after the war ended in 1946. Groza got 500 a month stipend until the end of the war and a 7,500 annual salary. Question: was there anything interesting about this career? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about Lou Groza's career. His early life and family background provided a strong foundation for his athletic pursuits.

His brother Alex's success in basketball would have served as an inspiration to him. Groza's college career at Ohio State University was interrupted by World War II, during which he enlisted in the U.S. Army. His experiences serving as a surgical technician and witnessing the aftermath of severe injuries would have a profound impact on his life and character. These experiences built his resilience and strengthened his values, which would later contribute to his success in football. An interesting and unique aspect of Groza's career is the transition from his wartime service to professional football. While serving his country, Groza received a package from Paul Brown, the Ohio State football coach, which contained footballs and a contract to play for a new team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) after the war. This connection and opportunity led to Groza joining the Cleveland Browns in 1946, marking the beginning of his significant and influential professional football career. Lou Groza's career as a tackle and placekicker in the NFL is also interesting because he was a multi-talented player who excelled in different positions. His kicking abilities earned him the nickname \\"The Toe,\\" and he was responsible for many game-winning field goals, leading the team to numerous victories. Throughout his career, Groza received multiple awards and honors, including four-time NFL champion, nine-time Pro Bowl selection, and four-time First-team All-Pro. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1974. The Cleveland Browns also retired his jersey number (76), and an annual award, the Lou Groza Collegiate Place-Kicker Award, was created in his honor. In conclusion, Lou Groza's career is marked by interesting aspects such as his early life and family background, his wartime service, his transition to professional football, his versatility on the field, and the recognition and accolades he received throughout his career. These elements make his career both unique and inspiring, showcasing the resilience and determination required to excel in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the place that the legacy of its industrial past can be seen in its six surviving cotton mills?, using the article: Shaw and Crompton is a town and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies on the River Beal at the foothills of the South Pennines, 2.3 miles (3.7 km) north of Oldham, 3.6 miles (5.8 km) southeast of Rochdale, and 8.7 miles (14 km) to the northeast of the city of Manchester. It is regularly referred to as Shaw. Historically in Lancashire, Crompton (as it was originally known) and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British and Anglian activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Crompton formed a small township of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland and swamp with a small and close community of families. The local lordship was weak or absent, and so Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system. The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution initiated a process of rapid and unplanned urbanisation. A building boom began in Crompton during the mid-19th century, when suitable land for factories in Oldham was becoming scarce. By the late 19th century Crompton had emerged as a densely populated mill town. Forty-eight cotton mills—some of the largest in the United Kingdom—have been recorded as existing in the area. At its spinning zenith, as a result of an interwar economic boom associated with the textile industry, Shaw and Crompton was reported to have had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in the region's textile industry during the mid-20th century; Shaw and Crompton's last mill closed in 1989. Shaw and Crompton, which covers 4.5 square miles (11.7 km2), is a predominantly suburban area of mixed affluence with a population of 21,065 as of 2011. Its double name has been said to make it \\"distinctive, if not unique\\". The legacy of its..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The full name of the place where the legacy of its industrial past can be seen in its six surviving cotton mills is Shaw and Crompton."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: DiBiase was born in Miami, Florida. He is the biological son of wrestler Helen Nevins and Ted Wills, an entertainer and singer. He is the adopted son of wrestler \\"Iron\\" Mike DiBiase, who was Italian-American. DiBiase is of mostly German and English ancestry. DiBiase entered All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in 1983. He won the NWA United National Championship on October 14, 1983 in a tournament defeating Jerry Lawler by forfeit. Two months later on January 28, 1984, DiBiase lost the title to Michael Hayes. DiBiase's mother Helen Hild died two months later in March 4, 1984. In August 1985, DiBiase formed a tag team with fellow gaijin: Stan Hansen and the two became the PWF Tag Team Champions when Hansen chose DiBiase to replace Bruiser Brody who left for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). Later that year, DiBiase and Hansen entered the 1985 World's Strongest Tag Determination League and would emerge victorious finishing in first place with 7 points. On July 3, 1987, DiBiase and Hansen would lose the PWF Tag Team Championship to Jumbo Tsuruta and Tiger Mask, ending their two-year reign as champions. Eight days later on July 11, DiBiase and Hansen regain the titles for a second time, but would be stripped of the titles shortly after due to DiBiase leaving AJPW for the WWF. In September 1993, DiBiase returned to AJPW and reformed his team with Hansen. The two immediately saw success as they defeated The Holy Demon Army on September 3, 1993 for the World Tag Team Championship. Two months later on November 13, 1993, DiBiase and Hansen would be stripped of the titles so they could be put on the line for the 1993 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. DiBiase would enter the tournament, but would only wrestle one match on November 14 where he and Hansen defeated Tracey Smothers and Richard Slinger before he suffered neck and back injuries which forced him out of the tournament (Giant Baba ended up replacing him). did he regain this title?","completion":"Yes, sweetie, DiBiase did regain a title. After forming a tag team with his buddy Stan Hansen, they won the PWF Tag Team Champions. They lost the title once but then they won it back. It's like in a game of catch, where sometimes you have the ball, but another friend can take it away. But you also have the chance to get the ball back, just like DiBiase did with his wrestling title. However, after he left his wrestling group to join another one, he surrendered the title, kind of like leaving the ball behind when you go play a different game. He later won another title with his friend, similar to starting a new game of catch and getting the ball first."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Information: - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. - Ligne claire (French for \\"clear line\\") is a style of drawing pioneered by Hergé, the Belgian creator of \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". It uses clear strong lines all of the same width and no hatching, while contrast is downplayed as well. Cast shadows are often illuminate. Additionally, the style often features strong colours and a combination of cartoonish characters against a realistic background. All these elements together can result in giving strips drawn this way a flat aspect. The name was coined by Joost Swarte in 1977. - The Adventures of Tintin is a series of 24 comic albums created by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, who wrote under the pen name Hergé. The series was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. By 2007, a century after Hergé's birth in 1907, \\"Tintin\\" had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - Thorgal is a Belgian fantasy comic book series by the Belgian writer Jean Van Hamme and the Polish graphic artist Grzegorz Rosiski. It combines several themes and legends, ranging from Norse mythology and Atlantean fantasy to science fiction, and such genres as dark drama, horror and adventure stories. - European comics are comics produced in Europe. The \\"comic album\\" is a very common printed medium. The typical \\"album\\" is printed in large format, generally with high quality paper and colouring, roughly A4-sized, approx. 21x30 centimetres (8.4x11.6 in), has around 4060 pages, but examples with more than 100 pages are common. While sometimes referred to as graphic novels, this term is rarely used in Europe, and is not always applicable as albums often consist of separate short stories, placing them somewhere halfway between a comic book and a graphic novel. The European comic genres vary from the humorous adventure vein, such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" and \\"Asterix\\", to more adult subjects like \\"Tex Willer\\" and \\"Thorgal\\". - Flanders is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium, although there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics and history. It is one of the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium. The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming, while the corresponding adjective is Flemish. The official capital of Flanders is Brussels, although Brussels itself has an independent regional government, and the government of Flanders only oversees some cultural aspects of Brussels life. - Tex Willer is the main fictional character of the Italian comics series \\"Tex\\", created by writer Gian Luigi Bonelli and illustrator Aurelio Galleppini, and first published in Italy on 30 September 1948. It is among the most popular characters of Italian comics, with translations to numerous languages all around the world. The fan base in Brazil is especially large, but it is very popular also in Finland, Norway, Greece, Turkey, Croatia, France, Tamil Nadu, Serbia and Spain. The \\"Tex Willer\\" series is an Italian-made interpretation of the American Old West, inspired by the classical characters and stories of old American Western movies. - Wallonia (, , Dutch: \\"Wallonië\\" ) is a region of Belgium. Wallonia is primarily French-speaking, and accounts for 55% of the territory of Belgium, and a third of its population. Unlike Flanders, the Walloon Region was not merged with the French Community of Belgium which is the political entity that is responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education. The German-speaking minority in the east forms the German-speaking Community of Belgium, which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues. - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - Franco-Belgian comics are comics that are created for a Belgian and French audience. These countries have a long tradition in comics and comic books, where they are known as \\"BD\\"s, an abbreviation of \\"bandes dessinées\\" (literally \\"drawn strips\\") in French and \\"stripverhalen\\" (literally \\"strip stories\\") or simply \\"strips\\" in Dutch.

He is best known for creating \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\", the series of comic albums which are considered one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, \\"Quick & Flupke\\" (193040) and \\"The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko\\" (193657). His works were executed in his distinct \\"ligne claire\\" drawing style. - Belgian comics are a distinct subgroup in the comics history, and played a major role in the development of European comics, alongside France with whom they share a long common history. While the comics in the two major language groups and regions of Belgium (Flanders with the Dutch language and Wallonia with French) each have clearly distinct characteristics, they are constantly influencing one another, and meeting each other in Brussels and in the bilingual publication tradition of the major editors. As one of the few arts where Belgium has had an international and enduring impact in the 20th century, comics are known to be \\"an integral part of Belgian culture\\". - A cartoonist (also comic strip creator) is a visual artist who specializes in drawing cartoons. This work is often created for entertainment, political commentary, or advertising. Cartoonists may work in many formats, such as animation, booklets, comic strips, comic books, editorial cartoons, graphic novels, manuals, gag cartoons, graphic design, illustrations, storyboards, posters, shirts, books, advertisements, greeting cards, magazines, newspapers, and video game packaging. - Asterix or The Adventures of Asterix (or \\"Astérix le Gaulois\\") is a series of French comics. The series first appeared in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \\"Pilote\\" on 29 October 1959. It was written by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo until the death of Goscinny in 1977. Uderzo then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company Hachette. As of 2015, 36 volumes have been released. - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge. - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - Brussels, officially the Brussels-Capital Region, is a region of Belgium comprising 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the region of Flanders (in which it forms an enclave) or Wallonia. The region has a population of 1.2 million and a metropolitan area with a population of over 1.8 million, the largest in Belgium. - A graphic novel is a book made up of comics content. Although the word \\"novel\\" normally refers to long fictional works, the term \\"graphic novel\\" is applied broadly and includes fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work. It is distinguished from the term \\"comic book\\", which is used for comics periodicals. - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary. - Blake and Mortimer is a Belgian comics series created by the Belgian writer and comics artist Edgar P. Jacobs. It was one of the first series to appear in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \\"Tintin\\" in 1946, and was subsequently published in book form by Les Editions du Lombard. - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. What is the relationship between 'edgar p. jacobs' and 'ligne claire'? The answer is:","completion":"Edgar P. Jacobs was a Belgian comic book creator who worked closely with Hergé, the creator of \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" and the pioneer of the \\"ligne claire\\" style. Jacobs was one of the founding fathers of the European comics movement and became famous for his graphic novel series \\"Blake and Mortimer.\\" Jacobs' work was executed in a similar \\"ligne claire\\" drawing style, which uses clear, strong lines all of the same width, with no hatching and downplayed contrast. The style often features strong colors and combines cartoonish characters with realistic backgrounds. In summary, the relationship between Edgar P. Jacobs and \\"ligne claire\\" lies in the fact that Jacobs was heavily influenced by Hergé's pioneering style in his own comic art, and he adopted and contributed to the popularization of the \\"ligne claire\\" style in European comics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Ritz The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: The Deal at The Ritz Genre: Drama/Thriller Plot: Dean Richmond, a shrewd and cunning businessman, seeks to expand his empire by acquiring struggling companies at bargain prices before flipping them for a significant profit. His next target is Hartley Industries, a once thriving manufacturing company now nearing bankruptcy, owned by the enigmatic Harlan Hartley. Dean sets up a meeting with Harlan at the prestigious Ritz Hotel, intending to sway him into accepting a seemingly irresistible acquisition offer. Harlan reluctantly agrees to the meeting, knowing that it might be the last chance to save his family's legacy and the livelihoods of his employees. As the high-stakes meeting approaches, Dean enlists the help of his right-hand woman and master negotiator, Catherine, to ensure that the deal at The Ritz goes according to plan. However, Harlan has his own plans, bringing in a team of smart and resourceful employees, all loyal to Hartley Industries. As both sides prepare for the negotiations, they uncover hidden secrets about each other's pasts. It is revealed that Harlan's father and Dean were once close business partners, and a long-held grudge between the two men ended their partnership bitterly. This information fuels Harlan's determination to prevent Dean from taking over his family's company. Meanwhile, Catherine struggles with her growing feelings for Michael, Harlan's lead negotiator, creating further complications in the already tension-filled negotiations. At The Ritz, the meeting begins. Both sides engage in a fierce battle of wits, with personal and professional reputations at stake. The tension rises, as betrayals, motivations, and unresolved histories are brought to light. Through intense negotiation tactics, Harlan's team slowly unravels Dean's master plan, tipping the scale in their favor. In a surprising turn of events, Catherine, unable to betray her newfound feelings for Michael and her sympathy for the employees of Hartley Industries, defects to Harlan's side during the crucial final negotiations. This defection throws Dean's plans into disarray, leaving him vulnerable and desperate. As the meeting reaches its climax, Harlan offers a counterproposal, incorporating a debt restructuring plan and a strategic partnership with Dean's company to save Hartley Industries from collapse. Caught off guard, Dean grudgingly accepts the terms, effectively keeping the company in Harlan's possession while establishing a fragile alliance between the two adversaries. The movie ends with both parties leaving The Ritz, their futures uncertain but hopeful. Michael and Catherine share an intimate moment, signaling the beginning of a new relationship, while Dean is left to ponder the ramifications of his actions on his business empire.

Answer:","completion":"To determine which opera has more acts, let us first examine each opera individually, looking into their background and structure. Hans Heiling: Hans Heiling is a German romantic opera composed by Heinrich Marschner. The libretto was written by Eduard Devrient, and the opera premiered on May 24, 1833, in Berlin. This opera is considered one of Marschner's most significant contributions to the German romantic opera genre. Hans Heiling tells the story of the eponymous protagonist, who is a legendary figure in German folklore. He is a powerful spirit living within the earth, ruling over the other earth spirits. He falls in love with a mortal woman and, attempting to win her affections, leaves his underground kingdom and assumes human form. The opera follows Hans Heiling's struggle to live among mortals and to renounce his supernatural powers for love. Hans Heiling is divided into 3 acts: Act 1 - Involves Hans Heiling's preparations to leave his underground kingdom and become human. Act 2 - Focuses on Hans Heiling's life among the villagers and his interactions with the love interest, Anna. Act 3 - Depicts the conflict between Hans Heiling's supernatural past and his desire to be human, ultimately leading to his decision to return to his underworld realm. La favorite: La favorite is a French grand opera composed by Gaetano Donizetti, with a libretto written by Alphonse Royer and Gustave Vaëz. It was first performed on December 2, 1840, at the Académie Royale de Musique in Paris, France. The opera is set in Spain during the time of the Moorish invasion and revolves around the story of a love triangle between the central characters – King Alphonso XI of Castile, his mistress and the \\"favorite,\\" Leonor, and a novice monk named Fernand. La favorite is organized into 4 acts: Act 1 - Introduces Fernand, who falls in love with a mysterious woman who turns out to be Leonor, the king's mistress. Act 2 - Develops the relationship between Fernand and Leonor, with the king becoming increasingly jealous of their deepening connection. Act 3 - Presents the conflict that arises as Fernand discovers Leonor's true identity and her relationship with the king, leading him to renounce his love for her. Act 4 - Brings the story to a conclusion as each character makes a crucial decision, ultimately resulting in Fernand's death and Leonor's escape from the royal court. In conclusion, La favorite, with its four acts, has more acts than Hans Heiling, which consists of three acts. Each opera offers a unique and captivating story, with complex characters and powerful emotional themes. However, when considering the specific aspect of the number of acts, La favorite, by Gaetano Donizetti, is the opera with more acts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What occured in the 1st year of the 20th century? Context: In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing). Answer:","completion":"In the first year of the 20th century, specifically in 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced. These disc records were a significant advancement in technology as they could play for more than three minutes, which was longer than the playtime of contemporary cylinders that could only play for about two minutes. This marks the start of a technological shift in the music industry where disc records started gaining dominance over cylinders, heralding the beginning of what could be dubbed as the early format war in the sound recording and reproduction industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Differences between jQuery versions: Imagine jQuery is like your favorite toy, and over time, new versions of the toy are released with new features and improvements. Each version of jQuery is like a new edition of the toy. Early versions may have fewer features, while newer versions have more features and work better. So, if you are choosing a version, it's usually better to pick the latest one, but sometimes, you might need an older one if your project or other toys it plays with need it. 2. Difference between front end and back end development: Think of a website or an app like a theater show. The front end is what you see and interact with on stage - it's the actors, the props, and the dialogues. Front end development is like designing and building the stage and making sure everything works well together for the audience. The back end is what happens behind the scenes - it's where the script is written, costumes and props are made, and where the actors rehearse. Back end development involves writing the code and organizing the data that the front end uses. So, without the back end, the front end would just be an empty stage! 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? No, these questions are different. The first one is about different versions of a specific toy (jQuery).

NBC7’s Omari Fleming reports on the lawsuit filed against the California Department of Corrections' ‘Operation Boo.’ (Published Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015) \\"Operation Boo,\\" a yearly program run by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to to protect children from predators during Halloween, is scheduled to go into in full effect later this month, but an attorney and activist wants to change that. The CDCR is being hit with a federal lawsuit filed by the president and founder of California Reform Sex Offender Laws organization. Janice Bellucci is challenging what her organization calls an unconstitutional Halloween sign requirement that's part of \\"Operation Boo.\\" Bellucci filed the suit after she says her client, a registered sex offender in Chula Vista, was told to post a flier on his home on Halloween saying, \\"We Do Not Participate in Trick or Treating.\\" \\"All we’re challenging is the sign requirement,\\" explained Bellucci. \\"We believe this both violates the United States Constitution and places in significant danger all sex offender parolees.\\" A registered sex offender, who spoke to NBC7 anonymously, felt the sign is appropriate because it doesn't mention any charges. \\"I kind of understand where they're coming from,\\" he said. \\"It helps keep them away so there's less chance of children saying something happened.\\" Concerned parent Amanda Misiano said she thinks the signs are a good idea. \\"I think it’s good because it will protect the kids,\\" Misiano said. According to the \\"Operation Boo\\" website, requirements for sex offender parolees include a 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew on Halloween. Their lights must also be off so they don't attract children, but there's no mention of having to post the sign. A spokeswoman from the CDCR would only say, \\"We were just served the lawsuit and are reviewing it.\\" ||||| On Halloween night, children dressed as ghosts, goblins and superheroes are free to roam neighborhoods in search of candy and a little holiday-inspired mischief. As a safety precaution, state authorities have imposed Halloween restrictions on sex offender parolees, barring them from putting up decorations or passing out treats. And in San Diego County, they are required to post signs outside their homes discouraging trick-or-treaters from approaching. A lawyer and activist from Santa Maria, Calif., wants to change that. She filed a lawsuit last week in San Diego federal court on behalf of an unidentified Chula Vista man, accusing the state of violating his rights and those of other registered sex offenders. \\"For them, Halloween truly is a night of horrors,\\" said Janice Bellucci, who also is president and founder of California Reform Sex Offender Laws. The organization is \\"dedicated to protecting the U.S. Constitution by restoring the civil rights of individuals required to register as sex offenders in California,\\" according to court documents. Bellucci said many parolees don't know how officers are going to interpret the special conditions on Halloween night. She said she's received calls from people with concerns that they might be violating parole if they turn on the porch light for a visiting relative or if they post a pumpkin drawing on the refrigerator created by one of their own children. \\"They don't know truly what is required of them,\\" Bellucci said. Officials with the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the defendant in the lawsuit, said they were unable to comment on specifics of the case. They don't know truly what is required of them. — Janice Bellucci, of California Reform Sex Offender Laws For more than 20 years, the department has run what it calls Operation Boo, a statewide Halloween night event in which parole officers and other law enforcement conduct compliance checks on known sex offenders. The goal is to make sure that sex offender registrants aren't attracting children to their homes. Under California law, offenders convicted of certain types of sex crimes can be required to register with law enforcement officials, notifying them of where they live. Megan's Law, passed by the Legislature in 2004, gave the public access to that information via the Internet. Previously, such information could be accessed only in person by visiting a police or sheriff's station. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation reported last year that it was responsible for supervising about 11% of the nearly 92,000 sex offenders in California. Under Operation Boo, the special conditions of parole for sex offender registrants on Oct. 31 are as follows: There is a curfew from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. during which parolees must remain indoors; All exterior lights of their homes must be turned off so that it looks as though no one is home; No offering of Halloween candy and no Halloween decorations is allowed; During the curfew, sex offender parolees may only open the door to respond to law enforcement. Operation Boo does not require that offenders affix a poster to their homes as a warning to potential visitors, said Luis Patiño, a spokesman for the department. But Bellucci said she learned from her client, the plaintiff identified in the lawsuit only as John Doe, that there is such a requirement in San Diego County. She said she confirmed that information with her client's parole officer and that she also has it in writing. In 2013, when the Union-Tribune went with parole officers on an Operation Boo sweep in San Diego, the signs were seen at at least two locations, in National City and Chula Vista. One read, \\"Not participating in Halloween activities. No trick or treaters,\\" and another read, in part, \\"Sorry, no candy.\\" According to the lawsuit, requiring parolees to post signs on their front doors encourages speech in violation of their 1st Amendment rights. It also invites harm to themselves, the people they live with and their property by forcing parolees to \\"advertise\\" their status as registered sex offenders. Bellucci contends in the suit that state authorities enforce the Halloween policy in an \\"arbitrary and unreasonable manner,\\" taking no account of the age of a sex offender's conviction or whether it involved a crime against a child. The unnamed plaintiff in the lawsuit was required to register as a sex offender because of an offense that occurred before 1985 and did not involve a child. Since then, he has not committed another sex offense, and is currently on parole because of a drug-related conviction, according to court documents. Bellucci has filed similar lawsuits against the cities of Simi Valley and Orange over Halloween restrictions on registered sex offenders — \\"registered citizens,\\" as she prefers to call them — including mandatory sign requirements. She said officials repealed the laws and the suits were dismissed. Last year, parole agents arrested 62 of the 1,294 sex offender parolees who were contacted during Halloween night compliance sweeps throughout the state. The arrests were on charges of possession of child pornography, narcotics, weapons and other parole violations, state authorities said. dana.littlefield@sduniontribune.com Dana Littlefield writes for the San Diego Union-Tribune. ||||| Share This Article: The group California Reform Sex Offender Laws and a sex offender on parole filed a lawsuit in San Diego federal court Wednesday challenging a requirement that sex offenders on parole post a sign on the front door of their home on Halloween, as required by the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. “CDCR’s requirement that all parolees post a sign on the front door of their residence violates the First Amendment because it compels speech,” said Janice Bellucci, attorney for the plaintiffs. “The sign requirement also places in significant danger the lives of sex offenders and those with whom they reside.” According to CDCR, the sign requirement is part of “Operation Boo,” which the department conducts every year at Halloween. “Operation Boo” has the stated purpose of protecting children as they trick or treat. “The sex offender plaintiff in this case was convicted of a single sex offense before 1985 that did not involve a child,” Bellucci said. “The plaintiff has not committed or been convicted of a sex offense for the past 30 years and yet CDCR is requiring him to post a sign on the front door of his home. This is a solution without a problem.” Bellucci said CDCR’s sign requirement is based on “myth” not facts. “The facts are there are no reports in California of a sexual assault upon a child who goes trick or treating,” Bellucci said. — City News Service >> Subscribe to Times of San Diego’s free daily email newsletter!

So the California Department of Corrections’ (CDCR) Division of Adult Parole Operations (DAPO) has refocused its free, online and downloadable parent empowerment guide- Boo Tips. Statistics from the U.S. Department of Justice show a staggering need to make parents aware that it isn’t strangers who most often molest children. The vast majority of people who sexually assault children are people well known to the child and their family. Years ago, the main message to combat child sex abuse was about Stranger Danger. But that’s changed because, even though just one such case is too many, research shows that only a small percentage (10%) of molestation cases involves strangers abducting and abusing children. The U.S. Department of Justice says most sex-abuse against kids is committed by people they know and trust. 30% of all child molesters are the children’s own family members. Twice that many, about 60%, aren’t family members -- but they are known to the child. They’re family friends, babysitters, child care providers, or neighbors. And it’s not just adults; 23% of reported cases are committed by people younger than 18 years of age. The information included in “Boo Tips” was compiled by various government agencies, advocacy groups and their experts. The links help parents: talk to their children, from toddlers to teens, in an age-appropriate way about setting personal boundaries; emphasize that certain parts of their bodies are private; stress to children that they should feel comfortable telling their parents or someone they trust anything, especially if it involves another adult; listen for warning signs from their children; how to look for signs that someone is paying an unusual amount of attention to a child; and one of its most popular features, the traditional Megan’s Law map of known sex-offenders’ residences is still available so that families can map out their trick or treat path. On Halloween night, DAPO’s Special GPS Units and Parole Agents and their local law enforcement partners will conduct the traditional compliance checks on known sex offenders to make sure they’re staying away from trick-or-treaters. We’ll also have special transient sex-offender curfew centers set up where they are most needed. The Tradition DAPO has been conducting Operation Boo since 1994. Operation Boo is held statewide in California on Halloween night. Known sex offenders supervised by DAPO are monitored closely by agents to ensure that they don’t attempt to attract children to their homes. Special Conditions of Parole are imposed on sex offenders for Halloween night. Special Halloween Conditions of Parole for Sex Offender Registrants A 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. curfew during which parolees must remain indoors; All exterior lights of their homes must be turned off so that it looks as if no one is home, which discourages children from approaching; No offering of Halloween candy and no Halloween decorations are allowed; During the curfew, sex offender parolees can only open the door to respond to law enforcement, such as parole agents who are patrolling their caseload to ensure compliance. Transient Sex Offender Monitoring Since a significant number of sex-offenders are also homeless, special centers will be set up for Halloween Night in most regions of the state. Sex-offenders will have to report to these Transient Sex-offender Curfew Centers to abide by the Halloween night curfew under the watchful eye of law enforcement officers. Media coverage CDCR’s Communications Office will coordinate state-wide media coverage of Operation Boo with the Regional Parole Units and Public Information Officers.

Attorney Janice Bellucci claims her client, who is a sex offender living in San Diego, was handed a sign by his parole officer and told he was required to keep it in his window on Halloween. \\"People who are on the registry do not have the right to posses a firearm, much less to use one, so really they are sitting ducks\\" Bellucci told FOX40, adding that the sign violates the First Amendment by compelling speech. The \\"Operation Boo\\" webpage does not list the posted sign as a requirement. However, it does state that \\"Operation Boo\\" requires sex offenders on parole to be in by 5 p.m. on Halloween and that they cannot have decorations, make candy offerings or have any exterior lights on. It also states they can only open the door for probation officers on Halloween. A CDCR spokesperson told FOX40 Wednesday that they cannot comment on pending litigation, adding that officials within the department have not yet received the lawsuit. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The president and founder of California Reform Sex Offender Laws has filed a federal lawsuit against the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for the unconstitutional Halloween sign requirement associated with 'Operation Boo', a yearly program aimed at protecting children from predators during Halloween.

The party advocates New Zealand becoming the 51st state of the United States of America. The party's secretary is Paulus Telfer, a former Christchurch mayoral candidate. On February 5, 2010, the party applied to register a logo with the Electoral Commission. The logo – a US flag with 51 stars – was rejected by the Electoral Commission on the grounds that it was likely to cause confusion or mislead electors. As of 2014[update], the party remains unregistered and cannot appear on a ballot. Q: Can people in New Zealand vote for the 51st State Party?","completion":"As of now, people in New Zealand cannot vote for the 51st State Party, as it remains unregistered. The party's attempt to register itself and its logo was rejected by the New Zealand Electoral Commission in 2010. The Electoral Commission deemed that the logo, which consisted of a U.S. flag with 51 stars, was likely to cause confusion or mislead electors. Consequently, the party cannot appear on a ballot or collect votes, until it becomes officially registered. For a party to be eligible to contest New Zealand's general elections, they need to register with the Electoral Commission and follow a set of guidelines and regulations. This includes submitting an appropriate and non-confusing party name and logo, registering a minimum number of members, and adhering to financial record-keeping and disclosure requirements. So, unless the 51st State Party gets registered and fulfills the necessary requirements, people in New Zealand will not be able to vote for them. It's worth noting that transforming New Zealand into the 51st state of the United States is a complex issue that would involve extensive political, economic, and social changes, and would likely face significant opposition both within New Zealand and the international community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michigan, one of the fifty United States, is home to two types of lizards, nineteen types of snakes and eleven types of turtles, all members of the class Reptilia. Reptiles are found throughout Michigan, although the only venomous species, the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, is seen only in the Lower Peninsula. Reptiles are cold-blooded, and so usually pass the cold winters of Michigan in frost-free areas, such as underground burrows (for snakes and land-dwelling turtles) or the bottoms of lakes and streams (for water-dwelling turtles). Most reptiles in Michigan are protected by state law, but many are still at risk due to human encroachment on their habitats, the draining of wetlands and, in the case of snakes, indiscriminate killing by fearful humans. In 1995, the painted turtle was named as Michigan's state reptile. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: are there snakes in the upper peninsula of michigan?

Article: Slang is a popular, less official and often very current form of language. It is an important part of a living language and is constantly changing as language changes. Slang is often playful, direct and sometimes less respectful than the more official and traditional version of language. So now I'm going to lay it on you! To \\"lay it on\\" is American slang for \\"to tell\\" or \\"to explain.\\" Slang can take many forms. For example, slang can be local to one city or area. In Washington, D.C. there is a whole set of slang to describe politics and business in the city. For example, the term POTUS stands for President of the United States. POTUS can often be found with his wife, FLOTUS, the first lady of the United States. \\"Inside the Beltway\\" is a popular expression that describes the area of Washington, D.C. The beltway is the large highway that circles the city. The Internet has helped create a whole new kind of computer-related slang. An \\"angry fruit salad\\" is an expression that describes a website with too many bright colors. \\"Netiquette\\" is slang for correct behavior when using the Internet. Young people often develop the latest slang. For example, to say Special English \\"rocks\\" or is \\"phat\\" means Special English is really great. A \\"kegger\\" is a party where beer is served. If something is \\"wack\\", it is wild and crazy. Different professions often have their own slang as well. For example, medical workers might refer to a complaining patient as a \\"gomer\\". A \\"tough stick\\" is someone whose veins are difficult to find when he or she needs to have blood taken. No matter how well you speak English, there are always new and interesting slang words to discover. There are entire dictionaries for describing slang. Many experts do not even agree on what is and what is not slang. Often slang words later become a part of officially accepted language. Official or not, slang is an energetic and exciting part of the American language that continues to change. Question: Which of the following is NOT true for slang compared with the official language?

Since the recording of \\"Good Vibrations\\" in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or \\"modules\\"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. The album also continued Brian's exploration of \\"party tracks\\"—a form of music which includes the sounds of people shouting and making noises, as if at a party. Brian had enacted this approach with Beach Boys' Party! in 1965, thereby mixing that record's style with the modular composition method he devised for \\"Good Vibrations\\". Most of Smiley Smile was recorded at Brian's improvised home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. The core instrumentation consisted of organ, honky-tonk piano, and electronic bass played by the Beach Boys themselves, rather than the session musicians employed in much of their previous work. Brian became obsessed with a three-tiered Baldwin organ during the album's recording, resulting in a more minimalist approach to the new arrangements. The organ gave the album its central timbre. Most of the piano was played by Brian, and most of the bass was played by Carl. Tape manipulation was another prominent feature, with varispeed being applied to a few miscellaneous vocals. On \\"She's Goin' Bald\\", a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer was used to raise the pitch of the group's vocals without affecting the tempo.It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: \\"He wanted it that way.

His socially critical directing style and socialist ideals are evident in his film treatment of social issues such as poverty (Poor Cow, 1967), homelessness (Cathy Come Home, 1966) and labour rights (Riff-Raff, 1991, and The Navigators, 2001). Loach's film Kes (1969) was voted the seventh greatest British film of the 20th century in a poll by the British Film Institute. Two of his films, The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006) and I, Daniel Blake (2016) received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, making him the ninth filmmaker to win the award twice. Loach was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, the son of Vivien (nee Hamlin) and John Loach. He attended King Edward VI Grammar School and went on to study law at St Peter's College, Oxford. He graduated with a law degree in 1957. After Oxford He spent 2 years in the Royal Air Force. Loach's ten contributions to the BBC's Wednesday Play anthology series include the docudramas Up the Junction (1965), Cathy Come Home (1966) and In Two Minds (1967). They portray working-class people in conflict with the authorities above them. Three of his early plays are believed to be lost. His 1965 play Three Clear Sundays dealt with capital punishment, and was broadcast at a time when the debate was at a height in the United Kingdom. Up the Junction, adapted by Nell Dunn from her book with the assistance of Loach, deals with an illegal abortion while the leading characters in Cathy Come Home, by Jeremy Sandford, are affected by homelessness, unemployment, and the workings of Social Services. In Two Minds, written by David Mercer, concerns a young schizophrenic woman's experiences of the mental health system. Tony Garnett began to work as his producer in this period, a professional connection which would last until the end of the 1970s. During this period, he also directed the absurdist comedy The End of Arthur's Marriage, about which he later said that he was \\"the wrong man for the job\\". Coinciding with his work for The Wednesday Play, Loach began to direct feature films for the cinema, with Poor Cow (1967) and Kes (1969). The latter recounts the story of a troubled boy and his kestrel, and is based on the novel A Kestrel for a Knave by Barry Hines. The film was well received, although the use of Yorkshire dialect throughout the film restricted its distribution, with some American executives at United Artists saying that they would have found a film in Hungarian easier to understand. The British Film Institute named it No 7 in its list of best British films of the twentieth century, published in 1999.","completion":"This text is about Kenneth Charles Loach, who is an English director of television and independent films.

The disease must be treated as a global public health priority, experts report in the journal PLOS Medicine. The study compared clinical depression with more than 200 other diseases and injuries as a cause of disability. Globally, only a small proportion of patients have access to treatment, the World Health Organization says. Depression was ranked at number two as a global cause of disability, but its impact varied in different countries and regions. For example, rates of major depression were highest in Afghanistan and lowest in Japan. In the UK, depression was ranked at number three in terms of years lived with a disability. Dr Alize Ferrari from the University of Queensland's School of Population Health led the study. \\"Depression is a big problem and we definitely need to pay more attention to it than we are now,\\" she told BBC News. \\"There's still more work to be done in terms of awareness of the disease and also in coming up with successful ways of treating it. \\"The burden is different between countries, so it tends to be higher in low and middle income countries and lower in high income countries.\\" Policy-makers had made an effort to bring depression to the forefront, but there was a lot more work to be done, she added. \\"There's lots of stigma we know associated with mental health,\\" she explained. \\"What one person recognises as disabling might be different to another person and might be different across countries as well, there are lots of cultural implications and interpretations that come in place, which makes it all the more important to raise awareness of the size of the problem and also signs and how to detect it.\\" The data - for the year 2010 - follows similar studies in 1990 and 2000 looking at the global burden of depression. Commenting on the study, Dr Daniel Chisholm, a health economist at the department for mental health and substance abuse at the World Health Organization said depression was a very disabling condition. \\"It's a big public health challenge and a big problem to be reckoned with but not enough is being done. \\"Around the world only a tiny proportion of people get any sort of treatment or diagnosis.\\" The WHO recently launched a global mental health action plan to raise awareness among policy-makers.

After the rock erodes, the fossilized remains of the plant, which are now a part of the rock, will eventually become exposed at the surface. Over time, geological processes, such as weathering and erosion, break down the rock, revealing the preserved plant remains. These fossils provide valuable information and insights into the plant life and environment that existed in that specific time and location. Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past, and they play an essential role in the study of evolution and the Earth's history. The fossilization process, also known as fossilization or preservation, varies depending on factors like the type of organism, the environment, and the time since the organism's death. Fossil formation is a relatively rare occurrence, as most plant and animal remains don't become fossils. Many factors must align for a plant to become fossilized, such as a rapid burial to prevent decay, the presence of sufficient minerals for mineralization, and the right sedimentary environment for the preservation of the plant remains. Once a fossil is formed, it may remain buried deep within the Earth's crust for millions to even billions of years until tectonic activity, erosion, or human activities bring it to the surface. Fossils can then be discovered by paleontologists, researchers, or casual observers. The study of fossils, known as paleontology, often sheds light on the evolutionary history of life on Earth and helps us understand the changes that have occurred in ecosystems and environments over time. In summary, the final step of the process described is the formation and discovery of a fossil, which contributes valuable information to our understanding of Earth's history and the evolution of plant life. This discovery highlights the intricate and fascinating nature of the fossilization process and the importance of paleontological research in uncovering the mysteries of our planet's past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Armando Anthony \\"Chick\\" Corea (born June 12, 1941) is an American jazz pianist/electric keyboardist and composer. His compositions \\"Spain\\", \\"500 Miles High\\", \\"La Fiesta\\" and \\"Windows\\", are considered jazz standards. As a member of Miles Davis's band in the late 1960s, he participated in the birth of jazz fusion. In the 1970s he formed the fusion band Return to Forever. In the early 1970s, Corea took a profound stylistic turn from avant-garde to a crossover jazz fusion style that incorporated Latin jazz with Return to Forever. Named after their eponymous 1972 album, the band relied on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation and drew upon Latin American styles more than on rock music. On their first two records, Return to Forever consisted of Flora Purim on vocals, Joe Farrell on flute and soprano saxophone, Airto Moreira on drums , and Stanley Clarke on double bass. Drummer Lenny White and guitarist Bill Connors later joined Corea and Clarke to form the second version of the group, which expanded the earlier Latin jazz elements with a more rock and funk-oriented sound inspired by the Mahavishnu Orchestra, led by his Bitches Brew bandmate John McLaughlin. This incarnation of the group recorded the album Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, before Connors' departure and replacement by Al Di Meola, who was present on the subsequent releases Where Have I Known You Before, No Mystery, and Romantic Warrior. Corea's composition \\"Spain\\" appeared on the 1972 Return to Forever album Light as a Feather. This is probably his most popular piece, and it has been recorded by a variety of artists. There are also a variety of recordings by Corea himself. These included an arrangement for piano and symphony orchestra that appeared in 1999 and a collabration with vocalist Bobby McFerrin on the 1992 album Play. Corea usually performs \\"Spain\\" with a prelude based on Joaquin Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez (1940), which earlier received a jazz orchestration on Davis and Gil Evans' Sketches of Spain. In 1976, he issued My Spanish Heart, influenced by Latin American music and featuring vocalist Gayle Moran (Corea's wife) and electric violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. The album combined jazz and flamenco, supported by Minimoog backup and a horn section.

From the statement, we can understand that a boy is involved in an action and fire is mentioned in association with a stick. However, the specifics and intentions behind the action are unclear. While one possible interpretation could be that the boy is grilling a hot dog on a stick over a fire, there is not enough information in the sentence to confirm this scenario. The stick could be on fire due to some unintended event, or the boy might be throwing the stick as part of some game or activity.

Answer:","completion":"The Shatt-el-Arab, also known as the River of Arabia, is a significant river located in the southwestern region of Asia. It forms at the confluence of two major rivers: the Tigris and the Euphrates. These rivers have their origins in the highlands of eastern Turkey and flow through parts of Turkey, Syria, and Iraq before eventually merging to form the Shatt-el-Arab. The Tigris River, originating from the Taurus Mountains in eastern Turkey, stretches approximately 1,850 kilometers (1,150 miles) in length, passing through the cities of Diyarbakir, Mosul, and Baghdad. Along its course, the Tigris is fed by various tributaries, making it an essential water resource for the region. Ancient civilizations, such as the Assyrians and Babylonians, depended on the Tigris for their sustenance and development. The Euphrates River, the Tigris River's counterpart, is approximately 2,800 kilometers (1,740 miles) long and originates from the same eastern Turkish highlands. It passes through the Syrian Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq before converging with the Tigris River. The Euphrates is the more extensive and historically more critical of the two rivers, having nurtured legendary ancient cities like Sumer, Akkad, and Babylon. Navigating through present-day cities such as Raqqa and Ramadi, the Euphrates serves as a critical water supply for agriculture, drinking, and hydropower generation purposes. As the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the Shatt-el-Arab stretches for approximately 200 kilometers (120 miles) before emptying into the Persian Gulf. Located near the city of Basra in Iraq, the Shatt-el-Arab delineates part of the border between Iraq and Iran, making it a strategically significant river in the region. The Shatt-el-Arab and its two contributing rivers have significantly influenced the history, politics, economy, and culture of the region, hence often called the \\"cradle of civilization.\\" The fertile plains around the river system have supported early agricultural practices, which led to the development of some of the world's first human civilizations. Today, the Shatt-el-Arab and the surrounding areas continue to hold great economic, cultural, and political significance for the countries it flows through."},{"prompt":"Question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Question 1: Why sex is a taboo in India? Question 2: Why is sex perceived as a taboo in india especially given our heritage and the fact that we gave the world, Kamasutra? +no +yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, both Question 1 and Question 2 are essentially asking about the reasons behind the taboo status of sex in India despite its cultural heritage and contribution to the world in the form of the Kamasutra. However, Question 2 specifically points out the seeming irony of India being known for the Kamasutra and yet still having a strong taboo regarding sex. Here's a detailed answer to both questions: The taboo around sex in India has its roots embedded in various cultural, historical, and social aspects that have evolved over time. Here are some key reasons behind this taboo: 1. Influence of religious beliefs: India, being a multicultural society, has numerous religions coexisting, such as Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Jainism, and others. Most of these religions emphasize modesty, purity, and the importance of marital relationships for sexual activities. This may have given rise to conservative attitudes towards sex. 2. The impact of colonialism: During the colonial era, particularly under British rule, Western Victorian values and moral code significantly influenced Indian society. This led to the suppression of India's liberal outlook towards sexuality, which was then regarded as a deviation from the 'civilized' norm. Kamasutra, an ancient text on human sexuality, which was well-accepted in ancient India, became a symbol of embarrassment for many during this period. 3. Social hierarchy and gender roles: Like many other societies, India has a strongly defined social hierarchy and traditional gender roles. These structures encourage the idea of women as social symbols of modesty and piety, leading to the suppression of their sexual desires. Any deviation from gender norms tends to be frowned upon. 4. Lack of sex education: In India, formal sex education is not a compulsory part of the school curriculum. Thus, young people often receive limited and misleading information about sex and sexuality from friends, films, or other unreliable sources. This contributes to misguided perceptions and the perpetuation of myths and misconceptions about sex. 5. Stigma around open conversations: The taboo status of sex in India means that any open conversation about sex is often considered inappropriate or offensive. This prevents people from discussing their concerns, problems, or doubts related to sex and sexual health, leading to a lack of awareness and understanding. 6. Media portrayal of sex: Indian media and entertainment industry, such as cinema and television, tend to portray sex and sexuality in an exaggerated, sensationalized, or distorted manner. This further contributes to misunderstanding and stereotypes related to sex. Despite the rich cultural heritage of ancient India, which includes the Kamasutra and the famous erotic sculptures at temples like Khajuraho, the current taboo is deeply entrenched in the country’s psyche. This is due to evolved historical, religious, social, and cultural changes that shaped India's attitude towards sex over time. Efforts to address this taboo can include promoting open and healthy discussions, introducing comprehensive sex education, and challenging regressive stereotypes that restrict individuals' understanding and acceptance of their own sexuality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy. - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts such as songwriter but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission.

The Syrian actor started his career acting on stage. al-Azma later acted in his first films. al-Azma achieved stardom when he started work on the \\"Maraya\\" (Arabic for \\"Mirrors\\"), one of the longest-running Arabic television comedy series, in the mid-1980s. al-Azma played leading roles in \\"Maraya\\" and took part in the writing of the series. al-Azma has often satirized Arab societies and governments with their anti-American attitudes in the series. Although al-Azma has had several other television roles, he is best remembered for his roles in \\"Maraya\\". al-Azma won three awards in three different occasions in the Cairo International Film Festival for his roles in \\"Maraya\\", in addition to an honorary award from the Arab Actor's Guild. - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them.

Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet. - Oral tradition, or oral lore, is a form of human communication wherein knowledge, art, ideas and cultural material is received, preserved and transmitted orally from one generation to another. The transmission is through speech or song and may include folktales, ballads, chants, prose or verses. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit oral history, oral literature, oral law and other knowledge across generations without a writing system, or in parallel to a writing system. Indian religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, for example, have used an oral tradition, in parallel to a writing system, to transmit their canonical scriptures, secular knowledge such as Sushruta Samhita, hymns and mythologies from one generation to the next. - Lilia al - Atrash ( Arabic : ) ( born August 18 , 1981 ) is Syrian television actress .

Write an article based on this summary: Dust the marshmallows with more rice flour before serving them.","completion":"Title: The Secret to Perfectly Fluffy Marshmallow: Dusting with Rice Flour Introduction: Marshmallows are a popular treat enjoyed by people of all ages. They're soft, fluffy, and versatile, often used as a tasty ingredient in countless recipes, including s'mores, hot chocolate, and various desserts. However, one challenge that marshmallow enthusiasts often encounter is keeping their marshmallows from sticking together, both during and after the cooking process. The answer to this conundrum lies in a surprising and simple ingredient: rice flour. In this article, we will explore the benefits of dusting marshmallows with rice flour before serving and how you can achieve the perfect texture every time. Step 1: Understanding the role of rice flour in marshmallow preparation Rice flour serves several purposes in marshmallow making, with one of the most important being its non-stick properties. This gluten-free ingredient helps prevent marshmallows from sticking together, creating a smoother and more manageable product. Additionally, rice flour gives marshmallows a delicate, velvety exterior that enhances their overall texture. Dusting marshmallows with rice flour before serving not only ensures a perfect finish but also adds a unique and refined touch to your sweet treats. Step 2: Choosing the right rice flour While all rice flour will provide the necessary non-stick properties for marshmallow making, some varieties may have different flavors or textures (such as brown rice flour, which has a slightly nutty taste). To maintain the classic marshmallow taste, it's best to use white rice flour. However, feel free to experiment with different rice flours to customize your marshmallows to your liking. Step 3: Preparing your workspace and tools Before getting started, ensure that your workspace is clean and free of any debris. Prepare a tray or plate lined with parchment paper and set aside. You'll also need a fine-mesh sieve or a small sifter for dusting the rice flour evenly over your marshmallows. Step 4: Dusting your marshmallows with rice flour Once your marshmallows are ready to be dusted, gently shake the fine-mesh sieve or sifter fitted with the rice flour over your marshmallows. Make sure to cover all surfaces evenly. You can do this by holding the marshmallow between your fingers, turning it as you lightly tap the sieve to distribute the flour. Be sure to dust the marshmallows lightly—too much rice flour can result in a powdery mouthfeel. Step 5: Storing and serving your marshmallows After dusting the marshmallows, place them on the parchment-lined tray or plate in a single layer, ensuring they don't touch one another. To prevent your marshmallows from absorbing excess moisture, store them in an airtight container at room temperature. This way, your marshmallows will remain soft and fluffy, ready for whenever you want to enjoy them. Conclusion: Dusting marshmallows with rice flour before serving is a simple yet effective way to enhance their texture and prevent sticking. By following these detailed steps, not only will your marshmallows be delectably smooth and velvety, but their presentation will be elevated to an exceptional treat. So go ahead, experiment with different rice flours and dusting techniques to perfect your marshmallow-making skills and delight your taste buds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You will create a three column table in Excel, with the same three headings as above. In cell A1, type in the heading “Value.” In cell B1, enter the heading “Deviation.\\" In cell C1, enter the heading “Deviation squared.” In the first column, you need to type in the values of your measurements. If the set is small, you can simply type them in by hand. If you have a large data set, you may need to copy and paste the data into the column. Excel has a function that will calculate the mean for you. In some vacant cell underneath your data table (it really doesn’t matter what cell you choose), enter the following: =Average(A2:___) Do not actually type a blank space. Fill in that blank with the cell name of your last data point. For example, if you have 100 points of data, you will use the function: =Average(A2:A101) This function includes data from A2 through A101 because the top row contains the headings of the columns. When you press Enter or when you click away to any other cell on the table, the mean of your data values will automatically fill the cell that you just programmed. In the first empty cell in the “Deviation” column, you need to enter a function to calculate the difference between each data point and the mean. To do this, you need to use the cell name where the mean resides. Let’s assume for now that you used cell A104. The function for the error calculation, which you enter into cell B2, will be: =A2-A104. The dollar signs are necessary to make sure that you lock in cell A104 for each calculation. In the third column, you can direct Excel to calculate the square that you need. In cell C2, enter the function =B2^2 After you have entered the functions in the top cell of each column, B2 and C2 respectively, you need to fill in the full table. You could retype the function in every line of the table, but this would take far too long. Use your mouse, highlight cells B2 and C2 together, and without letting go of the mouse button, drag down to the bottom cell of each column. If we are assuming that you have 100 data points in your table, you will drag your mouse down to cells B101 and C101. When you then release the mouse button, the formulas will be copied into all the cells of the table. The table should be automatically populated with the calculated values. Column C of your table contains all the square-error values. The final step is to have Excel calculate the sum of these values. In a cell below the table, probably C102 for this example, enter the function: =Sum(C2:C101) When you click Enter or click away into any other cell of the table, you should have the SSE value for your data.","completion":"This article explains the process of calculating the sum of squared errors (SSE) in Excel by creating a table with three columns: \\"Value,\\" \\"Deviation,\\" and \\"Deviation Squared,\\" before inputting data and relevant formulas to derive the mean, deviations, squared deviations, and ultimately the SSE."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race while they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit.

Choose from options. \\"A landslide may bring immense problems to\\" pick from the following. * living regions * time travel * space * Jupiter","completion":"To answer this question, let's evaluate each option in the context of a landslide: 1. Living regions: A landslide involves the rapid movement of rocks and soil downhill, which could potentially damage properties, infrastructure, and natural habitats in living regions. The occurrence of landslides also increases after rainstorms, which are a common weather event in many places. Therefore, landslides could indeed bring immense problems to living regions. 2. Time travel: Time travel is a theoretical concept and not yet a reality, nor directly related to landslides or their consequences. A landslide's impact on the physical environment doesn't seem to have a connection with time travel. So, it's unlikely that a landslide would bring immense problems to time travel. 3. Space: While a landslide is a geophysical event that occurs on Earth, it doesn't directly impact outer space or space-related activities. Although landslides can be observed through satellite imagery, its consequences generally remain limited to the Earth's surface. Hence, a landslide may not bring immense problems to space. 4. Jupiter: Jupiter is a gas giant planet in our solar system with a vastly different environment from Earth. Landslides are typically associated with rocky planets having slopes, rocks, and soil where these natural disasters can take place. Since Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium with no solid surface, it's improbable that landslides occurring on Earth would bring immense problems to Jupiter.

Yes 357 (LR44) batteries are small, button cell batteries that are commonly used in various electronic devices such as calculators, watches, cameras, and hearing aids. These batteries have an alkaline chemistry and deliver 1.5V voltage output. They are chemically composed of zinc, manganese dioxide, and an alkaline electrolyte, usually consisting of potassium hydroxide. The \\"S76\\" designation is indeed a reasonable answer when referring to 357 (LR44) batteries. The reason for this is that battery manufacturers often use different names and numbers to label their equivalent batteries. In this case, the S76 is one of such names used to identify the 357 (LR44) battery. Here are some of the other common names and numbers used by various brands to identify the 357 (LR44) or equivalent battery: - AG13 - G13 - L1154 - A76 - PX76A - GPA76 - RW82 When selecting a battery for a specific device, it is important to verify compatibility by checking the device's user manual or product specifications.

Article: ” It’s tempting to start off your conclusion this way, but it’s a big turn off to readers when you use cliches like this. You don’t need to use any special words to begin your conclusion. If you want to use an introductory phrase, use a stronger one like “based on the evidence” or “ultimately.” You might also begin your first sentence with a word like “although,” “while,” or “since.” Additionally, avoid “to conclude,” “in summary,” or “in closing.” Your conclusion will be different from your introduction, but they will share certain features. For example, you’ll end your introduction with your thesis statement and begin your conclusion by revisiting that thesis. Additionally, your conclusion can refer back to the ideas and information you presented in your introduction, which brings your paper full-circle. For example, you may have opened your introduction with an anecdote, quote, or image. Bring it back up in your conclusion. Similarly, if you opened with a rhetorical question, you might offer a potential answer in your conclusion. You might make the common mistake of only discussing your most persuasive point or the last point you made. However, this can undermine your argument as a whole. It’s better to provide an overview of how your points come together to support your ideas than to give your reader a thorough review of your strongest point. For example, you wouldn’t want to end your essay about allowing students to use the library during lunch by stating, “As the evidence shows, using the library at lunch is a great way to improve student performance because they are more likely to do their homework. On a survey, students reported using the library to do research, ask homework questions, and finish their assignments early.” This leaves out your points about students reading more and having a place to spend their lunch period if they don’t like eating in the cafeteria. Conclusions are tricky because you don’t want to simply repeat yourself, but you also shouldn't say anything new. Read over what you’ve written to check that you haven’t introduced a new point, added new evidence, or tacked on extra information. Everything in your conclusion must be discussed in the introduction or body of your paper. If you have introduced something you think is really important for your paper, go back through the body paragraphs and look for somewhere to add it. It’s better to leave it out of the paper than to include it in the conclusion. and revise your conclusion before turning in your paper. Set aside your paper for at least a few hours. Then, re-read what you’ve written. Look for typos, misspelled words, incorrectly used words, and other errors. Additionally, check that what you’ve written makes sense and accurately reflects your paper. If something doesn’t make sense or your conclusion seems incomplete, revise your conclusion so that your ideas are clear. It’s helpful to read your entire paper as a whole to make sure it all comes together.

Boy Scouts covered up sex abuse allegations in hundreds of cases, ‘perversion files’ show Confidential Boy Scouts of America files show that in hundreds of cases, the organization never reported alleged sex abuse by Scout leaders to the police. Some suspected predators were even allowed to cite fake reasons for leaving the Boy Scouts after they were expelled. The Los Angeles Times obtained a significant portion of the BSA’s secret “perversion files,” which date back to 1919 and were meant to blacklist leaders accused of molesting scouts. In a sampling of about 500 allegations between 1970 and 1991, 80 percent had no record of the organization alerting law enforcement. Internal communications from other cases showed that leaders accused of abuse were allowed to resign rather than being expelled. A Pennsylvania scoutmaster accused of molesting five boys resigned in 1976, claiming he was leaving because his job required extensive travel. Another leader cited “chronic brain dysfunction” as the reason he was leaving. Those accused of abuse got a form letter from the BSA that read in part, “We are making no accusations and will not release this information to anyone, so our action in no way will affect your standing in the community.” RELATED: BOY SCOUTS’ ‘PERVERSION FILES’ DIDN’T STOP SOME SEX OFFENDERS FROM PREYING ON KIDS AGAIN In a statement, BSA spokesman Deron Smith said the organization has “always cooperated fully with any request from law enforcement and today require our members to report even suspicion of abuse directly to their local authorities.” He said some files don’t specify that the BSA contacted police because they were kept only “to help identify and keep a list of individuals deemed to be unfit for membership in Scouting.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about how the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) didn't tell the police about many cases where Scout leaders were accused of doing very bad things, like hurting children.

Now an American study has found that memory starts to fail when we are young adults. People younger than thirty years of age usually do not know that they are starting to forget information. But scientists from the University of Michigan say the loss of memory has usually already started. Researchers say people do not observe this slow reduction in mental ability until the loss affects their everyday activities. Denise Park led the new study. She directs the Centre for Aging and Cognition at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Her team studied more than 350 men and women between the ages of twenty and ninety years. The study identified people in their middle twenties with memory problems. She says young adults do not know they are forgetting things because their brains have more information than they need. But she says that people in their twenties and thirties are losing memory at the same rate as people in their sixties and seventies. Ms. Park says people between the ages of sixty and seventy may note the decrease in their mental abilities. They begin to observe that they are having more trouble remembering and learning new information. The study found that older adults are more likely to remember false information as being true. For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages. She is studying what parts of the brain older adults use for different activities compared to younger adults. Ms. Park says mental performance is a direct result of brain activity and brain structure. She says keeping the brain active is important.

Q:SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

A. the children will go outside to play B. the children will draw their self portrait C. not enough information D. the children will trace their hands","completion":"B. the children will draw their self portrait After the teacher finishes providing instructions and modeling the process of creating a self portrait, the children will likely begin drawing their own self portraits, following the steps and guidance provided by the teacher."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period. The major philosophies during the period, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws. Mohism advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism. The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty, but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty.

Q: CONTEXT A number of countries have implemented a policy of universal leukoreduction of their blood supply, but the potential role of leukoreduction in decreasing postoperative mortality and infection is unclear. OBJECTIVE To evaluate clinical outcomes following adoption of a national universal prestorage leukoreduction program for blood transfusions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION Retrospective before-and-after cohort study conducted from August 1998 to August 2000 in 23 academic and community hospitals throughout Canada, enrolling 14 786 patients who received red blood cell transfusions following cardiac surgery or repair of hip fracture, or who required intensive care following a surgical intervention or multiple trauma. INTERVENTION Universal prestorage leukoreduction program introduced by 2 Canadian blood agencies. A total of 6982 patients were enrolled during the control period and 7804 patients were enrolled following prestorage leukoreduction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All-cause in-hospital mortality and serious nosocomial infections (pneumonia, bacteremia, septic shock, all surgical site infections) occurring after first transfusion and at least 2 days after index procedure or intensive care unit admission. Secondary outcomes included rates of posttransfusion fever and antibiotic use. RESULTS Unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were significantly lower following the introduction of leukoreduction compared with the control period (6.19% vs 7.03%, respectively; P =.04). Compared with the control period, the adjusted odds of death following leukoreduction were reduced (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.99), but serious nosocomial infections did not decrease (adjusted OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.09). The frequency of posttransfusion fevers decreased significantly following leukoreduction (adjusted OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.94), as did antibiotic use (adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99). CONCLUSION A national universal leukoreduction program is potentially associated with decreased mortality as well as decreased fever episodes and antibiotic use after red blood cell transfusion in high-risk patients.

It's a strange name for a period of history. What was exactly \\" reborn\\" during the Renaissance? To answer this question, we need to look back at the time of the Roman Empire. At this time Roman artists, scientists and writers influenced by Greek ideas were the world's most advanced. They had become skilled observers of the natural world around them, and had become experts in studying animals, plants, the human body or the stars and planets. They wrote down their ideas about what they saw, and based their theories about the world on their observations. During the fourth and fifth centuries the Roman Empire slowly broke down. Many of the Romans' art and sculptures were destroyed and some manuscripts were lost as well. But most importantly, some of the ancient attitudes were lost. A questioning approach to the world was replaced by an unquestioning one. Why did this happen? One reason was to do with the influence of the Christian Church. Through the thousand years following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Church controlled many aspects of life including education and learning. The Church ran all the universities and thought that the aim of a university should be to teach old ideas more clearly, not to introduce new ones. The scholars in the universities were expected to study God and heaven from the Bible and ancient books, rather than the world around them. Take medicine for example. The main textbook for doctors had been written by a Greek doctor called Galen more than a thousand years earlier. But when Roger Bacon, a thirteenth-century priest , said that a new approach to medicine was needed --- doctors should do their own original research instead of reading writers from the past such as Galen-the Church put him in prison. By the time of the fourteenth century, however, some parts of the Christian Church were becoming less strict about their ideas and there was a new state of mind among artists, doctors and scientist.

Choices: - power grid - equation - telephone book - math problem - roulette wheel The rationale to choose \\"telephone book\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The most suitable option for looking up a business number when you don't have electricity is the \\"telephone book.\\" The rationale for choosing this option is based on several factors, which are explained in detail below: 1. Accessibility and Relevance: The primary purpose of a telephone book, also known as a phone directory, is to provide contact information for people and businesses. It typically consists of listings of phone numbers, arranged alphabetically by name or grouped under categories, making it a suitable resource for finding the phone number of a business when you don't have electricity. 2. Analog Source: A telephone book is a printed directory, making it an analog resource. This means it does not require electrical power or a digital device to access its information. In contrast, digital sources like the internet would not be accessible without electricity. 3. Offline Use: As mentioned previously, a telephone book is an offline source that does not require an internet connection or electronic devices. Thus, it is an ideal option for looking up a business number when there is no electricity. 4. Widespread Availability: Telephone books have been in use for a long time and are commonly distributed to households and made available in public places, such as libraries or phone booths. Consequently, they are more likely to be readily available in the absence of electricity. 5. Comparison with other options: - Power grid: This is not a relevant option since a power grid refers to the network used for delivering electricity from generating plants to consumers. It does not contain business phone numbers. - Equation: An equation is a mathematical statement that shows the relationship between two expressions, and it cannot be used to look up a business number. - Math problem: A math problem is an exercise or question that requires solving by using certain mathematical techniques. It is not a source of contact information for businesses. - Roulette wheel: A roulette wheel is a gambling device used in the game of roulette. It is not used for storing or providing business contact information. Considering these points, it is evident that the most appropriate choice for finding a business phone number without electricity is a telephone book, given its purpose, offline nature, widespread availability, and relevance compared to the other options provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \\"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\\" Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, \\"It's not an acid song.\\" Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \\"Hey Jules\\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \\"Hey Jude\\". Lennon later said, \\"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\\"Lennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, Julian did not see his father again until 1973. With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. Julian recalls that he and his father \\"got on a great deal better\\" during the time he spent in New York: \\"We had a lot of fun, laughed... Answer:","completion":"The name of the dad who said, \\"What's this?\\" to which Julian replied, \\"it's Lucy in the sky with diamonds\\" is John Lennon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She tracks the box and a young woman named Terri (Paula Marshall) to The Boiler Room, from which Terri had stolen the puzzle box.Through video tape interviews with Kirsty Cotton recovered from the Channard Institute, Joey and Terri learn about the demonic Cenobites and the power of the Lament Configuration, the only means of sending Pinhead back to Hell. Pinhead remains dormant until one night several hooked chains shoot out of the pillar and rip into one of the club goers, Brittany Virtue (Sharon Percival), Monroe had recently slept with.

Options: - grow shorter - learn from each other - take trips - talk to coworkers - become hysterical Explain why a human would choose \\"take trips\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"take trips.\\" There are several reasons why humans would choose to take trips during their time off from work. Traveling or taking trips is a popular choice for people to use their leisure time and offers numerous benefits, both psychologically and physically. Here are some of the key reasons why humans choose taking trips as a preferable option: 1. Mental Well-being: Time off from work presents an opportunity to break away from the routine stresses of daily life. Taking trips allows individuals to recharge their mental batteries, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Exploring new places and experiences can rejuvenate the mind, thus improving overall mental well-being. 2. Creating Memories: Traveling creates opportunities to make new memories and share experiences with loved ones or friends. Whether it's a family vacation, a romantic getaway, or an adventure-packed trip with friends, the shared experiences of trips can strengthen bonds and create memories that last a lifetime. 3. Personal Growth: During trips, people often challenge their comfort zones and engage in new experiences. This can lead to personal growth, enabling individuals to learn new skills, adapt to unfamiliar situations, and gain a deeper understanding of themselves. Additionally, traveling exposes people to different cultures, which can foster empathy, tolerance, and open-mindedness. 4. Physical Health: Time off from work is also an opportunity to focus on physical health. Traveling often involves physical activity such as walking, hiking, or swimming. These activities are not only enjoyable but can also improve cardiovascular health and sleep patterns. 5. Expanding Perspectives: Taking trips gives people an opportunity to open their minds to new ideas, cultures, and ways of life. It is an effective way to broaden one's horizons by witnessing firsthand how others live and work within their own environments. This can create a more comprehensive worldview, spark creativity, and encourage innovation. 6. Education and Learning: Travel provides a unique form of experiential learning that goes beyond textbooks and classrooms. By visiting historical sites, museums, and landmarks, individuals can gain exposure to other cultures and deepen their understanding of history, art, and global issues. 7. Networking Opportunities: Traveling may also provide people with opportunities to network with individuals from different backgrounds and industries. These connections could lead to new business partnerships, collaborations, or simply broaden one's social circle. 8. Adventure and Excitement: We cannot ignore the thrill and excitement associated with taking trips. Curiosity and a sense of adventure are inherent human desires, and many are drawn to the opportunity to explore and seek out the unknown. In conclusion, taking trips has proven to be a popular choice among individuals during their time off from work due to its multitude of benefits. It promotes mental well-being, creates lasting memories, fosters personal growth, maintains physical health, expands perspectives, educates, provides networking opportunities, and satisfies the innate human desire for adventure. For these reasons, \\"take trips\\" is an adequate answer to the question of what people do during their time off from work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Playboy empire could fetch more than 500m (£354m), say sources quoted by news oulets including the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times. The reported move comes after Playboy magazine stopped publishing nude photos saying they had become outdated. Circulation numbers have plummeted to about 800,000 last year from 5.6m copies in 1975. Investment bank Moelis & Co has reportedly been hired to handle the sale process. Mr Hefner founded Playboy in 1953 with actress Marilyn Monroe as its debut centrefold \\"Playmate of the Month.\\" It quickly became an iconic brand and its logo of a bunny wearing a bow tie has been used for a variety of businesses, including clubs and restaurants. The company's financial details are not easily available after Mr Hefner and investment firm Rizvi Traverse Management took the company private in 2011. But under that deal, Playboy was valued at around 207m. According to the reports, Playboy was approached about the sale of the entire company after Mr Hefner's home was put up for sale in January. The Playboy Mansion - famous for its decadent parties - has a 200m asking price and includes a lifelong lease for the velvet jacket-wearing Mr Hefner. If sold at that price, the Los Angeles property will become one of the most expensive private residences in the US. The flagship magazine is struggling to attract subscribers and advertisers after dropping its famous nude spreads. Playboy chief executive Scott Flanders has said the shift in the company's strategy is due to its inability to compete with the availability of free internet pornography.

Given the question: Article: One of the most striking findings of a recent questionnaire in the UK is that of the people interviewed, one in two believes that it is becoming more difficult to meet someone to start a family with. Why are many people finding it increasingly difficult to start and keep close relationships? Does modern life really make it harder to fall in love? Or are we making it harder for ourselves? It is certainly the case today that nowadays couples benefit in different ways from relationships. Women no longer rely upon partners for economic security or status. A man doesn't expect his wife to be in sole charge of running his household and raising his children. But perhaps the knowledge that we can live perfectly well without a partnership means that it takes much more to persuade people to abandon their independence. In theory, finding a partner should be much simpler these days. Only a few generations ago,your choice of soul mate was limited by geography, social convention and family tradition. Although it was never clear, many marriages were essentially arranged. Now those barriers have been broken down. You can approach a builder or a brain surgeon in any bar in any city on any given evening. When the world is your oyster , you surely have a better chance of finding a pearl. But it seems that the traditions have been replaced by an even tighter restriction:the limitation of choice. The expectations of partners are made greater to an unmanageable degree:good looks, impressive salary, kind to grandmother, and so on. There is no room for error in the first impression. We think that a relationship can be perfect. If it isn't,it is intended to be thrown away. We work to protect ourselves against future heartache and don't put in the hard emotional labor needed to build a strong relationship. Twelve-hour work at the office makes relaxed after-hours dating difficult. The cost of housing and child-raising creates pressure to have a stable income and career before a life partnership.

The Allied invasion of Sicily began on 10 July 1943, with Lieutenant General George S. Patton leading 90,000 men of the Seventh United States Army in a landing near Gela, Scoglitti, and Licata to support Bernard Montgomery's British 8th Army landings to the north. Initially ordered to protect the British forces' flank, Patton took Palermo after Montgomery's forces were slowed by heavy resistance from troops of Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy. Patton then set his sights on Messina. He sought an amphibious assault, but it was delayed by lack of landing craft and his troops did not land in Santo Stefano until 8 August, by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of their troops to mainland Italy. Throughout the campaign, Patton's troops were heavily engaged by German and Italian forces as they pushed across the island.Patton had already developed a reputation in the U.S. Army as an effective, successful, and hard-driving commander, punishing subordinates for the slightest infractions but also rewarding them when they performed well. As a way to promote an image that inspired his troops, Patton created a larger-than-life personality. He became known for his flashy dress, highly polished helmet and boots, and no-nonsense demeanor.

Is \\"After the American Civil War ended in 1865, British and French traders abandoned Egyptian cotton and returned to cheap American exports,[citation needed] sending Egypt into a deficit spiral that led to the country declaring bankruptcy in 1876, a key factor behind Egypt's occupation by the British Empire in 1882.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What action of the Union damaged the southern cotton exports?\\"","completion":"No, the provided answer does not directly address the question about the actions of the Union that damaged the southern cotton exports during the American Civil War. However, it does provide valuable context on the shifts in global trade dynamics after the Civil War that impacted the Egyptian cotton market and its relationship with the British and French markets. To answer the question more directly, it is important to consider the actions of the United States' Union during the American Civil War that damaged the southern cotton exports. These include: 1. Blockades: One significant action was the Union Navy's establishment of a naval blockade known as the \\"Anaconda Plan\\". This blockade aimed to restrict the Confederate States' access to the international cotton markets. Southern cotton producers relied heavily on exporting their cotton to foreign markets to sustain their economy. The blockade extended along the entire Southern coastline, severely disrupting cotton trade, and made it difficult for Southern producers to export their cotton, directly hurting the Confederate economy. 2. Destruction of Infrastructure: The Union forces engaged in a strategy of total war known as \\"scorched earth,\\" which included destructive campaigns designed to cripple the South's ability to wage war and maintain its economy. Military campaigns led by Union generals, such as William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea, contributed to the destruction of railroads, telegraph lines, and manufacturing centers that supported the production and transportation of cotton. This further damaged the southern cotton exports by limiting their ability to produce and transport cotton within the country and to their dwindling ports. 3. Occupation and Emancipation: Union forces gradually occupied key areas of the southern states, disrupting plantation operations and cotton production. The Emancipation Proclamation, signed in 1863, declared that all slaves in Confederate territory were to be set free, leading many slaves to flee the plantations or cease work, further reducing the southern labor force involved in cotton production. 4. International Diplomacy: The Union worked diligently to maintain diplomatic relations with Britain and France, discouraging them from officially recognizing the Confederacy or providing financial or direct military support. This was crucial in ensuring that the Confederacy struggled to maintain competitive access to the critical British and French markets for cotton, the prime export of the Southern states. As a result of these Union strategies and actions, the Southern cotton exports faced significant damage. In conclusion, while the original provided answer gives an account of international market changes post-Civil War, it does not directly address the question that specifically asks about actions taken by the Union during the American Civil War that damaged the southern cotton exports. Instead, the actions outlined above—blockades, infrastructure destruction, occupation and emancipation, and international diplomacy—give the detailed and long answer necessary to address the question at hand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A man sweeps the road in front of a wall with graffiti and two flats set against it.\\", does this mean that \\"A guy uses a broom to sweep infront of a wall.\\"?","completion":"To determine if \\"A man sweeps the road in front of a wall with graffiti and two flats set against it\\" means \\"A guy uses a broom to sweep in front of a wall\\", let's break down each sentence and compare their meanings step by step. 1. Identify the subject in both sentences: - In the first sentence, the subject is \\"A man.\\" - In the second sentence, the subject is \\"A guy.\\" Both refer to a male person, so these are equivalent. 2. Examine the action being performed by the subject: - In the first sentence, the action is \\"sweeps the road.\\" - In the second sentence, the action is \\"uses a broom to sweep.\\" Both actions involve sweeping, but the tool used is mentioned in the second sentence. It's reasonable to assume that sweeping is done using a broom, so these actions can be considered equivalent. 3. Compare the context in each sentence: - In the first sentence, the context is \\"in front of a wall with graffiti and two flats set against it.\\" - In the second sentence, the context is \\"in front of a wall.\\" There is a slight difference in context between the two sentences. The first sentence provides more detail about the wall, namely that there is graffiti on it and two flats are against it. The second sentence only mentions the wall, without added details. Based on the comparison of subject, action, and context, it can be concluded that the two sentences share a similar meaning with a difference in descriptive detail. In essence, \\"A man sweeps the road in front of a wall with graffiti and two flats set against it\\" conveys additional information about the wall compared to \\"A guy uses a broom to sweep in front of a wall.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Q: A decline in blood flow to what organs stimulates release of the enzyme renin, in turn stimulating the reabsorption of sodium and water? Choices: - thyroids - kidneys - lungs - kidneys A: The answer is:","completion":"- Kidneys The kidneys play a pivotal role in the regulation of the body's fluid and electrolyte balance. Renin is an enzyme produced and released primarily by specialized cells in the kidney. The release of renin is stimulated when there's a decrease in blood flow to the kidneys. This could be due to a number of reasons like a decrease in blood volume, a drop in blood pressure, or any condition that threatens the adequate blood, and hence oxygen, supply to the kidneys. The release of renin sets off a series of reactions in the bloodstream. It acts on a protein called angiotensinogen, which is released by the liver and converted into a molecule called angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II by an enzyme, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), predominantly located in the lungs. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, meaning it can constrict the blood vessels which results in the increase of blood pressure. It also stimulates the release of another hormone called aldosterone from the adrenal glands. Aldosterone acts on the cells of the kidneys and prompts them to reabsorb more sodium and water. This increase in sodium and water reabsorption also contributes to the increase in blood volume and hence blood pressure. So, the stimulus of renin release, consequent activation of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) and the reabsorption of sodium and water are all responses to protect the body from a situation that could potentially starve the body tissues of oxygen. On the other hand, the thyroids (glands that produce hormones to regulate the rate of many activities in your body including metabolism) and the lungs (organs for respiration) aren't directly involved in the release of renin or the process of sodium and water reabsorption. Therefore, they aren't the correct answer in this context. The kidneys play an important role in the overall homeostatic regulation including blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and fluid balance, making them the point of origin for renin on an event of decreased blood flow."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Anger over health-care reform spurs rise in threats against Congress members Anger over the health-care overhaul has led to a nearly threefold increase in recent months in the number of serious threats against members of Congress, federal law enforcement officials said. The lawmakers reported 42 threats in the first three months of this year, compared with 15 in the last three months of 2009, said Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance W. Gainer, who had information about threats involving both chambers. \\"The incidents ranged from very vulgar to serious threats, including death threats,\\" Gainer said. \\"The ability to carry them out is another question and part of an investigation to determine what, if any, appropriate steps to take.\\" Nearly all of the recent threats appear to come from opponents of the health-care overhaul, said Gainer, who also served four years as chief of the U.S. Capitol Police. And, he said, there have been \\"significantly more\\" threats against House members than against senators. The threats, which have led to at least three arrests, have not abated since President Obama signed the measure into law March 23. The Capitol Police have contacted the FBI about such threats even more often since the law was signed, said Lindsay Godwin, an FBI spokeswoman. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) became the best-known of the recently targeted lawmakers Wednesday, when authorities accused a man in San Francisco of making dozens of threatening calls to her home and her husband's office. In response to the threats, Capitol officials have been working to ensure that the 454 Senate offices across the country are secure. Some of the offices, a quarter of which are in federal buildings, are receiving additional equipment to help with the screening of mail. In other instances, law enforcement officials are recommending new locks and surveillance cameras. A few members have reacted to the threats by lowering their public profiles. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) canceled an event at a Youngstown community health center because he received a threatening letter, his spokeswoman told a local television station. But most lawmakers haven't altered their routines, devoting their two-week spring recess to the typical district meetings, town halls and campaign events. A day before Gregory L. Giusti was charged with threatening Pelosi, Charles A. Wilson was arrested near Yakima, Wash., and charged with \\"leaving expletive laden threatening messages\\" on multiple occasions at the office of Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), including a recorded message that said, \\"I want to kill you.\\" On March 29, a Philadelphia man was charged with threatening in a YouTube video to kill Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and his family. Prosecutors say the suspect, Norman Leboon, has multiple personalities and is not competent to stand trial. Some lawmakers say the real change in recent weeks has been that members aren't keeping such incidents private anymore. \\"Normally, we don't give publicity to this,\\" said Rep. Dan Lungren (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the House committee that oversees the Capitol Police. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about how some people got very angry about changes in health-care rules and started making threats to members of Congress.

Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity. Question: \\"Give an important date in Japanese history that marks the \\"closing of Japan\\" to the outside world and give three examples of this isolation policy.\\" Answer: \\"1635\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Select from: A). no. B). yes.","completion":"B). yes. The answer \\"1635\\" is correct as an important date in Japanese history that marks the \\"closing of Japan\\" to the outside world. It was during this year that Japan imposed strict isolation policies under the Tokugawa Shogunate. Some examples of these isolation policies include: 1. Sakoku Edict of 1635: The Sakoku Edict, enacted by the Tokugawa Shogunate, prohibited Japanese citizens from leaving the country and made it illegal for them to return if they were already overseas. This policy aimed to suppress the spread of Christianity and limit the influence of foreign powers in Japan. 2. Expulsion of Catholic missionaries and Japanese converts: Ieyasu Tokugawa banned the activities of Catholic missionaries in 1612 and ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts in 1614. This led to widespread persecution of Christians, with thousands being executed or forced to renounce their faith under penalty of death. 3. Restriction of foreign trade: The Tokugawa Shogunate aimed to limit the influence of foreign powers and control trade with the outside world. A closed-door policy was adopted, allowing only limited trade with certain countries such as China, the Dutch East India Company, and Korea. This restricted trade was conducted exclusively through designated ports, excluding any possible interference from other foreign powers. These policies effectively sealed Japan off from the rest of the world and marked a period of isolation that lasted until the mid-19th century when Japan opened its doors once again under pressure from the United States and other Western powers."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world.

One of his last ideas was to draft plans for an elected parliament, or Duma, which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. In a matter of 48 hours, Alexander II planned to release his plan for the duma to the Russian people. Had he lived, Russia might have followed a path to constitutional monarchy instead of the long road of oppression that defined his successor's reign. The first action Alexander III took after his father's death was to tear up those plans. A Duma would not come into fruition until 1905, when Alexander II's grandson, Nicholas II, commissioned the Duma following extreme pressure on the monarchy as a result of the Russian Revolution of 1905. The assassination triggered major suppression of civil liberties in Russia, and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose death was witnessed first-hand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future emperors who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation, the May Laws, were yet another result. Finally, the tsar's assassination also inspired anarchists to advocate \\"'propaganda by deed'--the use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution.\\" With construction starting in 1883, the Church of the Savior on Blood was built on the site of Alexander's assassination and dedicated in his memory. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What event prevented Alexander II's plans for a Duma to come to fruition?\\" is \\"His son opposition\\"?","completion":"Yes, that is correct. Alexander II's plans for a Duma did not come to fruition due to his death and his son, Alexander III's opposition to the idea. Alexander III tore up the plans for the Duma, and a Duma would not be established until 1905 under the reign of Nicholas II, Alexander II's grandson. Alexander III's actions led to a setback for the reform movement in Russia, and it wasn't until the pressures of the 1905 Revolution that the idea of a Duma was resurrected."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Running is a physical activity that usually requires a certain level of comfort and freedom of movement, so one might deduce that the man's clothing is suitable for the activity, typically associated with workout gear. Workout gear refers to clothing or accessories that are worn specifically for participating in physical exercises or any fitness-related activities. Many people choose to wear light, breathable fabrics for running or other physical activities. A long-sleeved shirt can serve as acceptable workout gear, especially in cooler weather. Also, long sleeves can be worn for sun protection or to provide additional support during physical activity. However, it should also be noted that we do not have any information about the other attire the man is wearing. For example, we do not know what type of pants, shoes, or any other accessory the man is wearing, nor do we know the specific material or design of the green long-sleeved shirt. Consequently, absolute certainty regarding the man's complete outfit is difficult to attain. In conclusion, although we lack additional information about the man's apparel, the fact that he is running while wearing a green long-sleeved shirt indicates that the statement \\"A man is in workout gear.\\" is likely true. Given that running is a physical activity and the man is wearing a green long-sleeved shirt, one could reasonably infer that his clothing is appropriate for the activity, which might include workout gear. However, without more details about his entire outfit, we cannot definitively confirm whether or not the man is wearing workout gear."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: Which dynasty, which was replaced by another dynasty that included Henry IV, struggled to control the powerful dukes? Context: During the early High Middle Ages, Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period. In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century. Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241, 1259, and 1287.

Ron says that he and his family found the island when he was little, and there is no one else there. They immediately start partying. During the party, a drunken Luis decides to go skinny dipping. Ron tells the others the story of Dinoshark, a shark who was implanted with dinosaur DNA in an experiment, but broke free, killed the scientists experimenting on him and entered the ocean. Kirby laughs and dismisses the story as a myth, along with the others. However, Luis is eaten alive by Dinoshark. Ron hits on Ali, but she turns him down, which makes him visibly angry. Dani dumps Pete for not supporting her in her stripper job, despite his pleas for her to forgive him. Dani then leaves the party to have sex with David after he gives her wine. She strips naked and convinces him to try a complicated sex position. However, when the position almost results in David getting injured, he storms off. After he leaves, Dinoshark leaps out of the water and grabs Dani's ankle. She tries holding onto a string of seaweed, but it ends up asphyxiating her and Dinoshark drags her corpse into the bay and eats most of it. David and Pete climb a cliff while Kirby and Mag argue, and Mag insults Kirby for being a virgin. Ron and Ali break up the fight. Meanwhile, David decides to pee off the cliff, but loses his balance and nearly falls off. Pete manages to grab him, however. David then spots Dani's remains floating in the water, but he doesn't know what they are. David and Pete try and climb down the hill to get a closer look, but David trips and falls off. He lands in Dinoshark's mouth and is eaten whole. A horrified Pete scrambles up the mountain, but is knocked unconscious. Mag walks off to sunbathe. She takes off her bikini top, exposing her breasts, and is noticed by Dinoshark. Ron suddenly attacks Mag and rips off the bottom of her bikini.

Home from the Civil War, where he fought for the Union army, John Willoughby now lives in the western town of Kittreck Wells with wife Nora and their 7-year-old son, Petey. An appeal for help from Marshal Russell comes when a band of former Confederate soldiers are seen pulling a robbery in a neighboring town. John, who hates all rebels, agrees to go, against his wife's wishes that all his fighting must end. Meanwhile, the Rebels, Bedloe Mason and his sons Gray, Wesley, Cain and Frank, decide to ride into Kittreck Wells to replenish their dwindling water supply. Bedloe sends Gray, Frank and Wesley into town while he and Cain await their return. Petey Willoughby, who shares his father's dislike of rebels, aims and fires a cap pistol at them. Startled by the sound, Wesley Mason shoots and kills the boy. As the brothers mount their horses and gallop out of town, Gray, not having been witnessing the shooting, hesitates, then catches up to the others. When they reach Bedloe and Cain, Gray, angered by his brother's recklessness, appeals to his father and brothers that Wesley has to go back to face the consequences. Wesley is dead-set against this and the others take his side. Gray rides off alone to learn the fate of the boy, but Wesley ambushes his brother by throwing a knife into his back. After strapping his brother's unconscious body onto his horse, Wesley sets the animal loose. He then returns to camp and reports that Gray refused to listen to reason, but will meet the family at Oak Fork in three days.

Article:","completion":"Title: Chris Nash's Quickfire Century Powers Sussex Over Essex on Day One of Championship Game at Hove In a riveting display of batting prowess, Chris Nash's quickfire century was instrumental in giving Sussex the crucial edge over Essex on the first day of their Championship game held at Hove. Showing immense skill under pressure, Nash dominated the field with his aggressive yet calculated shots, setting the tone for the battle between Sussex and Essex in a highly anticipated game filled with tension and expectations. As the day's play began, all eyes were set on both the teams, with experts analyzing every bit of their performances, looking for hints of a possible winner. Right from the outset, Nash stood out as the backbone of Sussex, demonstrating his undeniable talent and providing his teammates with the much-needed inspiration to keep pushing on against a formidable Essex team. Time and again, Nash proved that he wasn't just about scoring runs but also understood the significance of rotating the strike, bringing in a perfect balance of aggressive shot-making and strategic play. His sharp technique, along with a keen eye on the ball, made him a formidable force on the pitch, keeping the Essex bowlers on their toes throughout his innings. The highlight of the day was undoubtedly Chris Nash's century, which came at a breathtaking speed. Displaying immense focus, he raced towards the hundred-run mark, leaving the audience in awe of his prowess. Nash's consistent shots, coupled with his ability to change gears from defense to attack and back again, made his innings a sight to behold for both cricket enthusiasts and players alike. Sussex's game plan seemed to work as Nash's spirited performance stymied Essex's momentum, allowing Sussex to gain an advantage in the ongoing competition. Nash's teammates rallied around him, providing much-needed support as they held steady at crucial junctures in the game and delivered valuable contributions of their own. As the day ended, Sussex found themselves in a commanding position, primarily thanks to Nash's quickfire century. Sussex fans were all praises for their star batsman, singing odes to his technique and temperament in what turned out to be a display of sheer brilliance. The Essex team, on the other hand, was forced to reassess their strategy as they prepare for the upcoming days of the match, knowing full well that they are up against a determined Sussex side that is unwilling to go down without a fight. Looking ahead, one can expect an intriguing contest in the Championship Game, with both Sussex and Essex fighting tooth and nail to edge past each other. Chris Nash's quickfire century on day one has set the bar high, but it remains to be seen if this display of batting prowess will be enough to carry Sussex to victory and give them the championship title. In conclusion, the first day of the Championship game between Sussex and Essex at Hove proved to be a spectacle for cricket lovers, thanks in large part to Chris Nash's scintillating century. While not entirely decisive, his performance undoubtedly tipped the scales in Sussex's favor, setting the stage for an engrossing and closely contested match on the days to come. It is now up to the rest of the Sussex squad and their Essex counterparts to rise to that challenge and deliver a championship game that will be long remembered by cricket fans everywhere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Dubliners were an Irish folk band founded in Dublin in 1962. The band started off as The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group, named in honour of its founding member; they subsequently renamed themselves as The Dubliners. The group line-up saw many changes over their fifty-year career. However, the group's success was centered on lead singers Luke Kelly and Ronnie Drew. Drew spent some time in Spain in his younger years where he learned to play Flamenco guitar, and he accompanied his songs on a Spanish guitar. Drew left the band in 1974 to spend more time with his family, and was replaced by Jim McCann. He returned to The Dubliners five years later, but left the group again in 1995. Ronnie Drew died at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Dublin on 16 August 2008 after a long illness. Paddy Reilly took Drew's place in 1995. Some of Drew's most significant contributions to the band are the hit single \\"Seven Drunken Nights\\", his rendition of \\"Finnegan's Wake\\", and \\"McAlpine's Fusiliers\\". Luke Kelly was more of a balladeer than Drew, and he played chords on the five-string banjo. Kelly sang many defining versions of traditional songs like \\"The Black Velvet Band\\", \\"Whiskey in the Jar\\", \\"Home Boys Home\\"; but also Phil Coulter's \\"The Town I Loved So Well\\", Ewan MacColl's \\"Dirty Old Town\\", \\"The Wild Rover\\", and \\"Raglan Road\\", written by the famous Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh. In 1980, Luke Kelly was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Occasionally Kelly was too ill to sing though he was sometimes able to join the band for a few songs. While on tour in Germany he collapsed on stage. When Kelly was too ill to play, he was replaced by Sean Cannon. He continued to tour with the band until two months before his death. Kelly died on 30 January 1984. One of the last concerts in which he took part was recorded and released: Live in Carre, recorded in Amsterdam, Netherlands, released in 1983. In November 2004, the Dublin city council voted unanimously to erect a bronze statue of Luke Kelly. Kelly is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin. Ciaran Bourke was a singer, but he also played the guitar, tin whistle and harmonica. He sang many songs in Irish (\\"Peggy Lettermore\\", \\"Preab san Ol\\"). In 1974 he collapsed on stage after suffering a brain haemorrhage. A second haemorrhage left him paralysed on his left side. Bourke died in 1988. The band did not officially replace him until his death. John Sheahan and Bobby Lynch joined the band in 1964. They had been playing during the interval at concerts, and usually stayed on for the second half of the show. When Luke Kelly moved to England in 1964, Lynch was taken on as his temporary replacement. When Kelly returned in 1965, Lynch left the band and Sheahan stayed. According to Sheahan, he was never (and still has not been) ever officially asked to join the band. Sheahan is the only member to have had a musical education. Lynch committed suicide in Dublin in 1982.

In an American suburb in Northern New Jersey, conservative, middle-aged Indian immigrant Gopal, a telephone-company engineer who has taken early retirement, is celebrating Diwali in November with his wife and grown daughter. His daughter suddenly tells him that she is leaving indefinitely to teach English in Mongolia with her German boyfriend. As Gopal recovers from this shock and tries to talk her out of it, largely on the grounds that she will be living in sin in his eyes, his wife Madhu announces that she is leaving him as well, and is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India. Confused, mortified, bored, and directionless, newly single Gopal lies to his few Indian-American acquaintances about the situation, and refuses to answer his daughter's phone calls from Mongolia. He tries to cope with his emptiness by redecorating slightly, searching through the various corners of his small house, reading newspapers, and watching videos of Bollywood romance extravaganza films. Desperately lonely, he latches upon a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine that had belonged to his daughter, and takes a quiz gauging a man's suitability for a relationship – which reveals that he is a \\"Ditchable Dude\\". In the midst of his distress and his Bollywood fantasies, Gopal's eccentric neighbor, the oddly attractive divorcée Mrs. Shaw – whom he had previously thought of as loose-moralled (because of her one-night stands) and slovenly – appears at his door asking to borrow one of his rakes. This sets off a whole new set of fantasies on his part. A few nights later Gopal sees her on her porch nursing a drink, and after a tentative conversation, asks her to have Thanksgiving dinner with him at home the next day. While cleaning and straightening for the date, Gopal finds several more of his daughter's Cosmopolitans, and reads several articles on \\"What women want\\" from a man – evidently it is for them to \\"listen, listen, listen\\".

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that said \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\"? , can you please find it? During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\".","completion":"The person who said, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since.

However, you need to allow time for dust to settle on your old relationship before you begin planning how to get your ex back.

When you've put a lot of time and energy into a relationship, it can be hard to see your ex happily moving on with another girl. No one wants to take back an angry, bitter ex, so you need to direct your anger into something positive.

Once again, I've analysed my year of travel to see if I'm any closer to reducing it year on year. It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!). Question: What is true about online coaches Options: - They want to stay home - not enough information - They like to save time - they want less travel === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"The true statement about online coaches is that they want less travel. However, it is important to note that there are additional benefits to online coaching beyond reduced travel. For both coaches and clients, online coaching can save time, increase accessibility, and promote a more environmentally-friendly approach to professional development. Firstly, by reducing the need for travel, online coaches can save time that would otherwise be spent on transportation and logistics. This allows them to dedicate more time to their clients and refine their coaching practices. Additionally, the reduced time commitment can make coaching more appealing to professionals with busy schedules, allowing them to devote their limited time to sessions that are targeted, focused, and tailored to their specific needs. Secondly, online coaching increases accessibility for clients and coaches alike. Clients from diverse geographical locations can now access high-quality coaching from anywhere in the world, provided they have a stable internet connection. This brings together a broader range of perspectives and experiences, enriching the coaching process for all involved. Environmentally, online coaching promotes a greener approach to professional development because it substantially reduces the carbon footprint associated with travel. While some may argue that this is a secondary benefit, it is becoming increasingly important for organizations and individuals to adopt sustainable practices in all aspects of their work and lives. Moreover, online coaching can result in better quality work outcomes, as coaches and clients can engage in more frequent, shorter sessions tailored to their specific needs. This contrasts with traditional day-long workshops that may be less targeted and may not yield the same depth of insights and progress. It is important to recognize that the challenges of online coaching, such as the need for clients to take regular time out for sessions and establish new habits, should not overshadow its many benefits. As more leaders and educators embrace online coaching as an effective professional development tool, the positive impact on their careers and the learning communities they serve will become increasingly apparent. In summary, the primary focus of online coaching is to reduce travel for coaches while providing efficient, accessible, and environmentally responsible professional development opportunities for clients. However, this approach also offers numerous other advantages, such as time savings, increased accessibility, and improved work outcomes, which can only serve to enhance the overall coaching experience for both coaches and clients."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Medical researchers Frank and his fiancée, Zoe, have developed a serum, code-named \\"Lazarus\\". It was intended to assist coma patients but is shown to actually be able to bring the dead back to life. With the assistance of their friends, Niko, Clay, and videographer Eva, they run a successful trial on a recently deceased dog. However, they notice that the dog is behaving differently than it did when it was alive: its cataracts disappear, it loses its appetite, and it demonstrates other strange abilities. Tests reveal that the serum, instead of dissipating, is constructing strange new synapses within the dog's brain. When the dean of their university learns of their underground experiments, their project is shut down. They are also informed that a major pharmaceutical corporation has bought out the company that funded their research. The company and their attorneys confiscate everything associated with the project. Frank and his team sneak back into their lab to duplicate the experiment so that they can prove that they created the serum. During this attempt, things go horribly wrong and Zoe is fatally electrocuted. Unwilling to let her go, Frank uses the serum to resurrect her. Initially, the procedure appears to be a success, but the team soon realizes that something is wrong with Zoe.

Help as much as you can. What are the names of the state that was formed when its last merger was completed on May 15 1948? Answer the above question based on the context below: The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad.

Translate to English English:","completion":"Organizer, \\"There is no other event like this in the USA.\\" The statement provided in the original language, Turkish, describes the uniqueness of a particular event in the United States. The speaker, who is an organizer, claims that there is no comparable event to the one they are discussing within the country. This suggests that the said event holds some distinct features, which separate it from any other events taking place in the United States. In order to understand the significance of this statement, it is essential to explore the possible reasons why the organizer finds this event unparalleled in the USA. One reason could be the event's scale, which refers to the size or magnitude of the event. It could be a significant gathering, exhibition, or show that is unmatched in terms of the number of attendees, participants, or scope. On the other hand, it could be a smaller, intimate event that offers a level of exclusivity or innovation that is not commonly found in the United States. Another reason could be the theme or content of the event. It may address a specific issue, discipline, or industry that has not been widely explored or celebrated in other gatherings or celebrations within the country. In this context, the event may introduce novel concepts, showcase pioneering work, or facilitate important discussions that are otherwise not accessible in similar situations. The format of the event may also set it apart from other events in the USA. This refers to the way the event is organized and executed, including its duration, venue, logistics, and overall structure. An unconventional format may create a unique experience for the attendees, contributing to its inimitability and appeal. For instance, the event may incorporate new forms of technology, incorporate interactive elements, or use immersive or experiential design to captivate and engage its audience. The impact or legacy of the event could also be a defining factor. If the event has the potential to leave a lasting impression on its attendees, participants, or industry, it may change the way people perceive or approach a particular topic or issue. This transformative effect could contribute to the significance and distinctiveness of the event within the American context. Ultimately, the statement \\"There is no other event like this in the USA\\" positions the event in question as an exceptional occurrence that breaks the mold of conventional gatherings or celebrations. It implies that the event is distinguished by one or more factors, such as its scale, theme, format, or impact, and thus offers a unique experience that cannot be replicated elsewhere in the country. With this English translation, a broader audience can appreciate the unparalleled nature of the event, its potential implications, and the dedication and innovation of its organizers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Love Guru pegs the silly meter in the opening scene when Myers, as Guru Pitka, breaks out in a Bollywood-style 9 to 5 hoedown while picking at a sitar. 2. The Love Guru is insulting to anyone with a healthy sense of humor and the simple desire to laugh. 3. It's not very good but it won't want to make you tear your eyes out either. 4. With this sort of junk, Myers obviously is all out of love, and one day he'll be so lost without us. 5. The endless winks at the camera look more desperate, the jokes at Troyer's expense seem more tasteless. 6. Nobody, apparently, told Myers he was doing a one-note character with a funny voice that wouldn't make a good 'Saturday Night Live' sketch, let alone an 88-minute movie. 7. While for some The Love Guru may feel as though its gags were forced and unworthy as a script of pure hilarity, those same opponents will find themselves either secretly snickering or outright chortling in a seat-bouncing fashion. 8.

Based on these individual reviews, what is the critic consensus?","completion":"The critic consensus based on these individual reviews is that \\"The Love Guru\\" is largely disappointing and fails to deliver smart and genuinely funny comedy. The majority of the reviews point out that Mike Myers' portrayal of Guru Pitka is a one-note character with a funny voice, which doesn't hold up well throughout the 88-minute movie. Critics also mention that the humor is often crass and tasteless, focusing on low-brow gags such as bodily functions and cheap laughs at the expense of the supporting characters. Many of the reviews highlight that \\"The Love Guru\\" is insulting to anyone with a healthy sense of humor and suggest that the film doesn't have much value for those seeking intelligent or fresh comedy. Some critics even go as far as saying that the movie is a desperate attempt by Myers to create a new comedy franchise or mimic the success of Dr. Phil. Despite the overwhelmingly negative consensus, a few reviews do acknowledge that some viewers may find themselves secretly snickering or outright chortling at certain moments in the film. However, this only serves to further underline the general disappointment surrounding \\"The Love Guru\\" and its inability to deliver consistent and high-quality comedy. Overall, the critic consensus for \\"The Love Guru\\" is predominantly unfavorable, criticizing the movie for its lack of smart humor and over-reliance on tasteless jokes and one-note characters.
