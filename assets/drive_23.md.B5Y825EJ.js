I think bridal shopping is a hot & cold kind of thing & I came away from this appointment pretty chilly.","completion":"The review is mixed, but leans more towards a negative experience. The reviewer has listed pros and cons about the bridal shop in question. The pros include a large selection of dresses, beautiful accessories, and being accommodating when making appointments. However, the cons seem to outweigh the pros. The reviewer points out some issues with the sales associates, such as crowding around the front desk, unprofessional behavior (gum chewing and relaxed style of dressing), not being knowledgeable enough about the details and design of the dresses and designers, and displaying a lack of interest in the bride they are selling to. Additionally, the reviewer feels that they didn't receive the undivided attention they were hoping for from their sales associate, which led to them not feeling like a bride. They acknowledge that the shop was quite busy at the time of their visit, but this didn't excuse the lack of engagement from the staff. Overall, the reviewer describes their experience as \\"hot & cold\\" and came away from the appointment feeling \\"chilly.\\" This sentiment indicates that the negative aspects of the experience left a stronger impression than the positive factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Emily is less likely to go on a cruise. Step-by-step justification: 1. The sentence states that Kayla gets seasick less often than Emily. 2. Getting seasick is a negative experience for someone who is on a cruise. 3. If Kayla experiences seasickness less frequently than Emily, it would mean Emily would have a higher likelihood of suffering from seasickness while on a cruise. 4.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Protesters in parts of Egypt rallied Friday against the government and a vote on a constitution that would ban religious parties, leading to clashes with security forces or demonstrators' opponents in at least three cities, Egyptian media reported. The demonstrations are the latest by members or supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that has regularly protested Egypt's interim government since Brotherhood-backed President Mohamed Morsy was ousted in a coup in July. Muslim Brotherhood supporters clashed with opponents in parts of Cairo after Morsy loyalists tore down posters supporting the proposed constitution, on which Egyptians will vote Tuesday and Wednesday, the semiofficial Ahram Online news outlet reported. In Giza, security forces fired tear gas at Morsy supporters to disperse their march there, Ahram Online reported. The demonstrators began to march after Friday prayers and clashed with police in various parts of the city, Ahram Online said. Clashes also broke out in al-Sabah city in Suez province, where security forces fired tear gas at a pro-Morsy march, according to the state-run Middle East News Agency. The Muslim Brotherhood-led National Alliance to Support Legitimacy had called for protests, MENA said. The alliance has focused its ire on Egypt's January 14-15 referendum on a new constitution, which would not only ban religious parties but also put more power in the hands of the military. The alliance has called for a boycott of the referendum. Muslim Brotherhood supporters have continued their protests, even though the government declared the group a terrorist organization last month. The government has threatened to arrest anyone who attends Muslim Brotherhood protests or provides financial support to the organization. Supporters of the organization demand the reinstatement of Morsy, who became the country's first democratically elected president in 2012, and the full restoration of their political and social rights. The interim government blames the group for coordinated attacks on churches and government facilities, including a recent bombing of a police headquarters that left 16 dead and more than 100 injured. The military ousted Morsy on July 3 after he was accused of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. Morsy's supporters say that the deposed president wasn't given a fair chance and that the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011. Morsy is awaiting trial in several cases, including one in which he and 14 other Muslim Brotherhood members face charges stemming from December 2012 protests over a constitution he shepherded into effect. Egyptian authorities have accused Morsy and his staff of ordering supporters to attack protesters after guards and members of the Interior Ministry refused to do it. Morsy and four others are charged with inciting violence, but they are not accused of using force. Eleven others are charged with killing three men, torturing 54 people, using force and possessing weapons. That trial, delayed Wednesday, is expected to resume on February 1. Morsy, who says he still is Egypt's legitimate president, has refused to recognize the court's authority and has yet to accept legal representation for the proceeding. CNN's Jason Hanna, Sarah Sirgany, Saad Abedine and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"In Egypt, people called protesters were not happy with the government and some decisions being made. They were supporting a group called the Muslim Brotherhood and a leader named Mohamed Morsy who used to be in charge of the country. The government and some other people didn't agree with them, and sometimes they had arguments or fights in different cities. The Muslim Brotherhood's supporters want their leader, Morsy, to be in charge again because they think he was treated unfairly. The government doesn't like the Muslim Brotherhood and thinks they do some bad things, so they said the group is not allowed anymore and that people who support them could get in trouble. Morsy has to go to court because some people say he did some bad things, but he doesn't think it's fair and doesn't want to go."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose earth doesn't have a volcano happens, how will it affect MORE body cooling occurring. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"A: The situation you propose involves two unrelated processes – the cooling of the human body through sweat evaporation and volcanic activity on Earth. In the case of sweat evaporation, the body cools itself by releasing sweat, which then evaporates, taking heat away from the body and cooling the skin. This mechanism remains the same regardless of the presence or absence of volcanic activity on Earth. Now, considering the theoretical scenario where Earth does not experience any volcanic activity, this would not have a direct impact on the body's cooling process through sweat evaporation. There might be some indirect effects on climate and weather, but they would not significantly change the body's primary cooling mechanism.

Nick Kyrgios and Andy Murray: the bromance capable of saving a career It was a three-word tweet which spoke volumes. No sooner had Andy Murray completed his remarkable ascension to the top of men’s tennis, Nick Kyrgios paid homage on social media. “U the man” wrote the Australian before posting a picture of him rubbing Murray’s head. A heartwarming tennis “bromance” for the ages. Though as the 21-year-old licks his wounds following a meltdown in Shanghai last month which earned severe ATP sanctions and sessions with a sports psychologist, watching his buddy reach for the stars can only have a positive effect. There is, after all, much of Murray in Kyrgios. Both are hot-headed, emotional, complex characters. Their respective countries have endured a relative dearth of success which brings its own pressures. The best sportsmen are often enigmas, curious puzzles which are fiendishly difficult to solve. Both fall into that category, yet are also rampaging talents on the tennis court. And, that’s why Murray, a world-class superstar with no airs or graces, has constantly been available to help the young Australian deal with the troubles which pollute his undoubted brilliance with racquet in hand. “Dealing with criticism is hard to take, but Andy has been there and been brilliant with Nick in helping him understand the process,” a source close to Kyrgios told the Guardian. “There’s no manual on how to deal with being famous. He tells him not to get carried away when everything is going to plan and tells him straight when it starts to get ugly. Nick looks up to him more than anyone. There is no one he respects more, and seeing what Andy has achieved is all he needs to take his career forward.” The Scot is always available – text, WhatsApp, call, or email. Novak Djokovic has also opened the airwaves, something for which he has been appreciative, yet Murray is Kyrgios’s go-to man. The pair are planning a training block together in the coming months. Murray, a relentless athlete in the gym, wouldn’t invite just anyone into the sweatbox of his inner sanctum. He recognises that Kyrgios works hard off the court, even if his demeanour invites large swathes of criticism from those who are unable to see the whole picture. Certainly among his peers, the Australian isn’t shunned in the locker room or given the cold shoulder. Of course, he’s not everyone’s cup of tea. His relationship with Stan Wawrinka suffered following their unseemly bust-up last August but has now healed. Yet his tennis talents help him earn respect with others. On tour, a senior group including Murray, Jo Wilfried Tsonga, Gael Monfils, and John Isner will hang out with him in foreign climes. In hotel rooms, gaming-console duels on Fifa are keenly fought. Undoubtedly, the battles in Kyrgios’ mind are harder to combat. Yet, Murray knows the pitfalls in which younger players can find themselves. The 29-year-old has been there. Hitting the ball over the net is the straightforward part. Dealing with strains and stresses of sporting stardom, however, is a harder nut to crack and one with which Kyrgios has struggled. The meltdown in Asia was symptomatic of his inability to cope. With Tokyo tournament sponsor Yonex earmarking one of their clients, Kyrgios, as a marquee player, everyone wanted a piece. The off-court demands were incessant, yet there we no complaints. It’s all part of the game. A superb week, one of the best in his career, which resulted in a winner’s trophy, soon followed but within 48 hours, he was in Shanghai, starting all over again. No gap, no time for breathing space. The denouement was brutal and the repercussions seismic. Something had to give, and even though Sam Querrey was dispatched in straight sets, against Germany’s Mischa Zverez, he cracked. Serving underarm and arguing with fans is never a good idea. It looked awful. The critics once again had bucketloads of ammunition to unload. The firestorm blazed. How could it not? “It was terrible and Nick knows he has to do better than that,” the source said. “It was constant between Tokyo and Shanghai. Playing and doing everything else has taken its toll. “But dealing with everything that comes with being one of the best players in the world is a learning process, and that’s where someone like Andy can come in and help. Nick loves him.” Now is the time for this supremely talented student to follow his world-dominating teacher’s lead. There is no better role model.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To make sure the cookies expand evenly over the muffin tin","completion":"To make sure cookies expand evenly over the muffin tin, follow these detailed steps: 1. Choose the right recipe: For this particular method of baking, choose cookie dough that is soft and has a good amount of butter or fat. This ensures that the dough spreads evenly over the muffin tin while baking. Avoid using very thick or chunky dough recipes. 2. Prepare the muffin tin: Before starting, thoroughly wash and dry the muffin tin. Properly greasing the muffin tin is essential for the cookies to expand evenly and to avoid sticking. You can use either butter, non-stick cooking spray, or line the tin with parchment paper. Make sure to coat the tin's sides and bottoms evenly. 3. Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven according to your chosen recipe, generally between 325°F and 375°F (163°C - 190°C). 4. Portion the dough: Use a small ice cream scoop or a tablespoon to divide the cookie dough into equal portions. Make sure that each dough portion is roughly the same size, ensuring that the cookies will expand evenly across the muffin tin. 5. Shape the dough: Roll each portion of dough into a ball. Then, gently press the dough ball into the bottom of each greased muffin tin cavity, ensuring that there are no air pockets underneath. The dough should be spread evenly in the tin, but not too thin, to ensure proper expansion. 6. Keep some space between the dough balls: Avoid filling adjacent cavities in the muffin tin. This will allow for better heat circulation and even expansion of the cookies. 7. Bake: Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake according to your chosen recipe, generally between 10-15 minutes. Check regularly to ensure they don't over-bake, as cookie baking time may differ in a muffin tin compared to traditional cookie baking on a baking sheet. 8. Rotate the tin: For even baking and expansion, rotate the muffin tin halfway through the baking time. This ensures that all cookies are exposed to the same amount of heat. 9. Test for doneness: Use a toothpick to check if the cookies are done. The toothpick should come out clean or with only a few crumbs when inserted in the center. Keep an eye on color as well - cookies should be golden brown and slightly firm to the touch. 10. Cool: Once done, remove the muffin tin from the oven and allow the cookies to cool for a few minutes in the tin. Afterward, carefully remove them using a spatula or butter knife and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. 11. Troubleshooting: If the cookies don't expand evenly, consider using a different recipe or adjusting the baking time and temperature. Sometimes overmixing the dough can cause uneven expansion, so be gentle with the dough while preparing it. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully make cookies that expand evenly over the muffin tin, ensuring uniformly shaped and delicious treats for everyone to enjoy!"},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

It dropped to a much lower level in September, October and November, when they released a significant portion of the water as a yearly chore. But I can use this background: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. What is an answer for this question: When was the water level lower, in April or in March?

By Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor The Queen rolled out the red carpet for China's Prime Minister Li Keqiang today as part of his three-day official visit to Britain designed to ease diplomatic tensions - and win billions of pounds in business contracts. Her Majesty welcomed Mr Li and his wife at Windsor Castle alongside Prince Andrew before crunch talks in Number 10 this afternoon. At the Downing Street meeting, China's 30 year ban on British beef is expected to be lifted. A raft of other business deals will be announced to coincide with the visit, but Mr Cameron is also under pressure to raise concerns about China’s human rights record. Mr Li's visit is seen as a breakthrough in Sino-","completion":"British relations, coming after years of frosty ties between the two countries over a range of political and economic issues. It is expected that the talks in Number 10 will yield significant results, particularly in the investment and trade sectors. Both the UK and China hope to foster a stronger partnership that could reshape their bilateral relationship and contribute to their respective economic growths. During the China-UK Business Forum, held at Mansion House in London, Premier Li Keqiang signed a series of agreements with the UK government worth over £18 billion. These deals involve investments in key British industries such as energy, infrastructure, and financial services. Among the most notable projects is the planned construction of a new nuclear power plant in Somerset, England, which will be jointly financed by Chinese and French firms. In addition to opening up new trade opportunities, the agreements are expected to create thousands of jobs in both countries. Mr Li's visit also witnessed the launch of a joint China-UK research and development fund aimed at fostering innovation and collaboration in science and technology. However, the visit has not been without its controversies. Prior to Mr Li's arrival in the UK, British MPs and human rights activists voiced their concerns about China's record on human rights. They urged Prime Minister David Cameron to raise these issues during his meeting with the Chinese Premier. Despite these concerns, the UK government sees the benefits of engaging with China too important to be overshadowed by the human rights issues. In a statement, Mr Cameron said, \\"We will not shy away from discussing human rights in our conversations with the Chinese, but we also recognize the enormous economic opportunities presented by greater cooperation with China.\\" As part of the diplomacy surrounding Mr Li's visit, both sides agreed to enhance cultural, education, and tourism exchanges. The British Museum and China’s Palace Museum signed a memorandum of understanding to work together on special exhibitions and artifact loans. Moreover, several British universities signed agreements with Chinese institutions to establish joint research projects. In summary, Mr Li Keqiang's visit to the UK marks a significant milestone in Sino-British relations as it paves the way for enhanced political and economic cooperation. The several billion-pound deals signed indicate a renewed interest in fostering a strategic partnership that will benefit both countries economically, while also addressing some of the longstanding concerns such as human rights. While critics argue that engaging with China without confronting its human rights record could send the wrong message, the UK government believes that open dialogue and cooperation will ultimately lead to stronger ties and a better understanding of shared values and common interests."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Moses loves Nefretiri, who is the throne princess and must be betrothed to the next Pharaoh. She reciprocates his love. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God. An incident occurs when an elderly woman is almost crushed to death when her sash gets caught under the slab of stone, prompting Moses to scold overseer Baka. Moses frees the elderly woman, not realizing that she is his natural mother, Yoshebel. Moses institutes numerous reforms concerning the treatment of the slaves on the project, and eventually Prince Rameses, Moses's \\"brother\\", charges him with planning an insurrection, pointing out that the slaves are calling him the \\"Deliverer\\".

Critics argue that his decisions and management style led to negative outcomes and long-lasting consequences, particularly in regard to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a recent interview, however, Rumsfeld defended his record against these critics. Rumsfeld's Tenure at the Department of Defense (Step 2: Provide a brief overview of Rumsfeld's tenure to bring context to the differing perspectives) Rumsfeld served as the U.S. Secretary of Defense twice: first from 1975 to 1977 under President Gerald Ford, and later from 2001 to 2006 under President George W. Bush. During his second term, he oversaw the U.S. military's involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was known for his confrontational and no-nonsense approach to defense management, which won him admiration from some and criticism from others. The Criticism Against Rumsfeld (Step 3: Outline the main points of criticism against Rumsfeld) Many of Rumsfeld's critics argue that his aggressive approach to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan led to poor strategy, planning, and execution. Specific points of contention include: 1. The insufficient number of troops deployed, which some argue contributed to the growth of insurgent groups and the protraction of the wars. 2. His insistence on a \\"light footprint\\" approach, which may have weakened the U.S. military's effectiveness on the ground. 3. A perceived lack of adequate preparation for post-invasion governance in Iraq, particularly following the disbanding of the Iraqi military. 4. Allegations of prisoner mistreatment at Abu Ghraib during Rumsfeld's leadership, which many believe damaged the U.S.'s global reputation. Rumsfeld Defends His Record (Step 4: Summarize Rumsfeld's defense of his record) In response to these criticisms, Rumsfeld has defended not only his record but also the broader approach that he and the Bush administration took to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His key arguments include: 1. The belief that deploying a larger number of troops would have worsened the situation by causing more resentment among local populations. 2. The conviction that a lighter footprint allowed for greater flexibility in a rapidly changing geopolitical climate. 3. The argument that, despite complications, the removal of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban from power ultimately made the world a safer place. 4. His assertion that he personally took steps to address the Abu Ghraib allegations once they became known to him, emphasizing that those actions were ultimately the responsibility of a small number of individuals. Conclusion (Step 5: Offer an objective analysis, leaving readers to form their own opinions) As is often the case with high-ranking government officials, Rumsfeld's tenure at the Department of Defense is a complex and polarizing subject. As critics continue to scrutinize his decisions and management style, Rumsfeld still vehemently defends his record as Defense Secretary. Ultimately, it is up to historians and the public to weigh the arguments on both sides and decide the lasting impact of Rumsfeld's time in office."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is not an international standard unit, and its conversion factors may vary slightly depending on the particular region. In general terms, a marla is equal to an area of 9 square karams. A karam (also spelled as a gattha or gaz) is another traditional unit of length commonly used in India and Pakistan, and it can be converted to more familiar units such as yards or meters. One karam is usually recognized as equivalent to 5.5 feet or 1.67 meters. So, to determine the area in square yards, we first need to convert marla into square karams and then into square yards. As mentioned earlier, 1 marla is equal to 9 square karams. Now, we will convert this to square yards. Since 1 karam is equivalent to approximately 5.5 feet, one square karam will be equal to (5.5 ft x 5.5 ft) which equals 30.25 square feet. Now knowing that 1 marla = 9 square karams and 1 square karam = 30.25 square feet, we can now convert marla to square feet: 1 marla * 9 square karams/marla * 30.25 square feet/square karam = 272.25 square feet As there are 9 square feet in 1 square yard, we can now convert the value of marla in square feet to square yards: 272.25 square feet * (1 square yard / 9 square feet) = 30.25 square yards Hence, 1 marla is equivalent to approximately 30.25 square yards. It is essential to note that this conversion is based on the standard value adopted for one karam (5.5 feet) and can vary depending on the location or local customs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many of his books have been made into films and videos. He is so famous that there is even a Roald Dahl Museum you can visit. Roald Dahl was born in 1916 in Wales, Britain. His father was rich but he died when Roald was very young. Roald and his mother lived a hard life. He had to leave school and went to Africa where he worked for an oil company. In 1939 Roald became a pilot, but he had a bad accident. It made him limp for the rest of his life. After this, Roald went to America where he wrote a story about his experience as a pilot. It was so good that it was put in a magazine. Roald married an American film star. They bought a house in England and had five children. From 1960 to 1965, _ : Theo, one of his children, was hit by a taxi and was seriously hurt. Olivia, one of Roald's daughters, died of a strange illness. Soon after this, his wife also had a serious illness. It took her years to get completely better. Gradually Roald became more and more successful. He always did his writing in an old shed at the back of his house. He always sat in the same old armchair with a wooden board on his lap. _ In 1983 Roald won a big prize for his book The BFG. During his life, Roald wrote many famous books, such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, Fantastic Mr. Fox. After he died in 1990, Roald left money to help people with serious illnesses and those with problems with reading and writing. Question: After Roald went to America, he _ .

Advanced age was significantly associated with increased SARS-related deaths, primarily due to the onset of early-and late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis. Infection of aged, but not young, mice with recombinant viruses bearing spike glycoproteins derived from early human or palm civet isolates resulted in death accompanied by pathological changes associated with ARDS. In aged mice, a greater number of differentially expressed genes were observed than in young mice, whose responses were significantly delayed. Differences between lethal and nonlethal virus phenotypes in aged mice could be attributed to differences in host response kinetics rather than virus kinetics. SARS-CoV infection induced a range of interferon, cytokine, and pulmonary wound-healing genes, as well as several genes associated with the onset of ARDS. Mice that died also showed unique transcriptional profiles of immune response, apoptosis, cell cycle control, and stress. Cytokines associated with ARDS were significantly upregulated in animals experiencing lung pathology and lethal disease, while the same animals experienced downregulation of the ACE2 receptor. These data suggest that the magnitude and kinetics of a disproportionately strong host innate immune response contributed to severe respiratory stress and lethality. Although the molecular mechanisms governing ARDS pathophysiology remain unknown in aged animals, these studies reveal a strategy for dissecting the genetic pathways by which SARS-CoV infection induces changes in the host response, leading to death.","completion":"Title: \\"Age-Related Susceptibility in SARS-CoV Infections: Dissecting Molecular Mechanisms, Immune Responses, and ARDS Pathophysiology\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1993 our then PM Paul Keating travelled to Balmoral to inform the Queen she was \\"an anachronism\\". Yet on the Queen's tour Down Under to open the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, beaming crowds turned out for her. A poll revealed that support for the monarchy is at its highest level for 20 years. So, to use Aussie vernacular, what the bloody hell's goin' on? Fan ... author Kathy Lette Well, first there's the Wills and Kate factor. That handsome couple are so disarmingly charming, so young and fun and full of rock star glamour, they've become the monarchy's stealth weapon. Then there's the \\"last chance to see\\" element. At 85, this is probably the Queen's final Antipodean jaunt. Plus, recessions always ignite a chronic case of nostalgia-itis. The Queen reminds us of a time when all problems were solved by putting the kettle on. The hardest drug we took was coke  as in cola. Aids, al-Qaeda, global warming and immigration were not gnawing at the national psyche. The White Australia policy, from 1901 to 1973, barred immigration to anyone black or even vaguely beige. The Queen's dedication and dignity have also endeared her to even the most hardened anti-monarchist. Buck Palace threw a bit of a barbie for Aussies a couple of weeks ago. It proved most amusing to see how the republicans' knees gave way as they approached Her Maj, explaining their unexpected bobs as the sudden flaring up of an old tennis injury. Even though we share a sense of humour and history, a love of Milligan, Monty Python, cricket and Dickens etc, Australia is no longer a land of cuppas and cucumber sandwiches. Post-White Australia policy, the government implemented an ambitious immigration drive. Australia is now a human minestrone. It is part of Asia, and not just geographically. There are economic ties too  our wealth is due to digging up our back yard and selling it to China. So, before you Brits get all smug about the death of republicanism, I'd just like to add that Stephen Fry is also currently drawing huge crowds Down Under. You see? We're fond of all kinds of Queens, but it doesn't mean we want to be ruled by them. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about how Australians seem to be showing more support for the monarchy and Queen. The writer explains that the increasing support could be because of the charm of Prince William and Kate, the young and popular royal couple. Also, since the Queen is 85 years old, this might be her last visit to Australia, so people want to see her one last time. The writer also mentions how the Queen's dedication and dignity have won over even those who don't like the monarchy. However, in the end, the writer points out that Australians also enjoy other famous figures from the UK, like Stephen Fry, and that doesn't mean they want to be ruled by them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If \\"A man in a plaid shirt and a blue helmet holds onto a blue rope while hanging against some large boulders.\\", does this mean that \\"The man in a plaid shirt is walking along the ground.\\"?","completion":"No, the statement \\"A man in a plaid shirt and a blue helmet holds onto a blue rope while hanging against some large boulders\\" does not imply that \\"The man in a plaid shirt is walking along the ground.\\" Here are some detailed reasons about why these two statements don't align: 1. Different Scenarios: The situations described in both the statements are entirely different. The first statement describes a scenario where a man is hanging against some large boulders. This implies that the man could be rock climbing or rappelling as he's holding onto a rope and has a helmet for safety, which are common gear for such activities. On the other hand, the second statement describes a situation where a man is simply walking along the ground, a casual scenario that doesn't require any particular gear or equipment. 2. Location Context: The location that each of the man's actions take place is different in the two scenarios. Hanging against boulders suggests that the man is in a mountainous or rocky terrain, possibly partaking in an adventure sport. Walking on the ground is a general statement that could be applicable anywhere, from city sidewalks to country trails, indoors or outdoors, and doesn't convey any specific adventure or activity, unlike the first statement. 3. Activity Level: There is also a difference in the physical exertion level in both these scenarios. Hanging against some large boulders while holding onto a rope is a physically strenuous activity that requires strength, skill, and possibly training. It is an adventurous situation that can be associated with thrill and risk. Conversely, walking along the ground is a routine activity undertaken by people daily, without needing any specific skills or physical abilities. 4. Safety Equipment: In the first statement, the man is wearing a helmet, which is often symbolic of situations where there may be an element of danger or risk. Conversely, the second statement mentions no such protective gear, suggesting a more mundane, less hazardous scenario. To summarize, based on the descriptions given, it is not valid to conclude that the man in the plaid shirt who is hanging against some large boulders is also walking along the ground. The first statement paints a picture of a man possibly engaged in a thrilling outdoor sporting activity, while the second statement refers to a more common daily activity of walking.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: The Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers. Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated 3 to 5 million, to charity. His charitable work continued with the release of \\"We Are the World\\" (1985), co-written with Lionel Richie, which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa. It earned 63 million, and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold. It won four Grammys for 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers. The project's creators received two special American Music Awards honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the USA for Africa idea. Jackson, Jones, and promoter Ken Kragan received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.Jackson collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making 40 million a year from owning the rights to other artists' songs. By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to others' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included \\"Everyday People\\" (1968), Len Barry's \\"1-2-3\\" (1965), and Dion DiMucci's \\"The Wanderer\\" (1961) and \\"Runaround Sue\\" (1961). In 1984 Robert Holmes à Court announced he was selling the ATV Music Publishing catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4000 songs, including most of the Beatles' material. In 1981, McCartney had been offered the catalog for £20 million (40 million). Jackson submitted a bid of 46 million on November 20, 1984.

At a certain temperature, (usually between 1,500 °F (820 °C) and 1,600 °F (870 °C), depending on carbon content), the base metal of steel undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms in its crystal matrix, called allotropy. This allows the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal, diffusing into the iron matrix. When this happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in solution, or mixed with the iron, forming a single, homogeneous, crystalline phase called austenite. If the steel is cooled slowly, the iron will gradually change into its low temperature allotrope. When this happens the carbon atoms will no longer be soluble with the iron, and will be forced to precipitate out of solution, nucleating into the spaces between the crystals. The steel then becomes heterogeneous, being formed of two phases; the carbon (carbide) phase cementite, and ferrite. This type of heat treatment produces steel that is rather soft and bendable. However, if the steel is cooled quickly the carbon atoms will not have time to precipitate. When rapidly cooled, a diffusionless (martensite) transformation occurs, in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution. This causes the iron crystals to deform intrinsically when the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, making it very hard and brittle.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The New York Times announced Wednesday that it intended to charge frequent readers for access to its website, a step being debated across the industry that nearly every major newspaper has so far feared to take. Starting in early 2011, visitors to NYTimes.com will get a certain number of articles free every month before being asked to pay a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access. Subscribers to the newspaper's print edition will receive full access to the site. But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand. Still, publishers fear that money from digital subscriptions would not make up for the resulting loss of audience and advertising income. NYTimes.com is by far the most popular newspaper site in the country, with more than 17 million readers a month in the United States, according to Nielsen Online, and analysts say it is the leader in advertising income, as well. That may make it better positioned than other general-interest papers to charge--and also gives The Times more to lose if the move produces an opposed result. The Times Company has been studying the matter for almost a year, searching for common ground between pro-and-anti pay campaigns--a debate mirrored in dozens of media-watching blogs-- and the system will not go into effect until January 2011. Executives said they were not bothered by the possibility of absorbing barbs for moving cautiously. \\"There's no prize for getting it quick,\\" said Janet L.

This in turn infects many people, robbing them of their emotions when they enter REM sleep.One of the first people infected is Tucker (Jeremy Northam), a CDC director investigating the crash.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Henry Havelock Ellis, known as Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 - 8 July 1939), was an English physician, writer, progressive intellectual and social reformer who studied human sexuality. He co-authored the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as on transgender psychology. He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. Context: Dr. Havelock Ellis' 1933 book, Psychology of Sex, is one of the many manifestations of his interest in human sexuality. In this book, he goes into vivid detail of how children can experience sexuality differently in terms of time and intensity. He mentions that it was previously believed that, in childhood, humans had no sex impulse at all. \\"If it is possible to maintain that the sex impulse has no normal existence in early life, then every manifestation of it at that period must be 'perverse,'\\" he adds. He continues by stating that, even in the early development and lower function levels of the genitalia, there is a wide range of variation in terms of sexual stimulation. He claims that the ability of some infants producing genital reactions, seen as \\"reflex signs of irritation\\" are typically not vividly remembered. Since the details of these manifestations are not remembered, there is no possible way to determine them as pleasurable. However, Ellis claims that many people of both sexes can recall having agreeable sensations with the genitalia as a child. \\"They are not (as is sometimes imagined) repressed.\\" They are, however, not usually mentioned to adults. Ellis argues that they typically stand out and are remembered for the sole contrast of the intense encounter to any other ordinary experience. Ellis claims that sexual self-excitement is known to happen at an early age. He references authors like Marc, Fonssagrives, and Perez in France who published their findings in the nineteenth century. These early ages are not strictly limited to ages close to puberty as can be seen in their findings. These authors provide cases for children of both sexes who have masturbated from the age of three or four. Ellis references Robie's findings that boys' first sex feelings appear between the ages of five and fourteen. For girls, this age ranges from eight to nineteen. For both sexes, these first sexual experiences arise more frequently during the later years as opposed to the earlier years. Ellis then references Hamilton's studies that found twenty percent of males and fourteen percent of females have pleasurable experiences with their sex organs before the age of six. This is only supplemented by Ellis' reference to Katharine Davis' studies, which found that twenty to twenty-nine percent of boys and forty-nine to fifty-one percent were masturbating by the age of eleven. However, in the next three years after, boys' percentages exceeded that of girls. Dr. Ellis also contributed to the idea of varying levels of sexual excitation. He asserts it is a mistake to assume all children experience are able to experience genital arousal or pleasurable erotic sensations. He proposes cases where an innocent child is led to believe that stimulation of the genitalia will result in a pleasurable erection. Some of these children may fail and not be able to experience this either pleasure or an erection until puberty. Ellis concludes, then, that children are capable of a \\"wide range of genital and sexual aptitude.\\" Ellis even considers ancestry as contributions to different sexual excitation levels, stating that children of \\"more unsound heredity\\" and/or hypersexual parents are \\"more precociously excitable.\\" Question: What's the name of his book?

It would all be equal. But right now we're almost invisible and so what I hope for is more visibility. More opportunity and more acceptance of the disabled body.\\" Richardson said she doesn't want an apology from Kylie, but rather, an \\"explanation.\\" \\"Mostly, I'd like an explanation of how not one person at the magazine, nor Kylie herself, or her manager/mother thought, 'Maybe this could hurt people,'\\" she mused. \\"An apology would be lovely but it's not completely necessary.

The reality star, 18, daughter of Caitlyn and 'momager' Kris Jenner, first filed the application in May last year. But court documents reveal pop princess Kylie Minogue has formally opposed the application, describing Jenner as \\"a secondary reality television personality who appeared on the television series Keeping Up With the Kardashians as a supporting character.\\" The star, 47, already owns various trademarks including the name 'Kylie' for the services of education and entertainment. She has also owned the domain name kylie.com since August 21, 1996, a year before Jenner was born. (Photo: WENN) Jenner is attempting to trademark 'Kylie' for \\"entertainment in the nature of providing information by means of a global computer network in the fields of entertainment, fashion and pop culture\\", according to the documents. The opposition was filed by KDB Pty Ltd under claims of likelihood of confusion, dilution by blurring and dilution by tarnishment. The opposition's court papers make reference to Jenner's past controversies, noting: \\"Ms. Jenner is active on social media where her photographic exhibitionism and controversial posts have drawn criticism from, e.g., the Disability Rights and African-American communities.\\" In September last year Jenner was accused of racism after apparently buying her mixed race friend a birthday cake with the inscription \\"happy birthday N****\\" written in icing. And in December she posed in a wheelchair in a fashion shoot for Interview magazine, provoking outcry from disability rights groups.

Jenner, who appears in the reality TV show Keeping Up With the Kardashians, is hoping to trademark the name Kylie in the US to use for her expanding empire of beauty and clothing collections. But last week KDB, an Australian firm representing Minogue, filed opposition to the application, claiming that allowing Jenner to take the Kylie name would cause confusion for Minogue fans and dilute her brand. Kylie v Kylie – the Jarndyce v Jarndyce of our time Read more KDB goes on to describe Jenner as a “secondary reality television personality”. In making its case for which Kylie is the more legitimate Kylie, it goes on to list criticism Jenner has faced from African American communities and disability rights groups, particularly for her “photographic exhibitionism” on social media. In December, Jenner caused controversy by posing in a wheelchair for a photoshoot with Interview magazine. In contrast, the claim describes Minogue as an “internationally renowned performing artist, humanitarian, and breast cancer activist”. Minogue is no stranger to trademarking names. She currently owns the terms “Kylie Minogue”, “Kylie Minogue Darling” (the name of her perfume brand) and “Lucky – the Kylie Minogue musical”. As of 2015, Kylie Minogue had record sales of more than 80m, though Jenner can almost match that number in terms of followers on social media. Kylie v Kylie: does Minogue or Jenner deserve to own trademarked name? Read more Such trademark disputes in court are becoming increasingly common, as more celebrities are protecting their brands and the fruits of their labour through aggressive patenting. Fox’s popular television series Glee is currently fighting a ruling which disputes the name of the show in the UK, after it lost its appeal against the British comedy chain The Glee Club. The network is considering taking its case to the European courts, arguing that the forced rebranding of Glee could have “catastrophic consequences” for the show, which would also cover repeat shows, DVD sales, stage show performances and downloads. In 2007, Angelina Jolie became embroiled in a similar battle after perfume designer Symine Salimpour attempted to trademark the name Shiloh for her new fragrance. Jolie’s daughter is also called Shiloh and Jolie fought a five-month battle against the name patent but eventually lost. To prevent such an occurrence, Beyoncé and Jay-Z filed a trademark application for their daughter’s name, Blue Ivy Carter, just a few days after she was born in January 2012.

Here's a video of one teen performing the challenge: And another video: Several photos on Twitter look similar to this one, which shows a young girl's bruised lips after she took the #KylieJennerChallenge: This challenge is risky, according to experts, who are warning teens that the shot glass can break while they're sucking, leading to cuts and injuries. While I agree no one should try this stupid stunt because they could get hurt, I'd argue there's an even better reason not to attempt this stupid stunt: you're emulating a reality TV star who has yet to win a world record, write a song, help build an orphanage, graduate college, or even vote in an election. In short: challenging yourself to look more like a cartoon character is beyond bizarre and sad. More from The Stir: Kylie Jenner's Huge Lips Can Finally Be Explained At first, I thought: maybe these teens are poking fun at Kylie and showing the world how silly it is to pump up your lips to artificial proportions. Surely, no one thinks they look good like this, right? If they could find some way to take that stand using makeup, and not a shot glass, I'd be all for it. I hope I'm right. I hope this is all just a wacky joking way of trying to prove that natural is best—but I also fear the message this sends out is that Kylie's lips are something we should all try and achieve, regardless of whether big lips are in our genes. When I was younger, the world of plastic surgery wasn't accessible to teens. In our eyes, it was a bizarre universe inhabited only by a small percentage of Park Avenue socialites, most of whom were in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. We wouldn't have even dreamed of going under the knife—it just wasn't part of teen culture. It makes me sad to know that Kylie and other really young people are, whether they realize it or not, promoting plastic surgery and obscenely exaggerated body enhancements. Let's hope this challenge is just a joke and that it goes away quickly. Why do you think teens are taking the Kylie Jenner Challenge?

The late rockers Elvis and Lemmy didn’t need to announce their family names. Think Usher and Prince, Sia and Kylie. Turns out another Kylie wants the name all to herself. Kylie Jenner, the teenage model and star of reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, has applied to trademark her first name in the U.S. Problem is Kylie Minogue has been performing as \\"Kylie\\" since before Jenner was born. Kylie Minogue Engaged to Boyfriend Joshua Sasse Jenner is seeking protection for the name “Kylie” in connection with advertising services, according to World Intellectual Property Review, though Minogue’s reps last week filed a notice of opposition to the application. KDB, an Australian-based business representing Minogue, argues that if the US Patent and Trademark Office approved Jenner’s application then it would cause confusion among consumers and dilute the pop singer’s brand. In its opposition, KDB said Jenner was a ““secondary reality television personality” who appeared as “a supporting character” on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and who has been criticized by disability rights groups and African American communities. Kylie Minogue Splits With Roc Nation Minogue has addressed the dispute in a message to her 2.3 million Twitter followers. “Hello... My name is KYLIE #lightyears”, she wrote, lifting a lyric from her 2000 song \\"Light Years\\". Hello..... My name is KYLIE #lightyears — kylie minogue (@kylieminogue) February 28, 2016 Minogue has sold more than 65 million albums over her career. Her trophy room includes Brit Awards, Grammys and in 2007 she became the first-ever woman (and first foreigner) to receive Britain's prestigious Music Industry Trusts' Award. In 2011, she was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. She has owned the domain name kylie.com since Aug. 21, 1996, a year before Jenner was born, The Mirror reports.

Question: Given the following context: About to nervously jump off a bridge, scrawny Harry Berlin is a barely functional human being. Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him. As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her.

To her, any kind of sex is casual, and it doesn't matter who she does it with or when, as long as she gets it.At graduation she falls asleep, proving she has little interest for the norms of prize-givings or anything to do with what's accepted by society. At her father's birthday party she is under dressed and is of course moaned at by her hypocritical mother. Here we learn that her parent's friends are just as false as what is accepted by everyone.

All the nursing staff and the patients are kept marginally sane by Valerie, and she and Susanna have a complex relationship.

Imagine when you leave your toys outside and they get all yucky because of the air and weather. The same thing happens to cookies if we leave them out. So we need to keep them safe and cozy. Here's a fun and easy way to keep cookies moist: 1. Find a clean, airtight container. This can be a box with a lid that fits tightly. This is like a little house for cookies to keep them away from the outside air. 2. Put a piece of bread in the box with the cookies. I know, bread sounds strange, right? But the cookies and the bread will play a little game. The cookies will take the moisture from the bread, so they stay soft and yummy, while the bread will become hard. Never store cookies when they're still warm; let them cool first, just like you have to wait for your bath water to cool down a bit. Remember to eat the cookies within a week, it's their game over time. If they stay longer, they might not taste as good. Also remember not to put in too many cookies in one box.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Owls are some of the world's greatest hunters. From head to feet, owls' bodies are built to hunt. Scientists are studying all the things that make owls such great hunters. Most owls hunt at night. The birds have excellent hearing, which helps them find their next meal in the dark. Owls have one ear that is larger and set higher than the other. When an owl hears a sound, it listens closely. Is the sound lounder in its right ear or left ear? Does the upper or lower ear detect the sound first? The information helps the owl find the location of its prey without ever seeing it. Owls don't depend just on their hearing to hunt. After a sound draws an owl's attention, it zeroes in with sight. Many birds have eyes on either side of their heads. But an owl's eyes face forward, like a person's. Images from each eye combine to form a 3-D picture, similar to how we see. That helps owls better judge a prey's size, distance, and speed. An owl's eyes are so large that they can gather lots of light. That helps the owl see better when hunting at night. An owl's eyes are also fixed in their sockets . It can't roll them like we can. Instead, an owl keeps prey in its sight by turning its head. Owls can move their beads nearly upside down and turn them 270 degrees around. Their necks have 14 vertebrae . That's twice as many neck bones as a person has. The blood vessels thread through holes in an owl's vertebrae. The researchers found that these holes are very large so that the extra space provides an air cushion that protects the vessels. Detecting prey is only the first step for owls. Next they must catch their meals. An owl can fly inches over your head and you can't hear anything. The secret to owls' silent flight is their feathers. Fine \\"hairs\\" cover the surface of an owl's wing feathers. And the feathers' edges have soft barbs . Together, they make the sound of air rushing over the owl's wings quieter and less clear.

Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca.

This is called the \\"fire triangle.\\" Here are some ways you can do that: 1. Use water: Pouring water on a fire cools down the heat. You can use a hose or a bucket of water to pour on the fire. This helps because water absorbs the fire's heat and turns into steam, which puts the fire out. 2. Use a fire extinguisher: This is a special red canister that sprays a special material that stops the fire. It works by taking away the oxygen the fire needs to burn. Always ask an adult to help you use a fire extinguisher. 3. Smother the fire: Covering the fire with a thick, non-flammable material like a fire blanket or even a large pot lid can help block the oxygen the fire needs. This will make it harder for the fire to breathe and help put it out. Make sure an adult helps you with this.

Answer the following question: Information: - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F. Hoffman (1999), use the term \\"supercontinent\\" to mean \\"a clustering of nearly all continents\\". This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic. However, beyond , continental positions are much less certain. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia.

It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - A coucal is one of about 30 species of birds in the cuckoo family. All of them belong in the subfamily Centropodinae and the genus Centropus. Unlike many Old World cuckoos, coucals are not brood parasites. On the other hand, they do have their own reproductive peculiarity: all members of the genus are to varying degrees sex-role reversed so that the smaller male provides most of the parental care. At least one coucal species, the black coucal, is polyandrous. Some species (\\"Centropus phasianinus\\") have the male investing more in incubation and parental care. Recent DNA evidence suggests that they should be raised to family status, as Centropodidae. - The true koels, Eudynamys, are a genus of cuckoos from Asia, Australia and the Pacific. They are large sexually dimorphic cuckoos which eat fruits and insects and have loud distinctive calls. They are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other species. - Malkohas are large birds in the cuckoo family Cuculidae, all in the genus Phaenicophaeus. The group name is derived from the Sinhala word for the red-faced malkoha; Mal-Koha meaning flower-cuckoo. These are all Asian tropical species. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"phoiniko-\\" \\"crimson\\", and \\"phaes\\" \\"eyes\\" or \\"face\\", referring to the red-faced malkoha. However, the 'œ' was mistranscribed as 'æ'. - The cuckoos are a family of birds, Cuculidae, the sole taxon in the order Cuculiformes. The cuckoo family includes the common or European cuckoo, roadrunners, koels, malkohas, couas, coucals and anis. The coucals and anis are sometimes separated as distinct families, the Centropodidae and Crotophagidae respectively. - In paleogeography, Gondwana, also Gondwanaland, is the name given to an ancient supercontinent. It is believed to have sutured between about 573 and 510 million years ago (Mya), joining East Gondwana to West Gondwana. Gondwana formed prior to Pangaea, and later became part of it. - Couas are large , mostly terrestrial birds of the cuckoo family , endemic to the island of Madagascar . Coua derives from koa , the Malagasy name for a cuckoo or coua , which is in turn an onomatopoeic of some species ' call notes . Reminiscent of African turacos when walking along tree branches , they likewise feature brightly coloured bare skin around the eyes . Some resemble coucals in their habit of clambering through plant tangles while foraging , while the arboreal species move between tree canopies with gliding flight . Four species occur ( red ) in rainforests while the remaining six are found in the dry forests of western and southern Madagascar . They have large feet , with a reversible third toe like all cuckoos . Their long tibia suggest a relationship with the Carpococcyx ground - cuckoos of Asia , a genus with similar nestlings . Consequently , they are sometimes united in the subfamily Couinae . Couas build their own nests and lay white eggs . Couas ' calls are short series of evenly spaced notes , which are sometimes answered by other individuals . What entity does 'coua' has the relation 'parent taxon' with? Answer:","completion":"Coua has the relation 'parent taxon' with the family of birds called Cuculidae. The Cuculidae family comprises cuckoos, which includes various subgroups like coucals, anis, and couas. The Couas are large, mostly terrestrial birds of the cuckoo family, endemic to the island of Madagascar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: How long is the play in Edinburgh?

Smartphones do make our lives easier. But have you ever thought about what they mean to your eyes? According to a study, half of the British people own smartphones and they spend an average ( ) of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the U.K who suffer from short-sightedness since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring at smartphones for a long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink a certain number of times. However, when you look at the things closer to your face, the blink slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes. Another bad habit is using smartphone in dark rooms before going to sleep. If you look at a bright screen while your pupils become larger, too much light goes into your eyes. This can be bad for your eyes and causes a disease called glaucoma . Maybe it is possible for you to stop using your smartphone, but there are a few things you can do to protect your eyes. * Hold your phone at least 30 centimeters away from your eyes when using it. *Take a break every hour and try the following: look at something at least 5 meters away from you and then focus on your nose.

Here's a detailed analysis of the various aspects of the tweet: 1. The tweet starts with \\"@ryan_s great news!\\" which indicates a positive sentiment. The user is sharing \\"great news\\" with another user (@ryan_s), implying that something good has happened or has been communicated. In this instance, the tweet is definitely leaning towards a positive sentiment. 2. The next part of the tweet, \\"Poor Dave,\\" indicates sympathy for a person named Dave. This could imply that something unfortunate has happened to Dave, or he's in a situation that merits sympathy from the author of the tweet. This part of the tweet leans towards a negative sentiment. Taking both of these components into consideration, the overall sentiment of the tweet can be described as a mix of both positive and negative emotions. It's important to note that sentiment analysis is not always black and white, and social media communication can be nuanced and multifaceted.

A disfluent question is a question that has some interruptions in it while framing and a proper question is the correct form of the question without any disfluency. Classify whether the question is answerable or not based on the given context. Input: proper question: What gives sedimentary rock its characteristic fabric? disfluent question: What changes the mineral content of a rock or wait I want to know what gives sedimentary rock its characteristic fabric? context: There are three major types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The rock cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock, and magma. When a rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava), it is an igneous rock. This rock can be weathered and eroded, and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock, or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric. The sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified, ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rock may also be re-eroded and redeposited, and metamorphic rock may also undergo additional metamorphism. All three types of rocks may be re-melted; when this happens, a new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize. Output:","completion":"The given proper question is: What gives sedimentary rock its characteristic fabric? The disfluent question is: What changes the mineral content of a rock or wait I want to know what gives sedimentary rock its characteristic fabric? Now, let's analyze the context: The context explains that there are three major types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The rock cycle illustrates the relationships between these types of rocks and magma. The transformation of an igneous rock into a sedimentary rock, or a sedimentary rock into a metamorphic rock, changes the mineral content of the rock, which gives it a characteristic fabric. Considering the context, we can understand that the characteristic fabric of sedimentary rocks is a result of being weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified after transforming from either igneous or metamorphic rocks. Based on the context, both the proper question and the disfluent question are answerable. The answer to the questions is that the characteristic fabric of sedimentary rocks is given by the weathering, erosion, deposition, and lithification processes that they undergo during their formation as part of the rock cycle."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The amazing December turnaround of the Philadelphia Eagles continued with another road win over a division rival. Philadelphia's surprising 23-7 Christmas Day victory over the Dallas Cowboys was broadcast on national television and clinched a playoff spot. Jeff Garcia, who outshined fellow backup-turned starting quarterback Tony Romo, led the Eagles to scores on four of their first five possessions. Capping off their first drive, which took 7:12 off the clock, Garcia hit tight end Matt Schobel for a 25-yard touchdown. Cowboys' return man Miles Austin fumbled the ensuing kickoff to Quintin Mikell. However, Dallas cornerback Anthony Henry intercepted Garcia and the Cowboys drove to the Eagles' 1-yard line. From there, the Philadelphia defense stuffed Dallas goal-line back Marion Barber III on three straight plays. The ball turned over on downs and Garcia promptly found Dont&#233; Stallworth for a 39-yard gain. The drive finished with a David Akers field goal and the Eagles led 10-0. Romo and the Cowboys responded with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens, who only caught two passes for 23 yards on the game. With only&#160;:29 seconds left in the half, Garcia got the Eagles into field goal range, and David Akers connected on a 45-yarder to make it 13-7 as time expired. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Garcia beat a Dallas blitz and completed a 65-yard catch and run to L.J. Smith. Philadelphia finished the drive with another field goal and it was 16-7. Early in the fourth quarter, Brian Dawkins made an over the shoulder interception in front of Owens in the end zone. On a 6:57 drive that included ten running plays and broke the Cowboys' backs, Correll Buckhalter pounded it in from one yard out, increasing the lead to 23-7. Romo would throw another interception, this one to Lito Sheppard, and the Eagles' domination of the Dallas offense continued for the rest of the game. The Eagles ran the ball a whopping 42 times for 204 yards (with Brian Westbrook accounting for 122 of those yards), while Garcia and the passing game gained 238 yards. The defense recorded three sacks in addition to the two interceptions and held Dallas to a meager 201 total yards on their own turf. Philadelphia clinches a playoff berth, and now suddenly controls the NFC East and can win the division with a win over the Atlanta Falcons or a Dallas loss.

Summarize this article: They were killed when a gunman, with links to Islamic State extremists, opened fire on a beach in Sousse, outside two hotels. He had hidden a gun under a beach umbrella and also threw grenades, forcing people to run for their lives. Some survivors have been speaking about their ordeal. Full coverage of the Sousse attack Angela Evans and her friend lay face down in the sand playing dead as the gunman passed. \\"We both looked up, stood up, there was this man there in black, several rows of sun loungers away just stood there with his huge gun moving round all the people shooting them, just killing, murdering them. \\"You can't run, you're an open target running, he was shooting anyone on their feet as well as people on sun loungers, he was just killing them. \\"So we both at the same time, [said] play dead, we just fell to the ground, faces in the sand. \\"The shooting continued. He just kept on shooting, it was coming nearer and nearer. Then his feet were at the side of me. \\"You don't move, because you're next. You just pray to God. \\"Then there was this noise, this heavy clicking noise, into the sand fell part of the gun, a magazine... You still have to pretend you're dead. \\"And then click again. He put more bullets in. \\"And then there was a noise. I don't know what noise, just a noise. I could feel him move and the shooting started again.\\" Ms Evans, from King's Lynn in Norfolk, described hearing the gunman leave the beach towards a hotel. When the pair thought it was safe, they ran to another hotel. She said staff there hid her and her friend in an office until it was over. Saera Wilson said her fiance Matthew James, 30, from Trehafod, near Pontypridd, was trying to protect her during the gunfire and used his body as a human shield. Ms Wilson, 26, said Mr James was hit in the shoulder, chest and hip. Speaking from the hospital where Mr James, known as Sas, is being treated, Ms Wilson said: \\"He took a bullet for me. I owe him my life because he threw himself in front of me when the shooting started. \\"He was covered in blood from the shots, but he just told me to run away.\\" Shelley Hay, 25, and Ben Milton, 24, from Cardiff, were on the beach with sunbathers when the attack began. Ms Hay told the BBC: \\"I heard what I thought were fireworks and looked to the left of me and the whole beach was running, it was like a stampede. \\"I have never seen anything like it in my life. There were shots - from what I know now as I could see sand flying in the air - I believe it was bullets hitting the floor and the sand was just hitting back, so we just ran.\\" The couple got engaged hours later. Mr Milton proposed after deciding to \\"not let them stop me.\\" Fourteen-year-old Bronwyn Slater was in the sea with her mum when the gunman began firing. \\"We just heard these sounds like bang, bang, bang bang. We just proper ran to my dad. It were terror and shock and sorrow. Then I had to proper sprint for my life really, to survive,\\" she told the BBC. The three of them ran to a shop where they hid in a cupboard for two-and-a-half hours, listening to gun shots and hand grenades being detonated on either side of them. It must have been frightening, said BBC Today presenter John Humphrys. \\"Frightening? It's unbelievable. It's shocking as well and terrifying really,\\" said Bronwyn. Listen to the full interview on BBC Radio Four's Today programme One survivor has spoken about how he was hidden in a hotel laundry room by hotel staff. John Carter, who was on holiday with his wife Lynn, ran into his hotel's kitchen area after hearing gunfire and was hidden in the laundry room. Mr Carter, from Hull said he lost sight of his wife after stopping briefly to urge an older man to run. \\"Then there were big explosions and then gunshots,\\" he said. \\"You didn't know what was going on, and you just saw some legs under where we were hid and they were shouting at them to get in with us, and then someone fell on top of me and it was my wife.\\" Couple Becky Catterick, 19, and Mark Barlow, 24, from Scunthorpe were protected from the gunman by local shopkeepers. Miss Catterick said: \\"We didn't want to say goodbye, but he just kept getting closer so we just all told each other we loved each other.\\" \\"We thought it was the end,\\" Mr Barlow added. Jac Randell, from Cardiff, was on holiday in the resort of Sousse with his partner Hollie Nicklin when the gunman opened fire on Friday. Mr Randell said they ran from the attacker expecting to get shot in the back. \\"Hotel staff formed a line of protection around the hotel. They were prepared to take the bullets for us.

One British tourist in Tunisia, whose name was only given as Danny, took refuge under a table with his wife, hearing ''guns and grenades and explosions'' around them. ''I hid under a table and kissed my wife goodbye, thinking that was going to be the end'' he said. Listen to his story A couple from Manchester told the BBC that the gunman was \\"killed about 400 yards\\" from where they were hiding. Olivia Leathley, who was on holiday in Sousse, said she saw \\"hundreds of people running and screaming from the beach,\\" before she managed to hide with her boyfriend, Mike Jones, in a small security lodge. Melanie Callaway, 45, from Hedge End, Hampshire had just been in the sea with her friend Paula Gill, 48, when the shooting started. \\"It was absolutely manic - people were just screaming 'run for your life', 'get off the beach - just run'. It was like a tsunami film where everyone was just running up the beach towards their hotels. \\"We had a five-minute run up the footpath with no shoes on,\\" said Mrs Callaway. The pair barricaded themselves in their room in the Royal Kenz Hotel for five hours with a mattress pushed up against the door. Debbie Horsfall was on holiday in Tunisia and flew back on Saturday morning. She described to the BBC how her friend noticed the gunman, and raised the alarm by shouting ''run, there's a gun''. Graeme Scott, from Irchester, Northamptonshire, was in the Hotel Imperial Marharba with his parents Jen and Sid and cousin Karl when the Tunisian beach attack happened. \\"We were laying by the pool and suddenly there were gunshots - what I thought were gunshots - but dad turned round and said 'it's fire crackers'. \\"I said 'no dad it's gunshots, we have got to go'. So we all got up... and we just headed towards the foyer of the hotel. \\"We just wanted to get safe somewhere. \\"There was about 20 of us in the cellar room with the door shut just for safety and we had to just keep quiet. \\"We just feared for our lives.\\" Listen to the full interview with BBC Radio Northampton Belfast couple Robert McKenzie and his wife, Wilma, had just come out of the sea when the gunman opened fire. The couple were staying at a hotel about 300 yards from where the shooting happened. Mr McKenzie said \\"pandemonium\\" broke out. \\"Everyone was running. I hadn't heard any gunfire,\\" he said. \\"If they had come to our section of the beach, we'd have been wiped out because we always lay right at the front of the beach... and wouldn't have had a chance, quite honestly. \\"By the grace of God, it didn't happen to us.\\" Summary:","completion":"A violent attack at a beach in Sousse saw individuals killed by a gunman linked to the Islamic State. He used a weapon hidden under a beach umbrella and also launched grenades, forcing people to flee. Various survivors shared stories of their experiences, including one woman and her friend who played dead to avoid being shot, and a man using his body as a shield for his fiancé. Others hid in shops, hotel offices, and laundry rooms. Staff and local shopkeepers also helped protect tourists during the attack. The event has left survivors traumatized, fearful, and thanking those who put their lives at risk to protect them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: While attending a preview of the film Stab, a film within a film based on the Woodsboro murders depicted in the first film, two Ohio Windsor College seniors, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens are murdered by Ghostface. Phil is stabbed through the ear in a bathroom stall while trying to eavesdrop on strange whimpering noises. The killer, wearing a Ghostface costume, then returns to the screening and sits beside Maureen before mortally stabbing her. At first the audience believes she is part of the raucous acting out by audience members until she falls dead in front of the cinema screen. The following day, the news media including local journalist Debbie Salt, descend on Windsor College where Sidney Prescott, a theatre major, now studies alongside her best friend Hallie and her new boyfriend Derek, fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy, and Derek's best friend Mickey. Sidney receives prank calls but is oblivious to the recent killings until someone instructs her to watch the news. Two other Woodsboro survivors arrive at the campus: officer Dewey Riley to help Sidney, and reporter Gale Weathers to cover the case. Gale tries to stage a confrontation between Sidney and Cotton Weary, who is attempting to gain fame from his exoneration for the murder of Sidney's mother. After Gale forcibly brings Sidney to Cotton, Sidney angrily hits Gale. Later that evening, Sidney goes to a party with Hallie. At a sorority house, Ghostface kills fellow student Cici. After all the partygoers leave, the killer then crashes the party and attempts to murder Sidney, though Derek intervenes. The killer injures Derek but Dewey and the police arrive, causing the killer to flee. The next morning, Gale discusses the case with the police. Upon realizing that Cici's real name is Casey, she concludes that the killer is a copycat who targets students who share the same names as the Woodsboro murder victims.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Options are: (a). no. (b). yes.","completion":"(a). No. These two questions are inquiring about different information. The first question is asking why many gambling Bitcoin sites have an \\".io\\" domain, while the second question is asking how to create a Bitcoin investment site like btclab.io. I will address both questions separately below. 1. Why do most of the gambling bitcoin sites have an .io domain? The .io domain has become popular among gambling Bitcoin sites and other technology-focused websites for a few reasons. The \\".io\\" top-level domain (TLD) is the country code TLD for the British Indian Ocean Territory, but it has gained recognition beyond its original purpose due to several factors: a) The \\"IO\\" abbreviation: It bears resemblance to \\"I/O,\\" or input/output, which is a term frequently used in computer and technology-related fields to describe the flow of data between systems. It makes the .io domain a natural fit for tech-savvy websites. b) Reputation: Over time, .io domains have been associated with a higher quality of service and better user experience among tech-based businesses, especially those involved in cryptocurrency and gaming since both industries are heavily reliant on technology, and .io domain signals to users that the gambling site is legitimate and innovative. c) Availability: With the saturation of .com domains, it's often difficult to find a desirable and easily memorable domain name. The .io TLD provides an alternative, allowing businesses to secure a domain that is both short and meaningful. d) Legal concerns: Some gambling Bitcoin sites may operate in legal grey areas or jurisdictions with strict gambling regulations, and the use of .io domains might help them avoid scrutiny from authorities that are less familiar with this domain extension. 2. How can I make a Bitcoin investment site like btclab.io? Creating a Bitcoin investment site similar to btclab.io involves several steps: a) Research: First, study the btclab.io platform and its features, and analyze how it operates. Investigate its business model, target audience, and interactions with the Bitcoin ecosystem. Also, research how the platform manages funds and guarantees returns to investors. Keeping yourself updated with cryptocurrency and investment news will help you better understand the market and competition. b) Legal aspects: Consult with legal experts to ensure that your planned investment site complies with all relevant laws and regulations within your jurisdiction, as well as any international regulations that may apply. Ensure that proper licensing is in place if required. c) Financial infrastructure: Develop a wallet system that integrates with your investment site to handle bitcoin deposits, withdrawals, and transactions. Collaborate with reliable bitcoin wallet providers to secure funds and user information. d) Platform development: Develop a user-friendly website or application with a robust backend system that can support your users' investments, offer various investment options, and automatically calculate returns. You may want to consider hiring experienced web developers and designers to create a professional-looking and trustworthy platform. e) Security: Implement strong security measures to protect users' data, funds, and transactions from hacks, fraud, and other cyber threats. Make sure to follow best practices in securing online platforms and consult with cybersecurity professionals. f) Marketing: Develop a marketing strategy to attract users and convince them to utilize your investment site. Ensure to establish a strong brand presence that targets your specific audience through appropriate marketing channels, such as social media, search engine optimization (SEO), and online advertising. g) Customer support: Establish a reliable customer support system that provides users with responsive, helpful, and informative assistance when they have issues or questions about your platform.

But if you ask a doctor, he can see a whole lot more. Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails. There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University.

They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration. 3. Vertical lines, however, are generally not such a big deal.

The 165km stage came alive at the end as crosswinds split the peloton before Matthews held off Edvald Boasson Hagen. Froome leads by 18 seconds over Italy's Fabio Aru and 23 seconds over France's Romain Bardet with five stages to go. Marcel Kittel was dropped early on a bad day for his Quick-Step team after Dan Martin lost time on the leaders. Listen: Froome survives the wind The German sprinter was looking for his sixth stage win but Matthews' Sunweb team pulled hard to distance him, with the Australian also winning the intermediate sprint to move 29 points behind Kittel in the green jersey points classification. Ireland's Martin was caught behind a split on the run-in to Romans-sur-Isere and dropped to seventh overall as Britain's Simon Yates moved up to sixth and extended his lead in the best young rider's white jersey competition. Media playback is not supported on this device Matthews, who also won Saturday's stage 14, initially tried to leave Kittel behind by getting in a breakaway group during a frantic start after the roll-out in Le Puy-en-Velay. Those attempts failed but with the category three climb of Cote de Boussoulet coming early in the stage, Sunweb upped the pace and Kittel was soon visibly struggling, also lacking the help of key team-mate Philippe Gilbert, who pulled out before the start through illness. The green jersey leader never looked like bridging the gap as Sunweb ruthlessly drove on over the second and final climb of the day and down onto flatter terrain. An unchallenged Matthews took 20 points at the intermediate sprint before his team-mates then also helped rid the front group of sprint rivals Andre Greipel and Nacer Bouhanni as high winds split up the peloton inside the final 20km. The final drag saw BMC's Greg van Avermaet go early but Matthews had enough power to pass him and deny a surging Boasson Hagen and John Degenkolb on the line. Kittel rolled home easily within the time limit and still has stage 19 and the final stage in Paris to target victory. But as the form rider and with perhaps the form team in the race, Matthews could snatch a green jersey that had looked safe. Kittel's struggle had a disastrous knock-on effect for Quick-Step later in the stage as Julien Vermote and Zdenek Stybar dropped back to help their sprinter but also never made it back. It meant two of the most impressive riders of the Tour so far were not present when Martin slipped behind the other favourites, leaving an exhausted Jack Bauer to try in vain to bridge the gap. As a result, Martin - who has been battling a back injury since a crash involving Richie Porte on stage nine - lost 51 seconds and perhaps his chance of finishing on the podium. \\"I didn't have great legs today and the team was suffering,\\" Martin told ITV4. \\"We put a brave face on it at the start but we've had a few people sick.\\" Aru was also briefly caught behind a split but managed to recover, while South Africa's Louis Meintjes ended up in the same group as Martin and now trails Yates by nearly four minutes in the best young rider classification. Spain's Alberto Contador also dropped out of the top 10, while New Zealand's George Bennett - who started the day 12th overall - was forced to abandon through illness partway through the stage. Wednesday's stage 17 sees the race tackle two 'hors categorie' climbs, including the famous Col du Galibier, as the Tour finally reaches the Alps.

(Photo: Junfu Han, Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo The badly decomposed bodies of 11 infants were found in the ceiling of a former funeral home on Detroit's east side, Detroit police said. The remains were found late Friday afternoon by state investigators just hours after they received an anonymous letter explaining how to find the bodies carefully hidden inside the false ceiling, Detroit police said. The bodies had been hidden inside the former Cantrell Funeral Home at 10400 Mack Avenue at Garland, about 10 blocks east of the Indian Village neighborhood. The funeral home was closed by state authorities in April after they found numerous violations of state law. After the infants' bodies were uncovered, Michigan State Police used a cadaver-trained police dog to search the entire building, but no additional bodies were found, said Detroit police Lt. Brian Bowser. \\"We do have names for some of the remains and we're going to try to contact the families,\\" Bowser said. He said he was unable to say how long the remains had been stored there or how old they were. But he said he was upset \\"by the callousness\\" of whoever had placed the remains of infants, some of them apparently stillborn, inside a cardboard box hidden in the drop-down ceiling of a stairwell. Police want to speak to the former home's longtime owner, Raymond Cantrell, Bowser said. \\"Obviously, it was either an employee or someone who had knowledge\\" of the business and the building who hid the bodies, for unknown reasons, he added.

(Photo: Junfu Han, Detroit Free Press) The successor business of the shuttered funeral home in Detroit operates on Kelly Road in Eastpointe as Cantrell Funeral Services. That firm's answering service said none of the owners or managers were available to comment Friday night. The firm's website praises the former Detroit's home's longtime owner, Raymond Cantrell. The website says: \\"Our father, Raymond E. Cantrell, founder of Cantrell Funeral Home in Detroit, has provided excellent service for over 50 years. As the next generation of funeral directors, our goal is to continue in his footprints of quality, family-oriented and customer focused funeral service.\\" A spokesman for the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs confirmed Friday that state inspectors found the bodies. “We will use the evidence gathered today to add to our open investigation and will continue to work with local law enforcement as this case proceeds,” LARA communications director Jason Moon said in an email. In April, state investigators found that embalmed bodies had been stored for months in an unrefrigerated garage and other unsanitary areas, allowing them to deteriorate — one body was kept from January until April before it was cremated, according to state officials. The funeral home, which had operated for half a century, also had committed numerous other violations of state rules, such as the failure to deposit more than 21,000 in prepayments by at least 13 customers who'd signed contracts for future funeral services, according to the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulation. Also in April, state regulators suspended the funeral home's license and suspended the individual mortuary science license of the manager, Jameca LaJoyce Boone, according to state website.

Article: Chinese officials yesterday urged employers to take more measures to protect workers against workplace diseases and injuries. Experts estimate that about 200 million workers face a potential danger of occupational diseases and work-related injuries. The majority of them are farmers-turned-workers who are working in small or medium-sized firms. One of the most serious workplace diseases on the Chinese mainland is pneumoconiosis, a lung disease that is caused by breathing in too much dust of coal, silicon, and cerement. It causes serious breathing difficulties and can be fatal . The disease killed 966 people in the country last year, according to an official report released by the Ministry of Health yesterday. From the early 1950s until the end of last year, 607,570 people were diagnosed with pneumoconiosis. Among the number, 137,481 people died from the disease. Chen Xiaohong, vice minister of health, said the general level of prevention and control of workplace diseases is still quite low in China. \\"Health authorities at various levels will do more education work in the future to raise employers\` awareness that they are the first person responsible for any workplace diseases or accidents,\\" Chen said. He made the remark at a ceremony held by his ministry and other relevant departments under the State Council to award prizes to 56 companies which have done well in protecting workers\` health. On the Chinese mainland, more than 16 million companies are engaged in potentially dangerous sectors, such as coal mining, construction, and those that use chemicals, according to the Ministry of Health. Although many companies, especially large foreign-invested and State-owned ones, have done well in protecting workers\` health, many employees are still working in dangerous places with poor protection and without any insurance support.

Combine them to get: -42*q So the simplified equation is: -49*q - 119 = -42*q Step 2: Get all the q terms on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. Add 49*q to both sides to move all q terms to the right side: -119 = 7*q Step 3: Solve for q. Now, to isolate q, divide both sides by 7: q = -119 / 7 q = -17 So the solution for the equation -20*q - 29*q - 119 = -66*q + 24*q is q = -17."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Below is a detailed and long negative review: Title: Disappointing Experience at \\"The Food Haven\\" I recently decided to try out a new restaurant in town called \\"The Food Haven\\". Having heard about their supposedly amazing steaks and positive word-of-mouth reviews from friends, I was eager to check it out myself. Unfortunately, my experience left me feeling underwhelmed and dissatisfied. 1. The Food It all started with the appetizers. I ordered their \\"heritage bruschetta,\\" which boasted of a unique blend of tomatoes and other ingredients. Upon arrival, the dish looked fairly presentable but to my dismay, the bread was soggy, and the tomatoes weren't fresh at all. The burst of flavors I was expecting turned out to be a complete letdown. Moving on to the entrées, I ordered their much-talked-about steak with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked unevenly, with parts being well-done and some parts too rare for my liking — even though I had requested medium-rare. The garlic mashed potatoes tasted bland and lacked the creaminess one would expect. Overall, the food quality did not justify the extraordinarily high prices. 2. Service Sadly, the subpar food wasn't the only issue at \\"The Food Haven\\". The service we received paled in comparison to what is expected in a reputable restaurant. It took a long time to get a waiter's attention, and when we finally placed our orders, there was no acknowledgment or confirmation on their part. Additionally, the staff seemed untrained and unapologetic about our growing discontent. When I asked for additional seasoning to try and improve the flavors, it took them an excessive amount of time to return, clearly signaling a lack of efficiency and attention to customer needs. 3. Atmosphere Lastly, the ambiance at \\"The Food Haven\\" wasn't up to par. The lighting was too dim, making it difficult for us to read our menus and interact comfortably with each other. The seating arrangement was cramped, causing unnecessary disturbance every time other patrons or staff passed by. Moreover, the restaurant was quite noisy, which further detracted from the overall enjoyment of our dining experience. In conclusion, my visit to \\"The Food Haven\\" was genuinely disappointing. The restaurant failed to deliver on its promises of high-quality food, attentive service, and an enjoyable atmosphere. I cannot recommend it to others and will not be returning in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Specifically, it can be found on Calder Freeway. This motorsport circuit, renowned for its unique tri-oval design, was opened in 1987. The design was overseen by renowned motorsports promoter Bob Jane, inspired by his visit to the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina, USA. Being Australia's first purpose-built, high-banked oval, the Thunderdome was designed to host top-level racing, including the American NASCAR and AUSCAR series. The racetrack features a 1.8-kilometer (1.119-mile) quad-oval race track inspired by similar high-banked oval racing circuits in the United States and was intended primarily for NASCAR-style racing. The Thunderdome has hosted multiple motorsport events since its opening, but today, its activities are much more limited. Please check with the official venue or event operators for the latest schedule and activities. The Thunderdome's unique construction and annual events have made it a popular venue for motorsport enthusiasts from around Australia and the world. Even if current racing events are intermittent, the historical significance of the Calder Park Thunderdome remains. Start and end your visit with a plan in place because Calder Park is quite a bit away from the central city, and the travel time can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on where in Melbourne you are coming from and the traffic situation. So, to answer your question more directly, the Calder Park Thunderdome is a motorsports circuit located in the suburb of Calder Park, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - A dervish or darvesh (from , \\"Darvsh\\" via Turkish, , , \\"\\") is someone guiding a Sufi Muslim ascetic down a \\"path\\" or \\"Tariqah\\", known for their extreme poverty and austerity. Their focus is on the universal values of love and service, deserting the illusions of ego to reach God. In most Sufi orders, a dervish is known to practice dhikr through physical exertions or religious practices to attain the ecstatic trance to reach God. Their most common practice is Sama which is associated with Rumi. - Baku is the capital and largest city of Azerbaijan, as well as the largest city on the Caspian Sea and of the Caucasus region. Baku is located below sea level, which makes it the lowest lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world located below sea level. It is located on the southern shore of the Absheron Peninsula, alongside the Bay of Baku. At the beginning of 2009, Baku's urban population was estimated at just over two million people. Officially, about 25 percent of all inhabitants of the country live in Baku's metropolitan area. - Madrasa (\\",\\" pl. , \\"\\", ) is the Arabic word for any type of educational institution, whether secular or religious (of any religion). The word is variously transliterated \\"madrasah\\", \\"medresa\\", \\"madrassa\\", \\"madraza\\", \\"medrese\\", etc. In the West, the word usually refers to a specific type of religious school or college for the study of the Islamic religion, though this may not be the only subject studied. In countries like India, not all students in madrasas are Muslims; there is also a modern curriculum. - A talibé (also called \\"talibe\\", plural \\"talibés\\", Arabic, lib, \\"\\"student\\"\\", lit. \\"\\"seeker\\"\\"; pl. \\"ullb\\") is a boy, usually from Senegal, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali or Mauritania, who studies the Quran at a daara (West African equivalent of madrasa). This education is guided by a teacher known as a marabout. In most cases talibés leave their parents to stay in the daara. - Shirvan (from Tat: \\"irvan\\"), also spelled as Sharvn, Shirwan, Shervan, Sherwan and Šervn, is a historical region in the eastern Caucasus, known by this name in both Islamic and modern times. Today, the region is an industrially and agriculturally developed part of the Azerbaijan Republic that stretches between the western shores of the Caspian Sea and the Kura River and is centered on the Shirvan Plain. - The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area, variously classed as the world's largest lake or a full-fledged sea. It is in an endorheic basin (it has no outflows) located between Europe and Asia. It is bound by Kazakhstan to the northeast, Russia to the northwest, Azerbaijan to the west, Iran to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southeast. - A khanqah or khaniqah (also transliterated as khankahs , khaneqa, khanegah or khaneqah), also known as a ribat among other terms is a building designed specifically for gatherings of a Sufi brotherhood or \\"tariqa\\" and is a place for spiritual retreat and character reformation. In the past, and to a lesser extent nowadays, they often served as hospices for salik (Sufi travelers) and talibe (Islamic students). Khanqahs are very often found adjoined to dargahs (shrines of Sufi saints), mosques and madrasas (Islamic schools). - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, while having an 8 km border with Turkey in the north west. - The Absheron Peninsula is a peninsula in Azerbaijan. It is host to Baku, the biggest and the most populous city of the country, and also the Baku metropolitan area, with its satellite cities Sumqayit and Khyrdalan. - Shirvanshah, also spelled as Shrwn Shh or Sharwn Shh, was the title of the rulers of Shirvan, located in modern Azerbaijan, from the mid-9th century to the early 16th century. The title remained in a single family, the Yazidids, an originally Arab but gradually Persianized dynasty, although the later \\"Shirvanshahs\\" are also known as the Kasranids or Kaqanids. The Shirvanshah established a native state in Shirvan (located in modern Azerbaijan Republic). - Jall ad-Dn Muhammad Rm, also known as Jall ad-Dn Muhammad Balkh, Mevlânâ/Mawln (\\"our master\\"), Mevlevî/Mawlaw (\\"my master\\"), and more popularly simply as Rumi (30 September 1207 17 December 1273), was a 13th-century Persian Sunni Muslim poet, jurist, Islamic scholar, theologian, and Sufi mystic. Rumi's influence transcends national borders and ethnic divisions: Iranians, Tajiks, Turks, Greeks, Pashtuns, other Central Asian Muslims, and the Muslims of South Asia have greatly appreciated his spiritual legacy for the past seven centuries. His poems have been widely translated into many of the world's languages and transposed into various formats. Rumi has been described as the \\"most popular poet\\" and the \\"best selling poet\\" in the United States. - The Pir Huseyn Khanqah and Mausoleum lies along the left bank of Pirsaat River ( Pirsaatçay ) , 126 kilometers to the southwest of Baku . The inscription plaque over the portal , read by V. Kratchkovskaya in 1952 , announces that the khanqah ( dervish monastery ) was built by Sharaf al - Dawla wal - din Hasan during the reign of the Shirvanshah Afridhun Abul - Muzaffar Fariburz ( Fariburz III , 1225 - 1255 ) .

His tomb was rebuilt by ' Umar , son of Muhammad al - Shirzadi of Qazvin and completed in the year of 684 ( 1280 B.C.E. ) . '' It is likely that the tomb of Pir Husayn bin Ali , an Azeri sheikh of the Qalandari sect who lived in the 11th century , existed on this site before a formal khanqah was built around it in the 13th century . Built out of cut - stone , the roughly rectangular complex was centered on an open courtyard fortified with ramparts , similar to a ribat . The crenellated rampart walls were buttressed with round bastions at the corners and semi-circular bastions at the middle of the south , east and west walls . A monumental gate centered on the eastern wall gave access to the courtyard , which was surrounded with halls of different sizes to its north and west , including a mosque on the western wing and a single minaret near the northeastern corner . The Pir Husayn Khanqah was renowned for the glazed tiles covering the interior of the tomb and the sheikh 's sarcophagus , which had disappeared entirely by 1913 .

Context: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. Question: The manager probably believes that: Options: A. not enough information B.

Write a title for this article: With his star turn as an emotional, hug-happy leader in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, and his open embrace of President Obama in the days before the election, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey had been enjoying something of a romance with the American left. On Thursday, in the liberal lion’s den that is “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,” that flirtation seemed to be unofficially declared over. In his first appearance on the Comedy Central talk show — and fresh off a widely discussed cameo on another left-leaning television mainstay, “Saturday Night Live” — Mr. Christie, a Republican who supported Mitt Romney, endured a half-hour of grilling from the host about his political beliefs, his personal style and even a hug he recently received from Bruce Springsteen. “He said, ‘C’mon, gimme a hug,’ ” Mr. Christie recalled, sounding awed at the memory. “And I hugged him.” “And then did he go, ‘C’mon, stop, let me go’?” Mr. Stewart replied with a sly grin. The audience roared. Mr. Christie looked nonplused. The Springsteen banter gave way to an aggressive line of questioning from Mr. Stewart, who challenged the governor about his change of attitude toward the president in the days before and after Hurricane Sandy struck. “The week before the storm, you were out there: ‘President Obama couldn’t lead his way out of a paper bag,’ ” Mr. Stewart said. “And then right after the storm was over, you were like” — he adopted a robotic tone — “ ‘This man is a leader.’ ” Mr. Christie replied, “What it tells me is that people have different skill sets at different times.” Mr. Stewart shot back, “So he wasn’t a leader until you needed leadership?” With a smile, Mr. Christie said, “Maybe until he was presented with a stark opportunity to lead.” The interview, taped in Manhattan, also touched on Mr. Christie’s penchant for insulting political opponents. Mr. Stewart said he had planned to play a game with the governor: “Which of these quotes was from you, and which was from Don Rickles?” Mr. Christie retorted that Mr. Stewart could be guilty of “trying to categorize people very narrowly,” and he added, “You’ve been trying to do that a little bit with me here.” They eventually agreed that politicians should strive to be more genuine. Mr. Stewart told Mr. Christie that if he did so, “You and Hillary are going to have a hell of a battle in 2016.” At one point, Mr. Christie said his name-calling “doesn’t make me nonhumble, it makes me honest.” Explaining his attitude, the governor said, “If you are an idiot, I’m going to call you an idiot, and if you don’t like it, then stop acting like an idiot.” The audience laughed, and then Mr. Stewart offered his guest a suggestion: “You better write a Chris Christie’s ‘Chicken Soup for the Soul.’ ”","completion":"\\"Governor Chris Christie's Hug-Happy Adventures and Talks with Jon Stewart\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the background: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... and the situation: Two neighboring farms used different farming methods. Hill farm used GMO seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds. Answer the following question: Which farm used fewer herbicide-resistant seeds? A:","completion":"Valley farm used fewer herbicide-resistant seeds because they practiced organic farming methods and used non-GMO seeds. Organic farming typically avoids the use of genetically modified seeds, including those that have been engineered to be resistant to herbicides such as glyphosate. Hill farm, on the other hand, used GMO seeds and chemical inputs, which would likely include herbicide-resistant seeds."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

Article: Domestication of sheep and goats reached Egypt from the Near East possibly as early as 6,000 BC.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which is from further east in the United States, 3 Doors Down or Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros? The answer to this question is:","completion":"3 Doors Down hails from further east in the United States than Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. To understand this, let's delve into the details of each band, their origins, and the geographical locations associated with them. 3 Doors Down is an American rock band that was formed in 1996 in Escatawpa, Mississippi. Mississippi is located in the southeastern region of the United States and is part of the Deep South. It is bordered by the states of Alabama to the east and Louisiana to the west. Escatawpa specifically lies close to the eastern border of Mississippi and sits just north of the Gulf of Mexico. Given its southeastern positioning in the United States, 3 Doors Down has its roots firmly planted in the eastern portion of the country. Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, on the other hand, is an American indie folk band formed in 2007 in Los Angeles, California. California is situated on the western coast of the United States, along the Pacific Ocean. It is bordered by the states of Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east, and Arizona to the southeast. Los Angeles is located in the southern part of the state and serves as a major center of culture, finance, and entertainment in the country. While Los Angeles is undeniably a significant location in the United States, its position on the West Coast places Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros further west in the nation compared to 3 Doors Down. Taking into account the geographical origin of each band, we can conclude that 3 Doors Down, originating from Escatawpa, Mississippi, is further east in the United States than Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, who hail from Los Angeles, California. These two bands represent distinct musical styles and regions of the country, highlighting the diverse cultural and creative landscapes present throughout the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: It is found on scattered sandstone ridges in a shallow area in the northern Mid West and Pilbara regions of Western Australia where it grows in rocky soils. Step 2: Compare the structure of both sentences. Both sentences have a similar structure, starting with the subject \\"It\\" and following with the verb \\"is found.\\" They both mention the same locations, such as scattered sandstone ridges, shallow area, northern Mid West, and Pilbara regions of Western Australia, along with the same description of the plant growing in rocky soils. Step 3: Identify differences in punctuation and capitalization. The differences between the two sentences are minor: Sentence 1 has a comma before \\"where,\\" whereas Sentence 2 does not; and the term \\"mid-west\\" in Sentence 1 is hyphenated and not capitalized, while it is capitalized as \\"Mid West\\" in Sentence 2. Step 4: Analyze the impact of these differences on the overall meaning. The minor differences in punctuation and capitalization do not change the meaning of the sentence significantly. Both sentences convey the same information about the plant's growth and the locations where it can be found. Step 5: Make a conclusion. Based on the comparison, I can conclude that these two sentences are indeed paraphrases of each other, as they convey the same message with a very similar structure, and the differences in punctuation and capitalization do not affect the overall meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: The combination of burn damage, skin grafting, and/or surgery can leave you in a great deal of pain. Depending on the nature of your wound, you may be prescribed topical, oral, or injectable pain medications. Powerful pain medications can also lead to dependency — such as opioid addiction — so follow your dosing plan to the letter and report any problems to your doctor. Signs of addiction to pain medications can include changes in sleep patterns and daily habits; drowsiness or lethargy; reduced concern for basic hygiene; personality changes; weight loss and reduced appetite; and persistent flu-like symptoms. Both of these dressings help hydrate and protect burn wounds, and are frequently prescribed for a wide range of burn injuries. If your doctor prescribes one of them as part of your wound care regimen, make sure you fully understand how to apply and change them. Hydrocolloid dressings are simple, one-piece, sticky patches that provide a water-resistant barrier and a gel coating for the wound. Each patch can last for 3-5 days. These are more common for mild or moderate burns. Hydrogel dressings contain a hydrating polymer that must be wrapped loosely with a gauze bandage to remain in place. A single dressing can last for up to 4 days. They are more commonly prescribed for blistering wounds. It takes a lot of energy for your body to heal itself, so you need to provide it with additional healthy fuel while you recover. Protein is a great fuel for healing, so increase your intake of lean meats, nuts, beans, yogurt, eggs, tofu, and soy products. Vitamin A, vitamin C, and zinc can also help with wound healing. Increase your intake of fresh fruits and vegetables — especially citrus for vitamin C and dark leafy greens for vitamin A — and add seafood, fortified grains, and red meats for zinc. Your doctor may also recommend a multivitamin or similar nutritional supplement. Consult a registered dietician for help in crafting the best wound healing diet for you. As you heal from your burn, you may find that your mobility and coordination are impaired by tissue damage, nerve damage, scar tissue, and chronic pain. Regular sessions of physical therapy can help improve your quality of life as you recover. A burn to your palm, for instance, can cause permanent damage that requires extensive physical therapy and training to use your hand again. Also, even as your physical scars slowly begin to fade, the emotional scars of a traumatic burn injury can last for a long time. You may benefit from psychological therapy sessions with a licensed mental health professional, or perhaps by joining a support group for burn victims. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of this article would be that burn injuries can result in severe pain, requiring various types of pain medications. However, there is a risk of dependency on powerful medications, so strict adherence to dosing plans is crucial. Hydrocolloid and hydrogel dressings are commonly prescribed for burn wounds, with different application methods for each type.

Donald had an air conditioner while Derrick did not since","completion":"Donald had an air conditioner while Derrick did not since Derrick believed in living a more environmentally friendly lifestyle. Instead, Derrick relied on natural methods to keep his house cool, like cross-ventilation and the use of heat-resistant materials in its construction. Step 1: Establish the characters' personalities and beliefs I'm choosing to continue the story in a way that highlights the differences in values and lifestyles of Donald and Derrick. By doing so, I can create some interesting conversations and potential conflict between the characters later on. Step 2: Introduce a situation that will bring them together One sweltering summer day, Donald's air conditioner suddenly broke down, causing his house to become unbearably hot. With sweat trickling down his brow, he picked up the phone and called Derrick, seeking advice on how to survive the heat without his air conditioner. Derrick, always happy to help others embrace a greener lifestyle, gladly accepted Donald's invitation to come over and share his tips on staying cool naturally. Step 3: Explore the characters' limitations Derrick arrived at Donald's house armed with various materials to help him set up a more eco-friendly cooling system. However, as they went through Derrick's suggestions, Donald realized that most of the natural cooling strategies Derrick was proposing would require significant time, effort or modifications to his house. This made it difficult for them to come up with an immediate and viable solution. Step 4: Create some tension between the characters Frustrated by the heat and the lack of quick solutions, Donald and Derrick began arguing about the practicality of Derrick's eco-friendly philosophy. Derrick accused Donald of being wasteful and dependent on technology, while Donald criticized Derrick for being stubborn and unwilling to accept the conveniences of modern life. Step 5: Find a resolution After the heated exchange, both friends took a deep breath and decided to compromise. They agreed that while it was necessary to seek alternative ways to reduce energy consumption, some aspects of modern life could not be entirely dismissed. Derrick helped Donald set up a temporary cooling solution using fans and strategically placed wet towels, while Donald promised to look into more sustainable air conditioning options in the future. Step 6: Conclude the story As the sun set and the temperature dropped, Donald's house became more tolerable, allowing both friends to enjoy a relaxed evening together. They watched a documentary on climate change and discussed ways in which they could contribute to a better future for the planet. Despite their differences, their friendship was strengthened by their willingness to learn from one another and compromise in the pursuit of a shared goal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He quickly gets used to the city and its people, but finds it under curfew. When he shelters in a nearby tent, a witch (whom the audience later learns is Zenobia) summons a trio of ghouls, which emerge from a fire. Sinbad disposes of the ghouls. Meanwhile, Farah and Kassim's evil stepmother, Zenobia (Margaret Whiting), turn Kassim into a baboon (one of Harryhausen's stop-motion creations) just as he was going to be crowned caliph. If Kassim cannot regain his human form within seven moons, then Zenobia's son Rafi will be caliph instead. Sinbad meets with Farah, who believes Kassim's curse is one of Zenobia's spells. Sinbad, Farah, and the baboon Kassim set off to find the old Greek alchemist named Melanthius (Patrick Troughton), a hermit of on the island of Casgar, who is said to know how to break the spell. Zenobia and her son, Rafi (Kurt Christian), follow in a boat propelled by the robotic bronze Minoton, a magical creature created by the sorceress which looks like a Minotaur.

Controversy: Outcry after Dylan Mayer's catch of an octopus, seen proudly displayed in his arms, has launched a potential ban on their hunt statewide. National outcry over a 19-year-old Seattle diver who caught and killed an octopus while publically boasting of his kill has pressed lawmakers one step closer to banning their hunt potentially statewide. 'The harvesting of this animal has resulted in a strong, negative reaction from the public and the dive community,' Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Phil Anderson said in a release. 'We believe this area may merit additional restrictions to enhance the traditional uses of this popular beach.' Hunting octopus is legal in Central Puget Sound, with a maximum catch of one per day. But on October 31st, the sight of Dylan Mayer punching and beating the 30-pound female on shore before throwing it in his truck bed and driving off easily unnerved many residents. 'As they were coming in you could tell the octopus was alive. It was writhing around and they were wrestling with it,' said Bob Bailey, a dive instructor who witnessed Mayer bring the octopus on shore with one of his students. 'It's just not done. It's bad form. Even if you can do it, you shouldn't do it,’ he said. Local activists photographed Mayer's catch and posted the photos on their website, urging outraged residents to sign a petition banning the harvesting of giant Pacific octopuses. Scroll down for video. Fresh catch: Mr Mayer is photographed after loading the live cephalopod into the back of his pickup truck on October 31st. The animals are not protected and their population is said to be healthy. Seattle Times also reports Myers having had a permit to catch shellfish in the area. ‘I don't have an issue with hunting,’ Mr Bailey told the Seattle Times. ‘People dive for all sorts of reasons. I don't have a problem with it. It is not whether you hunt, it is where you hunt, and there are appropriate and inappropriate places to do that.’ But he added: ‘People come from all over the world to dive here and see the octopus that live here.’ Earlier this month Scott Lundy, a member of the Washington Scuba Alliance, presented the WDFW a petition signed by 5,000 divers supporting a ban on killing octopuses at Seacrest Park. It's a ban Mr Mayer has since latched onto himself. 'I didn’t know they were so beloved, or I wouldn’t have done it,' he said according to a WDFW release that reported him signing the petition as well. The new Marine Protected Area in Central Puget Sound will require the commission's vote for the new protected area and could take months. Food? Mr Mayer said he planned to eat to octopus and that catching it was no different than catching an eating a fish. Legal: Game wardens said the catch was completely legal and that the diver was within his rights to harvest the animal. Among their considerations are designating Seacrest Park as a marine protected area or prohibiting hunting the animals anywhere in the state. Angry fellow divers from the shore took. photographs of Mayer proudly standing with the large octopus and then. watched in disbelief as he and his friend tossed the still live 30 pound. female onto the bed of his truck before driving off. Their shock turned to horror as a. grinning Mayer posted images of himself measuring the now dead octopus. onto his Facebook account and now is in the position of having to. justify to the diving community why he hunted the gentle and intelligent. animal. 'I eat it for meat. It's no different than fishing. It's just a different animal,' said Mayer at the time to Komo News. Catching the octopus for a friend' s class assignment, requiring him to draw something from nature, he said:. 'He wanted me to get something from nature, so I got an octopus. I caught it, and then these divers came up and started yelling at me. I ignored them and ended up driving away.' 'They’re incredibly intelligent, curious, very playful,' said avid diver Drew Collins. The uproar caused by Mayer has led to the 19-year-old receiving dozens of threatening phone calls and abusive emails. The wannabe rescue diver has said that he has been demonized by the local scuba community and has had to deny claims that the octopus was sitting on eggs when he captured her. 'That's not true. There were no eggs under it, and we checked,' said Mayer. 'I even had a game warden come over and look at it, and even they said there was no problem with it.' Today, however, he says if he could go back to that day he would have done things differently. 'I probably would have gone at a different time. I probably would have gone to another area of Cove Two,' he said. Dylan Mayer measures out the dead octopus on the floor of his garage in Seattle. 'The bottom line is another octopus will move up into that area and take its place.' The. game warden who inspected the catch also said that despite doing. nothing wrong, Mayer could have acted with more sensitivity. 'I think the timing, manner and place where the harvest occurred may be the issue. It could have been done at a better time,' said Wendy Willette. 'It's like deer hunting. You don't kill a deer while kids are viewing it, and I think it's a similar problem here. You need to be sensitive to other drivers and people if you're going to be a sportsman.' Indeed, Mayer told Komo News that he has now been banned from several diver shops in the Seattle area because of the octopus hunt. He said that his dream of becoming a rescue-diver is in jeopardy because he has been banned from several diving schools because of his actions. Watch the video here:.

And how about insatiable bloodlust and multiple rows of serrated teeth? As it turns out, the shark from the Jaws movies has better favorability numbers than any politician included in the latest Washington Post-ABC News survey. Ditto for The Terminator. Same for Darth Vader. You can see it all this chart, which tracks the net favorability of presidential candidates (the favorable ratings minus the unfavorable ratings). It plots favorability ratings from the latest Post-ABC News and Quinnipiac polls against a survey we did of Internet users about their feelings toward four of Hollywood's favorite villains. Results for movie villains are from a Google Consumer Survey of 1,000 Google users from June 5 to June 7, 2015. Questions written by Christopher Ingraham. Surveys are conducted with Internet users visiting websites that partner with Google and are asked to complete survey questions before viewing the site’s content. The real-world surveys show that the overwhelming majority of presidential candidates are running negative favorability scores. Quinnipiac has Bernie Sanders at +1 overall, although that's partly because 62 percent of Americans say they haven't heard enough about him to form an opinion. The closest Republican is Marco Rubio — the same number of Americans say they view him positively as those who view him negatively, meaning his score nets out to exactly zero. Clinton and Obama are tied at -4. And it's all downhill from there, all the way down to Donald Trump. Only 15 percent of Americans view him favorably, compared to 71 percent who have a negative opinion. That gives him a net favorability of -56, more than twice as bad as the next-lowest candidate, Chris Christie, with his -26 score. To put some context behind these numbers, I ran a few Google Consumer Survey questions on famous movie villains. I worded them as similarly as possible to the Post survey for maximum comparability, although to be clear: We are comparing fictional people/robots/animals/wizards with real ones here, so let's try not to take any of this too seriously. PostTV breaks down what the newest Washington Post/ABC News poll means for both Republican candidates and Democrats. (Rebecca Schatz and Julio Negron/The Washington Post) Among the movie monsters, the Terminator polls best. This makes a certain amount of sense, since the most famous Terminator was played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who later gave a convincing performance as governor of California. (And the Terminator became a good guy.) Only one of the villains — Voldemort, the evil wizard from the Harry Potter series — has a lower favorability rating than some of the candidates. You'll recall that Voldemort killed Harry Potter's parents, fed his enemies to a giant snake, and tortured and killed muggles just for fun. But he's still polling better than Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Rick Santorum, Chris Christie and Donald Trump. The GOP field has become so large and unwieldy that Fox News is only allowing 10 candidates to participate in the first debate to be held this August. Fox could make things simpler by narrowing the field even further, allowing only the candidates who are currently polling better than Lord Voldemort. After all: How are you going to defeat ISIS on the battleground if you can't beat a fictional wizard without a nose? ||||| Q: (AMONG REPUBLICANS AND REPUBLICAN-LEANING INDEPENDENT ADULTS) Do you think (the Republican nominee for president should take only conservative positions on issues) or do you think (it is OK to have the Republican nominee for president take moderate positions on some issues)? ||||| Washington (CNN) More people have an unfavorable view of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton now than at any time since 2001, according to a new CNN/ORC poll on the 2016 race. While Clinton remains strikingly dominant in the Democratic field, the poll shows that her numbers have dropped significantly across several key indicators since she launched her campaign in April. A growing number of people say she is not honest and trustworthy (57%, up from 49% in March), less than half feel she cares about people like them (47%, down from 53% last July) and more now feel she does not inspire confidence (50%, up from 42% last March). In head-to-head match-ups against top Republicans, her margin is tighter than it has been at any point in CNN/ORC's polling on the contest. Pfeiffer: Clinton is going to have to engage the press Pfeiffer: Clinton is going to have to engage the press 05:02 Pfeiffer: Clinton is going to have to engage the press On the Republican side, though, no candidate has successfully broken out of the pack. Much of Clinton's fade is attributable to shifts among independents, but she's also losing some ground among her own partisans. Her support in the Democratic nomination contest has dropped 9 points since April, and though more than 8-in-10 Democrats said they thought she was honest and trustworthy earlier this year; now, just 73% say so. The new CNN/ORC poll looking at the shape of the race for the presidency in 2016 finds these warning signs for Clinton, alongside some concerns for the Republican Party's best-known contender, Jeb Bush. Jeb Bush's family ties Bush's efforts to separate himself from his brother have worked to some extent. Only about half of Americans say Bush is \\"a lot like his brother.\\" But most -- 56% -- say his connection to two former presidents would make them less likely to back him for the presidency. Just 27% say that connection would make them more likely to back the former Florida governor. JUST WATCHED Scott Walker jabs at Clinton over foundation claims Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Scott Walker jabs at Clinton over foundation claims 00:41 That's virtually the opposite situation of what his brother faced when George W. Bush made his initial run for the presidency in 1999. Back then, 42% said Bush's connection to his father made them more likely to back him, while only 24% said it was a deterrent. Bush's family ties are slightly more of a draw for Republicans, but not by much. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 42% say they're more likely to back Jeb Bush because of his connections, while 38% say they are less likely to vote for him because of that. No leader emerges in the GOP pack For the bulk of the GOP field, however, the race for the Republican nomination remains an effort to distinguish themselves from the pack and no one has yet succeeded at that. Though there has been some shuffling at the top of the GOP order since the last CNN/ORC poll in April, no individual candidate's movement lies outside of the margin of sampling error. Rubio tops the field with 14%, with Bush near even at 13%. Huckabee and Walker follow at 10% each, with Cruz (8%), Paul (8%) and Carson (7%) all within striking distance of double-digit support. Paul prompts the largest gender gap on the GOP side, drawing 13% and tying for first among men while garnering just 2% support among women. The top of the field is similar among conservative Republicans to the overall horse race numbers, but among those who consider themselves tea party supporters, there's a clear leader: Scott Walker with 19% support. His closest competitor is Ted Cruz with 12%. JUST WATCHED New Clinton challenger jumping into 2016 race Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New Clinton challenger jumping into 2016 race 02:01 Overall, about half of Republicans (49%) would like to see the field resolve early, saying it would be best for the party if one strong candidate emerged early as a clear frontrunner. But 46% say they would prefer a longer campaign, with a number of strong contenders competing over the next year. One possible differentiator emerges: The poll finds a distinct difference in which candidates Republicans view as representing the future rather than the past. Three-quarters of Republicans describe Marco Rubio (77%) or Scott Walker (75%) as representing the future, nearly 7-in-10 say so about Rand Paul (68%), but Bush (51%) and Christie (51%) are far less likely to be seen as representative of the future. The growing Democratic field Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say they would like a competitive primary (53% say that would be best for the party), but their preferences so far don't portend a close contest. Clinton continues to hold a massive lead in that race, with 60% of Democrats saying she would be their top choice for the nomination. Behind her, 14% would favor Vice President Joe Biden, and 10% prefer Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor who announced his candidacy on Saturday, barely registers with 1% support. Sanders does fare better among liberals than overall, carrying 18% support among that group, but Clinton still notches 61% among the liberals in her party. Getting closer to the general In general election match-ups, Clinton now runs about even with Rand Paul, Scott Walker and Marco Rubio, while she continues to top Bush and Ted Cruz by a significant margin. As noted above, those shifts stem largely from a change among independents, though Republicans appear to be solidifying their support for GOP candidates while Democrats are slightly less certain about Clinton. One feature of the race that has held even as the numbers shifted: These match-ups prompt enormous gender gaps. According to the poll, the gender gaps remain over 20 points in each of the five match-ups tested, including a whopping 34-point gender gap in Clinton's match-up with Scott Walker. Her declining support in those general election match-ups, alongside falling favorability ratings and worsening impressions of her, suggests recent news about her actions as secretary of state may have taken a toll.

A:","completion":"North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), has a unique government system that is often described as a totalitarian Stalinist dictatorship. The country is ruled under the principles of the Juche ideology, which emphasizes self-reliance, national independence, and socialism. The governing structure can be described under the following key elements: 1. One-party rule: North Korea is governed by the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), which is the only legal political party in the country. The WPK exercises complete control over the government, military, and all other major institutions. 2. Supreme leader: Since its founding, North Korea has been ruled by the Kim family, beginning with Kim Il-sung, followed by his son Kim Jong-il, and currently by his grandson Kim Jong-un. The supreme leader holds ultimate power in North Korea and makes all major decisions for the country. 3. Centralized control: The government maintains strict control over the country's political, economic, and social aspects. State-run media and education systems promote the official ideology and loyalty to the Kim family. 4. Juche ideology: Developed by Kim Il-sung, Juche stresses self-reliance and an independent course in foreign policy. It combines aspects of socialism, nationalism, and Korean culture. The ideology serves as the primary guiding principle for governance in North Korea. 5. Military-first policy: Known as Songun, this policy prioritizes the military's role and strength in North Korean society. The policy focuses on developing a robust defense capability to ensure the regime's survival and maintaining political stability. 6. Repression and human rights abuses: The North Korean government is known for its strict control over information, censorship, and extensive surveillance. Human rights abuses such as forced labor, public executions, and severe restrictions on freedom of movement are widely documented in the country. The government also operates a system of prison camps for political prisoners and dissidents. In summary, North Korea is governed by a highly centralized, one-party system that adheres to the Juche ideology, with the supreme leader holding ultimate authority over all aspects of the country's political, economic, and social life. The government is characterized by its focus on self-reliance, prioritization of military affairs, and significant human rights abuses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's start by writing down this equation: -19*q - 1604 = -1642. Step 2: Now, I'll add 1604 on both sides to isolate terms containing 'q' on one side. -19*q -1604 +1604 = -1642 + 1604, which simplifies to -19*q = -38 Step 3: To isolate q, I'll now divide both sides by -19 -19*q / -19 = -38 / -19 which finally gives us q = 2 Step 4: To check if the solution is correct, let's plug q = 2 back into the original equation: -19*2 - 1604 = -1642 This simplifies to -38 - 1604 = -1642, which is indeed correct.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago.

From an early age, Hill admired the local mobsters who socialized across the street from his home, including Paul Vario, a capo in the Lucchese crime family. In 1955, when Hill was 11 years old, he wandered into the cabstand across the street looking for a part-time after-school job. Context: Hill testified against his former associates to avoid a possible execution by his crew or going to prison for his crimes. His testimony led to 50 convictions. Jimmy Burke was given 20 years in prison for the 1978-79 Boston College point shaving scandal, involving fixing Boston College basketball games. Burke was also later sentenced to life in prison for the murder of scam artist Richard Eaton. Burke died of lung cancer while serving his life sentence, on April 13, 1996, at the age of 64. Paul Vario received four years for helping Henry Hill obtain a no-show job to get him paroled from prison. Vario was also later sentenced to ten years in prison for the extortion of air freight companies at JFK Airport. He died of respiratory failure on November 22, 1988, at age 73 while incarcerated in the FCI Federal Prison in Fort Worth. Hill, his wife Karen, and their two children (Gregg and Gina) entered the U.S. Marshals' Witness Protection Program in 1980, changed their names, and moved to undisclosed locations in Omaha, Nebraska; Independence, Kentucky; Redmond, Washington; and Seattle, Washington. In Seattle, Hill hosted backyard cookouts for his neighbors, and on one occasion, while under the influence of a combination of liquor and drugs, he revealed his true identity to his guests. To the ire of the federal marshals, they were forced to relocate him one final time to Sarasota, Florida. There, a few months had passed, and Hill repeated the same breach of security, causing the government to finally expel him from the Federal Witness Protection Program. Question: What did he do to get kicked out? Answer:","completion":"Henry Hill was kicked out of the U.S. Marshals' Witness Protection Program for breaching security protocols and revealing his true identity to others on multiple occasions. After being relocated to several undisclosed locations across the country, Hill found himself in Seattle, Washington, where he hosted backyard cookouts for his neighbors. While under the influence of liquor and drugs at one of these gatherings, he divulged his true identity to his guests, compromising his safety and his family's protection. This forced the federal marshals to relocate him one final time to Sarasota, Florida. In Sarasota, Hill made a similar mistake, again revealing his true identity to others after only a few months had passed. This repeated breach of security and the risks associated with his actions ultimately led the government to expel him from the Federal Witness Protection Program. The inability to keep his true identity a secret exposed not only Hill and his family to potential danger, but also placed a significant strain on the resources and efforts of the U.S. Marshals' Witness Protection Program."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The wonderful \\"Z\\" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film about six months or so after \\"Butterfly\\". I had such high hopes for the actress, and then she goes from bad to obviously WORSE in this film. Again, it was the 80's and I gotta tell you Harold Robbin's work had been eclipsed by smarter writers. Jacqueline Susann ripped into him (she hated his way of writing women), Irwin Shaw's work caught on with many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's and then came Jackie Collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books, even more so. Which is why this work smelt. Harold Robbin's work in the 80's just didn't catch on with audiences. Pia Zadora acting in one of Robbin's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire. The supporting cast was not a help either. Oooooh... this was awful to look at then and even 20 more years later, it looks even worse. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done. It would be tough for Pia to redeem herself as an actress (although John Waters casting her in \\"Hairspray\\" was a spark) although she has a nice singing voice.

Information: - The number and type of plants, how leafy they are, and how healthy they are. In places where foliage is dense and plants are growing quickly, the index is high, represented in dark green. Regions where few plants grow have a low vegetation index, shown in tan. The index is based on measurements taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAs Terra satellite. Areas where the satellite did not collect data are gray. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city. - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Afri (singular \\"Afer\\") was a Latin name for the inhabitants of Africa, referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya). Latin-speakers at first used \\"afer\\" as an adjective, meaning \\"of Africa\\". As a substantive, it denoted a native of \\"Africa\\", i. e., an African. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Trichoceridae, or winter crane flies, of the order Diptera are long, thin, delicate insects superficially similar in appearance to the Tipulidae, Tanyderidae, and Ptychopteridae. The presence of ocelli distinguishes the Trichoceridae from these other families. There are approximately 160 known species. The adults can be found flying in the fall and the spring and some are active even in the winter, hence their common name. They form dancing, loose swarms of mostly males. Adults can also be found resting inside caves and hollow logs. Larvae occur in moist habitats where they feed on decaying vegetable matter. They are of no economic importance. - The Tanyderidae , or primitive crane flies , of the order Diptera , are long , thin , delicate insects with spotted wings , superficially similar in appearance to some Tipulidae , Trichoceridae , and Ptychopteridae . Most species are restricted in distribution . They are found in many parts of the world , including North America , South America , Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various islands in the Pacific Ocean . Adults are usually found hanging from vegetation near streams . Larvae are found either in sandy stream margins or in wet , rotten wood . Fossil species are known . - A larva (plural \\"larvae\\" ) is a distinct juvenile form many animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle. - The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ('; ', ; \\"\\") is a peninsula in Egypt, situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, serving as a land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people. The bulk of the peninsula is divided administratively into two of Egypt's 27 governorates (with three more straddling the Suez Canal area). - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - The Ptychopteridae, phantom crane flies, are a small family (three extant genera) of nematocerous Diptera. Superficially similar in appearance to other \\"tipuloid\\" families, they lack the ocelli of the Trichoceridae, the five-branched radial vein of the Tanyderidae, and the two anal veins that reach the wing margins of the Tipulidae. They are usually allied with the Tanyderidae based on similarities of the mesonotal suture, this group being called the Ptychopteromorpha. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\". - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System. In a biogeographic sense, the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth's land surface. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Online banking, microwaving and connecting to WiFi among most 'essential' skills. Knitting, baking bread and writing letters no longer considered important. 2,000 adults polled in survey which listed knowing how to use Google as most needed skill. Article:","completion":"Title: Modern Life Skills: Online Banking, WiFi Connectivity and MicrowavingTop the List Introduction: In today's fast-paced digital world, the skills we deem essential have transformed significantly. According to a recent survey of 2,000 adults, knowledge in online banking, microwaving, and connecting to WiFi now rank among the most indispensable skills, while traditional abilities like knitting, baking bread, and writing letters have lost their importance. The Evolution of Essential Skills: The survey revealed that the most needed skill today is knowing how to use Google effectively. This highlights our increased reliance on search engines to find information instantly and how vital it is to navigate this digital tool efficiently. As more banking transactions have moved online, knowing how to manage one's finances through online banking platforms has become crucial. From transferring funds to paying bills, people are now expected to handle these tasks themselves, with minimal assistance from bank employees. Microwaving, a once frowned-upon method of cooking, now finds itself among the most essential skills, reflecting the growing preference for convenience and quick meal solutions. With hectic schedules and an increased focus on efficiency, people now value the ability to prepare a meal in mere minutes. Additionally, connecting to WiFi has become a fundamental skill as our day-to-day lives rely heavily on internet access – be it staying informed, working, or keeping in touch with loved ones. The Decline of Traditional Skills: While the rise of modern, tech-focused skills is expected, it has also led to the diminished importance of traditional skills. Knitting, once a valuable craft passed down through generations, no longer holds the same significance. Similarly, baking bread at home and writing letters have been replaced by buying ready-made products and instant messaging, respectively. Some may view this shift as a loss, lamenting the decline of these traditional skills. However, others argue that adaptation to the changing world is necessary. It comes down to prioritizing what helps us thrive in the modern era and allocate our time and resources accordingly. Conclusion: The evolution of essential skills reflects the changing landscape of our society, with a strong emphasis on digital capabilities. While we may miss the personal touch of handwritten letters or homemade bread, it is crucial to keep up with the times and stay relevant in today's world. Balancing both modern, digital skills and traditional practices will help us navigate this ever-evolving environment."},{"prompt":"Q: This task is about classifying the similarity of two sentences.

Article: March is women’s history month — to recognize the achievements of women everywhere, as well as to continue the work towards equality. While significant progress has been made in the United States, severe inequalities remain. For example, even though women make up nearly half of the U.S. workforce, and even after controlling for experience, education level, and age, men are paid more. The gender pay gap differs widely across industries and specific occupations. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed female weekly earnings as a percentage of male weekly earnings in full-time wage and salary jobs using data from the Bureau of Labor statistics. The 20 jobs with the lowest pay equity between men and women range from first-line supervisors of food preparation and serving workers, a job in which the typical woman earns 72.8% of male earnings, to personal financial advisors, a job in which women earn 55.6% of what men in the same job are paid. For reference, women across all such occupations earn 81.9% of male earnings. Click here to see the worst paying jobs for women. The occupations with the widest gender pay gaps tend to be high paying jobs overall. The median weekly wage for 16 of the 20 jobs on this list is greater than the national median of 832 a week. Finance industry jobs, which are often among the highest paid in the country, are well represented on this list. Researchers at the University of Chicago examined gender discrimination in the financial advisory industry. Not only are female employees at financial firms paid less than comparable male workers, but also according to the study, “When Harry Fired Sally: The Double Standard in Punishing Misconduct,” punishments for professional missteps are less forgiving for women than for men. Compared to men in similar roles, women financial advisors are less likely to misstep, such misconduct is less costly, and female advisors are less likely to be repeat offenders. Yet, women in the industry are not only paid less, but report harsher punishments, and are less likely to be hired after being fired. Gregor Matvos, associate professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth school of business, is one of the authors on the study. In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Matvos noted that the harsher punishments for women in this industry can partially feed into the wage gap. “If you walk a tighter margin, any mistake you make will potentially lead to you losing the job, preventing you from progressing in your career path.” The share of men and women in each occupation’s workforce also plays a role in the overall gender pay gap. Women are more represented in lower paying jobs. The share of female employees is lower than the nationwide average of 44.3% in 15 of the 20 highest paying jobs. At the same time, women are disproportionately represented in 14 of the 20 lowest paying full-time jobs. Research has shown females often face greater gender discrimination in male-dominated work environments. Yet, occupations in which women comprise a majority of the workforce are not immune to gross pay disparities. Women are the majority in nine of the 20 most unequal paying jobs for women. To determine the worst paying jobs for women, 24/7 Wall St. compared median weekly wages of men and women for 2016 in 120 full-time occupations from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, a program sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The worst paying jobs for women are the occupations where women earn the least compared to men in the same jobs. Total employment figures, the percentage of men and women in each occupation, and educational requirements also came from the BLS. We also considered inflation-adjusted median weekly wages and employment figures for each year from 2007 through 2016 from the CPS. Estimated annual compensation was calculated by multiplying the median weekly wage by 52. These are the worst paying jobs for women. ||||| Source: Thinkstock 20.

The typical woman working in the field earns less than 73 cents for every dollar the typical male in the same job earns. Women working as supervisors of food preparation and serving workers are at an additional disadvantage as the job is not especially high paying to begin with. The typical worker earns 27,456 annually, versus the estimated annual median salary across all occupations of 43,264.

Designers > Women’s earnings as pct. of men’s: 72.8% > Women’s median weekly earnings: 922 > Men’s median weekly earnings: 1,267 > Number of workers: 586,000 The broad employment category of designers includes graphic designers, floral designers, and industrial designers. Nearly an equal share of men and women are designers. The difference in compensation between men and women in the field, however, differs significantly. While the typical male designer brings home an estimated 65,884 a year, the typical female designer brings home only 47,944 a year. Compared to 2007, wages for female designers are up by 14.0%, well above the 5.2% growth for female wages across all full-time occupations. However, wages for men in the same position have risen faster, by 22.2% in the last 10 years. Source: Thinkstock 18.

Women comprise 37.5% of financial analysts, compared to their 44.3% share among all full-time workers nationwide. The gender wage gap tends to be wider in high-paying jobs. The typical financial analyst earns an estimated 79,300 annually, well above the estimated national annual salary of 43,264 A recent March 2017 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that following an incidence of misconduct, female advisers in the finance industry are 20% more likely to lose their jobs and 30% less likely to find new jobs relative to their male peers.

While more women work in the field than men, their salaries tend to be far lower. The profession is one of only 29 in the country where women’s median weekly pay is less than 75% of men’s pay. The weekly wage for the typical female lodging manager is up by 6.6% since 2007, compared to the 10-year growth of 5.2% for women in all full-time occupations. Wages dropped for all lodging workers last year, however, and the decline was worse for women than for men. While male weekly wages declined by 10%, female wages declined by 16%.

Bartenders > Women’s earnings as pct. of men’s: 71.0% > Women’s median weekly earnings: 498 > Men’s median weekly earnings: 701 > Number of workers: 253,000 In the service industry, bartending has one of the worst discrepancies in pay between men and women. The typical female bartender earns 71 cents for every dollar the typical male earns doing the same work. Part of the explanation could be hiring habits among more expensive establishments. According to a study of restaurants in New York by advocacy group Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, men are more likely to work in higher end, higher paying bars than women. There are just over a quarter million bartenders working in the United States, and almost half of them are women. |||||Summary:","completion":"March is Women's History Month, a time to recognize the achievements of women and work towards gender equality.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person whose work's increased value has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries?, using the article: Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute., what would be the answer ?

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What will Hercules the Second eat? The Steptoes have retired their horse - because the horse is lame, after having to pull the cart (and Harold) home from York, after the horse walked into the back of a removal van which then drove off - and plan to buy a new one with Albert's life savings of £80, putting £9 away for \\"emergencies\\". Harold sends Albert home and returns several hours later drunk and introduces Hercules the Second, a short sighted racing greyhound. Harold reveals to Albert that he purchased this from local gangster and loan shark Frankie Barrow for the £80 plus a further £200 owing on top. Furthermore, he plans to pay a small fortune to keep it fed on egg and steak. They eventually have to sell all of their possessions to have one final bet on their dog at the races to try to pay off the money they owe. When their dog loses, they just about lose hope when Albert brings up that he had saved £1,000 in a life insurance policy. Harold then schemes to get the money from his father by faking his death. They find an old mannequin among their collection of junk and fit it around Albert's body. They then call Dr. Popplewell, a known alcoholic doctor, who's drunk at the time of seeing Albert and he announces that Albert has died. Harold then brings home a coffin that he has been saving for the inevitable day that his father would actually die. Answer:","completion":"Hercules the Second, a short-sighted racing greyhound, will be fed on a diet of eggs and steak according to Harold's plans. After purchasing the greyhound from local gangster and loan shark Frankie Barrow for £80 and an additional £200 owed, Harold intends to spend a significant amount of money to keep Hercules the Second well-nourished and healthy with this high-protein diet. The egg and steak diet will likely help build muscle and possibly enhance the dog's performance on the race track, as both of these foods are rich in essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Greyhounds, just like any other dog breed, require high-quality food to maintain their health and well-being, even though their dietary requirements might be slightly different due to their unique physique and metabolism. Ensuring that Hercules the Second receives an appropriate diet will certainly be of paramount importance if the Steptoes want to see their new pet succeed on the racing track and hopefully help them pay off their mounting debts. However, it is important to note that solely feeding Hercules the Second on eggs and steak might not provide a balanced and varied diet as the dog might still miss out on other essential nutrients and vitamins. It would be recommended to consult with a veterinarian or an experienced dog nutritionist to ensure that Hercules the Second receives all the necessary nutrients and supplements for a healthy and active life. Of course, this would be an additional expense, but it might improve the dog's overall well-being and chances of success in racing events. In summary, according to the information provided in the article, Hercules the Second will eat a diet primarily composed of eggs and steak. This high-protein diet will likely contribute positively to the greyhound's health and performance on the race track. However, it is crucial to ensure the dog receives a balanced and varied diet based on proper guidance from experts in dog nutrition to ensure its overall well-being and chances of success in racing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:To be a good teacher, you need some of the _ of a good actor: you must be able to hold attention and interest of your students; you must be a clear speaker, with a good, strong, pleasing voice which is fully under your control; you must be able to act what you are teaching, in order to make its meaning clear. A good teacher doesn't sit still before his class; he stands all the time he is teaching; he walks about, using his arms, hands and fingers to help him in his explanations, and his face to express his feelings. Listen to him, and you will hear the loudness, the quality and musical note of his voice always changing according to what he is talking about. The fact that a good teacher has some of the gifts of a good actor doesn't mean he will indeed be able to act well on the stage, for there are very important differences between the teacher's work and the actor's. The actor has to speak words he has learnt by heart; he has to repeat exactly the same words each time he plays a certain part, even his movements and the ways in which he uses his voice are usually fixed beforehand. What he has to do is to make all these carefully learnt words seem natural on the stage. A good teacher works in quite a different way. His audience takes an active part in his play--they ask and answer questions, they obey orders, and if they don't understand something, they say so. The teacher therefore has to meet the needs of his audience. He can't learn his part by heart, because their brains couldn't keep discipline: they couldn't keep strictly to what another has written.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:If a person has to pee then their bladder is what? - tight - full - empty - stretchable - filled The best answer is A:","completion":"The best answer is \\"full.\\" When a person has to pee or urinate, it means that their urinary bladder is filled with urine, indicating that the capacity of the bladder has reached a point where it needs to be emptied. The sensation of needing to urinate is triggered by the bladder wall stretching as it fills up with urine. The urinary bladder is a hollow, muscle-lined, balloon-shaped organ that stores urine produced by the kidneys until it can be expelled from the body. As urine is produced, it passes through the ureters and into the bladder. As the bladder fills up, the smooth muscles within its walls stretch to accommodate the increasing volume. Once the bladder holds a certain volume of urine, typically around 300-400 milliliters (although it can vary depending on individual factors), it sends signals to the brain that it's time to urinate, creating the sensation of needing to pee. Regarding the other answer choices: - \\"Tight\\": The term 'tight' may not necessarily accurately describe a bladder that needs to be emptied, as it is mainly associated with tension or constriction, which is not what occurs as the bladder fills up with urine. The stretching and expansion of the bladder walls happen as they accommodate for the increasing volume of urine. - \\"Empty\\": When a person has to pee, their bladder is not empty; it's full of urine that needs to be released. - \\"Stretchable\\": While it's true that the bladder is stretchable, as its muscular walls expand and stretch to accommodate for the increasing volume of urine, this term doesn't describe the state of the bladder when a person has to pee. - \\"Filled\\": This term is similar to \\"full,\\" as it implies that the bladder contains urine that needs to be released. However, \\"full\\" could be considered a more accurate term, as it conveys that the bladder has reached its capacity and triggered the urge to urinate. \\"Filled\\" could simply mean that the bladder contains some amount of urine, not necessarily enough to prompt the need to pee."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. This seems like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luise's performance to be lackluster throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes. She stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice.

Answer the question...the iliad is an example of what type of literary work??","completion":"The Iliad, attributed to the ancient Greek poet Homer, is an example of an epic poem, which is a lengthy narrative that recounts and glorifies the deeds of legendary or historical heroes. It is a type of literary work that has been celebrated for centuries due to its grand scope, elaborate language, and exploration of profound themes. Written in dactylic hexameter, The Iliad concerns the events of the Trojan War, a legendary conflict between the Achaeans (Greeks) and the Trojans (inhabitants of the city of Troy). The poem specifically focuses on the final weeks of this ten-year war and highlights the personal conflicts and motivations of the various characters. The story unfolds with a dispute between two key Achaean leaders, King Agamemnon and the great warrior Achilles, which incurs the wrath of the gods and results in the tragedy of war and loss for both sides. Several features distinguish The Iliad as an epic poem: 1. Heroic narrative: The Iliad presents a story that involves larger-than-life heroes, such as Achilles, Hector, and Odysseus, who demonstrate exceptional courage, strength, and nobility. These characters embody the virtues and values of their respective societies and serve as examples for others to follow. 2. Supernatural elements: The Iliad is infused with the presence of gods and divine forces that play an influential role in shaping the events of the narrative. The gods often intervene in human affairs, often siding with various factions in the war, which emphasizes the theme of fate and the capricious nature of the divine. 3. Elevated language and style: As an epic poem, The Iliad employs an elevated, formal style of language that conveys the grandeur and majesty of the events it describes. Homer frequently uses extended similes, elaborate metaphors, and lengthy speeches to convey complex ideas and emotions. 4. In medias res: The Iliad begins 'in medias res' or in the middle of the action, immediately immersing readers in the events of the Trojan War. This technique creates an immediate sense of urgency and helps to emphasize the significance of the story. 5. Invocation of the Muse: The Iliad starts with an invocation of the Muse, a goddess traditionally associated with inspiring poetic creativity. This aspect underscores the connection between the poet and the divine source of inspiration, which lends authority to the poem's contents. 6. Vast scope: The Iliad encompasses a vast scope of characters, locations, historical events, and themes, which imparts a sense of grandeur, cultural depth, and historical importance. Overall, The Iliad stands as a seminal example of an epic poem, as it explores universal human experiences such as love, ambition, courage, and loss, while also addressing key questions related to the nature of heroism, destiny, and the role of the divine in human affairs. This masterful literary work, with its expansive narrative, vivid characters, and profound themes, has continued to resonate and inspire readers for centuries, establishing it as a timeless and transformative piece of world literature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write the next sentence. Jeffrey's pets have been plagued with illness. Joel's have not. Available choices: (a). Jeffrey 's pet food is fresh.. (b). Joel 's pet food is fresh..","completion":"Although both Jeffrey's and Joel's pets receive regular care, it is evident that their experiences significantly differ in terms of their health. Jeffrey's pets have been plagued with illness, constantly facing one health issue after another, while on the other hand, Joel's pets have remained remarkably healthy and illness-free up until this point. While there could be many factors contributing to this stark contrast, it is crucial to take a closer look at each pet owner's management practices to uncover any potential reasons behind the difference in outcomes. As it turns out, the freshness of their pet food could be playing a significant role in these experiences. In Jeffrey's case, his choice of pet food might not be optimally fresh, possibly containing subpar ingredients or even harmful pathogens that could weaken his pets' immune systems over time. It is essential to consider that lower-quality pet food often has low nutritional value, and the presence of harmful toxins could result in a higher susceptibility to diseases and health issues among his pets. On the contrary, Joel's choice of pet food seems to be providing his pets with a healthier and more invigorating diet. Joel's pet food is fresh, made with high-quality ingredients that offer a much-needed balance of essential nutrients. This freshness ensures that his pets benefit from robust immune systems and greater overall health, having a higher resistance against illnesses. Consequently, it becomes clear that the freshness of pet food plays a significant role in influencing the well-being of pets, ultimately allowing them to lead healthier and disease-free lives. The two contrasting scenarios of Jeffrey's and Joel's pets emphasize the importance of selecting fresh and high-quality pet food to promote good health and vitality. It is highly recommended that pet owners like Jeffrey pay close attention to the quality and freshness of the pet food they provide to mitigate the prevalence of illnesses among their pets. Identifying reputable pet food brands that prioritize nutritional value and freshness is crucial to improving the long-term well-being of beloved pets. By doing so, pet owners can ensure that their furry companions will not only thrive physically but also enjoy increased happiness and a better quality of life overall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plot title: Gravity Movie plot: Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a biomedical engineer from Lake Zurich, Illinois, is aboard the NASA space shuttle Explorer for her first space mission, STS-157. Veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is commanding his final mission. During a spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope, Mission Control in Houston warns the team about a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a cloud of debris in space. Mission Control orders that the mission be aborted and the crew begin re-entry immediately because the debris is speeding towards the shuttle. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter. High-speed debris from the Russian satellite strikes the Explorer and Hubble, detaching Stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. Kowalski, using a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), recovers Stone and they return to the Explorer. They discover that it has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew is dead. They decide to use the MMU to reach the International Space Station (ISS), which is in orbit about 1,450Â km (900Â mi) away. Kowalski estimates they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again. En route to the ISS, the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach the substantially damaged but still operational ISS, they see that its crew has evacuated in one of its two Soyuz modules. The parachute of the remaining Soyuz has deployed, rendering the capsule useless for returning to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Chinese space station Tiangong, 100Â km (60Â mi) away, in order to board a Chinese module to return safely to Earth. Out of air and maneuvering power, the two try to grab onto the ISS as they fly by. Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. Despite...

But Ms","completion":"Blackburn's family and friends were left reeling as they struggled to comprehend how the young woman they loved could have suffered such a brutal fate at the hands of someone she knew. The close-knit community of Mackay was also shaken by the tragic events that unfolded as the gripping court case played out over several weeks. During the trial, it was revealed that Peros and Blackburn had been involved in a tumultuous relationship in the past, though they had broken up several months before her murder. In the time leading up to her death, friends and family testified that Blackburn had expressed concerns for her safety and mentioned that Peros had been behaving erratically and had sent her threatening messages. The prosecution presented a strong case against Peros, including witness testimony, surveillance footage placing him at the scene, and damning forensic evidence that linked him to the gruesome crime. The defense, on the other hand, tried to argue that there was not enough evidence to pin the murder on Peros beyond a reasonable doubt and suggested that Blackburn may have had other enemies who could have been responsible for her death. However, as more evidence came to light and witnesses recounted the chilling events of that fateful night, it became increasingly clear to the jury that Peros was responsible for Blackburn's untimely death. After several days of deliberation, the jury returned a guilty verdict on both charges of murder and robbery with wounding. Shandee Blackburn's family sat in the courtroom with tears in their eyes as the verdict was read, and the gravity of the situation weighed heavy on their hearts. Her mother, Vicki Blackburn, bravely addressed the court during the sentencing hearing to give a victim impact statement. She spoke of the immense pain and loss her family had endured since losing Shandee and asked for the maximum sentence to be handed down to her daughter's killer. The judge, visibly moved by Mrs. Blackburn's words, sentenced John Peros to life in prison for the murder of Shandee Blackburn, with a non-parole period of 25 years for the additional robbery with wounding charge. As the sentence was handed down, there was a collective sigh of relief in the courtroom, but it did little to ease the heartache of the Blackburn family. In the years that followed, the Blackburns became vocal advocates for victims of domestic violence and campaigned for better support systems and resources for those affected by such terrible crimes. Though they would never fully recover from the pain of losing Shandee, the family took comfort in knowing that her death would not be in vain and that her story would serve as a crucial reminder of the devastating consequences of abusive relationships. As for John Peros, he remained behind bars, haunted daily by the life he had taken and the many lives he had shattered. As he sat in his cell each day, he would be forced to grapple with the fact that he had been found guilty of a heinous crime and would spend the rest of his life behind bars. Shandee Blackburn's story, like many others that ended too soon, would forever live on as a tale of tragedy and injustice that the people of Mackay and beyond would never forget."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If he asks if you've been to a certain restaurant, don't cut off the conversation by saying no; instead say that you've heard great things about it and ask questions about his experience. It's likely this is his way of asking you for a date! If he's teasing you, play along. Enjoy his playful personality. If you say \\"no\\" to any slightly offbeat idea he may have, you will look prudish, and not like someone he wants to hang out with. Don't be overly disagreeable right away--even if you disagree. If you find out that your favorite sports teams are arch rivals, or that you fall on opposite sides of the political spectrum, don't start a fight about it. Being playful about your differences is one thing, but getting on a soap box about your views will make you look stubborn and selfish. Men love women who have a great sense of humor and who are confident enough to show it off. Though this may not be the time for knock-knock jokes, don't be afraid to throw in a joke or two if the occasion is appropriate. Show that you can laugh at yourself. No man wants a woman who takes herself too seriously--showing that you can laugh at your own foibles will show not only that you have confidence, but that you're aware of your flaws. Men don't want a girl who is \\"too perfect\\" and this will make them feel more secure about themselves. Don't be afraid to show off your brains for fear of intimidating a man. If he's the right guy, he'll be attracted by how smart you are, and will want to spend more time picking your brain. Show him your knowledge of current events, historical figures, or even your witty analysis of pop culture. If you know what you're talking about, he'll be pleased to hear you pontificate about any subject. There's a difference between sounding smart and showing off. Avoid bragging about where you went to college, what you got on the SATs ten years ago, or any other information that may make it sound like you're floating your own boat. There are plenty of confident, funny, and smart women out there, but there is only one you. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there to show what makes you who you are. If it's appropriate, tell him a funny or interesting story from your past that will give him a sense of what kind of person you are and what kind of experiences have shaped your life. Don't be afraid to share your interests. If you're teaching yourself French or are learning to ride the unicycle, tell him about it. He'll be impressed that you're marching to the beat of your own drum and will be impressed by your zest for new things. Share something about your friends or family. While you want to avoid telling him that you can't wait to introduce him to Mom and Dad after you've just exchanged names, you can say a few things about who your family and friends are to show who has influenced you to be your best possible self. Part of attracting a man is keeping him interested. If the flame of love is glowing, you should add logs to the hearth! Though you can still play coy, make sure to exchange information before you leave if the attraction is mutual. You should avoid coming on too strong, but express an interest that will make the man see that you want to spend more time with him. You'd be surprised by how shy many men are, and how happy they are when women step up and take the initiative. Unfortunately, certain men may not be attracted to you no matter how hard you try. But don't sweat it--there are plenty of men out there, and you've made yourself a better person already by following these tips! If the man you're seeking doesn't recognize your new confidence, looks, or conversational skills, then someone else will come along who will never want to leave your side. Though you may try to attract a man with all your might, his heart may be taken. Even if he's not in a serious relationship, he may have had a recent heartbreak or could be pining for someone else, and there's nothing you can do to change that. If you're rejected, play it off. There's no need for waterworks or angry text messaging if your crush doesn't reciprocate your feelings. Hang tough and the right guy will come along!

Solve 17*k = -49 - 36 for k.","completion":"To solve the given equation, 17*k = -49 - 36, for k, you will need to isolate the variable k. Let's look at the steps to solve this equation: Step 1: Simplify the right side of the equation. The equation is 17*k = -49 - 36. We need to combine the constants on the right side. -49 - 36 = -85 So, now the equation becomes: 17*k = -85 Step 2: Solve for k. To solve for k, you will need to isolate k by either dividing by the coefficient of k or multiplying the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient. As k is being multiplied by 17, the appropriate operation to isolate k would be to divide. Therefore, divide both sides of the equation by 17: (17*k) / 17 = -85 / 17 This simplifies to: k = -5 So, the solution to the equation 17*k = -49 - 36 is k = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to. If I hadn’t have found his joke funny, he probably wouldn’t have asked me out on a date. I hope that answers your question. I know it wasn’t very…. eventful. The boyfriend was probably what?

Write an article based on this summary: Jump jockey-turned-leading flat rider Jim Crowley admits to missing the adrenalin rush provided by national hunt racing, but not the perilous lifestyle nor, I guess, the rather smaller pay packets. Article:","completion":"Title: The Unbridled Journey of Jim Crowley: From Jump Jockey to Leading Flat Rider Introduction Jim Crowley, a former jump jockey who made a successful transition to flat racing, has become one of the most recognized names in British horse racing. His journey began with the excitement of National Hunt racing, where the steeds are put through high-adrenaline steeplechasing, hurdling, and point-to-point races. Although Crowley's career now focuses on flat racing, he confesses that he misses the adrenaline rush from his previous experiences, while celebrating the safer path he's since chosen in the world of horse racing that also comes with higher monetary rewards. Transformation from National Hunt Racing Crowley's career in National Hunt racing was marked by adrenaline-fueled excitement and a sense of camaraderie with the spirited racehorses. Although it was an unforgettable experience, he decided to make a career-defining transition to flat racing. One of the main reasons for this change was the inherent risks involved in National Hunt racing. The dangerous jumps and the high-speed hurdles posed significant risks to both the jockeys and the horses, requiring unwavering courage and precise coordination between the rider and the steed. Crowley, realizing the high stakes of this form of racing, decided to prioritize his personal well-being while still pursuing his passion for the sport. New Heights in Flat Racing As a flat rider, Jim Crowley enjoyed a less perilous lifestyle and quickly discovered his talent as an esteemed flat jockey. In this domain of horse racing, the absence of racing's more precarious elements allowed Crowley to focus his unwavering determination into mastering the intricacies of flat racing. This dedication paid off, as he swiftly climbed the ranks, becoming one of the most distinguished jockeys in the British horse racing circuit. Increased Financial Rewards Apart from the increased safety, another advantage of Crowley's move to flat racing came in the form of higher earnings - both for the jockey and the horse owners. The prestigious flat races are known to bring in larger prize money, with winnings running into several million pounds each year. As Crowley's talent and fame grew within the world of flat racing, his financial rewards also multiplied substantially. This proves the old adage that success breeds success, as the high-profile horse owners were more likely to entrust their thoroughbreds with an already accomplished jockey. Candid Reflections on His Journey In interviews, Jim Crowley has spoken candidly about his journey, reflecting on the time spent in National Hunt racing and how it shaped him as a person and an athlete. He admits to missing the adrenaline rush that accompanied those high-stakes races but acknowledges the significant benefits of his decision to make the transition to flat racing. From improved safety for both himself and the horses to the financial rewards that followed his accomplishments, Crowley seeks solace in knowing that he made the right choice in taking a new direction in his career. Conclusion The journey of Jim Crowley from jump jockey to leading flat rider is a remarkable story of adaptation, courage, and dedication to his craft. Although it came with its challenges, his transition from the perilous National Hunt racing has ultimately led him to success, safety, and an improved quality of life. As he continues to carve his name in the annals of British horse racing, Crowley serves as an inspiration to those navigating their path in the pursuit of passion and achievement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

George left behind a vast fortune which, despite the efforts of many treasure hunters, has remained hidden and waiting for the rightful heir, who can solve the riddle of George's Legacy. The story follows Emma, a young woman recently fired from her job as a reporter in the city, as she returns to her small hometown of Willow Creek. As a child, Emma was captivated by the legends and stories surrounding George's hidden fortune. With nothing but time on her hands, Emma begins to dig deeper into the unsolved mystery. Through her research, she uncovers a riddle left by George in an old newspaper article about his hidden fortune: \\"How many children does George have? 3\\" However, despite the seemingly simple answer, there remained doubt since George's three children were estranged from their father and had lost contact years prior. For the town residents, it was nothing more than an unsolvable riddle. As Emma investigates further, she crosses paths with three members of the community - Jack, a local handyman, Mary, an attorney, and Luke, a struggling artist. They coincidentally discover that they are each connected to one of George's estranged children. They learn that the key to solving the riddle is to reunite the three lost siblings and set aside their differences to find their father's hidden treasure. Throughout the journey, they face numerous obstacles and challenges, including a greedy treasure hunter determined to solve the riddle himself and claim the fortune. As Emma, Jack, Mary, and Luke race against time to bring the siblings together, they form an unbreakable bond and come to realize that the treasure they sought was not merely financial gain, but a powerful message from George, about the importance of unity, forgiveness, and family. In the end, the three siblings solve the riddle - Emma reveals that George had not only left the fortune to his three children, but the treasure would only be unlocked if they can prove that they have forgiven their father and each other for their troubled pasts. The answer to riddle was a key hidden within the childhood memories they shared - a reminder of a simpler time when George's family was still united.

Given the question: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: What will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries? Options: - not enough information - they will have an increased risk of disease - they will enjoy their food more - they will be healthier than those who don't === The correct answer is The answer is:","completion":"they will have an increased risk of disease. The Mediterranean diet is diametrically opposite to the standard American diet. It consists of a large amount of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and uses olive oil instead of butter. It includes very little red meat but a lot of fish and white meat such as poultry. Eggs, cheese, and yogurt are eaten often, but not in large quantities. Sweets and desserts are not eaten everyday. The primary difference in this diet is the minimal consumption of processed food. The food is natural and wholesome. It is low in unhealthy fats and high in fiber and good fats such as omega-3 fatty acids. Eating this way keeps your weight in check and helps to stabilize your blood sugar levels. Also notable is the inclusion of a glass of red wine with meals. Red wine contains resveratrol, a compound that likely contributes to the reduction of heart disease. Several studies were conducted on senior citizens in Mediterranean countries who have been on their traditional diet all their lives. It was noticed that they were healthy and did not suffer from a multitude of ailments that plague seniors in countries where the diet is far removed from the Mediterranean diet. The Mediterranean diet has even been linked to a lower risk of cognitive decline. The intake of fatty fish, which is high in Omega-3, helps to maintain brain health. Also, antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables help to reduce inflammation in the body, including the brain, thus potentially delaying cognitive decline. Moreover, another crucial benefit of the Mediterranean diet is its effect on the heart. As it is rich in monounsaturated fats (mainly from olive oil) it helps prevent heart diseases. High fiber foods and legumes help lower the risk of heart disease as well. Studies have also shown reduced levels of LDL, the \\"bad\\" cholesterol when following this diet. However, we must remember that although diet is a critical part, it’s not the only part. The Mediterranean lifestyle also involves regular physical activity, sharing meals with others, and enjoying life. This holistic approach of diet together with an active and social lifestyle is the real magic behind the ‘Mediterranean’ way. In conclusion, the anit-aging benefits of the Mediterranean diet largely stem from its ability to improve our overall health. It contributes to a healthier heart, sharpened mind, more energy, and a higher quality of life as we age. So while this diet might not literally slow down the ticking clock, it can help you maintain good health as you age, which indirectly could mean you're \\"aging\\" better, healthier and can certainly help to extend your lifespan. Therefore, although the Mediterranean diet does not \\"slow aging\\" in the literal sense, it does help you keep healthy and energetic as you get older."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. More a snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time than your typical dragged out biopic, this fun and fabulous film has the look and feel of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would want in an indie-type film. I think the tendency would be to portray Bettie Page as some sort of sex vixen, like a Jayne Mansfield. But if you've truly looked carefully at Bettie's poses, she always looked happy. Not a \\"you wish you could get with me\\" haughty look, nor the \\"I'm just doing this because my acting career didn't work out\\" look of a porn star. And so, the ladies involved with this film (three female producers, a female writer/ director, female co-writer and the lovely Gretchen Mol, who I'm sure helped shape this role with her own sugary influence) really captured the idea of a sweet, somewhat naive, southern girl who really enjoyed having her photo taken and hoped that good ol' JC wouldn't be too upset with her. Gretchen Mol turns out a career high performance (she may just have the most perfect breasts ever), which I am happy about, because she did have the curse. Several years ago, she made the cover of Vanity Fair when no one really knew who she was, touting her as the next It-girl. And let's be frank, that was a bit presumptuous. I mean unfortunately she has never made it to Gwyneth status, though not for lack of talent. Making a few poor film choices when you are a pretty blonde in fickle Hollywood renders you forgettable I'm afraid. If this doesn't put her back on the A-list, well I'll be a monkey's uncle. Intensely private, Bettie herself has not seen the film yet. Bettie left the pinup party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Whatever floats your boat honey. You were one helluva woman. I hope you're happy wherever you are. Congratulations Mary Harron, you've done our cult idol justice. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive. The reviewer expresses a notable appreciation for the film's portrayal of Bettie Page, indicating enjoyment of its depiction of her as a happy, sweet, somewhat naive southern girl rather than leaning into the typical portrayal of such characters as sex vixens. The reviewer appears to have a profound respect for the authenticity of the character's presentation and credits the female-led team behind the film for this. Furthermore, the reviewer offers high praise for the actress Gretchen Mol, even going so far as to say she delivered a \\"career-high performance\\" and possessed the \\"most perfect breasts ever,\\" showing a significant appreciation for her contribution to the production. The reviewer also expresses hope that this film could uplift her career status, showcasing a strong positive sentiment towards the actress. Additionally, the reviewer accolades the film director, Mary Harron, stating, \\"Congratulations Mary Harron, you've done our cult idol justice,\\" reinforcing the positive sentiment of the review. The review does hint at a slightly negative sentiment when discussing Gretchen Mol’s past movie choices and how Hollywood can forget talented actresses because of those, but it's largely forgiving and hopeful for her future projects. Ultimately, the review expresses a deep appreciation for the film, its execution, and the cinematic portrayal of Bettie Page, underlining the strong favorable sentiment it conveys."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The pair had a physical confrontation at a home in the Angeles National Forest area north of Santa Clarita that led Medina to retreat to his bedroom alongside his girlfriend. Sutter then forced the door open, according to a Sheriff’s Department news release. “Suspect Medina stabbed victim Sutter once in the abdomen with a sword kept next to the bedroom door,” the release stated. Medina called 911 and stayed until authorities arrived. Homicide detectives took him into custody. Bell said Medina acted in self-defense. \\"He was not only defending himself, but a young lady who was an independent witness, who observed the entire incident and was present with unfortunate issue with the sword occurred,\\" Bell said.

Instead, it was comprised of numerous independent city-states, also known as \\"poleis,\\" each having its own form of governance. One of the most well-known examples is the city-state of Athens, which is often associated with the notion of democracy in ancient Greece. Athens became a democratic state around 508 BC under the leadership of Cleisthenes, who introduced a series of reforms that led to the establishment of the Athenian democracy. However, it is important to note that not all ancient Greek city-states had the same form of governance, with some being ruled by monarchies, oligarchies, or even tyrannies.

The myriad of issues I encountered during my time there left me with an overwhelming desire to share my grievances in the hopes that someone might heed my warning before planning their excursion to this establishment. Upon arrival, the first thing that struck me as disconcerting was the lack of attention to detail in terms of cleanliness. The entrance foyer was visibly dirty, with dust and debris scattered across the floor. This initial impression made me question the overall hygiene standards of \\"The Place\\" and instilled a sense of unease which unfortunately stayed with me throughout my visit. Next, I was aghast at the abysmal customer service I encountered. The staff seemed uninterested in addressing the needs of their patrons and appeared to be utterly overwhelmed by the sheer volume of customers. My simple inquiries were met with curt, dismissive answers, which only served to exacerbate my overall dissatisfaction. It was evident that the employees had not received adequate training, nor did they possess the essential customer service skills required to ensure a pleasant experience for their guests. As I ventured deeper into \\"The Place\\", it became increasingly apparent that the poor service and lack of cleanliness was not an isolated incident, but rather part of a larger pattern of neglect. The facilities were outdated, with several areas in dire need of repair or modernization. Furthermore, the overall design of the place did not seem to prioritize user experience, making it difficult to navigate and find essential amenities. The actual attractions and offerings of \\"The Place\\" were also woefully underwhelming.

Poor customer service, a lack of cleanliness, outdated facilities, and an unremarkable assortment of attractions marred what was supposed to be an enjoyable day out.

Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Armour thyroid is an animal-source thyroid replacement used in the treatment of hypothyroidism. It’s used as hormone replacement therapy for people with hypothyroidism. It is also used to reduce the size of goiters and to treat thyroid cancer. It is a natural mix of pig-derived thyroid hormones. It is measured as grains, and the doses range from ¼ grain to five grains. It is an alternative to synthetic, man-made thyroid hormone replacement. The symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, dry, coarse hair, hair loss, dry skin, wanting to sleep often, intolerance to cold, decreased heart rate, swelling of the thyroid gland (goiter), unexplained weight gain or difficulty losing weight, constipation, and depression. Since Armour thyroid is prescribed for hypothyroidism or associated conditions, you must go to your doctor. Hypothyroidism is diagnosed by symptoms and lab tests. Your doctor will perform a physical exam to check your thyroid. Your doctor will also take a medical history and have you provide a list of symptoms. Your doctor will also do lab tests, checking things like your thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). If your doctor believes you have need to undergo thyroid treatment, your doctor will discuss your options with you. If your doctor believes you need Armour thyroid, you will be started on the lowest dose, which is ¼ grain. You will be required to go back to the doctor in one to two months. The TSH levels will be remeasured every four to six weeks. Your doctor will look at your TSH levels and adjust the dosage of Armour thyroid so that the TSH values fall within a range between 0.5 and 4.0 mIU/L. Since the TSH level range is rather wide, you will need to keep track of your symptoms during the first few months of taking Armour thyroid. Keep aware of how you are feeling so you can talk to your doctor. Some people don’t feel well unless their TSH levels go below 1.0. Others feel much better with higher TSH levels. TSH levels can be very individualized, so your doctor will work with you to find the proper dosage. Keep up with any fatigue or wanting to sleep more, changes in your hair, dry skin, sensitivity to cold, swelling of the throat, unexplained weight gain or difficulty losing weight, constipation, and feelings of depression. Once your personal optimal dose of Armour thyroid is achieved, you will likely stay on this dosage level for life. This helps keep your TSH levels at the appropriate place. You should, however, be aware that the dosage required can change. This can happen because of disease, stress, menopause, injury, or trauma. Make certain you talk to your doctor about the level of Armour you take if you experience any of these events. For most people, taking their dose of Armour in the morning one hour before eating works best. However, some people do better taking Armour and any other thyroid HRT in the evening. The only way to know is to try Armour at different times. Talk to your physician about the best way to do this to avoid any unpleasant side effects or other problems. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses Armour thyroid, an animal-based thyroid hormone replacement therapy derived from pigs, commonly used to treat hypothyroidism, reduce goiter size, and address thyroid cancer. It explains how the medication is taken, the importance of working with a doctor to find the correct dosage through monitoring TSH levels and symptoms, and emphasizes the individualized nature of treatment.

Information: - Professional wrestling is a dramatized athletic performance inspired by competitive combat sports. Taking the form of live events held by touring promotions, it is a unique style of combat based on a combination of adopted styles, which include classical wrestling, catch wrestling and various forms of martial arts, as well as an innovative style based on grappling (holds/throws), striking, and aerialism. Various forms of weaponry are sometimes used. The content including match outcomes is choreographed and the combative actions and reactions are performed to appear violent without injuring the wrestlers. Before the 1980s, these facts were kept highly secret, after which they were openly declared. By and large, the true nature of the content is ignored by the performing promotion in official media in order to sustain and promote the willing suspension of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude. Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media (i.e., interviews) will often directly acknowledge the fictional nature of the spectacle, making the predetermined nature of the sport something of an open secret.

Her mother, Piret Koiv, was a social worker, and her father, Toivo Koiv, was an auto mechanic. Her parents separated when she was 16. Kerli has stated that when she wrote \\"Supergirl\\"--a song about domestic violence written for Utopia--she \\"put [herself] in [her] mother's body, and said things that [she] wished that [her mother] would've said to her dad when [she] was little\\". Context: In 2006, Kerli worked with producer, songwriter, and mixer David Maurice on an autobiographical set of songs, the first set of which were released on a self-titled EP in 2007. She finally released her debut album, titled Love Is Dead on July 8, 2008, following her debut single \\"Walking on Air\\" (which charted at number 75 on the European Hot 100.) and \\"Creepshow\\", a promotional single. \\"Creepshow\\" was featured in the TV series Fringe, The City, as well as in the video game Burnout Paradise. The music video for the song \\"Love Is Dead\\" was released on February 29, 2008 and the music video for \\"Walking on Air\\" premiered on MTV Overdrive on May 20, 2008. \\"Walking on Air\\" was downloaded 550,000 times when it was featured as iTunes' \\"Single of the Week\\", which was a record at the time. The song appeared twice on So You Think You Can Dance? as well in an advertisement for Fringe. Love Is Dead charted at number 126 on the Billboard 200 for the week of July 26. Later in 2008, she was selected to perform a song titled \\"When Nobody Loves You\\" for the video game 007: Quantum of Solace, as well as the song \\"Bulletproof\\" on the official soundtrack of Punisher: War Zone. In 2009, Kerli performed at the Estonian music festival Ollesummer in Tallinn. On September 10, 2009 Island Def Jam announced Kerli's iPhone application and the first song, Saima was released the following month.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What album title was taken from a passage in a Stephen King novel? Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping...

Russian police have launched an investigation after a bag containing 54 severed human hands was found near the Siberian city of Khabarovsk. According to the Siberian Times, a single hand was spotted first, then the bag containing the remains was discovered on an island in the Amur River. Photos that appear to be taken at the scene show the hands lined up in 27 matching pairs laid out in the snow. Investigators gave no clues as to who the hands might have belonged to, or why they were discarded. Bandages and hospital-style plastic shoe covers were reportedly found with the haul, and police have taken fingerprints from one of the hands, according to local media. Theories from local media as to why the hands were severed range from them being the result of punishment for theft, medical amputations, or the improperly discarded remains of cadavers dissected by medical students. The Amur River island where the bag was found is a popular fishing spot for people living in nearby Khabarovsk, a city of half a million people close to Russia’s southeastern border with China. ||||| Macabre bag containing 27 pairs of human hands found in bag on Amur River island.

GRAPHIC IMAGES https://t.co/eq2B1N1Pn9 pic.twitter.com/wJZqYveSPr — The Siberian Times (@siberian_times) March 8, 2018 A fisherman in Siberia made a grim discovery yesterday (March 8) while walking near the icy Amur River: 27 pairs of human hands, severed at the wrist and stuffed into a bag. Russian authorities said the hands were likely disposed of by a local forensics lab, bucking proper protocol. According to the Siberian Times, the fisherman found the bag of hands on a small river island near the city of Khabarovsk, Russia, located in the country's far southeast about 18.6 miles (30 kilometers) from the Chinese border. The Amur River is a popular local fishing destination, the Times reported. Initially, the fisherman saw only one hand sticking up out of the snow there, and discovered the full bag soon after. Photos taken at the scene and shared anonymously to Russian media reveal the discovery in brutal detail. In one image, the 54 hands lie in a haphazard pile in the snow like leathery catcher's mitts, seemingly upended from the bag; in another photo, the hands have been lined up in neat rows. [27 Oddest Medical Case Reports] While many social media spectators (naturally) suspect foul play, officials from the Investigative Committee of The Russian Federation — a government agency responsible for criminal investigations — have said that the hands appear to have been improperly disposed of by a forensics lab in Khabarovsk. \\"The biological objects (hands) found are not of a criminal origin,\\" the Investigative Committee wrote in a post (as translated) on the messaging app Telegram, \\"but were disposed of in a manner not provided for by law.\\" Indeed, medical bandages and plastic hospital-style shoes were discovered near the hands. According to the Siberian Times, it's not unheard of for forensics labs in Russia to cut off the hands of unknown corpses in order to retain fingerprint information after the rest of the body has been discarded. Despite this possible explanation, investigators have been able to lift fingerprints from only one of the 27 pairs of hands. Little is known about the hands' previous owners. \\"Based on the [investigation] results, a legal assessment will be made of the actions of officials of the forensic medical institution in the city of Khabarovsk responsible for the disposal of these biological objects,\\" the Investigative Committee wrote. This investigation is ongoing.

Hypothesis: The boat is upright .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the provided premise, we can attempt to analyze whether the hypothesis that the boat is upright can be inferred or supported. For this, we must consider the available information and any other factors that may influence the conclusion. Information from the premise: 1. A man is present on the boat. 2. He is wearing a black jacket. 3. He is looking over the railing of the boat. Now let's evaluate each detail: 1. The presence of a man on the boat: This may suggest that the boat is stable enough to support a person's weight without capsizing. However, it does not provide definitive evidence that the boat is upright. In certain situations, people can still be on a boat that has partially or fully capsized. 2. The man is wearing a black jacket: The color of the jacket does not provide any useful information to support the hypothesis. It is just a piece of clothing that does not impact the boat's orientation in any way. 3. Looking over the railing of the boat: If the man is looking over the railing of the boat, it is likely that the boat is steady enough for the person to focus on something outside the boat. This might imply that the boat is upright and stable, as it would be difficult for the man to look over the railing if the boat was capsized or significantly tilted. However, it is important to note that even in an unstable situation, a person might still be able to look over the railing of a boat, depending on their position relative to the boat's orientation and how they are maintaining their balance. Given these considerations, we can argue that the hypothesis is somewhat supported by the premise, as the available information suggests that the boat is likely to be stable and upright. However, it is important to acknowledge that there might be other factors at play that could alter the boat's orientation, which are not included in the premise. Therefore, while the hypothesis is likely to be true, it cannot be conclusively proven solely based on the presented premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: A. defecating B. pooping C. reduced D. becoming full E. gaining weight","completion":"D. becoming full Immediately after eating, you are most likely to experience the sensation of becoming full. This occurs due to the consumption of food, which fills up your stomach. As you eat, your stomach expands to accommodate the food, and this expansion activates stretch receptors in the stomach. These receptors send signals to your brain, which then interprets this information as a feeling of fullness. Becoming full is a critical mechanism in your body's ability to regulate food intake, as it helps prevent overeating by giving you a signal to stop eating when you have consumed enough. It is important to listen to your body's signals of fullness to maintain a healthy balance of energy intake and expenditure, and to avoid consuming excessive calories that may lead to weight gain over time. The other options listed do not immediately occur after eating: A. defecating: The process of digestion and the transit of food through the digestive system takes time. After you eat, it usually takes about 24 to 72 hours for food to pass through the entire system and be eliminated as waste. Defecating may not occur immediately after eating, but rather several hours, or even a day or two, later depending on the individual and the specific meal consumed. B. pooping: This term refers to the same process as defecating, and follows the same timeline as mentioned. It does not typically occur immediately after eating. C. reduced: This option does not seem as related to eating as the question implies and is difficult to interpret within the context given. E. gaining weight: While eating does contribute to weight gain over time if you consume more calories than you burn, you will not experience a noticeable increase in weight immediately after eating. Weight gain occurs as a result of a steady surplus of calories over time, as well as other factors such as hormonal changes and activity levels."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Q:Question: \\"Why can anyone decide to worship in any manner they desire in America?\\" Context: \\"The first amendment to the US Constitution states \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\\" The two parts, known as the \\"establishment clause\\" and the \\"free exercise clause\\" respectively, form the textual basis for the Supreme Court's interpretations of the \\"separation of church and state\\" doctrine. Three central concepts were derived from the 1st Amendment which became America's doctrine for church-state separation: no coercion in religious matters, no expectation to support a religion against one's will, and religious liberty encompasses all religions. In sum, citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith, any support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary, and all religions are equal in the eyes of the law with no special preference or favoritism.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"In America, anyone can decide to worship in any manner they desire primarily due to the First Amendment of the US Constitution. The First Amendment guarantees freedom of religion by including two key components, the \\"establishment clause\\" and the \\"free exercise clause.\\" These clauses form the foundation for the Supreme Court's interpretation of the \\"separation of church and state\\" doctrine, which safeguards religious liberty and ensures that the government does not interfere in religious matters. Three central concepts emerge from the First Amendment that shape America's doctrine for the separation of church and state: 1. No coercion in religious matters: The government cannot compel citizens to adhere to a specific religion or participate in religious practices against their will. This concept protects individuals' right to choose their faith and mode of worship without fear of government intervention. 2. No expectation to support a religion against one's will: Citizens cannot be forced to contribute financial or other support to a religious institution or cause they do not believe in. This principle ensures that people have the freedom to decide how and if they want to support religious organizations. 3. Religious liberty encompasses all religions: All religions are considered equal under the law, with no special preference or favoritism for any particular faith. This concept guarantees that individuals from various religious backgrounds and beliefs are afforded the same protections and rights as those of any other faith. In summary, the First Amendment to the US Constitution grants citizens the right to freely embrace or reject a religion, requires that any support for religious institutions or causes be voluntary, and maintains equal treatment for all religions under the law. These principles of religious freedom and separation of church and state enable Americans to choose how they wish to worship and practice their faith without government interference or coercion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"Why would a gorilla dominate all of the resources of a group?\\" with the following options: - anarchy - it needs them - Energy. - gene flow - competition - four limbs - frustration - enabling","completion":"Gorillas, much like many other animal species, engage in competition towards other members of their own species. This competitive drive is genetically ingrained within animals as a way to secure resources, reproductive rights, and overall survival. Resource domination demonstrates an individual's ability to protect and provide for potential mates and offspring, thus increasing the chances of an individual's genes being passed down through generations. When observing a gorilla dominating all the resources of a group, it is important to consider their hierarchical system. Gorillas typically have a social structure organized around a dominant male, known as a silverback, who leads and protects his group, known as a troop. Other gorillas within the troop are comprised of females, their offspring, and younger males. The primary reason for a gorilla dominating all of the resources of a group can be attributed to competition. In the context of the social dynamics within a gorilla troop, competition arises due to limited resources such as food, shelter, and mating opportunities. The dominant silverback must maintain control over these resources to ensure his status and reproductive success. Moreover, younger male gorillas within the group may challenge the silverback’s dominance, making resource domination even more critical to the existing dominant male. Having control over resources enables the silverback to provide for his group, thus securing the well-being and safety of the troop. By dominating resources, the silverback also demonstrates strength and capability, which in turn attracts potential mates and helps maintain order within the group. Female gorillas are more likely to choose a silverback that can protect and care for them and their offspring, and ensuring control over resources plays a significant role in this decision-making process. Another reason for resource domination is the fact that gorillas do need these resources to sustain their energy levels. Gorillas have a predominantly herbivorous diet that consists of leaves, stems, fruit, and occasionally ants and termites. Ensuring that sufficient food resources are available plays a vital role in the health of the group and allows them to maintain the strength necessary for survival. Lastly, gene flow can be related to gorilla resource domination, as the transmission of genetic variation from one population to another can help in the adaptation and survival of the species. Dominating resources within a group may contribute to gene flow by ensuring that the most fit and successful members of the gorilla population are the ones contributing to the next generation. In conclusion, given the facts and options provided, the answer to the question \\"Why would a gorilla dominate all of the resources of a group?\\" is competition. Dominating resources is a direct result of competition within and between gorilla groups for access to valuable resources, which, in turn, ensures the overall survival, reproductive success, and gene flow of the species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that had to change plans when money was withheld? , can you please find it? The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.

Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

Both sentences convey the same meaning, but they are worded differently, which is the purpose of paraphrasing. To understand and analyze the changes between the original sentence and the paraphrased sentence, let's break them down. Original Sentence: \\"During 1942, \\"Whitehall\\" was \\"adopted\\" by the national community of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in a Warship Week civil savings campaign.\\" Paraphrased Sentence: \\"In 1942, \\"Whitehall\\" was adopted by the civil community of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in a national savings campaign of the warship-week.\\" Below, some of the changes made are elaborated upon: 1. \\"During 1942\\" in the original sentence has been paraphrased to \\"In 1942\\" in the second sentence. Both phrases convey the same period when the event occurred, the year 1942. 2. The original sentence refers to the \\"national community of Cheltenham\\" and the paraphrased sentence mentions the \\"civil community of Cheltenham.\\" Although \\"national\\" and \\"civil\\" are not exactly synonymous, in this context, both words still convey the idea of a collective group of people residing in Cheltenham. 3. The original sentence uses the term \\"Warship Week civil savings campaign\\" to describe the purpose and context of the adoption of \\"Whitehall.\\" In the paraphrased sentence, this same idea is portrayed as \\"national savings campaign of the warship-week.\\" This change in phrase structure still expresses the same event - a campaign related to warship week and involving savings but presented differently. In conclusion, these two sentences are indeed paraphrases, as they convey the same overall meaning through varied sentence structure and wording.

Write some highlights for the following article: A grand jury has indicted a northern California couple accused of holding Jaycee Dugard captive for nearly two decades, authorities said Friday. Phillip and Nancy Garrido face 18 counts, including kidnapping, rape and false imprisonment. They are also accused of possessing child pornography. Both had previously pleaded not guilty to 29 felony counts in the case. Dugard was 11 years old when she was snatched in 1991 from the street in front of her home in South Lake Tahoe, California. Authorities say the Garridos held Dugard in a hidden compound behind their home for 18 years. She was 29 when she was found in August 2009 at the Garridos' home in Antioch, about 120 miles from her house. Nancy Garrido's lawyers on Friday entered a plea of not guilty on her behalf to the revised charges. Proceedings against her husband have been suspended to determine whether he is mentally competent to stand trial. The indictment, filed September 21 in El Dorado Superior Court, allows the prosecution to circumvent a preliminary hearing, at which Dugard might have testified in open court. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for November 4. The indictment came to light during a scheduled hearing Friday, at which the Garridos were present. They sat just a few chairs apart and showed little emotion as they spoke to their lawyers and listened to the judge. \\"There's a number of reasons why we might use a grand jury,\\" El Dorado County District Attorney Vern Pierson later told reporters outside the courthouse. \\"One obvious reason is that sometimes given the publicity in a case, it's a better way to get the case to a final conclusion and move it along to trial.\\" Stephen Tapson, Nancy Garrido's attorney, said he did not imagine a trial would start before the end of next year. He also said he believed that Dugard testified before the grand jury. Garrido, a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest, is accused of fathering two daughters with Dugard during her captivity. Dugard now lives in seclusion with her mother, Terry Probyn, and Dugard's two daughters. Officials have said Dugard does not want to speak to Garrido or his attorneys, and authorities have tried to keep her location a secret. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Please answer a question about the following article about Time: Time appears to have a direction—the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet for the most part the laws of physics do not specify an arrow of time, and allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. This is generally a consequence of time being modeled by a parameter in the system being analyzed, where there is no \\"proper time\\": the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary. Examples of this include the Second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy must increase over time (see Entropy); the cosmological arrow of time, which points away from the Big Bang, CPT symmetry, and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only traveling forwards in time (see light cone). In particle physics, the violation of CP symmetry implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve CPT symmetry as stated above.

Tiffany performs the same reaction with no catalyst present. Could Tiffany change other aspects of her reaction besides adding a catalyst to influence its rate, yes or no? Hint: A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction. The presence of a catalyst is one of several factors that influence the rate of chemical reactions. (Other factors include the temperature, concentration, and surface area of reactants.) A catalyst isn’t a reactant in the chemical reaction it speeds up. As a result, it isn’t changed or used up in the reaction, so it can go on to catalyze many more reactions. A:","completion":"Yes, Tiffany can change other aspects of her reaction besides adding a catalyst to influence its rate. There are several factors that can affect the rate of a chemical reaction, in which some of them are: 1. Temperature: Increasing the temperature typically increases the rate of a chemical reaction. This is because, at higher temperatures, reactant molecules possess more kinetic energy and move faster, colliding more frequently and with greater energy. This results in a higher probability of effective collisions and subsequent formation of products. 2. Concentration: By increasing the concentration of reactants, the frequency of collisions between molecules also increases. This leads to a higher likelihood of successful collisions and ultimately results in a faster reaction rate. 3. Surface area: The rate of a chemical reaction can also be affected by the surface area of the reactants, particularly for heterogeneous reactions involving solid reactants. Increasing the surface area of a reactant increases the number of available contact points for the reaction to occur, resulting in more frequent collisions and a faster overall reaction rate. 4. Pressure: In reactions involving gases, increasing the pressure can increase the rate of reaction. As pressure increases, gas particles are forced closer together, leading to an increase in the frequency of collisions and hence a faster reaction rate. 5. Using different reactant forms: Sometimes, using different forms of reactants can influence the rate of reaction. For example, using a powdered solid reactant instead of a large chunk of the same material can increase the reaction rate due to the enhanced surface area. 6. Light: Certain chemical reactions, such as photosynthesis, are influenced by the presence of light. The rate of these reactions can be affected by the intensity, duration, and wavelength of the light source. To summarize, although Tiffany is not using a catalyst in her reaction, she can still manipulate other factors such as temperature, concentration, surface area, pressure, reactant forms, and light to influence the rate of her reaction. By doing so, she can potentially achieve a desired rate of reaction even in the absence of a catalyst."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize: As the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing opened, its Republican chairman also warned: \\"We are all targets of a sophisticated and capable adversary.\\" US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to help Donald Trump win in November by damaging Hillary Clinton. But Russian President Vladimir Putin again flatly denied the allegations. In the committee's opening remarks, ranking Democrat Mark Warner said \\"Russia sought to hijack our democratic process\\" by employing a disinformation campaign on social media. He described it as \\"Russian propaganda on steroids... designed to poison the national conversation in America\\". Mr Warner said Thursday's session would examine how Russia may have used technology to spread disinformation in the US, including the possible generation of fake news for voters in key states, such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Embarrassing \\"stolen information\\" was released through websites such as Wikileaks, Mr Warner said, to \\"cause maximum damage to one candidate\\" - Hillary Clinton. \\"They did this with an unprecedented level of sophistication,\\" he said. Senator Marco Rubio told the panel that members of his former presidential campaign staff were unsuccessfully targeted by unknown Russian web addresses as recently as Wednesday. Mr Rubio's campaign staff had previously been targeted in July 2016. The lawmakers also suggested Russian influence may have affected Britain's Brexit vote last year, and warned that forthcoming elections in France and Germany were the Kremlin's next targets. Committee chairman Richard Burr, a Republican, said \\"if we politicise this, our efforts will likely fail\\". But Clinton Watts, a homeland security expert testifying before the committee, said the Russians had successfully exploited US political divisions. \\"They win because they play both sides,\\" he said. Mr Watts said pro-Russian social media accounts continue to tweet at President Trump during times they know he is online, hoping he will read and cite fake news reports. He also testified that several Russians tied to the investigation had been killed in recent months in Russia and in Western countries, adding \\"follow the dead bodies\\". Former National Security Agency director Keith Alexander also testified on Thursday, saying that Russia was attempting to drive a wedge between US political parties and \\"destroy our unity\\". Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, is to appear next week before the committee. In a joint press conference earlier this week, both Mr Burr and Mr Warner pledged not to shy away from the truth. When asked if he had seen any links between Mr Trump and Russian interference, Mr Burr said: \\"We know that our challenge is to answer that question for the American people.\\" He also said that there had been \\"conversations\\" about interviewing Michael Flynn - who was sacked by Mr Trump as national security adviser for misleading the vice-president over his contacts with the Russian ambassador - but his appearance is not confirmed. The Trump presidency has been unable to shake off allegations that members of its team colluded with Russian officials during the election campaign. The president regularly dismisses the claims as \\"fake news\\" and Russia has also ridiculed the allegations. President Putin did so again on Thursday at an Arctic forum, describing them as \\"nonsense\\" and \\"irresponsible\\". He also said he would also like to meet President Trump at an Arctic nations summit in Finland in May. Mr Burr was a security adviser to the Trump campaign but insists he remains objective. Another congressional inquiry into the matter, by the House Intelligence Committee, has been beset by partisan disputes. Ranking Democrat Adam Schiff has called on panel chairman Devin Nunes to remove himself, after accusing him of colluding with the White House. Last week, Mr Nunes went straight to the White House after hearing allegations about surveillance of Mr Trump's team, rather than sharing them with Democratic colleagues on the panel. He later apologised but insists he remains an objective chairman and will not step down. As well as the two houses of Congress, the FBI is investigating the matter.

The last semester I was enrolled in ( Fall of 2007 ) my father paid my tuition in advance , again to keep my classes while the Financial Aid department took their sweet time putting my loan through , which I suspect got lost just like my current loan . The woman working at the Bursar that time told my father that the loan would still be processed and that he would receive a refund check in the mail for the amount he paid on his credit card . The interest rates on credit cards , as you must know , are much higher than that of a Federal Stafford loan . Answer the following question: Why did they take out a loan ?","completion":"The individual took out a loan, specifically a Federal Stafford loan, due to several reasons, which I will elaborate upon in detail below: 1. Financial aid delays: The individual seems to have faced issues with the Financial Aid department at their educational institution, which led to delays in processing their loans. This, in turn, required them to secure funding through alternative means to ensure that their classes were not jeopardized or dropped due to non-payment of tuition fees. 2. Lower interest rates: Federal Stafford loans tend to have significantly lower interest rates compared to credit card loans. Credit card interest rates can be quite high, which makes it a less attractive option for financing tuition fees for the individual. Opting for a Federal Stafford loan ensures that they can secure their education at a lower cost, as it reduces the long-term financial burden associated with repaying the debt. 3. Affordable repayment options: Stafford loans offer flexible repayment plans that take into account the individual's financial situation and income. This allows the borrower to manage their loan repayment more efficiently, without putting undue stress on their finances. Credit card repayment options may not offer the same level of flexibility in terms of amount and tenure. 4. Education-focused borrowing: Federal Stafford loans are designed specifically for funding educational expenses. The loan terms are generally more favorable for students compared to other forms of loans, such as credit cards or personal loans that are not specifically tailored for educational purposes. The funds can be used to cover tuition fees, books, and other education-related expenses, making it a more suitable option for the individual's needs. 5. Grace period: Stafford loans offer a grace period after graduation or dropping below half-time enrollment status, during which the borrower is not required to make loan repayments. This provides the individual time to secure employment or other sources of income before they need to begin repaying their loan. Credit cards, on the other hand, typically require immediate repayment and do not offer a similar grace period. In conclusion, the individual decided to take out a Federal Stafford loan due to past experiences with the Financial Aid department's delay in processing their loan, lower interest rates compared to credit cards, more affordable and flexible repayment options, education-specific funding, and a grace period post-graduation.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? A. no; B. yes;","completion":"A. no; The primary disadvantage of using timestamps revolves around the potential for collisions, synchronization, and accuracy degradation. Timestamps require accurate and synchronized time sources across systems. When different systems possess varying time sources, there is a risk of identifying and synchronizing concurrent events. Inaccuracies in timestamps can lead to incorrect assessments of event chronology in distributed systems. For instance, when two separate events have the same timestamp, it becomes difficult to distinguish which event occurred first, leading to potential data inconsistencies, overwrites, or loss. Additionally, if a system experiences even minor inaccuracies in time measurement, it can compound over multiple events, resulting in a degradation of system accuracy and reliability. The primary advantage of using timestamps is that they serve as an essential and broadly compatible means of detailing the chronological order of events within a system. Timestamps provide a wealth of data that can enrich analysis and increase the understanding of existing processes. They are a reliable tool for tracking and recording events in a data-driven environment, making it easier to monitor, trace, and verify occurrences within a system. Moreover, timestamps can be used for various purposes, such as identifying anomalies, detecting data breaches, optimizing performance, and coordinating distributed systems. This helps in maintaining system integrity and allows for smooth and efficient operations. Another enticing benefit is that timestamps can be derived from universally understood concepts such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), allowing for easier data synchronization and management across globally distributed systems. These two questions are not paraphrases of each other as they inquire about two distinct aspects of timestamps: their primary disadvantage and their primary advantage. While they both relate to the use of timestamps, each question seeks an independent answer that discusses a separate facet of the functionality and limitations presented by timestamps."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Much has been said and written recently about heroes, mainly because many people think we have too few of them. There are many different kinds of heroes, but they all seem to have two things in common. First, heroes, by their actions, show the great possibilities of human nature. Second, heroes can also stand the test of time, and their achievements will not be easily forgotten. Because of these good points, we need to choose our heroes carefully. Olympic sports star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who is believed to be a hero, warns young people to be careful of making athletes heroes. She hopes that if someone tries to copy her, it will be because she has achieved her goals by working hard. Joyner-Kersee says that a hero should be someone who has an influence on another person's life. Poet Maya Angelou believes that a hero encourages people to treat others well and to be concerned about the greater good. A hero should show politeness, courage, patience, and strength all the time. A hero should encourage others to follow him with actions that improve the world, even if only in small ways. Author Daniel Boorstin suggests that, \\" _ are people who make news, but heroes are people who make history.\\" Thus, if a person is truly worthy to be called a hero, he or she will not be soon forgotten. We all need heroes. We need to be able to respect people who have been there, done that, and succeeded. Many times the greatest heroes are the people we deal with every day -- relatives , friends, and neighbors -- who will keep going when it is easier to give up. The parent who puts her or his family ahead of herself or himself, the teacher who will make more money at another job but chooses to help others -- all these people can be considered as heroes. A hero quietly and continuously sets a good example, an example that inspires others to follow.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Realtors, lawyers scramble to close deals before 15% tax deadline on Metro Vancouver homes Real estate agencies, lawyers and notaries are scrambling to close the sale of homes in Metro Vancouver before the 15 per cent foreign buyer tax comes into effect Tuesday. \\"Hundreds of British Columbians head into the B.C. Day long weekend facing stress and uncertainty concerning the largest financial transaction of their lives,\\" said Dan Morrison, president of the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver, which represents nearly 13,000 Realtors. Because of the holiday weekend, today (Monday) was the last day to close real estate sales before the tax comes into effect on Aug. 2. Companies like Royal Pacific Realty have seen a surge in activity as sellers and buyers try to close before the end of the day. The new rules take effect Aug. 2 and only apply to home purchases in Metro Vancouver, excluding the treaty lands of the Tsawwassen First Nation. Provincial Finance Minister Mike de Jong unveiled the tax as part of legislation aimed at addressing low vacancy rates and high real estate prices in southern B.C. Last month, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said its benchmark price for detached properties in Vancouver rose above 1.5 million. Vancouver's Royal Pacific Realty is Western Canada's largest independent real estate company. On most Fridays, it usually closes under 100 deals. This week has been different. \\"This time I would say it's almost double – 60 or 70 deals more,\\" said Sing Yeo, vice-president of the company. Yeo says some lawyers and notaries are so swamped, they have had to turn people away. Yeo says they are trying to help his clients understand what is at stake, but that if they don't get their papers in by today, there is nothing they can do. That worries Vancouver real estate agent Jamie Stewart. \\"Canadian sellers that have sold to non-residents who can't complete or won't complete are in trouble,\\" said Stewart. \\"People will face bankruptcy over this.\\" Stewart is worried about the Canadian families who had expected to close deals with a foreign buyers have already committed to another house. If the foreign buyer backs out because of this tax, these families could default on their new homes. \\"I understand them wanting to cool off the market,\\" said Stewart, \\"but not in this way.\\" \\"I think it's very unfair that we weren't given a grace period,\\" said Stewart, \\"very un-Canadian that the government has instilled this new legislation and there's so many people that are going to be caught in the crossfire.\\" Summary:","completion":"Real estate agents, lawyers, and notaries in Metro Vancouver are rushing to close property sale deals before the 15% foreign buyer tax comes into effect on Tuesday, 2 August.

Hans Lundgren was born on 3 November 1957 in Spanga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (nee Tjerneld), a language teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spanga until the age of 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Angermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Although Lundgren has never competed as a professional bodybuilder, he has been closely associated with bodybuilding and fitness since his role as Drago in the mid-1980s. Bodybuilding.com said, \\"Looking like a man in his 30s rather than his 50s, Lundgren is the poster boy of precise nutrition, supplementation and exercise application that he has practiced for over 35 years.\\" In an interview with them, he claimed to often train up to six days a week, usually one-hour sessions completed in the morning, saying that \\"it's just one hour a day, and then you can enjoy the other 23 hours\\". Although he had begun lifting weights as a teenager, he cites co-star Sylvester Stallone as the man who got him into serious bodybuilding for a period in the 1980s after he arrived in the U.S. Stallone had a lasting influence on his fitness regime and diet, ensuring that he ate a much higher percentage of protein and split his food intake between five or six smaller meals a day. Lundgren has professed never to have been \\"super strong\\", saying that, \\"I'm too tall and my arms are long. I think back then [Rocky IV] I was working with around 300 pounds on the bench and squat.\\" In a January 2011 interview with GQ he announced he is working on releasing his own range of vitamins and supplements. He wrote an autobiographical fitness book, Train Like an Action Hero: Be Fit Forever, published in Sweden (by Bonnier Fakta) on 9 August 2011, offering tips he learned over the years to work out in various situations (with a busy schedule and a lot of traveling). On 9 September 2014, Lundgren published Dolph Lundgren: Train Like an Action Hero: Be Fit Forever, a book which contains a detailed account of his earlier life and troubles. He cites a better quality of life as having inspired him to maintain his physical fitness. When in Los Angeles he trains at the Equinox Gym in Westwood and when at home in Marbella, Spain, he trains at the Qi Sport Gym in Puerto Banus. Dolph does, however, also like to spar and practice his karate in the gym to keep in top shape aside from weight lifting. He cites dead lifting and squats as the best exercises for muscle building.

Here are possible answers to this question: - spring into action - accept his fate - cross street - feel upset - travel to europe I believe the correct choice is \\"spring into action\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"\\"Spring into action\\" First, let's break down the question and evaluate each possible answer based on the context. The question states that the person knew what he had to do to achieve his dreams. This sentence implies that the person has a clear vision of their goals and an understanding of the necessary steps to accomplish them. With this in mind, let's examine each possible answer: 1. Spring into action: This option means that the person immediately started taking proactive steps towards achieving their dreams. Since the person knew what needed to be done, it makes sense that they would waste no time in pursuing their goals. This fits the context perfectly and appears to be the most likely correct answer. 2. Accept his fate: This choice implies that the person willingly chose to resign themselves to their situation, which contradicts the context of the question. A person who knows what they need to do to achieve their dreams would be more likely to take action instead of merely accepting their current circumstances. 3. Cross street: This response is vague and unrelated to the context of the question. We have no information about whether crossing a street would be relevant to achieving the person's dreams, so we can't consider this as the correct answer. 4. Feel upset: While this option might be a possible reaction, it doesn't align with the context of the question. Feeling upset doesn't necessarily contribute to achieving one's dreams or indicate that the person is actively working towards their goals. Additionally, knowing what to do to realize one's dreams should generally be a motivating factor, rather than a source of distress. 5. Travel to Europe: Though it is possible that travel could play a role in achieving the person's dreams, this answer is too specific and situational. It assumes that going to Europe is absolutely necessary for the person's aspirations, which is not mentioned or implied in the question. Considering all the options and analyzing their relevance to the question, the most suitable answer is \\"spring into action.\\" This choice aligns with the context and shows a proactive approach taken by the person who knows what they have to do to achieve their dreams."},{"prompt":"Q: Seeing it was April Fool's day, Kai played a prank on his parents.

The former Trump campaign manager responded \\"womp womp.\\" ||||| Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski mocked an anecdote about a 10-year-old girl with Down syndrome being separated from her mother at the U.S.-Mexico border due to the Trump Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy on immigration. During an appearance on Fox News Tuesday night, Lewandowski responded “womp, womp” when fellow panelist Zac Petkanas shared the account he had read, CNN reports. Petkanas, a former senior Democratic National Committee adviser, said the 10-year-old had been “taken from her mother and put in a cage.” The girl’s story was originally shared by Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, who called the ordeal “particularly painful.” The girl and her brother were sent to a U.S. detention facility in McAllen, Texas, while their mother was sent an hour away to Brownsville, Videgaray added. The Trump administration has come under intense criticism for the zero tolerance policy which separates children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border in order to criminally prosecute all undocumented crossings. Since May, 2,342 children, some just infants, have been separated from their families, and put in the government’s care, according to federal officials. President Donald Trump has argued that he sees no alternative to family separations in order to ensure illegal immigrants do not “pour into” and “infest” the country. ||||| (CNN) A 10-year-old Mexican girl with Down syndrome is among the thousands of children who have recently been separated from their parents at the southern US border, Mexico's foreign minister said.

If dietary changes and movement don’t relieve your baby’s constipation, schedule an appointment with her pediatrician. The doctor can diagnose the problem and offer alternative dietary or medical treatments. Sometimes your baby's doctor may prescribe medications such as MiraLAX or Lactulose for constipation. These medications bring fluid into the colon to make the stools softer and easier to pass. Provide your doctor any relevant information necessary to diagnose and treat the problem. Let him know about dietary changes and what measures you’ve taken to relieve your baby’s constipation. Ask any questions you may have about your baby’s constipation, treating it, and preventing future bouts. If your baby hasn’t pooped in a few days, try a glycerin suppository. Inserting one in your baby’s anus may help quickly relieve constipation. Be aware that glycerin suppositories are only meant for occasional use. Get the suppository at your local pharmacy. These are available without a prescription. You can also get liquid glycerin, which you can drop into your baby’s rectum. Make sure you are using the right type and size for your baby's age. Insert the suppository as far into your baby’s rectum as you are able. Hold the baby’s buttocks together for a few minutes while the suppository dissolves. Make sure to talk to and comfort your baby so that she doesn’t get scared when you’re inserting the suppository or holding her buttocks together. There is conflicting information about using anything other than glycerin suppositories to relieve infant constipation. Talk to your doctor about whether other medical constipation relievers are okay for your baby before using them. Some doctors may suggest giving your baby corn or Karo syrup to relieve constipation. This product has a similar effect to eating fruits or fruit juices. Try giving your baby 1–2 tablespoons of either corn or Karo syrup every day to relieve constipation. Flax oil may help relieve your baby’s constipation. In addition, it can facilitate the absorption of vitamins and nutrients your baby may be losing as a result of the constipation. Give infants one teaspoon of flax oil every day for constipation. Summary:","completion":"If a baby is suffering from constipation, it is advised to bring about dietary changes, increase movement, or consult with a pediatrician who may recommend alternative dietary treatments or prescription medications like MiraLAX or Lactulose, which soften the stool by drawing fluid into the colon.

Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ).

In London, Professor Henry Higgins, a scholar of phonetics, believes that the accent and tone of one's voice determines a person's prospects in society (\\"Why Can't the English?\\"). At Covent Garden one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert who had come all the way from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or duchess at an embassy ball, even the young woman with a strong Cockney accent named Eliza Doolittle who tries to sell them flowers. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees, and describes how women ruin lives (\\"I'm an Ordinary Man\\"). Eliza's father, Alfred P.

Then, there were Internet companies which didn't have stores, they sold things only over the Net. Traditional companies didn't want to lose any business. Quickly, they created their own websites and began selling things over the Net. These are the so-called \\"brick and click\\" companies. Many stores are made of brick, and you click on your mouse to buy things with your computer. That's where the name \\"brick and click\\" comes from.

The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Keith is an environmental scientist. He was studying the loss of ozone layer and its effect on different species. His data showed that in the beginning or twentieth century there were hardly any loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time period as time A. Further inquiry revealed that things didn't go well at the end of twentieth century - when there were severe loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time as time B. At what period would lower level of UV radiation reach earth, time A or time B? Answer:","completion":"Lower levels of UV radiation would reach the Earth during Time A, which corresponds to the beginning of the twentieth century when there were hardly any losses in the ozone layer. During Time A, the ozone layer was largely intact and functioning effectively as a natural barrier, protecting the Earth from the sun's harmful UV radiation. Consequently, levels of UV radiation reaching the planet were relatively low and stable. On the other hand, Time B represents the end of the twentieth century, a period marked by severe losses in the ozone layer. The increase in air pollution, including the release of chlorine and bromine gases, led to significant depletion of the ozone layer during this period. As the depletion process intensified, the ozone layer became less effective at filtering out hazardous UV radiation, resulting in increased levels of UV rays reaching the Earth. This elevated exposure to UV radiation has been associated with a range of detrimental consequences, including increased cases of skin cancer, eye cataracts, and disruption to the nitrogen cycle, plankton populations, and the marine food web as a whole. Although the rate of ozone layer loss has slowed down in recent years due to restrictions on pollutants, the layer remains at risk and continued efforts are needed to minimize further damage. It is important for environmental scientists like Keith to study the consequences of ozone layer loss on different species in order to better understand the impact on ecosystems and develop effective strategies for mitigating potential harm to the environment and all life on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from.

Write highlights for this article: Last week we learned that Barack and Michelle Obama's effective tax rate for 2011 was 20.5%. They had adjusted gross income of 789,674. We also learned that their tax rate was slightly lower than President Obama's secretary, who had about 95,000 of income. Ours is supposed to be a progressive rate system, which means as income gets higher, so do tax rates. In a true progressive rate system, Obama would never pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. We also know that Mitt and Ann Romney have a projected effective tax rate of 15% for 2011. They have requested an extension so we don't have their actual returns. Their household income was just shy of 21 million. In a true progressive tax system, the Romneys would never pay a lower tax rate than the Obamas. We do not have a progressive tax system. The notion of a progressive tax system is the lie that has been perpetuated far too long. First, not all income is taxed the same. While our income tax has always had progressive rates, for most of the 20th century a lower rate applied to certain nonwage income. That rate differential was increased dramatically as a result of the Bush tax cuts. Most of the Romneys' income comes from stock ownership. Stock dividends and capital gains are generally not subject to our progressive rate system. Income from stock is taxed at a flat 15% rate. Fewer than 1 in 5 Americans owns stock in a way that qualifies for the flat rate. Of that minority, very few benefit the way the Romneys do. An analysis of IRS statistics show that for households up to 200,000, no more than about 5% of their income is eligible for the flat 15% rate. Those households combined represent well more than 90% of American households. The Simpson-Bowles commission included a proposal that all income should be taxed the same. While some would say that is a radical step, it is precisely what we did in 1986. Second, not all deductions are treated the same. Two-thirds of all taxpayers do not itemize their deductions but take the standard deduction. So, as a result, most Americans do not even benefit from the myriad of special interest group deductions found in our tax code. In addition, under a progressive tax system, the value of a deduction depends upon what rate your last dollar is taxed. That is referred to as your marginal tax rate. The more income you have, the higher your marginal tax rate and the greater the value of the deduction. For example, if your marginal tax rate is 35%, then for every dollar you spend, you save 35 cents. If your marginal tax rate is 15%, then for every dollar you spend, you save only 15 cents. That explains why those in higher income brackets seek out tax deductions as a way to save money on their taxes. Third, all of this is supposed to be a secret. The only reason we have the information is because taxpayers voluntarily disclosed it -- either because they are presidential candidates or concerned citizens such as investor Warren Buffett. The IRS statistics do a great job of masking this information because the real problem lies within the top 1% of taxpayers, and the data are not presented in a way that isolates that group. Congress decides to enact a tax law, and the president signs the bill. While presidents voluntarily release their tax returns, members of Congress do not. The first step toward real tax reform would be for every member of Congress to release his or her tax return. We can see which tax provisions benefit them, and we can compare their effective tax rates with our own. Achieving meaningful tax reform will require very few steps. First, tax all forms of income at the same rate. Second, repeal the progressive tax system and enact a flat tax. If a flat tax is good enough for Mitt and Ann Romney, it should be good enough for the rest of us. Most flat tax proponents, however, want a flat tax, but they want to exempt income from stock completely. That would mean Mitt and Ann Romney's already low 15% effective tax rate would be cut even further. That would be wrong-headed tax reform. Finally, most deductions should be eliminated. Most taxpayers do not itemize, so this change would only affect about one-third of taxpayers -- and their accountants and tax lawyers. Whenever Congress enacts a deduction, it creates winners and losers. That must stop. To be sure, every special interest group will oppose even the hint of this suggestion. But we outnumber them. I don't think it's fair that the richest Americans pay taxes at a lower rate than most taxpayers and neither should you. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dorothy Brown. Highlights:","completion":"1. Barack and Michelle Obama's effective tax rate in 2011 was 20.5%, while their secretary had a slightly higher rate despite earning significantly less. 2.

The U.S. does not have a truly progressive tax system, as not all income is taxed equally, and deductions are treated differently depending on taxpayers' income brackets. 4. Achieving meaningful tax reform requires taxing all forms of income at the same rate, repealing the progressive tax system and enacting a flat tax, and eliminating most tax deductions. 5.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: [1]. The phrase \\"oofs a cream and olive in a bowl\\" is not a clear or logical task that someone would perform in a kitchen. The word \\"oofs\\" does not make sense in this context. [3]. The wording is incorrect and illogical; one would not use a pan to heat a cooked pot of pasta, instead, they would heat the pasta in the pot or cook the pasta in the pan. [4]. Playing a saxophone is unrelated to a kitchen setting and does not effectively continue the initial sentence's narrative of a man performing kitchen tasks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Prototype OLED lighting panel developed by Lumiotec\\" be a reasonable answer? Select from the following. a). No. b). Yes. Answer:","completion":"The organic layer in an AMOLED (Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diodes) screen refers to the thin organic film containing electroluminescent organic compounds sandwiched between two electrode layers. In an AMOLED screen, an active matrix of TFT backplanes is used to switch individual pixels on or off. This plays a significant role in determining the color, brightness, and contrast of the display. The organic layer is essential to the functioning of the AMOLED screen as it emits light when an electric current is applied. An AMOLED screen comprises multiple layers: a substrate, thin-film transistors, insulating layers, backplane, organic layer (where electroluminescence takes place), and a front plane of cathode/anode electrodes connected through vias. It is important to note that the organic films can have various emissive colors (red, green, and blue) depending on the organic materials used for these layers. Now, coming to the \\"Prototype OLED lighting panel developed by Lumiotec,\\" it seems to be referring to a particular OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diodes) prototype created by Lumiotec, a company specializing in the development of OLED lighting panels. Note the distinction: OLED panels are typically used for general illumination, while AMOLED technology is commonly found in display applications, such as smartphone screens, tablets, and televisions. As a result, the prototype panel by Lumiotec would not serve as an accurate or reasonable answer to the question about the organic layer in an AMOLED screen.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: You may hear males \\"ribbiting,\\" producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding. Frog calls can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals. When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some species, also guards them. Now, I have a new situation: Bob and Andy were two nature enthusiasts. They went camping together once a month. Bob was into bird watching, while Andy was fascinated with frogs and salamanders. They went on a trip last week-end and they were very happy with what they had observed.

One example of this can be observed when Fred and his peers had an important test in chemistry, consisting of a hundred true-or-false questions. Instead of taking the time to study, Fred watched TV the night before the exam, showing no apparent concern for the upcoming test. He shared his plan of simply tossing a coin to answer the questions on the test, arguing that this method would guarantee him at least fifty correct answers, allowing him to pass the test. This mindset demonstrates not only Fred's casual attitude towards his academics but also his lack of understanding of the importance of proper preparation and effort to succeed. The next day, Fred carried out his plan at the exam, tossing a coin to determine his answers and finishing the test thirty minutes earlier than the other students. When he encountered the chemistry professor the following day, he asked for the results, displaying a sense of eagerness and optimism. However, the professor responded by tossing a coin himself and, based on the outcome, informed Fred that he had failed the test. The professor's actions, utilizing the same coin-tossing method that Fred used, conveyed the message that Baines' way for the exam would never work. It emphasized the fact that relying on chance, rather than putting in the required effort to study and comprehend the subject material, is not an effective or responsible approach to academic success.

Background: Future Islands is an American synthpop band based in Baltimore, Maryland, and signed to 4AD, currently comprising Gerrit Welmers (keyboards and programming), William Cashion (bass, acoustic and electric guitars), and Samuel T. Herring (lyrics and vocals). The band was formed in January 2006 by Welmers, Cashion and Herring--the remaining members of the performance art college band Art Lord & the Self-Portraits--and drummer Erick Murillo. Murillo left in November 2007, after which the band relocated to Baltimore, MD, and released the debut album Wave Like Home through British label Context: Sam Herring and Gerrit Welmers grew up in Morehead City, North Carolina two streets away from each other, and attended the same middle school in Newport, North Carolina. They became friends around 1998, when they were in 8th grade. Herring had started making hip-hop music when he was 13 or 14, while Gerrit was a skater with interests in metal and punk music who bought his first guitar at age 14. Having different musical backgrounds, they did not consider making music together during high-school. William Cashion started playing guitar when he was around 13, having had a couple of bands as a teenager in Raleigh, where he commuted to High School from Wendell, North Carolina. In 2012 he enrolled in the painting and drawing program at ECU and had drawing classes with Sam Herring. The idea to form a band came while Cashion was helping Herring study for an art history exam. They invited local record shop personality Adam Beeby to play rhythmic keyboards and fellow art student Kymia Nawabi for percussion and backing vocals. After a tumultuous debut on Valentine's Day February 14, 2003 at Soccer Moms' House, Herring also invited Welmers to join the band. Only Cashion and Welmers already played a musical instrument--the guitar--but Cashion took the bass and Welmers the keyboards, for a Kraftwerk-inspired sound. Sam Herring played Locke Ernst-Frost an arrogant narcissistic artist from Germany, Ohio, dressed in a 70's-inspired white suit with slicked-back hair, and a heavy German accent. The character's name originally was meant to be Oarlock Ernest Frost but it got shortened as a reference to John Locke the religious poet, Max Ernst, the artist and Robert Frost, the American poet. The band quickly gained a local reputation and started touring the underground venues in the Southwest, playing shows with North Carolina acts like Valient Thorr and Baltimore artists such as Height, Videohippos, OCDJ, Nuclear Power Pants, Santa Dads, Ecstatic Sunshine, Blood Baby, Ponytail and electronic musician Dan Deacon whom they met during a show on May 26, 2004. Nawabi who was already a senior when Cashion, Herring and Welmers were freshmen, left the band to prepare for her graduation project in June-July 2003. When Adam Beeby had to leave Greenville in September 2005, the remaining members dissolved the band. Question: What college did they attend?

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it. Your job is to determine which sentence(s) from the passage can be used to search for further information needed to answer the question. Q: Question: What age was Hans Asperger when he invented the term Autistic psychopathy? Passage:Michael Fitzgerald, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry, published a cornucopia of pathographies of outstanding historical personalities, mostly stating that they had Asperger syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum. In his 2004 published anthology Autism and creativity, he classified Hitler as an \\"autistic psychopath\\". Autistic psychopathy is a term that the Austrian physician Hans Asperger had coined in 1944 in order to label the clinical picture that was later named after him: Asperger syndrome, which has nothing to do with psychopathy in the sense of an antisocial personality disorder. Fitzgerald appraised many of Hitler's publicly known traits as autistic, particularly his various obsessions, his lifeless gaze, his social awkwardness, his lack of personal friendships, and his tendency toward monologue-like speeches, which, according to Fitzgerald, resulted from an inability to have real conversations.

He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Aubrey became separated from the group, yet was still with them. Given the context: What does Aubrey need to do before this? Possible answers: take a break, party a lot, be loud A:","completion":"Before Aubrey became separated from the group, yet still with them, there are a few possibilities for what she needs to do in terms of the given options. 1. Take a break: If Aubrey's intention is to have some space for personal reflection, or if she's emotionally or physically overwhelmed by the group's activities or dynamics, it would be beneficial for her to take a break from the group. During this break, she can take a step back, regain her composure, and evaluate her feelings about the group or situation. This would allow her to have a sense of separation from the group, while still being connected to them through their shared experiences and social ties. Once she's recharged and feels more balanced, she can decide on how best to re-engage with the group. 2. Party a lot: If Aubrey feels disconnected due to a lack of participation or shared experiences with the rest of the group, by immersing herself in the group's activities and partying, she can create a sense of belonging and camaraderie. By actively participating in these social events, she'll create shared memories that bond her to the group while also giving her the space to express herself through social interactions. This approach will help her feel present and integrated with the group while maintaining some degree of personal freedom. 3. Be loud: By being loud, Aubrey asserts her presence within the group and draws the attention of her peers. This could mean that she voices her opinions more, shares her thoughts, or contributes ideas in a way that demonstrates her investment in the group's dynamics and activities. In essence, she wants to be heard and recognized by her peers, which can create a sense of togetherness, even if she's physically separated from them. Being loud can be a powerful tool, as it shows that she's engaged and active within the scope of the group's activities, all the while feeling somewhat separated from them. Although these three options represent different strategies, they all have one thing in common: Aubrey feels that she needs to take some action to redefine her relationship with the group and find a balance between her personal space and her social belonging. By taking a break, partying, or being louder, she can explore these aspects of her identity and navigate her way towards a more comfortable and fulfilling balance within her social circle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the game they went to see the sports physician for a check up. The physician found that John had inflammation, but Keith didn't have any inflammation. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who would not have neutrophils on his wound, John or Keith? Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Keith would not have neutrophils on his wound, as he did not have any inflammation. John, on the other hand, had inflammation, which indicates the presence of neutrophils as a part of the body's inflammatory response to combat infections or injuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

With each unraveling mystery, Mike is faced with countless obstacles as he delves deeper into the unknown, driven by a personal connection to the disappearance of his younger brother. Act 1: Intro - We are introduced to Mike, an amateur detective with a passion for solving mysterious cases with unexplained phenomena. His life is turned upside down when his younger brother goes missing without a trace. The case leads him to discover decades of urban legends and witness accounts of an unknown figure referred to as The Tall Man. Interwoven throughout the scenes of Mike's personal life are eerie and seemingly disconnected incidents that hint at the existence of The Tall Man. Mike, unable to shake off the idea that The Tall Man may be involved in his brother's disappearance, becomes fully engrossed in the case. Mike's tenacity and determination lead him to gather clues, heading towards the distant town where the first accounts of The Tall Man started to appear. Act 2: Mike arrives in the quiet, yet peculiar little town and finds locals that are hesitant to share information about The Tall Man. It's apparent that the entire town is wrapped in fear and silence. Undeterred, Mike manages to befriend Sam, a local who is connected to several people who have mysteriously vanished. Together, Mike and Sam uncover the town's buried secret: a history of unexplained disappearances that seem to be linked to an ancient curse placed upon the town by The Tall Man. The deeper they dig, the more dangerous their journey becomes, exposing more nefarious connections between The Tall Man and the government and other powerful organizations. Act 3: Mike and Sam come across a cryptic map that could be the key to deciphering the origins of The Tall Man and the trail of fear and tragedy left in his wake. Following the map, they make their way to a hidden underground lair beneath the town's church, where they find evidence of human experimentation and a chilling link between The Tall Man and other otherworldly creatures. As tensions build and more secrets are exposed, Mike confronts the truth about what happened to his brother. The Tall Man, revealed to be a creation of dark forces bent on unleashing destruction upon the world, has abducted Mike's brother, along with numerous other victims, to complete the mysterious plan handed down through generations.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, but it is essential to analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis and the context in which they are used for a comprehensive understanding. First, let's break down the premise and hypothesis: Premise: Confusion? The premise is presented as a question, implying that there is some level of uncertainty or doubt about whether confusion exists or not. It does not provide a clear or definitive statement, making it ambiguous. Hypothesis: Is there confusion? The hypothesis is also framed as a question, which essentially mirrors the premise, again indicating uncertainty or posing a question about the existence of confusion. With these definitions established, we can now explore the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis appear to be asking the same question. Both express uncertainty or question the presence of confusion. As such, they are inherently linked. Assuming the premise is true – that there is indeed confusion – then it can be concluded that the hypothesis, which questions the existence of the same confusion, will also be true. In other words, if we accept that there is confusion (as per the premise), then asking if there is confusion (as per the hypothesis) becomes a valid question. However, it is crucial to note that a significant factor in this conclusion is the contextual usage of the terms \\"premise\\" and \\"hypothesis.\\" In formal logic, a premise would typically provide a statement or proposition accepted as true, which then forms the basis for drawing conclusions (in this case, using deductive reasoning). A hypothesis, on the other hand, is typically a proposed explanation based on limited evidence, often seen in the scientific method, where it is then tested through experimentation. Given that both the premise and the hypothesis are structured as questions, it could be argued that they do not adhere to traditional definitions within formal logic and scientific inquiry. Nonetheless, when assessing these specific examples, if we accept the premise as true, (i.e., that there is confusion), then the hypothesis inquiring about that confusion would also stand as true."},{"prompt":"Title: Save your money Review: Denise is not a certified Pilates instructor and it shows.

Given the question: The answer to the question: Who received inspiration from the teachings of Madhvacharya? is inside the article: The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars (Ashtadiggajas) of the literary assembly. The most famous among them were Allasani Peddana who held the honorific Andhrakavitapitamaha (lit, \\"father of Telugu poetry\\") and Tenali Ramakrishna, the court jester who authored several notable works.

Question: Process: - Carbon dioxide enters the leaves through the stomates by diffusion - Water is transported to the leaves in the xylem - Energy harvested through light reaction is stored by forming ATP - Carbon dioxide and energy from ATP are used to create sugar - Oxygen exits the leaves through the stomata by diffusion - The plant reuses the water or the water exits through the stomata as water vapor. Question: suppose Less pollution is better for more trees. happens, how will it affect more seedlings survive longer. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"A detailed analysis of the effect of reduced pollution on the survival of seedlings can be explained as follows: Reduced pollution can lead to better health and survival of more trees. How does this happen? Let's break it down: 1. Better air quality: Pollution, such as high levels of ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, can have adverse effects on plants and trees. These pollutants can damage the leaf surface, reducing the photosynthetic capacity of plants and inducing stress in the plants. With a reduction in pollution, the air quality improves, leading to healthier trees that can efficiently carry out photosynthesis. 2. More efficient photosynthesis: As the air quality improves due to less pollution, the process of photosynthesis becomes more efficient. Carbon dioxide enters the leaves through the stomates by diffusion, where it combines with the energy from ATP and the water transported by the xylem to produce sugar, the \\"food\\" for the plants. As these processes become more efficient, the overall health of the plant improves, leading to stronger trees that can better protect and nurture their seedlings. 3. Enhanced seed development and germination: The overall improvement in plant health due to reduced pollution leads to better seed development and germination. As a result, more seedlings have a higher chance of survival and growth. 4. Improved soil quality: Reduced pollution also improves soil quality, as pollutants can have detrimental effects on the nutrients and microorganisms in the soil. Healthier soil provides better conditions for seedlings to develop a robust root system, which increases their chances of survival. 5. Less stress on seedlings: Pollution can cause stress in plants, making them more susceptible to diseases and pests. When there is less pollution, seedlings experience lesser stress and are better equipped to combat diseases and pests. 6. Positive impact on surrounding ecosystems: Finally, reduced pollution also has a beneficial effect on the ecosystems surrounding the trees. Cleaner air, water, and soil not only support the growth of the trees themselves but also promote the survival and health of surrounding plant and animal species. As a result, seedlings have a better chance of surviving within balanced and thriving ecosystems. In conclusion, the reduction in pollution has a significant positive effect on the survival and growth of seedlings. So, the answer is A: more seedlings will survive longer as a result of reduced pollution. This, in turn, can lead to a healthier and more diverse ecosystem in which new trees can grow and thrive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: This article: The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose third Benhardt play was La Tosca?, what is it ?

Add punctuation: Particle pollution is one of the major environmental problems","completion":"Particle pollution, one of the major environmental problems, is a significant concern for our society. This type of pollution, which consists of tiny particles suspended in the air, affects not only the environment but also human health on a large scale. The sources of these particles range from automobiles, factories, and construction sites to natural events such as wildfires and volcanic eruptions. The potential impacts of particle pollution are multifaceted and far-reaching. Among the most pressing issues are the consequences for human health, including respiratory problems, heart attacks, and various forms of cancer. As individuals inhale polluted air, the tiny particles can enter their lungs, contributing to a range of serious health complications. Certain demographics, such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions, are at greater risk of experiencing these harmful effects. Furthermore, the environmental repercussions of particle pollution are also significant. For instance, visibility can be dramatically reduced due to the presence of these particles, which impairs our ability to appreciate natural scenery and poses challenges for transportation systems. Additionally, particulate pollution can be carried by the wind, spreading the problem across larger geographical areas and even crossing borders, making it a global issue. This spread of pollution is especially troubling in terms of adverse consequences for marine ecosystems, as ocean currents can transport these particles into fragile habitats and harm marine life. Mitigating particle pollution calls for a collective effort on multiple fronts. Governments and industries must institute regulations and policies to limit the emission of particulate matter from human-made sources. This could involve setting stricter standards for vehicle emissions, enforcing pollution controls at industrial facilities, and investing in cleaner technologies. Public awareness campaigns and education programs can also play a crucial role in helping people understand the risks associated with particle pollution and inspiring them to take action to reduce emissions and improve air quality. Moreover, the importance of investing in research and development of innovative solutions cannot be overlooked. Cleaner technologies, such as electric vehicles or alternative forms of energy production, can help decrease the amount of particle pollution being generated. Additionally, efforts directed toward understanding the health impacts of particle pollution can lead to more effective preventive and therapeutic interventions, further safeguarding the well-being of affected populations. In conclusion, particle pollution is a major environmental problem with wide-ranging implications for both human health and the environment. Concerted efforts must be made to address this issue by promoting clean technologies, implementing effective policies, and raising awareness of the challenges we face. Only through sustained actions can we hope to mitigate the damaging effects of particle pollution and create a healthier, more sustainable future for all."},{"prompt":"Title: I Need More Ink Review: Well, I can't get too excited about a review for a ink cartridge.

First question: What is the best Mario strategy in Super Smash Bros. 4? Second question: What is the best Dr. Mario strategy in Super Smash Bros. 4? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: What is the best Mario strategy in Super Smash Bros. 4? In Super Smash Bros. 4, Mario is considered a well-balanced character with a versatile playstyle. He possesses a mix of speed, power, and combo potential. Here are some tips for an effective Mario strategy: 1. Grabs and throws: Mario's grab game is very strong, so make use of his throws as an essential part of your strategy. His up-throw and down-throw can link into combos, while his back-throw can be used for edge-guarding purposes. 2. Combo game: Mario possesses a variety of combo starters and finishers, with his up-air and down-air being good combo tools. Utilize his down-air to start combos and rack up damage, and use his up-air for combos in the air or as a potential kill move. 3. Fireball zoning: Mario's neutral special, the Fireball, can be used as an effective zoning tool to control space and force your opponent to approach or shield. Be sure to mix up the speed and direction of your Fireballs, as well as using them off-stage for edge-guarding purposes. 4. Effective off-stage: Mario has a solid off-stage game, including good edge-guarding tools with his back-air and Cape (side special). The Cape can be used to reverse your opponent's momentum, while the back-air is a strong kill move. 5. Recovery: Mario's recovery is relatively predictable but has some mix-up options. Use his up-special, Super Jump Punch, along with the Cape and air dodges to keep your opponent guessing while you recover. Second question: What is the best Dr. Mario strategy in Super Smash Bros. 4? Dr. Mario shares some similarities with Mario due to being a clone character, but generally has more powerful attacks at the cost of lower mobility. Here are some tips for an effective Dr. Mario strategy: 1. Powerful attacks: Dr. Mario boasts stronger attacks than his regular counterpart. Make use of his powerful tilt and smash attacks to rack up damage and KO opponents. 2. Pills for zoning: Dr. Mario's neutral special, the Megavitamin, can be used similarly to Mario's Fireballs for zoning. These pills bounce differently, allowing you to control space and pressure opponents effectively. 3. Grabs and throws: Dr. Mario's grab game is also strong. Utilize his down-throw and back-throw for setting up combos and edge-guarding situations. 4. Slower but stronger aerials: While Dr. Mario's aerial game is slower than Mario's, his aerial moves pack a stronger punch. Use his back-air as a potent edge-guarding tool and his down-air to break through your opponent's defenses. 5. Adapted recovery: Dr. Mario's recovery is weaker than Mario's, but his down-special, Dr. Tornado, can be used to mix-up his recovery when used in conjunction with his up-special, Super Sheet, and air dodges. Are these two questions asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. While both Mario and Dr. Mario share similarities in their movesets, being from the same game franchise and fighting series, their different attributes and strategies make them distinct characters in Super Smash Bros. 4. The first question focuses on the best strategies for playing as Mario, while the second question specifically asks for strategies regarding Dr. Mario, who has unique characteristics and moves compared to Mario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Sharks are among the oldest animals on Earth. There are hundreds of kinds of sharks. Most are about two meters long. The dogfish shark, however, is less than twenty centimeters in length. A shark has an extremely good sense of smell. It can find small amounts of matters in water, such as blood, body liquids and chemicals produced by animals. These powerful senses help sharks find their food. Sharks eat fish, other sharks, and plants that live in the ocean. Sharks grow slowly. About forty percent of all sharks lay eggs. The others give birth to live young. Some sharks carry their young inside their bodies as humans do. Some sharks are not able to reproduce until they are twenty years old. Most reproduce only every two years. And they give birth to fewer than ten young sharks. For this reason, over-fishing of sharks is of special danger to the future of the animal. Sharks are important for the world's oceans. They eat injured and diseased fish. Their hunting activities mean that the numbers of other fish in ocean waters do not become too large. This protects the plants and other forms of life that exist in the oceans. People hunt sharks for sport, food, medicine and their skin. Experts say the international market for some kinds of sharks has increased because many parts of a shark are valuable.Collectors pay thousands of dollars for the jaws of a shark. Shark liver oil is a popular source of Vitamin A. The skin of a shark can be used like leather. In Asia, people enjoy a kind of soup made from shark fins. Experts say a fisherman can earn a lot of money for even one kilogram of shark fins. Sharks are among the oldest animals on Earth, but some sharks are in danger of disappearing from Earth. If too many sharks in one area are killed, that group of sharks may never return to normal population levels. The answer is:","completion":"Which of the following best illustrates the content of the given article? A) Sharks are the most dangerous animals on Earth.

Given the following context The father carried the sleeping boy in *his* arms Are \\"The father\\" and \\"his\\" the same?","completion":"Based on the given context, \\"The father\\" and \\"his\\" indeed refer to the same person. In linguistic terms, we can say that \\"his\\" is an anaphoric pronoun that connects back to a previously mentioned noun or noun phrase, which in this case is \\"The father.\\" In the sentence \\"The father carried the sleeping boy in his arms,\\" the word \\"his\\" functions as a possessive pronoun, implying a relationship of ownership or belonging. It denotes that the arms, where the sleeping boy is being carried, belong to the father. As the sentence refers to a single male individual, the possessive pronoun \\"his\\" is being used to indicate that the arms are those of the father who is carrying the boy. To understand this relationship more clearly, let's break down the sentence: 1. \\"The father\\": This part of the sentence refers to a specific male parent figure. 2. \\"carried\\": This is the verb in the sentence, indicating that the action is being performed by the subject (The father) to an object (the sleeping boy). 3. \\"the sleeping boy\\": This phrase refers to a child who is currently asleep, and is the direct object in the sentence. 4. \\"in his arms\\": This prepositional phrase clarifies how the father is carrying the boy (i.e., in the father's arms). The use of \\"his\\" before \\"arms\\" emphasizes that the arms belong to the father, and not to the boy or any other person. If you replace \\"his\\" with \\"The father's,\\" the relationship between the two phrases becomes more explicit: \\"The father carried the sleeping boy in The father's arms.\\" However, replacing the pronoun with the original noun phrase can make the sentence sound repetitive and less fluent, which is why we use possessive pronouns like \\"his\\" to streamline the text and avoid redundancy. Thus, considering the context, it can be concluded that \\"The father\\" and \\"his\\" refer to the same person in the sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In talks: Illegal immigrants living in 'beds in sheds' are desperate to leave Britain and return home, Gurmel Singh-Kandola, secretary-general of the Sikh Council, has said. Illegal immigrants living in ‘beds in sheds’ are desperate to leave Britain and return home, an ethnic minority leader says. Gurmel Singh-Kandola, secretary-general of the Sikh Council, said many arrivals from India who had entered the country unlawfully were stuck here, unable to work, and wanted help from the Home Office to go back. His support for a ‘voluntary returns process’ echoes Home Office efforts to persuade some of the estimated one million illegal immigrants in Britain to leave of their own accord. His organisation is now in talks with the department over how migrants with no right to remain might contact officials for help to return voluntarily. His remarks are in stark contrast to the fury provoked by the poster campaign among human rights advocates, refugee groups and left-wing politicians. The posters were mounted on vans driven around parts of London, and stating: ‘In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.’ A text number was provided for advice and help with travel documents. An investigation into whether they were ‘offensive and irresponsible’ was launched yesterday by the Advertising Standards Authority. The watchdog said it had received 60 complaints about the posters including that they were ‘reminiscent of slogans used by racist groups to attack immigrants in the past’. Mr Singh-Kandola believes the message behind the posters could have been delivered ‘more softly’. ‘If it said something like, “If you want to go home contact this number” or “assistance is available to return home” I think it would have been the same message but delivered more softly,’ he said. Many from the Punjab and Delhi were stuck here, impoverished and unable to work, he said. Controversial: This poster campaign caused fury among human rights advocates, refugee groups and left-wing politicians. ‘Their plight is well known; they are sleeping very rough under bridges and in multiple occupancies, sometimes in sheds in the back of people’s gardens. 'We have been quite concerned about the abject poverty in which they are living. Many of them have been trafficked by unscrupulous agents who take a lot of money from them.’ Many illegal immigrants destroyed their passport once they arrived in the country, Mr Singh-Kandola said, making it difficult for them to go home even if they wanted to. It could take six or seven months to get replacement documents papers from the Indian consulate, he said. The Home Office could help them obtain a new passport quickly and buy them a flight home. ‘Our discussions have been for those who want to go back home to facilitate that process in a humane and generous way.’ He said illegal immigrants were victims of ‘hype’ which led them to believe they could live and work in Britain once they arrived. ‘In fact they are stuck. They want to go home on a voluntary basis and what we need is processes to facilitate that.’ Raid: An Uzbekistani man who is said to have. overstayed his visa was detained by UK Border Agency officers in a raid. on a busy central London restaurant on Thursday. Officials said the £10,000 cost of the poster campaign would pay for itself if just one migrant returned home because of the cost of enforced removals. Yesterday, Eric Pickles became the first senior Tory to raise doubts about the use of the vans, and said they should be rolled-out nationwide only if it could be proved they work. The Communities Secretary said: ‘I will be looking at that evidence. I need to see some very persuasive evidence that this should be passed out nationally. If something like this has to happen it needs to be evidence-based.’ The Communities Secretary is cracking down on traveller sites which ‘trash’ the countryside, with new guidance to councils on removing illegal camps. Prepared: The UK Border Agency sent three vans to Soho to seize the employee. Mr Pickles said £60million was being made available to local authorities to help them act more quickly to shut down unauthorised encampments. He told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘We inherited a situation where the number of illegal sites had gone up four-fold and what we expect them to do is obey the law like you and I do. ‘The idea that this is somehow an attack on the traveller community is not true. This is a very good deal for travellers.’ His department hopes the guidance will give local residents a stronger voice in getting authorities to take action against illegal camps, and prevent incidents like the £7million clear-out of Dale Farm in 2011 after a 10-year wrangle.","completion":"This article talks about how some illegal immigrants living in poor conditions in the UK are actually wanting to go back to their home countries.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? a). no. b). yes.","completion":"a). No. These two questions, although they both pertain to programmers and their capacity to write code, actually address two completely different aspects of the programming profession. The first question, asking \\"How many lines of code do professional programmers write per hour?,\\" seeks to understand the productivity levels of practicing programmers. The answer to this question isn't straightforward, due to several variables that can impact a programmer's rate of code production. These variables include but are not limited to: the complexity of the task at hand, the programmer's familiarity with the language being used, the quality standards being adhered to, external disruptions, and even the programmer's individual work style. Many programmers and industry insiders discourage thinking in terms of lines of code per hour as an effective measure of productivity. They argue that the focus should be on delivering value, solving problems, and writing quality, maintainable code, rather than just churning out large quantities of code. Furthermore, a simple but well-thought-out piece of code can be more valuable than hundreds of lines of complex, convoluted code. It's also critical to remember that a significant part of a programmer's job includes non-coding activities like problem-solving, code reviewing, and debugging. The second question, asking \\"Is it true that most programmer candidates cannot write code?,\\" is seeking to address a claim about the competence of individuals entering the programming field or those interviewing for programming positions. This claim suggests that many candidates lack basic coding skills. While this statement might seem quite broad and generalizing, some studies and surveys have indeed indicated that a surprising number of candidates struggle with basic programming tasks during interviews. This may be due to a range of factors, like ineffective learning strategies, lack of practical experience, or nerves during interviews. However, it's important to note that this finding might not necessarily reflect the competence of the average programmer candidate. There are many highly skilled, capable individuals entering the field. Additionally, coding interviews themselves are somewhat controversial and are sometimes criticized for not being representative of the day-to-day work of a programmer.

Born on April 10, 1980, in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, Hunnam is well-known for his acting roles in both TV series and films. Charlie Hunnam's career began with his involvement in the popular UK television series “Byker Grove” (1998) and \\"Queer as Folk\\" (1999–2000). Later, he gained international prominence for his portrayal of Jackson \\"Jax\\" Teller in the American television drama series \\"Sons of Anarchy\\" (2008-2014), which earned him several award nominations and wins. Over the years, Hunnam has amassed an impressive acting resume, including roles in films like \\"Pacific Rim\\" (2013), \\"Crimson Peak\\" (2015), \\"The Lost City of Z\\" (2016), and \\"Triple Frontier\\" (2019).

Toronto mayor Rob Ford has declared 'rehab is amazing' and that it reminds him of 'football camp' as he vows to return fighting fit to 'kick butt' in October's election. The embattled mayor, who is on a leave of absence to tackle his drug and alcohol use, said he feels 'great' and is benefiting from the self-imposed exile. There are meetings with 'eight people in a group,' he told the Toronto Sun from his mystery treatment center Tuesday. And later 'there is a meal before we have some one-on-one sessions.' 'It reminds me of football camp. Kind of like the Washington Redskins camp I went to as a kid,' he said, adding 'I am working out every day and I am learning about myself, my past and things like that.' Where are you? Rob Ford is pictured above on May 1, a day after he announced his leave of absence. He has now spoken out about rehab, calling it the best thing he ever did. There's no timeline for his return to office, but Ford has assured his supporters he'll be back in time to gain re-election later this year. 'Of course, I am coming back and I am going to kick butt,' he told the newspaper. 'I will be on the ballot for mayor in October, guaranteed, and I will do well.' He joked 'on October 28 there will be no need to change the locks. There will be no need to clean out my office because I am coming back.' Ford said the rehab center treats 'addictions to alcohol and other things' and is 'worth every penny.' After a week of being clean and sober, the mayor said he's starting to come to terms with what has happened over the past year but he said he is hopeful he can right his wrongs. 'At first, I was mad. I was mad at myself and saying, \\"Why me?\\"' he told the Sun. 'But then I realized it could have been a whole lot worse.' He said the very public fall from grace was possibly what he needed to shake him into action. 'I do feel bad about what happened, but it might have been the best thing that happened because I am working on getting better.' Getting help: The mayor is seeking treatment for alcohol addition. Pictured above arriving at his home early Thursday morning after announcing his leave of absence. Ford refused to reveal the name of the treatment center he's checked into, out of respect for the other patients, and he wouldn't even confirm it was in Canada. He said the decision to check himself into rehab came on April 29 - the morning after he was taped in an apparent intoxicated state at a city pub. He said he woke up and 'I told Dougie, \\"I am going away\\" and then started looking up rehab and treatment centres.' Ford told the Sun his family knows where he is and he's been speaking to his children regularly, though they don't know why he's getting help. He said the past week has been tough but he described going into rehab as the 'best decision' he has ever made and said he wishes he'd done it sooner. 'I said to myself, \\"Am I going to try to cover it up for the rest of your life or deal with it and go to professional help?\\"' Ford recalled. 'I decided to get help.' The media has been speculating as to the crack-smoking mayor's whereabouts since he announced his leave of absence last Wednesday. He reportedly got on a private plane bound for Chicago but he was turned away at the border, the Globe and Mail reported. Neither. Ford's brother Doug Ford or his lawyer Dennis Morris will say where exactly the mayor is, but insisted Tuesday he is seeking treatment as. promised. Ford was last seen leaving his house the morning of May 1 to board a private plane at Buttonville Municipal Airport. He landed in Chicago but never formally entered the U.S. Back to drugs: Ford's announcement follows the emergence of yet another video showing him smoking what appears to be crack. A still from the new video released by the Globe and Mail, above. 'He. voluntarily withdrew his application to enter the USA,' Ray Norton,. Canada's Consul General in Chicago, told the Globe and Mail. Norton. added that Ford 'was not declined entry, per se'. Norton didn't learn about the incident until after the fact, when he was notified by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. CBP. spokesman Kris Grogan wouldn't comment on Ford's application, because. of the privacy act, but pointed out that foreigners attempting to enter. the U.S. can be barred on the grounds of 'criminality, security reasons. and documentations, among dozens of others'. Morris wouldn't comment on where the plane went after Chicago, since he wasn't on board. He maintains that Ford is in rehab, but when asked where, Morris said: 'I think it is close to Timbuktu.' 'The. bottom line is he's in rehab, he's getting rehab and he'll be there for. a number of weeks - and that's the answer. It's not like he's at a. baseball game in Los Angeles or something,' Morris said. Doug Ford wouldn't even say which country he was in. He previously announced that Ford was seeking treatment at one of the best facilities in North America. 'The most important thing, everyone who is concerned if he's in rehab, the answer is yes. As for his whereabouts that's personal and that should stay with Rob,' Doug Ford said. But that's not enough for politicians in Toronto, who are demanding answers for Ford's whereabouts. Infamous: Since the original crack video scandal, Ford has been the center of scandal after scandal. Pictured at a news conference with wife Renata (left) on November 14. 'The mayor should explain where he's. going to be and how long he anticipates being there,' Councillor Giorgio. Mammoliti told the National Post. 'I think everybody will leave him alone if he does that.' 'Right. now nobody in this city believes him and trusts him on any of this. If a. plane landed and he didn't get off, he better tell this city where he. is going for treatment.' While the U.S. has barred foreigners from entering the U.S. before for noted drug use, such as when celebrity chef Nigella Lawson wasn't allowed to enter from the UK because she admitted to taking cocaine in a court case, Ford was allowed into the country as recently as March for an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. But that was before news broke of yet another tape in which the mayor appears to be smoking crack-cocaine. The same day Ford announced his leave of absence, the Globe and Mail published screen grabs of a new video which shows Ford smoking the illegal drug at his sister's house on April 26. Ford made headlines last year when another group in Toronto was trying to sell a different video of Ford smoking crack, and he refused to step down. The new video also corresponded to reports that Ford got drunk at a Toronto bar Sullie Gorman's on April 28, making lewd comments about mayoral competition Karen Stintz.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Determine the sentiment: To sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible. Every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid-fire images, through to the last shot of the clean up at Ground Zero, but every frame is real. The story was thought up by two French brothers living in New York. Jules (28) and Gideon (31) Naudet (pronounced \\"Nau-day\\") want to make a documentary on New York City Firefighters, beginning with a \\"newbie\\" from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full-fledged firefighter. Seeking the help of their close friend, actor James Hanlon (36), an actor and firefighter at Station 1, Engine 7, the Naudets sift through the \\"Probies\\" at the academy and find one, Tony Benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on. Tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close-knit family. Firefighters have a superstition about \\"Probies.\\" It is that they are either \\"White Clouds\\" or \\"Black Clouds,\\" meaning that with the latter, all kinds of fires follow the \\"Probie.\\" The former means that very little fire activity follows, but one day, there will be the mother of all fires. Tony is a \\"White Cloud.\\" After some initial growing pains, Tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet. Then the unthinkable occurs.... September 11, 2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from Wall Street. Because Jules has had little camera experience, Gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief, T. K. Pfeiffer. Arriving at about 8:42, the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate. Then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene, and as Jules pans upwards, we see the first strike of the day. American Airlines Flight 11 smashes into the face of the North Tower of 1 World Trade. Pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the World Trade Center. Once there, Jules asks to accompany the Chief into the tower. Pfeiffer tells Naudet to stick close to him. Once inside, the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives. Gideon Naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area. Once there, he captures the impact of the second plane, United Airlines Flight 175, with 2 World Trade. He knows Jules is with Chief Pfeiffer inside the towers. Watching and capturing the crowds' reaction to the unimaginable, Gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in Lower Manhattan. Inside tower one, Jules records the last view the world, or loved ones will have of their sons, fathers, uncles, grandfathers, husbands, boyfriends, friends as one by one, each firefighter, carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped. Jules also catches the last glimpse Chief Pfeiffer will have of his brother, Kevin, as he leaves to do his selfless duty. Also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones, sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke. But Jules is respectful, never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment...the money shot. His work is professional through his baptism of fire. He also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building. Then Jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken: Father Michael Judd, the Chaplain for the fire department. Then as Jules and Chief Pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two, tower one begins its structural collapse. What results is a breathtakingly, poignant view from inside Ground Zero as Jules and Gideon work separately to document that day. Not knowing if either is alive, each fearing the worst. As each firefighter arrives at the firehouse, they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back. And in one moment of overwhelming emotion, Jules and Gideon are reunited. As Jules cries on his brother's shoulder, Gideon embraces his younger brother as Hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject. There is one fearful moment when Tony Benetakos, who left the station with a former chief, is believed to have been lost...but returns to the fold, this \\"Probie\\" has proven himself. Shown with only three interruptions, 9/11 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking. It ranks up there with the Hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds. The Naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject. In lesser hands, the tendency would be toward the sensational, but the Naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion. Narrated by Hanlon, we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of September 11. Robert De Niro hosts the program in a sombre, restrained way. He never seeks the camera for his own glory, rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see. I also commend CBS for their bravery at airing this special. Chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings, they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished. This is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is. It isn't about dribbling a basketball, or selling an album of hate lyrics...9/11 is about humanity at its best. Heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom.","completion":"This piece of writing talks about a documentary film that tells the story of firefighters in New York City during the tragic events of September 11, 2001.

At the recital, Rachel's music doesn't sound as good as Natalie's because Pick your answer from: (1). Rachel hasn't stopped practicing.; (2). Natalie hasn't stopped practicing.;","completion":"At the grand recital, the usually flawless and natural tone of Rachel's music doesn't sound as impressive or captivating as Natalie's. Some might question why this is so, considering that Rachel has always been an avid musician, shining with a genuine love for music that would often outperform anyone else in her age group. The main distinction between the two this time lies not necessarily in their talents, but rather their approach to their respective craft. In this scenario, the distinction becomes clear if we ponder on our two potential explanations: firstly, Rachel hasn't stopped practicing and secondly, Natalie hasn't stopped practicing. However, you may ask, shouldn’t constant practice represent dedication and consequently, result in improvement? While the adage \\"practice makes perfect\\" holds true, it's also necessary to consider the quality of the practice and the mindset of the practitioner. Consider our first argument: Rachel hasn't stopped practicing. This might initially sound like a commendable tactic, right? Yet, what if her relentless practice, instead of honing precision, tuned her towards exhaustion and fatigue? In her zeal to excel, Rachel may have found herself trapped inside a cage of repetition. Her constant engagement with the instrument, though well-intentioned, perhaps neglected one crucial element – the need for rest and reflection. As important as it is to practice consistently, an equal amount of importance should be given to \\"deliberate rest\\" where the mind is given time to relax, process and absorb what has been practiced. This lack of intermittent breaks might have resulted in her performance at the recital being not as enchanting and captivating as it usually is. On the other hand, the story said that Natalie hasn't stopped practicing either. However, the underlying difference here could be in how Natalie approached her practice sessions. Natalie, too, practiced intensely but perhaps coupled her dedicated practice sessions with bouts of rest and reflection. It’s likely that Natalie understood the importance of balancing her commitment with deliberate rest, thereby allowing her to be in a better state of mind during her performance, both physically and mentally. Moreover, by taking regular intervals during practice, Natalie could review her strengths and weaknesses more objectively – a process infusing a more profound understanding of her craft which eventually translated into a better performance. Thus, even though both Rachel and Natalie were diligent with their practice, it was Natalie's music that came out superior at the recital. The difference lay in their respective approach to practicing; while Rachel's ceaseless grind led to a paradoxical decline, Natalie's balanced regimen of practice and rest resulted in a more refined performance. The story highlights a critical aspect for any musician or artist – or anybody looking to excel in their respective fields. Practice is indeed necessary for growth, but it has to be balanced with the right amount of deliberate rest to allow for rejuvenation, reflection, and processing. Otherwise, the practice may turn into a monotonous chore that drains vitality rather than a productive exercise leading towards improvement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Emma Innes PUBLISHED: 07:01 EST, 29 April 2013 | UPDATED: 10:22 EST, 29 April 2013 A father-of-one who has survived cancer three times has described himself as the 'luckiest, unlucky' person alive. John Willis, 37, has battled testicular, stomach and lymph node cancers all in just three years. Miraculously, he has survived each one. John Willis (pictured with his wife Angela) has had testicular, stomach and lymph node cancers Incredibly, the stomach cancer was not related to the lymph node and testicular cancers, meaning that he developed two completely unconnected cancers. Professor Karol Sikora, a world renown oncologist, told MailOnline that the chances of being diagnosed with two different forms of cancer in a year is one in a million. Mr OPTIONS: - Angela said: ‘I went in for a CT scan and doctors found a tumour the size of a snooker ball in my stomach. - Emma Innes said: ‘I went in for a CT scan and doctors found a tumour the size of a snooker ball in my stomach. - John Willis said: ‘I went in for a CT scan and doctors found a tumour the size of a snooker ball in my stomach. - Karol Sikora said: ‘I went in for a CT scan and doctors found a tumour the size of a snooker ball in my stomach. - MailOnline said: ‘I went in for a CT scan and doctors found a tumour the size of a snooker ball in my stomach.","completion":"John Willis said: ‘I went in for a CT scan and doctors found a tumour the size of a snooker ball in my stomach. Despite the odds being against him, he has undergone numerous treatments, surgeries and chemotherapy sessions to combat the cancers. His wife, Angela, has been a pillar of support throughout his harrowing ordeal, taking care of their young daughter while he has been in the hospital. In a strange stroke of fate, this isn't the first time cancer has impacted Mr. Willis' family. His mother survived breast cancer, and his sister battled ovarian cancer. The family's resilience and fighting spirit have made a significant impact on Mr. Willis' ability to face and successfully confront these challenges. Professor Karol Sikora, who has been following and consulting Mr. Willis throughout this period, believes that modern medicine and early detection played a significant role in his survival. Mr. Willis has become an advocate of regular cancer screenings and check-ups, stressing the importance of early detection in the fight against the disease. He has also become an inspiration to many other cancer patients, as evidenced by his active participation in online support groups and community events. Given that the odds of surviving all three cancer diagnoses were extremely low, Mr. Willis is truly a medical marvel. His story is a testament to the strength of the human spirit and the advancements in cancer treatment available today. As Mr. Willis continues to rebuild his life with his family, he is determined to raise awareness about the importance of regular medical check-ups and early detection. He hopes that by sharing his story, he can inspire others facing similar challenges and save lives through the power of knowledge and prevention."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Definition: In this task, you will be presented with a context from an academic paper and a question based on the context. You have to classify the questions into \\"Extractive\\", \\"Abstractive\\", or \\"Yes-no\\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by concatenating extracts taken from a context into a summary while answering abstractive questions involves paraphrasing the context using novel sentences. Yes-no question is a question whose expected answer is one of two choices, one that affirms the question and one that denies the question. Typically, the choices are either yes or no. Input: We evaluate the quality of the document embeddings learned by the different variants of CAHAN and the HAN baseline on three of the large-scale document classification datasets introduced by BIBREF14 and used in the original HAN paper BIBREF5. Question: Do they compare to other models appart from HAN? Output:","completion":"In this task, you are asked to classify questions based on a given context from an academic paper. The questions can be classified into three types: \\"Extractive,\\" \\"Abstractive,\\" or \\"Yes-no\\" questions. Here are the simple steps to approach this task: 1. Read and understand the provided context from the academic paper. 2. Read the given question carefully. 3. Identify the type of question based on its characteristics: a. If the question can be answered by directly extracting parts of the provided context and combining them without creating new sentences, classify it as an \\"Extractive\\" question. b. If the question requires generating a new sentence using the information in the context, but with different wording, classify it as an \\"Abstractive\\" question. c. If the question can be answered simply with a \\"yes\\" or \\"no,\\" classify it as a \\"Yes-no\\" question. 4. Write down the classification of the question as your output. In this example, the context is about evaluating document embeddings and comparing CAHAN variants and the HAN baseline. The question asks if they compare to other models apart from HAN. Given the context and the question, it can be answered with either \\"yes\\" or \\"no.\\" Therefore, classify this question as a \\"Yes-no\\" question.

The luck of the Irish. They say luck is a lady.","completion":"To determine if \\"luck\\" is used to mean the same thing in both sentences, let's analyze each sentence separately. Step 1: Understanding the context of both sentences. \\"The luck of the Irish\\" is an expression that refers to the good fortune that people of Irish descent are said to possess or experience. The context here is about the Irish people and their supposed fortune. \\"They say luck is a lady\\" is an expression that personifies luck as a woman. The phrase comes from the song \\"Luck Be a Lady\\" from the musical Guys and Dolls and suggests that luck is capricious or changeable like a woman's whims, while also implying a certain charm or allure to luck. Step 2: Comparing the meanings of \\"luck\\" in both sentences. In the first sentence, \\"luck\\" is specifically tied to the idea of the Irish people and their good fortune. It is a cultural reference and is meant to convey a sense of fortune or blessings that Irish people may have. In the second sentence, \\"luck\\" is anthropomorphized, or given human qualities, as a lady. It refers to the changeable nature of luck and also implies a certain appeal or charm that luck may have, suggesting that people are drawn to luck and the idea of good fortune. Step 3: Conclusion. Although both sentences utilize the concept of luck, they do so in slightly different ways. In the first sentence, luck is tied to the Irish people, while in the second sentence, it is personified as a lady with capricious, changeable qualities. Therefore, the meaning of \\"luck\\" in these two sentences is not exactly the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Despite their numerous advantages, contact lenses have also been linked with certain health risks, including eye infections. Specialists at the renowned Moorfields Eye Hospital in London have recently reported a concerning rise in eye infections among contact lens wearers, urging users to take extra care and follow proper hygiene guidelines to avoid potential issues. The Problem: Moorfields Eye Hospital, a world-famous center of excellence for ophthalmic care and research, has witnessed a significant increase in the number of contact lens-related infections. These infections can vary in severity, ranging from mild irritation to severe cases requiring hospitalization. The most worrisome aspect is the potential for irreparable damage to the eye, which can sometimes result in permanent vision loss. Causes of Eye Infections in Contact Lens Wearers: One of the primary causes of this surge in contact lens-related eye infections is improper lens handling and insufficient hygiene practices. Many users neglect critical aspects of lens care, such as regular cleaning, disinfection, and replacement. Some of the leading factors contributing to the risk of infection include: 1. Inadequate hand-washing before lens insertion or removal 2. Using saliva or tap water to wet or clean the lenses 3. Failure to clean and replace the lens storage case regularly 4. Sleeping, swimming, or showering with contact lenses in 5. Prolonged use of lenses, including wearing them beyond their recommended replacement schedule Preventive Measures: In light of the recent increase in eye infections, Moorfields Eye Hospital specialists have offered a series of recommendations to help contact lens users maintain good ocular health and minimize the risk of complications: 1. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before handling contact lenses 2. Avoid using tap water or saliva to clean lenses; always use a sterile, commercially available lens solution 3. Store lenses in a clean case, filled with fresh contact lens solution after every use; replace the case at least once every three months 4. Remove lenses before swimming, showering, or sleeping, as these activities can introduce harmful microbes to the eyes 5. Follow the prescribed contact lens replacement schedule and routine eye check-ups Raising Awareness: Both eye care professionals and contact lens manufacturers share the responsibility of spreading awareness about the safe handling and care of contact lenses. While manufacturers need to emphasize proper use through packaging, instructions, and communication campaigns, eye care professionals have a crucial role in educating their patients about infection risks and ensuring that they adhere to the recommended guidelines. Conclusion: Contact lenses have certainly improved the lives of millions of people worldwide. However, the rise in eye infections among contact lens users reported by Moorfields Eye Hospital highlights the importance of vigilance and strict adherence to proper care and hygiene guidelines. By taking these precautions and raising awareness, we can continue to enjoy the benefits of these revolutionary devices while ensuring the health and safety of our eyes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Image copyright Saifee Hospital Image caption Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty after the surgery An Egyptian woman, believed to be the world's heaviest at 500kg (1,102lb), has undergone weight reduction surgery. A spokesperson at Mumbai's Saifee Hospital said Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty, 36, had lost 100kg since arriving in India in January. \\"We are trying to get her fit enough to fly back to Egypt as soon as possible,\\" the hospital said in a statement. Her family said she had not left her house for 25 years until she came to Mumbai on a chartered plane. The spokesperson told the BBC that she was likely to lose more weight in the coming months. The surgery was performed by a team of doctors led by bariatric surgeon, Dr Muffazal Lakdawala. Bariatric surgery, also known as weight loss surgery, is used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese (having a body mass index of 40 or above or 35 plus other obesity-related health conditions). Image copyright Saifee Hospital Image caption Ms Abd El Aty before the surgery Ms Abd El Aty's family says she weighed 5kg (11lb) at birth and was diagnosed with elephantiasis, a condition in which body parts swell due to a parasitic infection. By the time she was 11, her weight had risen sharply and she suffered a stroke which left her bedridden. She is cared for by her mother and sister. However, Dr Lakdawala told the BBC in December that he believed Ms Abd El Aty did not have elephantiasis but suffered from obesity-related lymphoedema which causes gigantic swelling of the legs. What is bariatric surgery? Bariatric surgery, also known as weight loss surgery, is used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese and carrying an excessive amount of body fat. The two most common types of weight loss surgery are: Gastric band, where a band is used to reduce the size of the stomach so a smaller amount of food is required to make someone feel full ||||| Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty, the nearly 500-kg Egyptian and possibly the world’s heaviest woman, successfully underwent a surgery to reduce the size of her stomach at Mumbai’s Saifee Hospital, doctors said on Thursday. Doctors at Saifee Hospital said Ahmed underwent a sleeve gastrostomy, a surgical weight-loss procedure that reduces the size of the stomach to 15% of its original size, on March 7. Doctors also removed a large portion of the 36-year-old’s stomach fat and limited her food consumption ability. “Once she is stable, she will return to her hometown and her weight loss progress will be tracked by the team of doctors. She has already lost over 100kg with the help of liquid diet, including protein and fibre supplements, and we are hoping that she will lose another 100kg during the course of 6-8 months,” one of the doctors treating Ahmed said. She will go back to the port city of Alexandria with the help of the money raised through an online crowd-funding campaign started by her family and the Saifee Hospital trust. As Eman will need a series of bariatric procedures over the next few years to achieve best results, her travel costs are going to be covered by the online crowdfunding campaign started under the banner of, ‘Help Save Eman - The Heaviest Woman in the World.’ The campaign, which intends to raise about Rs 50 lakh, has almost reached its halfway with 196 supporters donating over Rs 21 lakh. She had not left her house for 25 years until she was flown to Mumbai in a special cargo aircraft in February to undergo medical treatment for weight reduction.

Fact: chemical splashing can cause harm to the eyes Question: Which would damage the eyes the most in a laboratory setting without protection? What's the answer? Available options: I. a stray cat. II. an acidic spray. III. a chainsaw. IV. your thumb.","completion":"To answer the question correctly, let's analyze each option individually: I. A stray cat: In a laboratory setting, a stray cat could potentially harm eyes through scratches or if a person is allergic. But compared to other options, the threat it poses to eyes is significantly less. II. An acidic spray: This aligns with the initially mentioned fact that \\"chemical splashing can cause harm to the eyes\\". An acidic spray in a laboratory scenario would likely cause significant damage to the eyes, especially if the individual is not wearing any form of protective eye gear. III. A chainsaw: While dangerous overall, the likelihood of a chainsaw specifically causing harm to the eyes in a laboratory setting (unless used very irresponsibly) is lower than the direct hazard an acidic spray would pose. IV. Your thumb: Unless deliberately poked into the eye or in case of an accident, your thumb generally wouldn't harm your eyes. Given these analyses, we can conclude that in a laboratory setting without protection, an acidic spray (Option II) would pose the most danger to the eyes due to its chemical content and the possibility of splash or direct contact with the eyes.

Please briefly summarize this news article: LaHood Sponsored Millions in Earmarks The former Republican congressman chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to direct billions in federal highway spending has been an unapologetic advocate of earmarks, a practice Obama now opposes, and has used his influence to win funding for projects pushed by some of his largest campaign contributors. Ray LaHood, who represented Illinois in the House for seven terms, sponsored 60 million in earmarks last year, steering at least 9 million in federal money to campaign donors, a Washington Post analysis shows. An opponent of earmark reform efforts in Congress, LaHood ranks roughly among the top 10 percent in the House for sponsoring earmarks in 2008, according to a watchdog group. LaHood's record poses an important question as hearings begin today that will explore how he would administer part of a 775 billion stimulus package that will be directed to the Transportation Department. LaHood has defended his use of earmarks as a way to direct federal money to decaying communities in his district and insisted there is no connection between his earmarks and projects benefiting campaign donors. Obama has pledged to resist pressure from local interests and to block unjustified earmarks from inclusion in the stimulus bill. \\"We're not having earmarks in the recovery package, period,\\" he said Jan. 7. The stimulus package would include the largest wave of federal transportation spending since the Eisenhower administration launched the creation of the interstate highway system. Transition spokesman Dan Leistikow credited LaHood for \\"14 years of honorable and outstanding service as a congressman, fighting on behalf of his constituents and creating jobs for working families.\\" LaHood, 62, a longtime member of the House Appropriations Committee until his retirement last month, declined to comment. Government watchdog groups say LaHood's selection does not bode well for Obama's pledge to return transparency to government spending. Earmarks are often last-minute insertions in federal spending bills and are not subject to normal reviews. LaHood also has been criticized for his ties to a longtime Republican state kingmaker in Illinois, William F. Cellini Sr., who was indicted in the \\"pay-to-play\\" criminal investigation underway by the office of Northern District U.S. Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald. Cellini has denied wrongdoing. \\"This guy has history of pork barrel spending and lot of a questionable spending linked to his friends. He's going to be in charge of funneling hundreds of billions of dollars into local projects . . . and he's not going to be suddenly changing his stripes tomorrow,\\" said Leslie Paige of the watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste. LaHood's biggest campaign donor is Peoria's largest corporation: Caterpillar. The company and its workers have donated more than 190,000 to LaHood since 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Last year, LaHood secured 7.8 million to help the company and its offshoots develop technologies for potential future military contracts. Last year, he also pushed for 333,000 to construct the new Lakeview Museum in Peoria, part of a project that will include a Caterpillar-financed museum focused on the company's history. LaHood sponsored 1.49 million in earmarks directed to Springfield's Memorial Medical Center to fund the purchase of computer-based simulation technology and other equipment. Memorial and its lobbyist Cassidy and Associates together have given 60,000 to LaHood. Local road-building companies also have supported LaHood. United Contractors Midwest, led by president James Bruner, is often ranked as his second or third largest donor, and its officials have donated 24,925 to LaHood. Three leading members of the Illinois Asphalt Pavement Association have given more than 60,000 to LaHood. Last year, he proposed 2 million in road-paving projects, including at least one 245,000 check that the recipient never sought. The money would help an Illinois cemetery resurface its roadways. \\"Congressman LaHood's staff called me, saying, 'We know your roads are in bad condition. What can we do?' said LuAnn Johnson, executive director of the Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield. \\"We were thrilled for the chance for federal dollars.\\" LaHood's road-building earmarks have highlighted his relationship with Cellini, head of the Illinois Asphalt Pavement Association and other businesses. Cellini was indicted in October on charges of shaking down government vendors to raise money for Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Cellini has longtime ties to Blagojevich and is accused in a separate civil lawsuit of striking a deal with the governor to raise money for him in exchange for control over key state jobs. In a Peoria newspaper article last year that celebrated his career, mayors cheered LaHood's earmarks, with one noting that \\"Ray's fingerprints are on everything around here.\\" LaHood defended using his sway to fund good, local ideas. \\"The reason I went on the Appropriations Committee, the reason other people go on the Appropriations Committee, is they know that it puts them in a position to know where the money is at, to know the people who are doling out the money and to be in the room when the money is being doled out,\\" he said. Some beneficiaries are little known outside the district. LaHood sponsored more than 1 million in earmarks to build a Peoria/NEXT incubator, a technology development project. A Morton, Ill.-based firm, Otto Baum, was chosen in 2006 to build part of the center. The firm wrote LaHood a 2,300 campaign check last year. LaHood also has advocated for the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, which relied upon 40 million in federal funds. He sponsored a 5 million earmark in 2004 to finish the building. Staff researchers Julie Tate and Madonna Lebling contributed to this report. Summary:","completion":"Ray LaHood, a former Republican congressman chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to direct billions in federal highway spending, has been an advocate of earmarks, despite Obama opposing the practice. LaHood sponsored 60 million in earmarks in 2008, steering at least 9 million in federal money to campaign donors. As hearings begin for LaHood to administer part of a 775 billion stimulus package for the Transportation Department, his use of earmarks could be an area of scrutiny.

While parts of Britain are mopping up after flash floods and others are basking in warm weather, stranger things appear to be happening in the sky. One photographer captured sun streaming through the clouds which looked like a spaceship was about to land or something out of 70’s movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, while another snapped a cloud in Exeter in the shape of a magic carpet. Photographer Adrian Campfield was having dinner with his wife Louise at a restaurant at Beachy Head, East Sussex, when the eery rays suddenly appeared from between the clouds and beamed onto the water. Scroll down for video. Paranormal activity: Photographer Adrian Campfield took this image at Beachy Head in Sussex and said it looked like 'something from Close Encounters of a Third Kind' Mr Campfield said the eery lights were changing for about 15 minutes at Beachy Head in Sussex. The 59-year-old rushed outside onto the 535ft high cliffs to watch the spectacle unfold. Mr Campfield, a former graphic designer, from Bexley, Kent, said the light was changing for more than 15 minutes. He said: ‘I have taken pictures of rays before but never quite like this. It brought to mind the sequences from the film 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. ‘I was pleasantly shocked and stunned because you never expect to witness anything like this. This was an outstanding sight and I was very lucky to be in the right place at the right time.’ Mr Campfield took more than 50 photos, including his favourite of a gull standing on the rocky cliff edge. The rays looked similar to a scene from Spielberg's 1977 sci-fi film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. A message from outer space? A seagull watches the bizarre light shining through the clouds at Beachy Head. He said: ‘We looked out of the restaurant window and saw those rays starting to appear over the sea. Once outside, the height of the cliffs was ideal because my eye level was above the horizon, giving me much more dramatic angles and perspectives. ‘I had to work fast because the light and rays were changing all the time and the atmosphere and moods were fantastic.’ Meanwhile residents in Exeter, Devon, were amazed when they spotted what looks like a flying carpet in the sky. Magic carpet ride? Residents in Exeter, Devon, took this incredible shot of a cloud in the shape of a rectangle. Unsurprisingly Met Office experts rubbished claims this could be a close encounter of the third kind and explained the cloud was caused by a jet engine moving through a pocket of air. But officials at the Met Office was quick to dismiss the possibility of an encounter of the third kind. Met Office employee Laura Gilchrist tweeted the image on July 26: ‘So this evening, over Exeter, there was a rhombus-shaped cloud’. A spokesman for the Met Office said the cloud had been formed by a jet engine moving through a pocket of air with the ‘right conditions’. He said: ‘This cloud has been formed from the exhaust of a jet engine - known as a contrail.‘In this case an aircraft has moved through a pocket of air with the right conditions for the contrail to form, meaning there is just a short section. ‘The wind is blowing across the contrail, and due to the right atmospheric conditions this is causing the ice crystals in that trail to spread outwards - creating this rectangular shaped cloud. ‘It’s unusual to see the cloud edges quite so well-defined as in this example but the processes involved are very common.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Step 1: Analyze the premise The premise states that Jones-Lee and Krupnick may understate the effect of age because they only control for income and do not control for wealth. Step 2: Identify the variables The variables at play are: - Age - Income - Wealth Step 3: Assess the relationship between the variables in the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that both income and wealth are important to consider when it comes to age. Step 4: Compare the premise and the hypothesis The premise highlights a potential issue in how age is being assessed – that is, by not controlling for wealth. The hypothesis also emphasizes that both income and wealth should be considered. Step 5: Determine if the premise supports the hypothesis If we assume the premise is true, then it is more likely that the hypothesis is also true. By acknowledging that not considering wealth may lead to a potential understatement, the premise aligns with the hypothesis's suggestion that both factors are important when examining age.

Background: Patsy Matsu Takemoto Mink (Zhu Ben matsu, Takemoto Matsu, December 6, 1927 - September 28, 2002) was an American lawyer and politician from the U.S. state of Hawaii. Mink was a third generation Japanese American and member of the Democratic Party. She also was the Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. Mink served in the U.S. House of Representatives for a total of 12 terms, representing Hawaii's first and second congressional districts. Context: While attending the University of Chicago Law School, Patsy met hydrologist John Mink while playing bridge at the International House. He would become her husband and lifelong partner. Unable to find work as a married, female, Asian-American attorney, she returned to her student job at the University of Chicago Law School library while her husband found work immediately with the United States Steel Corporation. In 1952, Patsy gave birth to daughter Gwendolyn (Wendy), who later became a prominent author and educator on labor and women's issues. The family soon moved Hawaii in August 1952. By law, Patsy was required to take the residency status of her husband after marriage and needed to re-establish her Hawaiian residency in order to prove that she was eligible to take the Hawaii bar exam. After challenging the statute as sexist, Hawaii's attorney general ruled that since she had not ever physically resided in Pennsylvania, she had not assumed her husband's Philadelphia residency status. After passing the bar exam in June 1953, Mink continued to face gender discrimination in finding work as an attorney in the private or public sector. She created a solo practice with the help of her father. She was the first Japanese woman to practice law in Hawaiian territory. Mink founded the Everyman Organization, a group that served as the hub of the Young Democrats club on Oahu. She was elected chairman of the territory-wide Young Democrats, \\"a group that would wield a remarkable influence over Hawaiian politics for several decades.\\" In 1954, Patsy worked to help elect John A. Burns to Congress. The following year, she worked as staff attorney during the 1955 legislative session and drafted statutes and observed the inner-workings of the legislature. As the Territory of Hawaii debated statehood in 1956, Mink was elected to the Hawaii Territorial Legislature representing her district in the territorial House of Representatives. In 1958, she was elected to serve in the territorial Senate. In 1959, Hawaii became the 50th state of the Union. From 1962-1964, Mink served in the Hawaii State Senate. At the 1960 Democratic National Convention, a speech by Mink, a Hawaiian delegate, persuaded two-thirds of the party to keep their progressive stance on civil rights. Question: Did they have any children? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Patsy Mink and her husband had a child named Gwendolyn, who is also known as Wendy. She later became a prominent author and educator on labor and women's issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Remove the glue with isopropyl alcohol.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Easy Dent Repair with a Glue Gun: A Step-by-Step Guide Introduction Dents are a car owner's nightmare. They can happen at any time, detract from a vehicle's appearance, and be surprisingly expensive to fix. However, there is a simple and affordable method to repair dents without having to visit a professional - using a glue gun and a few essential tools. In this article, we will outline a step-by-step guide to help you remove pesky dents using a glue gun. Materials and Tools Needed Before diving into the repair process, ensure you have the following tools and materials on hand: 1. Glue gun 2. Glue sticks 3. Pulling tabs (with various sizes and shapes) 4. Dent pulling mechanism (often referred to as a dent puller/lifter) 5. Isopropyl alcohol 6. Clean cloth Step-by-Step Dent Repair Process Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace and Plug in the Glue Gun Choose a well-lit, flat surface to work on, and ensure that the temperature is above 50°F (10°C) to promote proper glue adhesion. Plug in your glue gun and let it heat up for about 5-10 minutes. Step 2: Select the Right Pulling Tab for the Dent Carefully inspect the dent and choose a pulling tab that best fits its size and shape. Selecting the correct tab is essential, as it will allow for more effective pulling and a smoother end result. Step 3: Apply Glue to the Pulling Tab Once the glue gun has reached its optimal temperature, apply a generous amount of glue to the selected pulling tab. Ensure an even distribution of glue across the tab for better adhesion. Step 4: Position the Pulling Tab on the Dent Carefully place the glue-covered pulling tab at the center of the dent. Firmly press down to ensure it sticks to the dented area and hold it in place for about 30-60 seconds to allow the glue to bond. Step 5: Attach the Dent Pulling Mechanism With the pulling tab securely attached to the dent, connect the dent pulling mechanism. Ensure it is properly aligned with the tab and provides even distribution of pulling force. Step 6: Turn the Knob to Pull the Dent Out Slowly and cautiously turn the knob on the dent pulling mechanism. This action will gradually lift the dent. You may hear a \\"popping\\" sound when the dent is finally pulled out. If the dent doesn't come out on the first attempt, simply repeat steps 3 to 6 until you achieve satisfactory results. Step 7: Remove Excess Glue with Isopropyl Alcohol With the dent successfully removed, it's time to clean up any remaining glue. Soak a clean cloth in isopropyl alcohol and gently rub the area where the glue residue remains. The alcohol will dissolve the glue, allowing you to easily wipe it away. Conclusion In conclusion, fixing small to medium-sized dents can be achieved easily and cost-effectively using a glue gun and the steps outlined in this guide. This method not only saves money but also helps preserve your vehicle's appearance, making it a valuable skill for every car owner."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the institution that provides Australian Army officer training? The two main tertiary institutions are the Australian National University (ANU) in Acton and the University of Canberra (UC) in Bruce, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively. Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available.

How to clean a furnace filter Turn off the furnace. Never remove a furnace filter while the furnace is running. Make sure to switch the furnace off before you begin.","completion":"Alright! Now that you've turned off the furnace, we can safely clean the furnace filter. Here's what happens next: 1. Find the filter: Look for your furnace filter. It's typically found inside the furnace or within the air return duct, near the blower motor. It may be behind a door or panel, so you might need to take that off. 2. Remove the filter: Carefully slide the filter out of its slot or housing. Be gentle, so you don't accidentally damage the filter or any nearby parts. 3. Check the filter type: There are different types of furnace filters, including disposable and reusable ones. Check if your filter is reusable, which means you can clean it and put it back. If it's disposable, you will need to replace it with a new one. 4. Clean reusable filters: If the filter is reusable, first tap it gently on the ground or a surface to remove loose dirt and dust. Then, use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to clean the filter. Make sure the vacuum cleaner is set on low suction, so it doesn't damage the filter. After vacuuming, you can also rinse the filter with water to remove any remaining dirt. But remember to let the filter dry completely before putting it back in the furnace. 5. Replace disposable filters: If the filter is disposable, you'll need to buy a new filter that matches the size and type of your old filter. Remove the old filter and insert the new one. Be sure the airflow arrow on the filter is pointing in the proper direction, which is usually towards the blower motor. 6. Put the filter back: Once the reusable filter is dry or you have a new disposable filter, slide it back into its slot or housing. Make sure it fits snugly and is in the right position. 7. Close the furnace: If you removed a door or panel to access the filter, put that back and secure it in place. 8. Turn on the furnace: Now that everything is clean and back in place, you can safely turn the furnace back on. And that's it! You've successfully cleaned or replaced your furnace filter. It's a good idea to do this every few months or as needed to keep your furnace running efficiently and maintain good air quality in your home."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Henry Havelock Ellis, known as Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 - 8 July 1939), was an English physician, writer, progressive intellectual and social reformer who studied human sexuality. He co-authored the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as on transgender psychology. He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. Context: Ellis was strongly opposed to the idea of castration for eugenic purposes. In 1909, regulations were introduced at the Cantonal Asylum in Bern, which allowed those deemed 'unfit' and with strong sexual inclinations to be mandatorily sterilized. In a particular instance, several men and women, including epileptics and pedophiles were castrated, some of whom voluntarily requested it. While the results were positive, in that none of the subjects were found guilty of any more sexual offences, Ellis remained staunchly opposed to the practice. His view on the origin of these inclinations was that sexual impulses do not reside in the sexual organs, but rather they persist in the brain. Moreover, he posited that the sexual glands provided an important source of internal secretions vital for the functioning of the organism, and thus their removal could greatly injure the patient. However, already in his time, Ellis was witness to the rise of vasectomies and ligatures of the Fallopian tubes, which performed the same sterilization without removing the whole organ. In these cases, Ellis was much more favorable, yet still maintaining that \\"sterilization of the unfit, if it is to be a practical and humane measure commanding general approval, must be voluntary on the part of the person undergoing it, and never compulsory.\\" His opposition to such a system was not only rooted in morality. Rather, Ellis also considered the practicality of the situation, hypothesizing that if an already mentally unfit man is forced to undergo sterilization, he would only become more ill-balanced, and would end up committing more anti-social acts. Though Ellis was never at ease with the idea of forced sterilizations, he was willing to find ways to circumvent that restriction. His focus was on the social ends of eugenics, and as a means to it, Ellis was in no way against 'persuading' 'volunteers' to undergo sterilization by withdrawing Poor Relief from them. While he preferred to convince those he deemed unfit using education, Ellis supported coercion as a tool. Furthermore, he supported adding ideas about eugenics and birth control to the education system in order to restructure society, and to promote social hygiene. For Ellis, sterilization seemed to be the only eugenic instrument that could be used on the mentally unfit. In fact, in his publication The Sterilization of the Unfit, Ellis argued that even institutionalization could not guarantee the complete prevention of procreation between the unfit, and thus, \\"the burdens of society, to say nothing of the race, are being multiplied. It is not possible to view sterilization with enthusiasm when applied to any class of people...but what, I ask myself, is the practical alternative?\\" Question: what were the regulations about? Answer:","completion":"The regulations were about allowing people who were considered 'unfit' and had strong sexual inclinations to be mandatorily sterilized. These regulations were introduced at the Cantonal Asylum in Bern in 1909. They led to several men and women, including epileptics and pedophiles, being castrated, with some even voluntarily requesting the procedure.

SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government... Question: How does Kim Jong Un feel about being denuclearized the way Libya was?

You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonX will be seen as what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, PersonX will be seen as the Tail if the Tail describes PersonX's persona or attribute as perceived by others given an event. In the gift-giving example, X may be seen as generous or giving. In contrast, in an event such as PersonX steals a car, PersonX may be perceived as evil.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: It is one of the most annoying words in the English language and it seems there is no escaping it. The word \\"huh?\\" is in worldwide use, a study found. Researchers discovered that languages spoken in countries from Ghana and Laos to Iceland and Italy all include \\"huh?\\", or something that sounds very like it. They said that while the study may sound silly, the word is an absolutely necessary part of speech. Without it and similar words, it would be impossible to show that we haven't heard or understood what had been said and this would lead to constant misunderstandings. But while other words used in the same context, such as \\"sorry\\" or \\"what\\", vary widely across languages, \\"huh?\\" remains unchanged. The Dutch researchers carefully studied ten languages from around the world, including Siwu, which is spoken in Ghana, and an Australian Aboriginal language, as well as Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Mandarin Chinese. They analysed tapes of recorded conversations for words that sounded like \\"huh?\\" and were used to request that whatever had just been said be repeated. All contained a version of \\"huh?\\". The word was also found in another 21 languages. While there were subtle differences in each country, all sounded basically the same. This is surprising because normally unrelated languages will use very different words to describe the same thing. For instance, the Japanese for \\"dog\\" is \\"inu\\", while the French is \\"chien\\". It is thought that languages around the world have developed their own version of \\"huh?\\" because the sound is quick and simple to form, as well as being easily understood. The researchers, said that it might seem unimportant to carry out scientific research into a word like \\"huh?\\" but in fact this little word is an essential tool in human communication. They also have an answer for those who claim that \\"huh?\\" isn't a word. They say that it qualifies because of the small differences in its pronunciation in different languages.

Spain bans Basque party Prime MinisterÂ Aznar (L)Â withÂ the president of theÂ Popular Party inthe Basque Country,Â Carlos Iturgaitz. The separatist Batasuna party has been banned for three years by Judge Baltasar Garzon, who accused it of supporting the outlawed armed separatist group ETA. It is the first time since the 1975 death of dictator General Francisco Franco that a political party has been banned. Although Batasuna has angered many Spanish politicians for its refusal to condemn ETA bomb attacks, the party denies any links with the armed group. The party's former leader, Arnaldo Otegi, had warned the regional government that siding with Madrid, or Judge Garzon against Batasuna would have \\"undesirable consequences\\", but he did not elaborate on what may happen next. Meanwhile,Â Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has called for the Socialist Party (PSOE) to put aside their differences and form an alliance in the Basque Country to keep Basque nationalists from running town councils. Earlier, socialist regional leader Patxi Lopez criticized Aznarâs Popular Party's (PP) hard line approach in the Basque Country, which he saidÂ was aimed to win votes elsewhere in Spain. However, he left the door open to a political pact.Â \\"The PP is playing with the Basque Country, and not in favor of it,\\" he said, adding âwe have not pacted with the PP for a year and a half, but a deal after May 25? Well, why not.\\" Aznar's ruling Popular Party has much at stake in Sunday's municipal vote across Spain.

Slowly test how much power you need to use so you don’t damage your bat. Swing the mallet with enough power to leave an indentation in the middle of the hitting area. If it’s difficult to see an indentation on the bat, loosen the clamp and hold it up to a light to see if you’ve made a dent. Repeatedly hit the entire flat area of the bat since a ball may be hit anywhere on the surface. Use the same amount of power you used to make your initial indentation across the face of the bat. The entire process should take about 6 hours. As you increase power, continue making the surface of the bat even so it is flat. Split your time knocking the wood into 10 or 15 10-minute sessions so you don’t get burnt out. Test the wood with your fingernail occasionally. At first, your fingernail should leave an impression in the wood’s surface, but after you’ve knocked it in, it will be harder to press. Ask a friend to toss gentle pitches to you with an old cricket ball so you can hit them back with the bat. This helps you detect if any sections of the bat hit unevenly. If they do hit unevenly, go back and strike the areas with a mallet again. Using a new ball could damage the bat if it is hit improperly. Alternatively, put the ball in a sock and tie it to a rope.

It's a yakuza/triad picture, involving cops versus Japanese &/or Chinese gangsters (mostly Chinese, as the title suggests), but already even in his first technical 'debut', Takashi Miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here-on in. Social issues like black market trading of precious goods, in this case human organs usually from children; nostalgia for childhood and one's roots, which was especially prevalent in Dead or Alive 2; thumbing-of-the-nose at taboos like gay sex and (satirical) rape/violence towards women; blood-curdling violence. It's certainly not as surreal as some of Miike's most recent films, but this is expected as he's trying out things that he's just starting to learn, following a track record of straight to video programmers. It's got all of those qualities, and it's also, like the films that would follow from it, equally savage and heartfelt, crazy (in spots) and sardonic in its drama, and solid for genre fans. The story concerns two brothers, one a Chinese orphan raised in Japan, Tatsuhito Kiriya (Kippei Shiina, pretty decent as a Eastwood-esquire anti-hero/hero), who's become a detective, and another, who's become a gangster, or a would-be one. The main arch likely takeover gang comes from Wang (a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare-time, played by Tomorowo Taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes), and his partner Karino (Takeshi Caesar, who's threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who's just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal), who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a Miike movie. There's some intrigue involving the organ-trading scheme with the gangsters, which Kiriya almost becomes a victim of, and the gang's penchant for gay sex- at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want. It all leads up to vengeance and redemption, qualities that Miike and his writer are trying to emulate from Shakespeare (hence the Macbeth bit with Wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying \\"it won't come off\\"). If it doesn't add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great Shakespeare play would have, it's par for the course of a film like this. Miike's goals are met, though just met, in his low-scale ambitions: a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble (the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents), notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime, and what the realm of unrepentant sex, with both sexes, brings out psychologically in the characters. At the same time, Shinjuku Triad Society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black-comedy from the Miike oeuvre. Some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness, like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face, or the randomness of the \\"interrogation\\" as it goes into a very twisted area. There's even a laugh-out-loud line from the young sex-slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses: \\"Thank you, Mr. Weeny-Burger.\\" Miike and his writer don't have enough here to make the film a full-on dark comedy like Ichi or, of course, Visitor Q, but there's enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters. As the first entry of the \\"Black Society\\" trilogy, as it's called, I was quite impressed, and it's a fine quasi-calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema.

Into the 1990s, when the prize every snooker fan wanted was a John Virgo waistcoat. While Big Break entertained millions of television viewers on Saturday evenings, Stephen Hendry became the sport's dominant force and many of snooker's colourful characters from the 1980s drifted out of the game's elite.

If your hair is damaged, oily, or limp, wash and condition it with something designed to create volume. If your hair is thick or not particularly oily, do not wash it before curling. Simply apply a dry shampoo to your roots. If your hair usually has trouble holding a curl, skip washing it for a day or two before curling. This should help make your hair more malleable. Using less conditioner, or none at all, may also help. Again, this will be different for different hair types. If your hair is damaged, oily, or limp, spray it with a heat protectant from root to ends while it is still damp. Apply a strong-hold mousse liberally—you can do this at the roots to achieve a fuller look, or from mid-shaft to ends for a looser one. Blow dry upside-down until your hair is totally dry. If your hair is thick or not particularly oily, spray it from roots to ends with heat protectant, and work a liberal amount of strong-hold mousse through your whole head. You may not be able to afford lots of specialized hair products, especially if you don't curl your hair often, or you may be curling your hair on short notice and not have time to run out to the store. These recommended products will help your hair keep its curl and protect it from heat damage, but you can still achieve a beautiful curl without them. That said, it is highly recommended that at a minimum you have hair spray, and something to help protect your hair from heat (especially if you plan on curling it regularly). There are many shampoos that help with the latter, in addition to all the heat protectant sprays on the market. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses various approaches for preparing hair for curling based on different hair types. For damaged, oily, or limp hair, it suggests washing and conditioning with volumizing products. On the other hand, for thick or less oily hair, it recommends not washing before curling and using dry shampoo instead. To help hair hold a curl, skipping washing it for a day or two might be helpful, as well as using less or no conditioner. For better results and protection, the article advises using heat protectant sprays from roots to ends for all hair types and applying a strong-hold mousse liberally. Depending on the desired look, the mousse can be applied at the roots for a fuller look or from mid-shaft to ends for a looser one. Blow drying upside down is also suggested for those with damaged, oily, or limp hair. Although specialized hair products are recommended for maintaining curl and protecting hair from heat damage, achieving a beautiful curl without them is still possible. However, it is highly recommended to have at least a hair spray and a heat protectant product, such as shampoos or sprays specifically designed for this purpose."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Media playback is not supported on this device Leigh Halfpenny kicked all of Wales' points, converting four of his five penalty kicks before going off injured. South Africa were limited to two Pat Lambie penalties as Wales largely contained the Springboks attacking threat. The tourists had a late five-metre scrum but the Wales pack disrupted the set-piece to seal a famous win. Perhaps of more concern, however, was the injury to captain Jean de Villiers, who was carried off having dislocated his kneecap. Much of the build-up to the match featured Wales coach Warren Gatland fielding questions about whether he was under pressure because of losses this series to Australia and New Zealand, taking his record to just one win in 27 matches against the southern hemisphere big three. This win, to add to Wales' previous victory over South Africa in 1999 - also at the Millennium Stadium - provided a perfect riposte and kick-starts their build-up to next year's World Cup in England. Opposite number Heyneke Meyer had not been under quite the same scrutiny, although their 29-15 defeat by Ireland in their opening tour game had raised some questions that were answered in subsequent wins over England and Italy. Both sides were missing players because of injuries and recalls to clubs, as this match took place outside World Rugby's official international window. With George North concussed, Liam Williams stepped into the vacant Wales wing slot, given the opportunity to redeem himself after conceding the last-gasp penalty try that denied them victory in June's second Test in Nelspruit. Gatland had also suffered a run of injuries among his loose-head props, while Paul James had to depart back to Bath, but he could still call on British and Irish Lion Gethin Jenkins to fill the number one shirt. Hooker Richard Hibbard had also been recalled to Gloucester, while South Africa had to change their entire back three with wing Bryan Habana and full-back Johan Goosen returning to France and JP Pietersen departing for Japan. Wales full-back Halfpenny and Springboks fly-half Lambie exchanged early penalties, with Halfpenny unfortunate to hit the outside of the post with a later effort. Space for the backs to work in was at a premium in a hotly contested first half, with both sides up quickly with some typically fierce defence. Wales' best moments came from chips ahead to turn the Springboks, the tactic enjoying particular success down the left wing. Twice Williams came close to collecting the bouncing ball to plunge over the try line, but each time Lwazi Mvovo was there a split-second before, covering across to snuff out the danger. South Africa almost broke the deadlock when Eben Etzebeth surged through the midfield, but he knocked on as the lock was scythed down by Halfpenny's thumping tackle on the 22-yard line. Lambie missed a long-range penalty that would have sent the Boks into the changing rooms with a narrow half-time lead, leaving the match delicately poised at the halfway stage. Halfpenny and Lambie again exchanged early penalties after the restart, with the Springbok stand-off showing his range by slotting from the halfway line. Wales enjoyed the best period of the game after that, keeping the ball in hand to pressurise the visitors into conceding two more penalties that Halfpenny converted. Through all of this, the Wales half-back partnership of Rhys Webb and Dan Biggar shone, using possession wisely and keeping a level of control that South Africa found hard to wrest away. Meyer used his bench early, making four changes including putting Handre Pollard on at fly-half in place of Lambie. But the Springboks coach was forced into another change soon when captain De Villiers was carried off, replaced by Damian de Allende. South Africa suffered a further blow when Cornal Hendricks was sin-binned for taking out Halfpenny in the air. The Wales 15 was clearly shaken by the collision and left the field soon after, with Scott Williams coming on and Liam Williams switching to his preferred full-back position. Spurred on by their man advantage, Wales laid siege to the Springboks line but met furious resistance as first Jamie Roberts and then Scott Baldwin were stopped just short. In the closing minutes, South Africa earned a five-metre scrum that threatened to undo all Wales' hard work and deliver another gut-wrenching late loss to a southern hemisphere side. But the Wales pack rose to the challenge, making a mess of South Africa's platform and allowing the ball to be cleared upfield. Wales kept their heads and kept the Springboks at bay for the final few moments to seal a well-deserved, and long overdue, win.

The president of the South African Football Association (SAFA) has been suspended as part of an investigation into match-fixing ahead of the country hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2010. Kirsten Nematandani and four other SAFA officials were suspended as an act of \\"good governence\\" following a report by football's global governing body FIFA, which adjudged four friendly matches ahead of Africa's first World Cup had been fixed. According to the FIFA report, the results of South Africa's matches with Thailand, Bulgaria, Colombia and Guatemala were prearranged for the benefit of convicted Singaporean match-fixer Wilson Perumal and his Football 4U organization. Nematandani declined to comment when contacted by CNN. Last year, Perumal was imprisoned in Finland after a court ruled that he had arranged the outcomes of at least seven league matches from 2008 onwards. The Singaporean was also heavily implicated in the match-fixing scandal that affected South Africa's neighbors Zimbabwe between 2007-2009, a process which has had repercussions for nearly 100 footballers while two former national coaches have been banned. The timing of FIFA's report into match-fixing involving the team known as Bafana Bafana comes at a bad time for South Africa, as it is just one month away from hosting the continent's showpiece football event -- the Africa Cup of Nations. The suspensions were announced by a SAFA emergency committee on Monday, ahead of an enquiry, with vice president Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana set to take interim charge of the governing body. \\"The emergency committee considered and accepted the report as received,\\" read an SAFA statement. \\"The emergency committee felt that the president would have to appear before the commission of enquiry to explain his role in the matter. \\"Having considered the implications of this for SAFA, the committee asked the president to take a voluntary leave of absence from his position. \\"All members of staff mentioned in the report who will need to give evidence at the commission are likewise put on special administrative leave pending the finalization of the enquiry, or pending receiving a clearance from the commission. \\"This action in no way implies that these individuals were involved in match fixing. It is again simply for good governance that this measure is being implemented. \\"The members of staff so affected are: Dennis Mumble, Lindile 'Ace' Kika, Adeel Carelse and Barney Kujane.\\" The SAFA was unavailable to clarify what the FIFA report might mean for South African football or what action they may take after the inquiry. The organization said last week it wanted to \\"bring this unfortunate matter to a just and final conclusion.\\" Speaking as president -- before his suspension -- Nematandani said: \\"Having cooperated with FIFA during their investigation, we are happy that this matter is coming to its conclusion and our commitment to zero tolerance to corruption is well documented. \\"SAFA remains totally committed to working with FIFA to wipe out the scourge of corruption that is impacting on football globally.\\" Mumble is SAFA's new chief executive officer. Interim president Nonkonyama stressed how all parties involved should be considered innocent until proven guilty. \\"This is a difficult situation for the Association, and for those who have been named in the report. We hope that there will be no speculation about their presumed guilt or otherwise. \\"We need to allow the investigation to take place speedily and fairly, so those that are innocent can be separated from those who are not.\\" In a statement released last week, South African football's ruling body acknowledged that \\"Perumal and Football 4U managed to infiltrate SAFA prior to the World Cup, with an offer to assist with referee development. \\"The offer included providing FIFA-accredited referees at their cost for the friendly matches prior to the FIFA 2010 World Cup.\\" One of these games -- when South Africa beat Guatemala 5-0 in May 2010 -- featured the award of three penalties. A month later the 2010 World Cup was the first to be staged on the continent of Africa. Hosts South Africa were eliminated in the group stages, but, to the delight of African football fans, Ghana enjoyed a run to the quarterfinal.

All is going well until Diane receives a phone call from an odd-sounding stranger claiming his name is Evil, who announces on live television that when the clock strikes midnight in each time zone, a \\"Naughty Girl\\" will be \\"punished\\" (murdered), then the killer signs off with a threat claiming that Diane will be the last Naughty Girl to be punished.

Article: Food for thought in the US Before I left for America, everyone warned me to watch my weight because it's easy to put on weight there. That's true. One thing I still cannot _ is the food and drink. Almost every American person loves sodas, especially those full of ice cubes. I remember the first day I came to my host family. When I asked them for a glass of hot water, they all looked at me and thought I was crazy! At my school there's no water dispenser but there's one in each classroom in China. All the American students drink water from taps outside the restrooms that are specially designed for drinking. The water is cold and the school doesn't have hot water. The most popular food here is hamburgers and French chips, which are junk food in China. Most students who eat at school prefer those to salads. They also eat lots of pizzas and hot dogs. As a result, you can always see some really fat people in school. Luckily, my host mom is really a great cook. She always makes food from different countries and eats a balanced meal every day. So I have a lot of fruit and vegetables. At my host family's home, they usually eat biscuits. These old-fashioned biscuits are low in fat and flavored with buttermilk, butter, and a bit of honey. Oh here comes the most interesting thing: the word \\"biscuit\\" in China actually means \\"cracker \\" here. Real biscuits are a kind of soft cake. I was also amazed by the rich kinds of food in American supermarkets and their reasonable prices. For example, one brand of yogurt has 20 kinds of flavors! You're sure to find one that you like. And most of the food provides you \\"light\\", \\"original\\" or \\"no sugar\\" options to choose from. Question: What is the main idea of the article?

However, the author also appreciates the diverse meal options offered by their host family, and the variety of food choices available in American supermarkets.

Write some highlights for the following article: A Philippine clan leader's bizarre attempt to revive the territorial claims of a defunct Islamic sultanate on the island of Borneo appears to be falling apart. With his followers engaged in a deadly game of cat and mouse with Malaysian security forces in the villages and palm oil plantations of northeastern Borneo, the self-proclaimed Sultan of Sulu is calling for a cease-fire after the U.N. secretary-general urged an end to the violence. But Malaysia promptly rejected the proposal and said its security forces had killed more than 30 of the Filipino fighters on Thursday. Between 100 and 300 men from the southern Philippines came ashore in the area, in the Malaysian state of Sabah, about three weeks ago, claiming to be the Royal Army of the Sultanate of Sulu, a former kingdom in the region whose power has faded. Jamalul Kiram III, one of the clan leaders claiming to be the rightful sultan, says he sent the men, some of whom are armed, to Sabah to reassert the sultanate's sovereignty over the area. But their arrival in the coastal district of Lahad Datu caused alarm and embarrassment in Malaysia, which still pays a token fee each year to the sultanate for the lease of Sabah. While scrambling to explain how so many armed intruders had managed to slip through the maritime border that separates Sabah from the nearby southern Philippine islands, Malaysian security forces tried to persuade the clansmen to return home peacefully. But those efforts -- supported by the Philippine government, which is pursuing a peace initiative with Muslim rebels in its restive southern islands -- failed as clashes in Sabah late last week left about 28 people dead, including several Malaysian police officers. A Malaysian offensive. Malaysian authorities responded by launching an offensive using fighter jets, mortar shells and ground troops on Tuesday. They followed that up with what they called a \\"mopping up\\" operation, going house to house in the area, searching for the Filipino fighters. But Kiram's spokesman, Abraham Idjirani, said Wednesday that the Malaysian attack had missed its target, striking an area that the Filipino clansmen had already vacated. He claimed the group hadn't suffered casualties. A day later, Idjirani made the call for a cease-fire on behalf of Kiram, saying the clan was responding to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's plea for the fighting to stop. But Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Kuala Lumpur won't consider any request for a cease-fire as long as the armed intruders in Sabah refuse to lay down weapons unconditionally, the official news agency Bernama reported Thursday. Later on, Ismail Omar, the head of the Malaysian Police, said security forces had killed 32 \\"militants\\" in Sabah on Thursday, including one they believed had the rank of general, according to Bernama. The task of the Malaysian security forces in hunting down the clan members has been made more complicated by the strong ethnic ties between many of the people in Sabah and the southern Philippines. Many of the sultanate's followers are believed to have friends and family living in the area. Malaysian police have admitted that the Filipinos are blending in with the local population. In a statement Wednesday, Ban's office said the U.N. secretary-general \\"urges an end to the violence and encourages dialogue among all the parties for a peaceful resolution of the situation.\\" Ban also expressed concern about the effects of the fighting on the civilian population in the area, including migrants. People and goods regularly go back and forth across the porous sea border between Sabah and the southern Philippines. Eroded power. Established in the 15th century, the Sultanate of Sulu became an Islamic power center in the southern Philippines that at one point claimed sovereignty over Sabah. But the encroachment of Western colonial powers, followed by the emergence of the Philippines and Malaysia as independent nation states, steadily eroded the sultanate's influence. Sulu is now a province within the Republic of the Philippines. But the historical connection still fuels tensions between Malaysia and the Philippines, with Manila retaining a \\"dormant claim\\" to Sabah through the Sultanate of Sulu, according to the CIA World Factbook. The Philippines claims much of the eastern part of Sabah, which was leased to the British North Borneo Company in 1878 by the Sultanate of Sulu. In 1963, Britain transferred Sabah to Malaysia, a move that the sultanate claimed was a breach of the 1878 deal. CNN's Karen Smith contributed to this report.","completion":"A Philippine clan leader's attempt to revive the territorial claims of a defunct Islamic sultanate on the island of Borneo is faltering.

The father of Ibragim Todashev, who was shot by an FBI agent a week ago while being quizzed over his links to the Boston bombers, revealed the extent of his son's injuries in gruesome photographs of his dead body today. Outspoken Abdul-Baki Todashev called for an investigation and possible legal action against the agent involved at a press conference in Moscow where he showed the images of his son's body lying in a morgue with up to seven gunshot wounds, including one to the back of the head. His angry calls for justice came as a report claimed the 27-year-old native Chechen was unarmed in the clash with a federal agent in Florida on May 22. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT. Anger: Abdulbaki Todashev says his unarmed son was shot up to seven times including once to back of the head. Gruesome: The father showed images of his son's bullet-riddled body laying in a Florida morgue. Previous reports claimed the US citizen went for the agent with a knife while being interrogated in his home. However, a report by the Washington Post yesterday cited law enforcement officials saying he had no weapon. He allegedly did become violent when. police quizzed him over links to Tamerlan Tsarnaev and an unsolved 2011. triple homicide but he did not have a knife as previously claimed. 'Today I want justice. I want an investigation, so that these people (the FBI) are sued under US laws,' he said. 'These are not FBI agents. These are bandits and they must appear in court.' He said he received the 16 images of his son's body from a friend in the US. Graphic: Todashev said he had been emailed 16 images of his son's corpse from a friend in Florida. Shot dead: The father called for justice in the shooting of his son who was a US citizen. Todashev is pictured lying in a Florida morgue. His father claims they show brutal injuries from up to seven bullets including one to the back of the head. 'This is not a shot that you fire when you come under attack. This is a shot you fire to execute someone,' he said. 'Couldn't they just handcuff him? At the very least, they could have wounded him in the foot or shoulder. And here he was – killed execution style.' Deceased: Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot by an FBI agent. Initial reports said he had a knife but that was not true. He added that his son must have had information they didn't want him to reveal. 'They silenced him', he added. He. now plans to journey to the US to pick up his son's body and said he. had been to the US embassy in Moscow to apply for a visa to do so. Authorities were pressuring the younger Todashev to make a full confession to the murders of three men found in an apartment in Waltham, Mass. on the tenth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001. It is known Tamerlan Tsarnaev was close friends with one of the victims and the FBI have been looking into whether he was involved. Law enforcement sources told NBC that Todashev and Tsarnaev carried out the 2011 killings when a drug deal that turned violent. The suspects didn't want the three victims to be able to identify them, so they slit their throats, according to the network. It is that evidence which apparently led them to Todashev and his Orlando apartment not far from Universal Studios on May 22. He had questioned for some hours before he allegedly flipped and the shooting came as one agent stepped out of the room, leaving Todashev alone with one officer, the Post said. Shot dead: Ibragim Todashev, a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter, right, was killed by an agent in his Florida home. The FBI had questioned Todashev in the past. regarding his ties to Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right). Tsarnaev's younger. brother, Dzhokhar, (left), has been charged in connection with the. bombings. Investigation: An FBI evidence response team enters an apartment after an agent shot and killed Ibragim Todashev who was questioned in connection with the Boston Marathon bombings. Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, confirmed to the New York Times on Wednesday that her older son knew Todashev. In a telephone interview from. Dagestan, Tsarnaeva said Todashev moved from Boston to Florida about two. years ago. She said she is devastated to learn that he has been killed. 'Now another boy has left this life,' she told the newspaper. 'Why are they killing these children without any. trial or investigation?' The FBI has been. investigating Todashev for the last month, questioning him several times. regarding his ties to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed by. police in a shootout following the deadly April 15 marathon bombings. Authorities said they have no reason to believe that Todashev had any involvement in the marathon bombings. Todashev. was arrested in an unrelated incident on May 4 for aggravated battery. after he left a man unconscious in the parking lot of a shopping mall. Victim: Brendan Mess was one of three victims in a triple slaying that Todashev allegedly confessed to police that he and Tsarnaev had committed in September 2011. According to the arrest affidavit, Todashev had gotten into an altercation with a man and his son over parking space. Todashev told police that the man. 'got into his face' so he pushed him and then the man's son 'got. involved' and Todashev began fighting him. A mall security officer arrived on. scene to find the son unconscious and lying in a pool of blood on the. ground just as Todashev was pulling away in a white Mercedes. The officer chased down the Mercedes, ordered Todashev out at gunpoint and arrested him. The son was later treated at a hospital with a split upper lip, several teeth knocked out and head injuries. Friends and family members of the 2011 murder victims reacted to news of that Tsarnaev and Todashev were involved on social media. On a Facebook page dedicated to. victim Raphael Teken, someone wrote, 'Whether we ever know exactly what. happened, there is one thing we surely know and that is that Rafi. deserved a much better fate.' Facebook user Tony Porter wrote, 'I'm disappointed that we will never really get to experience true justice for our friend or know the reasons for what happened despite the fact that both alleged suspects are now deceased. 'I don't know how you are supposed to feel when your friend's killer gets killed, but I don't feel \\"relieved\\" like I thought I would.' Murdered: Raphael Teken (left with a friend) and Erik Weissman (right) were also killed in the 2011 triple slaying.

Monet tiibetiläiset, erityisesti munkit ja nunnat, ovat joutuneet kestämään väkivaltaa, kidutusta, umpimähkäistä vangitsemista ja pakkotyötä. Tiibetiläistä buddhalaista uskontoa, joka on olennainen osa tiibetiläisten etnistä identiteettiä, on vainottu laajasti Kiinan hallinnon taholta. Heidän pyrkimyksensä sisällyttää kommunistinen ideologia osaksi tiibetiläistä kulttuuria on etäännyttää Tiibetin kansaa omasta perinteestään ja kulttuuristaan. Kiina on pyrkinyt hallitsemaan tiibetiläistä uskontoa sensuroimalla tiedotusvälineitä, rajoittamalla kielellisiä oikeuksia ja valvomalla munkkien ja nunnien koulutusta. Tiibetiläisten temppeleitä ja luostareita on suljettu tai otettu hallintoon, niitä alettiin käyttää asuinpaikkoina, ja arvokkaita kulttuuriperinteitä ja uskonnonvapautta on uhattu. Tiibetiläiset opettajat ja oppilaat kohtaavat usein pakkokkulttuurin, joka saattaa täysin tuhota heidän vapaan mielipiteensä ilmaisun ja todellisten kulttuuriarvojensa hyväksynnän. Munkkiluostareiden ja muiden uskonnollisten laitosten osalta Kiina on usein määrännyt rajoituksia kouluttaakseen munkkeja kommunistisen puolueen linjojen mukaisesti. Rajoitukset kohdistuvat erityisesti uskonnollisen koulutuksen saatavuuteen ja laatuun sekä munkkien ja nunnien oikeuteen ilmaista vapaasti henkilökohtaisia mielipiteitään. Monet munkit ja nunnat pakotetaan asumaan tarkasti valvotuissa oloissa, jotta he eivät voisi vastustaa Kiinan viranomaisten suunnitelmia. Tiibetiläisten kapinat ja mielenosoitukset ovat pyrkineet tuomaan esiin heidän kohtaamansa sorron ja syrjinnän, mutta Kiina ei ole vieläkään reagoinut näihin vääryyksiin. Tiibetin kansan hätähuutoihin on tarttunut kansainvälinen yhteisö, ja monet maailman johtajat ja järjestöt ovat vaatineet parannuksia Tiibetin ihmisoikeustilanteeseen. Kansainvälisen painostuksen ja solidaarisuuden avulla on toivottavaa, että Tiibetissä elävät ihmiset voisivat jonain päivänä kokea vapauden ja oikeudenmukaisuuden, jonka he ansaitsevat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: Social Security reform-depending on the elements of the reform package and the timing of implementation-could foster saving and Sentence 2: There is only one reform that could be implemented to save Social Security. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The first and second sentences present different perspectives on Social Security reform. The first sentence suggests that Social Security reform, depending on its specific components and the timing of its implementation, could potentially play a role in fostering saving and, by implication, contribute to the long-term sustainability of the Social Security system. It implies a level of flexibility and acknowledges multiple possible reform packages or outcomes, as it states that the impact depends on specific elements and timing. On the other hand, the second sentence expresses a very different view. It claims that there is only one reform that could save Social Security. This perspective presents a singular solution and seems to exclude any other possible reform options. The sentence lacks detail on what this specific reform might be, but its claim of exclusivity contrasts with the openness to various possibilities implicit in the first sentence. In summary, the first sentence does not entail the second sentence, because each sentence discusses Social Security reform from a different perspective. The first sentence considers a range of potential approaches based on different elements and implementation timing, while the second sentence asserts that only one specific reform could save the Social Security system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. and the situation: Michael and Robert are two patients at a cardiology clinic. Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to begin exercising regularly. Michael took this advice to heart, and began regular aerobic exercise every week. Robert, on the other hand, only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks. Answer the following question: Who is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of their arteries?","completion":"Based on the background information provided and the situation described, Michael is more likely to have better control over his LDL cholesterol build-up in the inner walls of his arteries compared to Robert. This is because Michael took the advice from the cardiology clinic to heart and began incorporating regular aerobic exercise into his weekly routine. Regular aerobic exercise has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) and increase HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol), thus resulting in a healthier balance of cholesterol levels. Meanwhile, Robert only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks, which is much less frequent compared to Michael's routine. With this less frequent exercise regimen, Robert is not as likely to experience the same level of beneficial effects on his cholesterol levels compared to Michael. Consequently, Robert's more sporadic exercise schedule may not provide him with adequate control over his LDL cholesterol levels, putting him at a higher risk for LDL cholesterol build-up in the inner walls of his arteries. Overall, Michael is more likely to have better control over LDL cholesterol build-up in the inner walls of his arteries due to his commitment to engage in regular aerobic exercise every week, which is an important factor in managing cholesterol levels and maintaining a heart-healthy lifestyle."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Write some highlights for the following article: The royal baby is great news for William and Kate, but is it also good news for British tourism? It's certainly a popular argument with fans of the British monarchy -- that the institution raises Britain's profile overseas and helps to boost tourist visits. The Daily Mail newspaper clearly hopes for such an effect from the recent arrival of the third in line to the British throne. \\"Royal baby could cause tourism surge as well-wishers flock to UK,\\" the paper trumpeted just after the birth of the new Prince of Cambridge. \\"As London wakes up to the aftermath of a giant party on the Mall and the announcement that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have a son, there are hopes that the birth of the new royal baby will spark a tourism boom as well-wishers flock to the UK to share in the joy,\\" Britain's second best-selling paper went on in its picture-rich splash. \\"The spell cast by the monarchy's 1,000-year history, combined with the international media frenzy around the royal baby, is extremely powerful at drawing people to England,\\" Lady Cobham, chair of the tourist body VisitBritain, is quoted as saying. Not alone. The Daily Mail wasn't alone in predicting such an effect. \\"Hotels and attractions\\" in London were set to capitalize on the \\"royal baby boom,\\" observed the International Business Times. And that boom was apparently resonating beyond London. \\"Royal Baby to spark rise in tourist visits,\\" read an Edinburgh Evening News headline. \\"Royal attractions in Edinburgh are expecting a surge in visitor numbers as tourists flock to share in the baby joy,\\" the article said. Yet further afield (although still in a Commonwealth country) the travel editor of the Star, in Toronto, was not \\"necessarily gung ho\\" about the royal family but he still devoted a blog post to the \\"bounce\\" it was sure to give British tourism. On social media, \\"A British Royal baby could spark a major boost to the UK tourism industry,\\" was a typical comment from Airwise News. Where's the evidence? Looking for evidence for the widely touted princeling-tourism connection, the evidence becomes less clear. Certainly tourists flocked to Buckingham Palace in advance of the birth, awaiting confirmation of the baby's arrival. \\"Our holiday was booked months ago, so we did not expect to be over here while the baby was happening [but we've] been told to bring back as many newspapers and souvenirs with the baby on as possible,\\" Matthew and Donna Harold, from Michigan, told the Telegraph. A scan of social media reveals the odd international prince-fixated quote, such as this from a tweeter in Fort Lauderdale, Florida: \\"Dear Kate Middleton, Please wait to have the Royal Baby until Thursday. Thank you, Annie Harley, an American Tourist.\\" But are there any hard numbers to support the idea of a baby-born tourist surge? The Mail did cite a statistical precedent. In 2012, it said, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year, tourist visits (at 31 million) were at their highest level since the beginning of the economic downturn in 2008. However, even if hotels near Kensington Palace are throwing caution to the wind with \\"Tot-ter Around Kensington\\" shop-and-stay packages and converting luxury suites into five-star nurseries for the occasion, that still doesn't turn correlation into cause. Negative effect? If anything, the numbers point the other way. A recent story in the Guardian refers to a document obtained under Freedom of Information legislation from Visit Britain on the marriage between Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson in 1986. \\"We find that across the year as a whole there were 4% fewer visitors to Britain than in 1985, but that in July [1986] there were 8% fewer than in July of 1985,\\" the document says. \\"[S]uch as it is, the evidence points to royal weddings having a negative impact on inbound tourism.\\" Graham Smith, chief executive office of the campaign group Republic, concurs. The argument that royal births, weddings and anniversaries benefit tourism is \\"a complete fiction,\\" he tells CNN. \\"There's not a shred of evidence for it. People don't make holiday decisions on the basis of who's living in what castle. \\"Tourists are here for our culture, our common language. They may come and look at palaces but the fairy tale side of it is there regardless of whether the monarchy is or not. \\"People have nothing [substantive] to say in defense of the monarchy so come up with a financial argument.\\" Culture and heritage. \\"We know that visitors drawn to Britain by the appeal of our culture and heritage spend over Â£4.5 billion annually and support around 100,000 jobs,\\" a VisitBritain official tells CNN. \\"This in part can be attributed to attractions and events with a connection to Britain's monarchs past and present.\\" Kate and William's wedding in 2011, VisitBritain says, \\"brought record numbers of visitors for the summer opening of Buckingham Palace. More than 600,000 people passed through the gates to see the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress. \\"That smashed the previous attendance figure set in 1994 and was an increase of almost 50%\\" on the previous year, says VisitBritain. Such figures are compelling. But whether anybody actually booked tickets to Britain for the birth of George Alexander Louis or any other royal event, as so many people in Britain and beyond seem to think, is far less certain.","completion":"- Royal baby's birth sparks debate over its potential impact on British tourism. - Media outlets and tourism bodies predict increase in tourist visits due to the new royal family member. - Some argue there's no clear historical evidence supporting the theory that royal events increase tourism.

Process: - Magma moves closer to the Earth&#x27;s crust - The magma starts to cool - The cooling causes atoms in the magma to condense - The condensed magma solidifies - The solidified magma forms minerals. Question: suppose more sunshine for the plants happens, how will it affect the magma condenses more. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"no effect Reasoning: 1. Sunshine affects the growth of plants, which is an independent process from magma formation and condensation. Increased sunshine will cause plants to grow faster and more efficiently due to the enhanced process of photosynthesis, but it does not have a direct impact on the formation of magma. 2. Magma formation and condensation are primarily influenced by processes and factors occurring deep within the Earth's crust and mantle. These factors include temperature, pressure, tectonic activity, and the movement of mantle material. Changes in these factors can affect how magma condenses and solidifies, but they are largely unrelated to the amount of sunshine for plants. 3. While it is true that processes occurring on the Earth's surface, such as weathering and erosion, can eventually influence the composition of the mantle and crust, these surface processes are not significantly affected by sunshine for plants. Thus, the increased sunshine for plants does not directly impact the way the magma condenses."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Brendan Rodgers has vowed to make Liverpool stronger and insisted there are no regrets about sanctioning Luis Suarez’s sale to Barcelona. Suarez’s £75million move was confirmed on Wednesday but his four-month stadium ban for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup means he could not be unveiled by head coach Luis Enrique and sporting director Andoni Zubizaretta. While Enrique and Zubizaretta were fielding questions in Spain about the Uruguay striker’s character flaws, a shadow Liverpool squad lost their opening pre-season game 2-1 against Brondby. Belief: Brendan Rodgers (above) has vowed to make Liverpool stronger after losing Luis Suarez. Afterwards, Rodgers was eager to bring closure to the Suarez affair. It has been argued that Liverpool’s ambitions will be compromised by losing the 31 goals which Suarez scored last season. But Rodgers countered that they are not a one-man team and believes the four signings he has made — with the promise of more to come — will maintain their progress. ‘In my short career as a manager I have lost people who I thought would be key players,’ said Rodgers. ‘But then you go away, reflect and ensure you bring in the right replacement. Always, after that, my teams have been better teams. ‘Luis missed a lot of our games but we still won a lot of those games so we just have to move on. We have loved working with a fantastic player, but a player who obviously benefitted from our work at Liverpool. New look: Liverpool line up for their first pre-season friendly in Denmark. On the move: Liverpool's star striker Suarez (left) has left for Barcelona. ‘He’s gone and we won’t dwell on it. This is Liverpool, not a small club but one of the great ones in world football. We had great service out of Luis but it’s one we can’t worry too much about now. 'There is a lot of work going on to get in the right player. We have every confidence in the group we have, plus we will bring in more signings. Hopefully they can improve to the levels Luis Suarez improved.’ Rodgers has signed Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Lazar Markovic and Emre Can, who missed the defeat to Brondby after turning his ankle. The next target is Ben Davies. Tottenham have had a £10million bid accepted for the Swansea left back but Liverpool will match it and are confident Davies will choose Anfield. This will be a summer of change at Anfield, with other targets including QPR’s Loic Remy and Southampton defender Dejan Lovren, but there is no question there will be a period of adjustment following Suarez’s exit. Bad start: The Reds were beaten in their first pre-season match of the season. Rodgers was forced to tackle a number of contentious issues because of Suarez’s behaviour but there was no sense that Liverpool’s manager felt relieved to see a man who was voted PFA and FWA Player of the Year depart. ‘I have great respect for Luis as a person and player, I know him deeper than most,’ said Rodgers. ‘He was a good man, great performer for Liverpool and hopefully I have played a part in his progress. ‘He’s gone to Barcelona, a club he wanted to play for, and now we’ll move on. Believe me, it will be a really exciting season for us.’ Stoke believe they can sign on-loan Liverpool winger Oussama Assaidi for £4m up front.

Why does the caste system still exist in India? Why caste system still survive in India? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information. They both essentially ask why the caste system continues to persist in India, despite its negative effects on society. While the phrasing of each question is slightly different, the overall subject matter and purpose of the questions are the same. Now, to answer the question: 1. Begin by understanding the background of the caste system: The caste system in India is an ancient social hierarchy that has existed for about 2000 years. It originally divided people into different groups or castes based on their occupation, social status, and religious beliefs. 2. Analyze historical and religious influences: The caste system is deeply rooted in Hindu scriptures and tradition, which may contribute to its continued existence in some areas of India. Some people may still hold on to caste-based beliefs due to their religious or cultural upbringing. 3. Assess the role of politics: Political parties in India may use the caste system to mobilize voters and secure support from specific communities. This can contribute to the perpetuation of the caste system, as politicians may be unwilling to challenge or dismantle the existing hierarchy. 4. Examine socio-economic factors: The caste system may still be relevant for some due to socio-economic reasons. Members of higher castes may want to maintain their status and privileges, while members of lower castes may believe that they are destined to stay in their social position. 5. Consider the impact of education and awareness: Insufficient education and exposure to alternative perspectives contribute to the continuation of the caste system. Greater awareness of social justice and equality can help change people's opinions and encourage them to challenge caste-based discrimination. In conclusion, the caste system continues to exist in India due to a combination of historical, religious, political, socio-economic, and educational factors. However, increased awareness and efforts towards social justice and equality can help to dismantle the caste system over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will convene an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss the downing of the Turkish military fighter jet and to determine the appropriate response to Syria's actions. As a member of NATO, Turkey expects solidarity and support from its allies in such critical situations, especially given the volatile nature of the ongoing conflict in Syria. The incident has heightened tensions between Turkey and Syria, who share a long and contentious border, and has the potential to escalate into a more severe political and military confrontation. The Turkish government has already warned Syria that it would not hesitate to take necessary measures to protect its territorial integrity and national security, while Syria maintains that it acted in self-defense, claiming that the Turkish jet had violated its airspace. If NATO acknowledges that the downing of the Turkish jet constitutes an attack on one of its member states, it could invoke Article 5 of its founding treaty, which states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all members. Such a scenario could potentially lead to NATO taking military action against the Syrian government, further complicating the already complex and dangerous situation in the region. However, NATO might also choose to pursue a diplomatic approach, seeking to de-escalate the situation through dialogue and negotiations with the Syrian government, as well as other regional and international stakeholders. Working closely with the United Nations and other global actors, NATO can contribute to the broader effort to achieve a lasting and comprehensive political solution to the Syrian crisis, which has devastated the country and its people for almost a decade, and to avoid further destabilization of the region. In any case, the incident involving the downing of the Turkish military fighter jet underscores the urgency of addressing the ongoing conflict in Syria, which continues to claim lives, displace millions, and undermine peace and stability in the broader Middle East. It also serves as a stark reminder of the responsibilities of global powers and regional actors to uphold international law, respect each other's sovereignty, and work together to build a more just, peaceful, and secure world."},{"prompt":"Q:Question: Who captured Nihad?

Step 1: You first rewrite the equation as follows: 4 * k - 4 = 3 * k The equation implies that four times some number k minus four equals three times the same number k. Step 2: You now want to start isolating the variable k. To do this, subtract 3*k from both sides of the equation. This gives: 4 * k - 3 * k - 4 = 3 * k - 3 * k Step 3: Simplify the above by executing the subtraction on both sides, this results in: k - 4 = 0 Step 4: Add 4 to both sides of the equation to completely isolate the variable k on one side. This results in: k - 4 + 4 = 0 + 4 Step 5: Finally, simplify the above again to obtain the solution as: k = 4 So, in conclusion, the solution to the equation 4 * k - 4 = 3 * k is k = 4.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Today, home-ownership has reached extremely high levels. Modern generations tend to believe there is something wrong with them if they rent. However, is high home-ownership really as rosy as people imagine? Staring at data first, we realize that the most successful, stable, attractive country in the Western world is Switzerland. It has tiny unemployment; wealth; high happiness and mental-health scores. Does it have high home-ownership rates? Absolutely not. In Switzerland, about seven in ten of the population are renters. Yet, with Europe's lowest home-ownership rate, the nation thrives. Now go to the other end of the misery distribution. Spain has approximately the highest home-ownership rate in Europe (at more than 80%). But one-quarter of its population are unemployed. A likely reason is that high levels of home-ownership mess up the labour market. In a sensibly functioning economy it is easy for people to move around to drop into the vibrant job slots thrown up by technological change. With a high degree of owner-occupation, everything slows. Folk get stuck. Renters can go to new jobs. In that way they do the economy a favour. As Friedman said, the rate of unemployment depends on the flexibility of the housing market. Next we come to economic breakdown. Most analysts accept that at heart it was the housing market--obsessive pursuit of homes, the engendered mortgage lending and an unavoidable house-price crash--that sank the Western world. Germany, say, with its more efficient rental market, had a far smoother ride through trouble. As for the monetary system, in the past few decades, in the hope of getting untaxed capital gains way above their true labour earnings, many people threw their spare cash into buying larger houses or building extra bedrooms.

The spacecraft awoke from its final hibernation period on Dec. 6, 2014 in preparation for the epic Pluto encounter at the edge of the solar system. LAUREL, Md. — Pluto, get ready for your close-up: A NASA spacecraft has roused itself from the final slumber of its nine-year trek to the edge of the solar system, setting the stage for the first close encounter with Pluto next year. The New Horizons spacecraft, currently located 2.9 billion miles (4.6 billion kilometers) from Earth, had been in hibernation since August — with most of its systems turned off to reduce wear. But late Saturday (Dec. 6), mission scientists received a confirmation signal from New Horizons at the probe's Mission Operations Center here at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. The probe is now wide awake for its 2015 flyby of Pluto. At the time of its wakeup call, New Horizons was just over 162 million miles (261 million km) from Pluto. About 20 people gathered in a conference room here at APL to await the signal from New Horizons.

The New Horizons mission is managed from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Credit: NASA First word from the probe arrived at about 9:30 p.m. EST on Saturday (Dec. 6) — generating a burst of happy applause from the attendees, including Alan Stern, New Horizon's principle investigator, and Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary sciences. At 9:52 p.m. EST (0252 GMT), mission managers confirmed that New Horizons was awake, with all systems functioning normally. The wakeup sets the stage for the probe's flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015. \\"This is the turning of a page. This is changing from a mission in cruise to a mission at its destination,\\" said Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Stern popped a champagne bottle and offered a toast to the mission following the signal confirmation. New Horizons even got a wakeup song to mark the occasion: the tune \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\" by English tenor Russell Watson. The song, which included a special greeting from Watson for New Horizons, was played in the mission operations center after the confirmation signal was received. You can hear Watson's New Horizons wakeup song here. This photo of Pluto (center) and its largest moon Charon was captured by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft in July 2014 and released on Aug. 7.

Credit: NASA New Horizons will begin its Pluto science campaign in January, and will make its closest approach to Pluto in July. It will explore the outer-most and most-populated region of the solar system, the Kuiper belt, which is full of rocky, icy objects that have remained largely unchanged since the formation of the solar system. \\"This is the place that this spacecraft was built to operate, and these are the operations that this team has waited a decade to actually go and execute,\\" Stern said. \\"So it's game time.\\" NASA launched the New Horizons mission in 2006 on a 700 million mission to be the first spacecraft ever to see Pluto and its five moons up close. The piano-size spacecraft is powered by a nuclear power source and has traveled nearly 3 billion miles (4.8 billion km) to reach Pluto in a mere nine years, making it the fastest space probe ever launched). It has spent two-thirds of its journey in a hibernation state that has both prolonged the life of the instruments and reduced staff costs on the ground. While New Horizons has gone through 18 hibernation periods, sleeping for about 1,873 days in all, this is the last one before it begins taking data on the Pluto system. For 20 weeks of its flyby of Pluto, New Horizons will provide better photos of Pluto and its moons than those taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, Stern said. In analogy, if the spacecraft were flying over a city it would be able to count the individual buildings on the ground. New Horizons may also identify as-yet-unknown moons or rings around Pluto. At the wake-up event, Stern handed out small, 2-inch-long pencils — whittled down from extensive use. \\"This is the metaphor for persistence,\\" Stern said, holding up the pencil stub. \\"Since this mission went through so many ups and downs — the way the exploration of Pluto did — I thought this was an appropriate thing to give away.

Karl Popper: Popper played a vital role in establishing the philosophy of science as a vigorous, autonomous discipline within philosophy, through his own prolific and influential works, and also through his influence on his own contemporaries and students. Popper founded in 1946 the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the London School of Economics and there lectured and influenced both Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend, two of the foremost philosophers of science in the next generation of philosophy of science. (Lakatos significantly modified Popper's position,:1 and Feyerabend repudiated it entirely, but the work of both is deeply influenced by Popper and engaged with many of the problems that Popper set.)

Title: The Contractor Movie plot: Retired CIA black-ops hitman James Jackson Dial (Wesley Snipes) is living his life in seclusion on his ranch in Montana when he is offered the chance to redeem himself by his former employer, Jeremy Collins (Ralph Brown). Some years earlier, Dial had been seconds away from taking down notorious terrorist cell leader Ali Mahmoud Jahar (Nikolay Sotirov) but his carelessness allowed Jahar to escape, marking his assignment as a failure. Now Collins wants Dial to complete his task by assassinating Jahar, who has been captured and is now in the custody of the police in London, England. Provided with a safe house, passports, and an assistant, Terry Winchell (Richard Harrington), Dial is off to London to complete unfinished business. Disguised as a priest, Dial gets into position in a church bell tower across the street from the building that Jahar is being brought into. When Jahar is brought out of the police van, his head is covered by a jacket, leaving Dial without a clean shot. Not wanting to fail again, Dial patiently waits for his opportunity. Moments later, from his high vantage point, Dial spots Jahar standing inside the building with his back to the window. Dial grasps the opportunity and shoots through the glass, fatally hitting Jahar in back of his head. Because of the delay caused by a pair of cops, Winchell is late in bringing the getaway car, and this brings attention to them fleeing the scene. After numerous attempts to stop the car, the police open fire, killing Winchell. The car, now out of control, comes to crashing stop, injuring Dial. But Dial manages to get out of the crashed car. On the run and bleeding profusely, he makes his way to the safe house, where he meets curious 12-year-old neighbor Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who lives with her grandmother (Gemma Jones).

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Write a summary based on this article: Finding Treasure in Trash San Juan Capistrano 6-year-old starts his own recycling business, aspires to drive his own garbage truck one day By Allison Jarrell If there’s one thing 6-year-old Ryan Hickman loves, it’s sorting. So when, at the ripe age of 3, his parents, Damion and Andrea, let him come along to return some water bottles at a recycling center, he was thrilled to help. “He likes to sort pretty much anything, and he liked putting the bottles in the machine,” Damion, said. “He probably got two or three bucks, and he was so excited about it. And of course then he got to sort his change, so that meant more sorting.” For an average 3-year-old, that probably would have been the end of the story. But when Damion returned home from work the next day, Ryan was waiting for him in the driveway. He told his dad that he wanted to show him his new business—or “bidness” in toddler talk. “I asked him what it was, and he kind of waved down the street and goes, ‘tah-dah!’” Damion recalled. “Ryan and Andrea had gone around giving all the neighbors trash bags—he wanted everyone to start saving cans for him.” That was the beginning of Ryan’s Recycling Company, established in 2012 in the family’s San Juan Capistrano home. A first-grader at Ambuehl Elementary School, Ryan has already earned more than 8,000 by collecting cans and bottles from about 40 “customers” in five different neighborhoods. His biggest client is the El Niguel Country Club. Of course, being a 6-year-old entrepreneur comes with some hurdles. Ryan’s parents, grandmother and aunt all help drive him around to collect his recyclables and often make multiple trips to pick up a few carloads at a time. The family’s backyard acts as Ryan’s sorting facility, where he has about eight large trash cans that he sorts containers into—bottles and cans, plastics and glass, they all have their place. Ryan’s family visits the recycling center every third Sunday, and on the weekends he can often be seen sorting to prepare for those visits with his work gloves on and sporting a blue CR&R hat. The young businessman said even though he has to dump the occasional “yucky liquids” from some of the collected containers, it’s all worth it—every nickel goes into a savings account and toward his dream of owning his own garbage truck one day. Since he’s got about 10 more years until he can learn to drive, Ryan figures that gives him at least a decade to earn the 70,000 needed to purchase a used truck, or 120,000 for a brand new one. “Ryan’s one of those really unique kids who has a passion,” said his first grade teacher Suzanne Devaney. “He just sees things that need to be done and he does them.” Since the company’s inception, Damion, who does graphic designing, has created business cards for Ryan as well as Ryan’s Recycling T-shirts, which sell for 13 apiece. All the proceeds from the shirts are donated to the Pacific Marine Mammal Center—so far they’ve contributed about 1,000. In a YouTube video posted last July, Damion asks Ryan if other people should start recycling to help save the earth. “Mmm … no,” Ryan says nonchalantly. “I got it all handled.” His answer has changed a bit since then. Ryan said he thinks people should start recycling not only to earn some extra cash, but “because it helps the world, too.” He worries that birds at the beach may eat the trash and “get sick or die.” “He’s very passionate about it, and he likes to get everybody else passionate about it as well,” Andrea said. “I think he’s rubbed off on all of us now. You find yourself walking past a can on the ground and needing to pick it up instead of walking away and leaving it there.” For more information on supporting Ryan’s Recycling, visit www.dhdwear.com/Ryans-Recycling.

The day after going to the recycling center, Ryan notified his mom and dad that he wanted to give empty plastic bags to all the neighbors and maybe they would save their recyclables for him. Not only did the local neighbors save their cans and bottles for Ryan but so did their friends, families and co-workers. Today, Ryan has customers all over Orange County, CA and he has a passion to recycle that is amazing. His goal is to recycle to keep cans and bottles from reaching the ocean where it’s harmful to the environment. Ryan spends a part of every week sorting thru cans and bottles from his customers and getting them ready to take to the recycle center. In 2016, Ryan’s recycling story went viral and ever since he has been featured on web sites, television and radio stations around the planet. He’s a 2017 CNN Young Wonder, he’s appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres show, The Pickler & Ben show and was interviewed by Maria Menunous on Sirius/XM Radio as well as Ryan Seacrest’s syndicated radio program and featured on the KFI AM 640 Bill Handel show. He’s a multiple time WE DAY speaker and has been featured on NBC, CNN, CNBC, PBS, FOX News, Amazon Prime’s SELF MADE series, Australia’s Channel 7 Sunrise morning show, Huffington Post, Voice of America, AJ+, UpWorthy, NOW THIS!, 60 Second Docs, KBS, USA Today, Univision, Good Morning America, and ABC World News. Ryan has been recognized internationally for his recycling efforts and Ryan was awarded the “2017 Citizen of the Year” by his hometown of San Juan Capistrano and he was recognized by the Orange County Register as one of the 100 most influential people of 2017. Ryan was selected in 2018 by MSN in their top 15 kids changing the world and was featured in TIME Magazine for Kids and National Geographic as well as being featured as a WHIZ KID in OC Family Magazine. Thank you to everyone who have sent Ryan inspiring emails and supporting his passion. Ryan is hoping to raise as much awareness to saving the planet through recycling and saving for his future college education (or saving for a full size trash truck) and he is a Youth Ambassador at the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach. All proceeds from his company logo t-shirts go to help support their volunteer efforts. Ryan is also a proud brand ambassador for the recycling and sustainability efforts of Sand Cloud, Busch Systems, Recycle Across America and Valet Living. People ask all the time what kind of items that Ryan recycles. Ryan collects and recycles plastic and glass beverage bottles as well as aluminum cans. Ryan and his dad take them in by the truckload regularly to the local redemption center where they are unloaded, sorted and weighed. If you’d like to help Ryan and help the environment at the same time, contact him here to schedule a pick up. Thank you to all of Ryan’s friends around the world, his customers and family who have supported his ambitions and hard work recycling. ||||| Photo Gallery of Ellen DeGeneres Ryan Hickman, 7, of San Juan Capistrano, was recently invited onto \\"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\\" to talk about his business, Ryan's Recycling Company.

To do that, let's first move all the terms containing h to one side of the equation. In this case, let's move the -2*h to the left side of the equation by adding 2*h to both sides. 2*h + 8 + 2*h = -2*h + 2*h This simplifies to: 4*h + 8 = 0 Step 2: Now, we need to isolate the 'h' term. To do that, let's subtract 8 from both sides of the equation. 4*h + 8 - 8 = 0 - 8 This simplifies to: 4*h = -8 Step 3: Finally, to find the value of 'h', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4.

Acest lucru este esențial deoarece industria românească este adesea pusă sub presiune de importurile străine și concurența globală. Compensarea ne permite să menținem un echilibru între comerțul intern și extern și să promovăm dezvoltarea unor industrii locale. Offset-ul poate lua diferite forme, precum investiții în infrastructura locală, transfer de tehnologie sau programe de formare, care ajută la dezvoltarea și susținerea economiei noastre.

Această abordare aduce nu numai avantaje economice, ci și sociale, pe termen lung pentru România.

Bourke's father, Frank, was serving in the RAAF and on leave in Melbourne when he played a solitary game for Richmond in 1943. A tall (193 cm) and lean (85 kg) full forward with an excellent reputation in country football, Frank returned to the city after the war and resume his playing career with Richmond. In the opening weeks of the 1946 season Frank kicked five or more goals six times in the first seven matches to lead the VFL goalkicking table. Injury curtailed further progress. In 1976, Bourke was appointed captain of the club and he responded with a great season, although the team slipped down the ladder. He finished third in the Brownlow medal and third in the club's best and fairest award, demonstrating a phenomenal consistency; in nine seasons between 1968 and 1976, Bourke was placed seven times in the best and fairest count. However, the first signs of advancing age showed the following year. Bourke was so disappointed with his form at one point he privately contemplated retirement, but he continued on and proved his mettle by captaining Victoria against West Australia and leading Richmond into the finals. Key position defenders were in short supply at Richmond, so Bourke was forced to play at centre half back even though he lacked height for the position. At the end of the season, he decided to resign the captaincy in an effort to prolong his career. This decision paid off in 1980, when the Tigers returned to power and again won the premiership. Due to his slowing leg speed, Bourke was now at full back but still a formidable opponent. Two weeks before the finals, Bourke entered football folklore in a match at Arden Street against North Melbourne. Bourke received an accidental finger in the eye, which quickly filled with blood that poured down his face and on to his guernsey. At the time there was no \\"blood rule\\" (requiring bleeding players to leave the field until the bleeding is stopped) and Bourke shifted to the forward line. Although he could barely see through the mass of blood, he dived full-length to take a chest mark, then kicked an important goal to ensure Richmond had a narrow win. Bourke, along with Kevin Bartlett, played in all five Richmond premierships of the era, which constitutes the club record. Aged 34, he decided to soldier on in 1981 and became only the third Tiger to play 300 games. However, his form was not always equal to the personal standard that he had set and when it became obvious that Richmond wouldn't make the finals to defend the premiership, Bourke retired. Note that changes to the way records are compiled was made after Bourke's retirement, and his official games tally has been reduced to an even 300, of which 23 were finals and six Grand Finals.

Sports are typically played in fields, courts, or stadiums, which are entirely separate environments from surgical settings. - \\"Muscle\\" and \\"vein\\" are related to human anatomy, but these options do not provide the complete context for the blood in an operating room. Although both muscles and veins may be involved in a surgical procedure, the actual subject under operation remains the person. - \\"Animals\\" could have been an option if the question specified a veterinary or animal surgery setting. However, as the question only refers to an operating room, the most common type of operation would be on a human. Additionally, veterinary operating rooms usually have different sets of equipment and professionals trained specifically to treat animals. In conclusion, considering that the question mentions an operation involving blood in the operating room, the most probable subject of the surgery would be a person, as operating rooms are designed primarily for human surgeries with expert medical professionals handling delicate internal structure like muscles and veins."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which cousin experienced more temperature inversion phenomena? Hint: Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Why did Antiochus second guess his choice to take over the kingdom?\\" is in \\"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Why did Antiochus second guess his choice to take over the kingdom?\\" can be found in the passage provided. Antiochus III, the Seleucid empire ruler, invaded the Greco-Bactrian kingdom in around 210 BCE. Although he emerged victorious in the field, it seems that Antiochus began to realize the advantages of maintaining the status quo. There could be a few reasons behind this change of heart. Firstly, Antiochus may have sensed that governing Bactria from Syria, the center of the Seleucid empire, would prove to be difficult due to the vast size of the empire. The Greco-Bactrian kingdom, comprising most of present-day Afghanistan, had initially emerged from the Seleucid empire's insufficient central control, and this lack of control might have posed a challenge in governing Bactria effectively. Secondly, Antiochus may have recognized a strategic advantage in having the Greco-Bactrian kingdom as an ally rather than trying to incorporate it into his own empire. This decision is evident in his choice to marry one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, effectively legitimizing the Greco-Bactria dynasty. This act of diplomacy may have been aimed at establishing a strong alliance between the two kingdoms, which could be useful in protecting their territories from external threats and could also provide mutual support in the future. Soon after the marriage, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded its territories, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus. This expansion may have further reinforced the benefits of the alliance for both kingdoms and solidified Antiochus's decision not to take over the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. In summary, Antiochus's second-guessing his choice to take over the kingdom stemmed from an understanding of the challenges posed by governing Bactria from afar (due to the size of his empire) and the strategic advantages of maintaining an alliance with the Greco-Bactrian dynasty. This decision eventually proved beneficial for both kingdoms, as evidenced by the subsequent political stability and territorial expansion in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information: - Babylon (or ; Aramaic: , \\"Babel\\", , \\"Bavel\\", , \\"Bbil\\") was a major city of ancient Mesopotamia in the fertile plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The city was built upon the Euphrates and divided in equal parts along its left and right banks, with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods. Babylon was originally a small Semitic Akkadian city dating from the period of the Akkadian Empire c. 2300 BC. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - The Parthian Empire (247 BC 224 AD), also known as the Arsacid Empire, was a major Iranian political and cultural power in ancient Iran and Iraq. Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of the Parni tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Iran's northeast, then a satrapy (province) in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I of Parthia (r. \\"c\\". 171138 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now central-eastern Turkey, to eastern Iran. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han Empire of China, became a center of trade and commerce. - The Seleucid Empire (\\"Basileía tn Seleukidn\\") was a Hellenistic state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty, which existed from 312 BC to 63 BC; it was founded by Seleucus I Nicator following the division of the Macedonian empire vastly expanded by Alexander the Great. Seleucus received Babylonia and, from there, expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander's near eastern territories. At the height of its power, it included central Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and what is now Kuwait, Afghanistan, and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan. - Mithridates or Mithradates I (Parthian: \\"Mihrdat\\", , \\"Mehrdd\\"), (ca. 195 BC 132 BC) was king of the Parthian Empire from 165 BC to 132 BC, succeeding his brother Phraates I. His father was King Phriapatius of Parthia, who died ca. 176 BC). Mithridates I made Parthia into a major political power by expanding the empire to the east, south, and west. During his reign the Parthians took Herat (in 167 BC), Babylonia (in 144 BC), Media (in 141 BC) and Persia (in 139 BC). Because of his many conquests and religious tolerance, he has been compared to other Iranian kings such Cyrus the Great (d. 530 BC), founder of the Achaemenid Empire. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Phraates II ( Persian : ) , was king of the Parthian Empire from 132 BC to 126 BC.

Creating such a smooth passage means adjusting a vehicle's speed so that it always arrives at the lights when they are green.That is theoretically possible, but practically hard.Roadside signs wired to traffic lights can help get the message across a couple hundred metres from a crossing, but such signs are expensive, and are not widespread.Margaret Martonosi and Emmanouil Koukoumidis at Princeton University, and Li-Shiuan Peh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, have an idea that could make the process cheaper and more effective.Instead of a hardwired network of signs, they propose to use mobile-phone applications. For a driver to benefit, lie must load the team's software , named SignalGuru, into his phone and then put it on a special thing attached to the inside of his car's windscreen, with the camera lens pointing forward.SignalGuru is designed to detect traffic lights and track their status as red, yellow or green.It broadcasts this information to other phones in the area that are fitted with the same software, and --if there are enough of them ?the phones thus each know the status of most of the lights around town.Using this information, SignalGuru is able to calculate the traffic-light schedule for the area and suggest the speed at which a driver should travel in order to avoid red lights.

[b]. acceptable.","completion":"The sentence in question is: \\"When Bill smokes, all the more does Susan hate him.\\" Analyzing this sentence step-by-step: - The main clause of this sentence is \\"Susan hates him.\\" This part of the sentence makes sense grammatically. - The dependent clause of this sentence is \\"When Bill smokes\\" and it's properly used as a conditional clause. - The phrase \\"all the more\\" is used as an intensifier, meaning that the degree of Susan's hatred increases. - Do-support (the use of \\"does\\") is employed correctly for emphasis here. - The sentence follows the English grammatical rules of subject-verb order, usage of intensifiers and appropriate conjunctions. Based on this analysis, the sentence appears to be grammatically correct and most likely understandable, though it might seem a bit unusual or old-fashioned to some speakers of English.

Summarize this article: MOSCOW — Rough diamonds worth millions of dollars have reportedly disappeared from Russia's supposedly impenetrable repository created by the Bolsheviks to store the tsar's jewels. The state-owned Severalmaz company handed diamonds weighing a combined 150,000 carats — or 66 pounds — to the Gokhran repository for inventory purposes, according to respected business daily Kommersant. A file photo of rough diamonds. BAZ RATNER / Reuters, file Citing sources close to the investigation, the paper said the same weight in diamonds was returned - but four of the biggest stones were missing and had been replaced by multiple smaller ones. The missing diamonds reportedly including a 23-carat stone. They were insured for a combined 500,000. That means their real market value was several million dollars, Sergei Goryainov of Rough & Polished, a diamond market analysis company, told NBC News on Thursday. Neither Gokhran nor Severalmaz returned repeated requests for comment. The Gokhran was created in 1920 as a storage facility for valuables confiscated by the victorious Bolsheviks from their enemies, including the Russian nobility, the tsar family and the Orthodox Church. Today, it stores Russia's supplies of gold, silver, platinum, diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, pearls and amber. The size of Gokhran's stores is classified. Despite its reputation as \\"Russia's Fort Knox,\\" the agency has fallen victim to inside jobs in the past. The first Gokhran embezzlers were executed a mere year after its founding. And in 2001, four senior employees were convicted of stealing 187 million worth of valuables from the repository. ||||| Alrosa Severalmaz belongs to the Alrosa, the leading diamond mining company in the world. Four uncut diamonds have disappeared while being held at the State Precious Metals and Gems Repository (Gokhran) for sorting, Kommersant daily newspaper reported on Thursday, citing unidentified sources in the industry. The precious stones were part of a bigger batch of diamonds submitted to Gokhran by Severalmaz mining company that extracts diamonds at a large mine in the northern Arkhangelsk region. After being sorted by Gokhran, some of the diamonds were replaced with inferior ones while the four large ones went missing altogether. The minimum price of these diamonds was 500,000, a source familiar with the situation told Kommersant. One of the missing diamonds weighed 23 carats. A state commission was created in order to investigate the incident. Severalmaz belongs to the Alrosa, the leading diamond mining company in the world. The Russian state, together with the republic of Sakha own 43 and 25 percent of the company respectively. The vast majority of Russia's diamonds come from the republic of Sakha. Since the 1950s, Gokhran has provided sorting and preliminary evaluation services for many diamond companies in Russia. If the report of the missing diamonds is confirmed, this will be a serious blow to the state agency's reputation. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Write a title for this article: WASHINGTON (AP)  The House voted Thursday to deny all federal funds for in a GOP-led strike against the scandal-tainted community organizing group that comes just three days after the Senate took similar action. \\"ACORN has violated serious federal laws, and today the House voted to ensure that taxpayer dollars would no longer be used to fund this corrupt organization,\\" said second-ranked House Republican Eric Cantor of Virginia. The vote, on a provision attached to a student aid bill, was 345-75, with Democrats supplying all the \\"no\\" votes. On Monday the Senate voted 83-7 to deny housing and community grant funding to ACORN, which stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. Republicans accelerated their attacks on the liberal-leaning group a year ago when ACORN, in conducting a massive voter registration drive, was accused of submitting some false registration forms. On a hidden-camera video released on Monday, two ACORN employees are seen apparently advising a couple that was posing as a prostitute and her pimp to lie about her profession and launder her earnings. The video was the latest in a series that has already led to the firing of four ACORN employees in Baltimore and Washington. It was created by James O'Keefe and Hannah Giles and posted on BigGovernment.com, where O'Keefe identifies himself as an activist filmmaker. ACORN spokesman Scott Levenson blasted the video shot at the organization's Brooklyn office, saying the group believes the voices of the couple were dubbed over to alter the conversation and make the interaction appear more objectionable than it may have been. ACORN said Wednesday that it is ordering its own independent investigation of the incidents, while stressing that they were isolated cases. The Census Bureau, meanwhile, also has severed its ties with the group for the 2010 national census. Republicans have urged federal officials to go further by launching a comprehensive investigation of how ACORN spends and manages federal money. \\"As long as taxpayers are subsidizing ACORN and its affiliates, we need to use every measure possible to ensure that those dollars are being spent and managed appropriately,\\" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., sponsor of the measure that passed the House. The Senate and House initiatives to cut funding for ACORN won't take effect until the bills to which they are attached clear Congress and are signed by President Obama. The Senate measure is attached to a fiscal 2010 spending bill. \\"President Obama needs to indicate whether he'll sign this bill and join us in ending all taxpayer funds for this corrupt organization,\\" House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio said after the vote. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs on Wednesday said the conduct seen on the tapes \\"is completely unacceptable.\\" He said the Obama administration \\"takes accountability extremely seriously\\" and noted that the Census Bureau had determined that ACORN could not meet its goal for conducting a fair and accurate count next year. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a conference call with reporters, called the latest allegations against ACORN \\"horrible.\\" However, she pointed out that ACORN has many honest employees and was conducting an internal investigation, and that it was up to House-Senate negotiators to determine whether the provision to cut funding would be in the final version of the bill.

To provide a detailed analysis of the review, it can be broken down into a few key points that demonstrate its negative nature: 1. Quality of food: The reviewer uses the word \\"OK\\" to describe the food, which implies that they did not find it particularly impressive or satisfying. This demonstrates that the quality of the food was not good enough to warrant a positive review. 2. Customer service: The reviewer criticizes the employees for their behavior, labeling them as \\"idiots\\" and \\"rude people.\\" This indicates that the customer experienced a significant amount of dissatisfaction with the staff's attitude and their ability to provide a pleasant dining experience. 3. Communication and responsiveness: The reviewer specifically mentions that the employees do not ask customers what they want and get irritable when asked for additional items, such as salsa for tacos. Poor communication and an unwillingness to accommodate customer requests paint a picture of an establishment that is not focused on creating a positive experience for its patrons. 4. Intent to return: The reviewer explicitly states that they \\"won't be coming back here ever.\\" This assertion demonstrates a strong negative reaction to their overall experience at the establishment, as they have no intention of giving it another chance in the future. 5. Suggestion for improvement: The reviewer concludes their review by stating that the establishment \\"needs a manager.\\" This suggests that one of the reasons for their dissatisfaction is a perceived lack of proper management or oversight, contributing to the employees' poor behavior and overall negative experience. Based on these elements, it is evident that the review is negative as it highlights various aspects in which the customer found their experience to be unsatisfactory and disappointing.

So, your original equation can be rewritten as follows: 434*h = -31682 To get the value of 'h', you'll need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'h', which in this case is 434. This is known as the division property in algebra. So, doing these calculations, the equation becomes: h= -31682 / 434 Dividing -31682 by 434 will give us 'h', which can be computed as follows: h ≈ -73.02 Note that the ≈ symbol is used here to indicate that this is an approximation. 'h' could have more decimal points, but this provides you an approximate value for 'h'. Therefore, solving the equation 434*h = -9378 - 22304 for h gives us h ≈ -73.02. This means that for every 434 units, there would be a decrease of approximately 73.02 units to give the total decrease of -31682 units."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Breast cancer patients could be spared chemotherapy misery as new test predicts if disease will return Experts say the test could reduce over-treatment using the toxic therapy by 46 per cent A new test could spare thousands of breast cancer patients the misery of unnecessary chemotherapy, by predicting if their disease will return. The pioneering test allows scientists to analyse the genetic make-up of tumours. By screening for 70 different markers – all of which increase the risk of the disease spreading – the MammaPrint test can accurately identify those patients who could be spared the toxic treatment. Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer drugs circulating in the bloodstream to destroy diseased cells in the body, by preventing their growth. The toxic therapy fails to distinguish between healthy and cancerous cells and as such, side-effects include severe nausea, hair loss, ulcers, chest pain and bleeding. Many women in the early stages of the disease are given the treatment after surgery or radiotherapy, as a preventative measure to minimise the risk of their tumour returning and spreading. Using the MammaPrint test, scientists found 46 per cent of patients’ tumours were low risk and as such, they had an excellent chance of survival without undergoing the ordeal of chemotherapy. Dr William Audeh, chief medical officer at Agendia, said the test could potentially spare patients from unnecessary chemotherapy. “The toxicities and side effects of chemotherapy may outweigh the potentially small and non-statistically significant benefit of chemotherapy in women at high-risk based on clinical factors, but at low risk per MammaPrint,” he said. “Thus, physicians and breast cancer patients may on an individual basis decide to avoid it.” The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, came from a clinical trial involving 6,693 patients across 112 cancer centres in nine European countries over five years. Dr Gabriel Hortobagyi, of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas and chair of the Agendia medical advisory board, said: “The reporting of these conclusive results of the trial will now give physicians increased confidence that in using MammaPrint, their treatment decisions will be based on the highest level of clinical evidence and will minimize the incidence of over- or under-treatment.” Professor Laura van’t Veer of the University of California San Francisco, who helped design the test for Agendia, told The Telegraph: “Our ability to profile the gene expression of a tumour is transforming the way we characterise cancers and how we can more effectively treat patients.” She said it is already being used to help breast cancer patients safely avoid chemotherapy. MammaPrint is currently approved for use by the Food and Drugs Administration in the US. In the UK the test is only available privately, as the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) discusses the potential for making it available on the NHS. Summary:","completion":"Scientists have made a new test called MammaPrint, which can help tell if breast cancer will come back in some patients. This test is amazing because it lets doctors look at what is inside the cancer and might help many women avoid difficult treatments they don't need. Some cancer treatments can make people feel very sick and lose their hair, but MammaPrint could help doctors choose the best treatment without using these strong medicines unless they really need to. This test is only for private use in the UK right now, but it may be approved for more UK patients soon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two sentences are not paraphrases of each other, as they convey different scenarios. Let's break down the meaning of each sentence to better understand their differences: Sentence 1: He was chosen before the next match at Lord's and was never injured again. This sentence tells us that the person in question was selected to play or participate before a forthcoming match at Lord's, which is a famous cricket ground in London. Additionally, the sentence highlights that after being selected, the person did not experience any more injuries during their career. The overall tone of this sentence is positive, as it implies that the person continued to play without any injury problems. Sentence 2: He was injured before the next match at Lord's, and was never chosen again. In contrast to the first sentence, this one implies that the person suffered an injury before the upcoming match at Lord's. As a result of this injury, the person was not selected to play again. This sentence has a negative tone, as it tells the story of someone who was injured and never had the opportunity to participate in the sport they were involved with again. In summary, the two sentences are not paraphrases of each other because they describe different situations. The first sentence reveals a player who was chosen for a match at Lord's and did not face further injuries, while the second sentence describes a person who was injured before a match at Lord's and was never chosen to play again due to their injury."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have unfriended someone over his near daily harassment of me to come over to his way of thinking. Way back in 2006, when Facebook was a young whelp and I had a newborn who steadfastly refused to sleep at night, I would sit and connect with old friends from university and high school, many of whom I had not seen or spoken with in more than a decade. One of those people was Scott. Scott was a super nice guy. He was a year ahead of me at university. He was a bit socially awkward but you really couldn’t hope to meet a more genuine individual. Like most people, Scott had had some ups and downs in his life. At some point he found religion. Like he really, really found it. Now, I am somewherere between an agnostic and an atheist but my attitude is generally live and let live. But Scott couldn’t do that. Almoost every day he would send me some sort of message. “What do you pray about?” I don’t. “God loves you, he gave his son for you, why don’t you love Him?” Because I don’t believe He or his Son exist. “What are you going to say when you die and stand before Satan instead of God?” Missed that by a mile, didn’t I? This went on for a few months. His questions became increasing unhinged and the only thing that mattered to him were his beliefs. Mine were of no consequence. I had asked him, politely at first and then more assertively, to stop bombarding me with his attempts to convert me or to witness to me. All to no avail. Finally, I’d had enough and decided I had better things to do. I pulled the plug and unfriended Scott. He’s sent me several friend requests over the years, all of which I have summarily ignored.

Article: A Japanese toy maker declares that they have developed a gadget that translates dog barks into human language and plans to begin selling the gadget----under the name of Bowlingual----in U. S. pet stores and gift shops this summer. Tokyo-based Takara Co. Ltd. says about 300, 000 of the dog translator gadgets have been sold since it was on sale in Japan late last year. It is forecasting far bigger sales once an English language translation for dogs comes to America in August. The United States is home to about 67 million dogs, more than six times the number in Japan. \\"We know that the Americans love their dogs so much, so we don't think they will mind spending 120 on this product, \\" the Takara marketing manager said during an interview at a recent pet products conference in Atlanta. Regarded as one of the coolest inventions of 2002 by Time magazine, Bowlingual is made up of a 3 - inch long wireless microphone that is fastened to a dog collar and sends out sounds to a small console that is connected to a database . The console divides each bark into six emotional types----happiness, sadness, disappointment, anger, threat and desire----and shows common phrases, such as \\"You're ticking me off,\\" that fit the dog's emotional state. Takara says it has spent millions of dollars developing the gadget in cooperation with famous sound experts and animal behaviorists. One thing that does appear certain is that the markets for animal translation products will likely remain a dog's world since Takara has no plans to develop a similar gadget for cats. \\" _ are too unpredictable , \\" the marketing manager said.

Although both sides squandered opportunities after the break, the game looked destined to end goalless. But Kermorgant seized on a loose ball in the Cardiff box and struck an emphatic half-volley to seal Reading's first away win of the season. It was a rare moment of quality in an otherwise forgettable meeting between two sides who struggled to play with any fluency. The most significant event of the day for Cardiff was their omission of goalkeeper David Marshall ahead of a £5m move to Hull. His successor, Ben Wilson, almost gifted Reading victory midway through the second half as he dropped the ball in the Bluebirds' box, but Roy Beerens' scuffed shot was cleared off the line. Paul Trollope's side mustered some promising chances - Immers and Sean Morrison both missing with free headers - but their toothless attacking display prompted boos from the home crowd at the final whistle. Cardiff manager Paul Trollope: \\"I'm really frustrated. We prepared really well and created enough chances, especially in the first period, to be in front. \\"We controlled the game and coped well with their game to limit them to a few chances.

Now, well, now it's just...crap.I dare you to listen to a clip from \\"The Little Mermaid\\" soundtrack of \\"Part of Your World,\\" and then this. It's just disgusting.Disney made gorgeous music. Why are they trying to destroy it? What is wrong with them? They're so greedy. They made the most entertaining music ever, and then went on to destroy it.Do NOT buy this. Instead, buy \\"Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic.\\" 125 of the original disney songs (including just about all of the music from \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"The Little Mermaid\\") for about ten dollars more than all of these rip offs.

Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack. Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write an article based on this summary: Fill out pro and con columns on a sheet of paper. Keep emotional distance from the issue you’re evaluating. Consider how the “cons” can be overcome. Article:","completion":"Title: A Balanced Approach: Using Pro and Con Columns to Make Informed Decisions Introduction In our daily lives, we constantly face numerous decisions; some insignificant, others impactful. At times, it can be difficult to make these decisions and finding an objective approach is vital. One such approach is the use of pro and con columns. In this article, we will explore the benefits of using pro and con columns to maintain emotional distance and carefully evaluate the issue at hand. Step 1: Filling Out the Pro and Con Columns To start, simply take a sheet of paper and divide it into two columns. Label one column 'pros' and the other 'cons.' This visual representation helps to create a clearer understanding of the issue. Next, think about the decision or problem being faced and consider all the possible positive and negative outcomes. Write these points down in the respective columns, and take your time to ensure that you have considered all aspects of the situation. Step 2: Keeping Emotional Distance It can be easy to let emotions cloud our judgment when it comes to making decisions, which may result in irrational choices. By maintaining emotional distance from the issue, we can remain unbiased and focus on the facts at hand. Writing down the pros and cons of a situation allows us to detach ourselves from potential emotional influences and clearly assess the situation. Step 3: Evaluating the Cons and Finding Solutions Once you have filled out the pro and con columns, it's important to carefully review the list. Consider the weight and significance of each point. Some cons may have more impact on the overall decision than others. By recognizing these points, you can give more attention to the cons that truly matter. With a clearer understanding of the cons, the next step is to evaluate whether there are possible solutions or alternatives to overcome them. Brainstorm ways you can mitigate the negative aspects of the situation or decision. The goal is to improve the overall outcome and to address potential concerns in a proactive manner. Conclusion In conclusion, using pro and con columns can significantly help individuals make more informed, objective decisions in both their personal and professional lives. This approach ensures that we don't let emotions cloud our judgment and that all aspects of a situation are considered. By evaluating the cons and working to find possible solutions, individuals can make a final decision with confidence and clarity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
