I only clean it with dry paper towel and once in a while, I apply white vinegar for disinfection but I do wash the cup which is the cap. I have had it since 2008 and it has not burned out yet. One thing that I have noticed is that it will get stuck if I try to grind only sesame seed because sesame seed is extremely oily. I consume flax seed because of the Omega-3 which comes without cholesterol unlike fish so I need to grind both seeds together which balances out since flax is less oily than sesame seed. Bravo.

Versatility: The reviewer did not use the grinder for its intended purpose (grinding coffee) but instead used it to grind flax and sesame seeds, indicating that the product works well in various applications. 2. Strength and speed: The reviewer mentions that the grinder is light, fast, and powerful enough to provide a fine powder for their drink. 3. Durability: The reviewer notes that they have had the grinder since 2008, and it has not burned out yet, suggesting that the product has a long lifespan and stands up well to regular use. 4. Easy maintenance: The reviewer explains that they clean the grinder with dry paper towels and occasionally use white vinegar for disinfection, indicating that the product's maintenance is straightforward and manageable.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It's important to know the signs of a child who is angry or upset so you can help them connect their emotions to verbal or physical cues. Then they can recognize when they're getting upset. These can be expressed verbally or through physical actions. Here are a few to watch out for: Clenched fists Tension or holding themselves tightly Angry facial expressions Stomping Verbal outbursts such as yelling and cursing One of the simplest fixes for an upset child is to make sure their basic needs are met. Here's a list of some basic needs that most children require: Physical needs such as not being hungry, cold, or tired. Attention. Children need attention from caregivers and people around them. Read them a book or play games together. Stimulation. Children need novel stimulation in order to thrive. New toys, friends, and activities can help them avoid emotional problems. Feeling safe and security. If your home is chaotic, they may act out because of feeling insecure. Laughter is a great way to break tension and release difficult emotions after the child has calmed down. Do something that makes the child laugh. Just make sure they don't think you're laughing at them, and also make sure it's an appropriate time to lighten the mood (not, for example, in the middle of a big argument). Here are some things you can do: Tell a joke. Watch a funny TV show or read a funny book together. Make funny faces. This is most effective with younger children. Touch is known to calm nerves, especially if it's coming from a loving, trusted source. Hugging and embracing release oxytocin in the body, which is the \\"bonding hormone.\\" This hormone reduces stress levels and increases positive feelings. If a child is upset and overwhelmed, offer plenty of touch in order to help them recover and show him that you're a trustworthy source of comfort. Don't restrain the child, even accidentally. This can increase their feelings of powerlessness, and teach them that they need someone else to control their behavior. Stressful situations can reduce anyone to an emotional mess, adults as well as children. Sometimes the most effective approach is to remove the child from the distress. For example, if they throw a tantrum over wanting something in a store, exit the store as quickly as possible. You can deal with the behavior afterward; your first step should be to reduce the intensity of the situation, if possible. This will make it easier for everyone involved. It's not out of the ordinary for kids to use physical aggression to try and get what they want. If a child tends to act out physically, try to get them to channel their energy into other ways of expressing themselves. Reward them when they tell you what's wrong or draw an angry picture rather than becoming violent. Lashing out physically is a form of communication that some children learn can be effective. Make sure not to reinforce the behavior by giving in to their demands or allowing them to be violent without consequences. Don't forget to keep your own safety in mind. Pacify a violent child if you can. Take steps to prevent injury. If they attack if you get close, then don't get in their personal space. Wait until they are calm enough to be approached. Absolutely avoid responding with physical aggression of your own. This will teach them that it's an effective way to communicate and get what they want. Contact a therapist who specializes in treating children if physical aggression is a common event and is violent. Children can be predictable in getting angry and upset. Pay specific attention to \\"trouble times\\" with the child, such as right before bed or when they need to do homework. Be extra sensitive and aware of the child's feelings in these moments. You don't need to make excuses for them, but it's helpful to be aware of these higher stress times. Prepare in advance if the child regularly has issues handling a particular behavior. Create a game-plan for how to react so that you can avoid spur of the moment decisions. It's more effective to reinforce the things the child does right than to punish bad behavior. You can't always avoid punishment, but if possible, wait for your child to do something right and then encourage that behavior. Here are some ways you can reward good behavior: Use nonverbal communication. Head nods, smiles, and hugs are an effective way to reinforce behavior and better the relationship without needing to spend money. Provide extra positive attention. Be specific with verbal praise. If the child does well on a test, tell them \\"I'm proud of you for working hard on this test.\\" It's a great idea to show your child how to calm themselves down during moments of anger and being upset. These skills will make things easier for you and teach them to manage their emotions early, so that they are less likely to develop emotional problems later on in life. Here are some suggestions for things to teach: Apply deep pressure. This could mean asking for a back rub from a loved one, giving themselves a hand massage, wrapping themselves tightly in a blanket, or using a weighted lap pad or blanket. Offer drawing, painting, or coloring materials. This can help them focus on something other than being upset while also giving them an outlet for their emotions. Show him the same deep breathing techniques that you use. You can make it playful by exaggerating the bodily movements. Provide a calming item or favorite stuffed animal that they can touch or hug when upset. If they are scared to be away from home, you can provide a small reminder of safety that they can carry in their pocket, and they can can touch or look at when feeling sad or anxious.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of recognizing the signs of anger or upset in children and provides various strategies to help them manage their emotions. These strategies include ensuring the child's basic needs are met, using laughter to break tension, incorporating physical touch, removing the child from stressful situations, redirecting aggressive behaviors, being mindful of trouble times, rewarding good behavior, and teaching self-calming techniques.

Context: The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario, which results in less coal being loaded and ultimately, less coal arriving at the power station, is directly impacting a step of the process. To understand the reasoning for this answer, let's review the entire process and identify the connection between the loading of coal and the ultimate outcome – the amount of coal that reaches the power station. 1. A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain: This step involves creating an opening or a passage for miners to access the coal deposits. This step does not directly impact the loading of coal or the amount reaching the power station. 2. Miners enter the mine: In this step, miners go into the excavated mine to extract the coal. Although essential, it doesn't directly impact the quantity of coal being loaded. 3. Miners remove the coal from the mine: This step signifies the actual extraction process where miners dig and remove coal from the mine. The quantity of coal extracted can impact the amount loaded and transported, but it is not the loading step itself. 4. The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt: This is a crucial step that directly relates to the loading of coal. If less coal is put into carts or on the conveyor belt, it directly affects the amount of coal that can be loaded onto trucks for transportation. 5. The coal is moved up to the surface: Bringing the coal from the mine to the surface doesn't directly affect the quantity of coal being loaded unless there is an issue with transport. 6. The coal is loaded onto a truck: This is the step that is directly impacted by the perturbation. If less coal is loaded onto the truck, it directly results in less coal arriving at the power station. It is the primary point in the process affected by the perturbation. 7. The truck takes the coal to a power station: In this last step, the truck transports the available coal to the power station. If less coal is loaded, the truck will carry less coal and, as a result, deliver less coal to the power station. Thus, the supposed perturbation directly impacts a step of the process - the coal-loading step. Reducing the amount of coal loaded onto the truck will lead to a direct reduction in the amount of coal arriving at the power station."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: The Deer Isle Bridge encountered wind stability problems that were similar to a bridge found in which U.S. state? Answer:","completion":"The Deer Isle Bridge encountered wind stability problems that were similar to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in the U.S. state of Washington. The Deer Isle Bridge, which is situated in Maine, is a suspension bridge that was completed in 1939. Since its completion, the bridge has been known to experience considerable oscillations due to wind-induced forces, especially during high winds. The suspension system oscillates in both vertical and torsional directions. These stability issues came to light because the design of the Deer Isle Bridge incorporated narrow, shallow stiffening trusses, which made it susceptible to wind-induced vibrations. Following the bridge's completion, it underwent several retrofits to increase its wind resistance, including modifications to its stiffening trusses. Similarly, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, located in Washington state, suffered from wind stability problems and experienced catastrophic failure due to wind-induced torsional oscillations. The bridge, which was also a suspension bridge, opened in 1940 but collapsed only a few months later in an incident famously known as \\"Galloping Gertie.\\" The bridge featured a slim, shallow plate girder which provided insufficient stiffness and torsional resistance, allowing wind to cause excessive oscillations that ultimately led to its collapse. The designs of both bridges failed to account for the critical importance of aerodynamics and wind resistance in suspension bridge engineering. The failures and challenges faced by both the Deer Isle Bridge and Tacoma Narrows Bridge prompted extensive research, innovations, and major changes in the design and construction of suspension bridges. As a result, wind tunnel testing and aerodynamic stability assessments have become standard procedures in suspension bridge design to ensure long-term stability and safety under various wind conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The kinases are heterotrimers that comprise a catalytic subunit and regulatory subunits that sense cellular energy levels. When energy status is compromised, the system activates catabolic pathways and switches off protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation.

Write a summary based on this article: Lying in the street and seemingly locked in a kiss as chaos erupts around them, a young couple appear oblivious to the charging crowds and baton-wielding riot police. The photograph, taken amid Vancouver's hockey riots, has been tweeted around the world. But the photographer who took it is still not sure what the picture really shows. Canada-based photojournalist Richard Lam took the photograph while covering the riots that followed the Vancouver Canucks' 4-0 loss to the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup. The photographer was being buffeted by rioters and riot police when he spotted the couple. \\"I was about 20 or 30 yards away,\\" he said. \\"There were these two people on the ground in this empty street. Initially I thought one of them was hurt.\\" He took a few shots and then the moment was lost. \\"It was complete chaos. Rioters set two cars on fire and then I saw looters break the window at a neighbouring department store,\\" he said. \\"At that point, the riot police charged right towards us. After I stopped running, I noticed in the space behind the line of police that two people were lying in the street with the riot police and a raging fire just beyond them. \\"I knew I had captured a 'moment' when I snapped the still forms against the backdrop of such chaos but it wasn't until later when I returned to the rink to file my photos that my editor pointed out that the two people were not hurt, but kissing.\\" \\"Everyone has been asking who they are,\\" said Lam but he has no idea and never had the opportunity to speak to them. Even now he's not sure whether the picture shows a couple kissing or whether one of the two people is hurt. \\"I keep looking at the picture but I don't know what I think any more,\\" he said. [This update was inserted on 17 June 2011: After publication of this Guardian article, further details about the couple and the incident emerged. A subsequent Guardian online piece is headlined Vancouver kiss couple 'were knocked down by riot police'.] Officials in Vancouver said almost 150 people required hospital treatment and almost 100 were arrested during the riot. A spokeswoman for the local health authority said three stabbing victims had been admitted and an one man was in critical condition with head injuries after a fall from a viaduct. Rioting and looting left cars burned, stores in shambles and windows shattered over a roughly 10-block radius of the city's main shopping district. Police Chief Jim Chu said nine officers were injured, including one who required 14 stitches after being hit with a thrown brick. Chu said some officers suffered bite marks. He said 15 cars were burned, including two police cars. He called those who incited the riot \\"criminals and anarchists\\" and said officers identified some in the crowd as the same people who smashed windows and caused trouble through the same streets the day after the 2010 Winter Olympics opened in 2010. \\"These were people who came equipped with masks, goggles and gasoline,\\" he said. \\"They had a plan.\\" Chu said those who stood by and filmed and cheered also bear some responsibility. Assistant Fire Chief Wade Pierlot said people had to be rescued from rooftops and bathrooms where they had hidden for safety. He said some people moved burning dumpsters away from buildings to prevent further damage. • This article was amended on 17 June 2011 to insert an update. ||||| Use your ← → (arrow) keys to browse the slideshow First things first—how amazing is this photo?

A:","completion":"Paul Dudley Sargent was a prominent military and civic leader during the American Revolutionary War, and he held the title of Baron in the town of Sullivan, which is located in Hancock County, Maine. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of his life and connection to this town and county, let's dive into a brief biography of Paul Dudley Sargent and a historical overview of the county and town. Paul Dudley Sargent was born in Salem, Massachusetts, on February 24, 1745, into a distinguished family. His father, Colonel Epes Sargent, was a leading merchant and military figure in the community, while his mother, Catherine Winthrop Sargent, belonged to the prestigious Winthrop family, one of the founding families of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Sargent began his military career as an officer under Sir William Phips during the failed 1746 expedition against the French province of Acadia. He then moved to Maine, where he engaged in surveying and land speculation work. In 1761, he acquired a significant portion of land in what is now known as Sullivan, Maine. During this time, Maine was part of the larger Massachusetts Bay Colony, and the land was initially called New Worcester. During the American Revolutionary War, Paul Dudley Sargent played a significant role in the military and political efforts, proving to be an ardent supporter of the American independence cause. He first served as a captain in a Massachusetts regiment and then advanced in rank, ultimately becoming a colonel. Sargent participated in numerous key battles and events, including the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Saratoga Campaign, and the Battle of Rhode Island. In the postwar years, Sargent returned to his land in what is now Sullivan, and he was instrumental in organizing and developing the settlement. He built mills, a store, and a vessel, which accelerated the growth of the community. Paul Dudley Sargent's influence and prominence in the area led to him being recognized as the \\"Baron of Sullivan.\\" Sullivan, located in Hancock County, Maine, was originally settled in the 1760s and was incorporated on February 16, 1789. The town, like many in coastal Maine, developed around the shipbuilding, fishing, and lumber industries. Due to its picturesque landscapes and natural beauty, Sullivan eventually became a popular summer destination for tourists. Hancock County, in which the town of Sullivan is located, was established on June 25, 1789. Named in honor of John Hancock, the first signer of the Declaration of Independence, the county includes towns such as Bar Harbor, Ellsworth, Southwest Harbor, and Tremont. This region encompasses scenic locations and natural features of Maine, such as the Acadia National Park, various bays, and harbors that testify to its historical roots in shipbuilding and maritime navigation. In conclusion, Paul Dudley Sargent was regarded as the Baron of Sullivan, a town situated in Hancock County, Maine. His military and civic contributions during the American Revolutionary War and the following years played a pivotal role in shaping the town's development and history. Hancock County's breathtaking landscapes, rich cultural history, and strong ties to Sargent's life make it an essential location for understanding the broader context of his title as the Baron of Sullivan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this instance: Article: Many children have a \\"bug period\\"--a time of life when bugs are a source of endless fascination and learning. Naturalist Edward O. Wilson jokes that unlike other kids, he never grew out of his bug period. Luckily for this biologist, his lifelong passion for ants has led to a career rich in accomplishments and praise. He is not just the world's foremost expert on the social behavior of ants, but also the receiver of the National Medal of Science and two Pulitzer Prizes for nonfiction. Now, at the age of 80, Wilson has tried his hand at fiction. His first novel, Anthill, combines two of his greatest loves -- his childhood home, Alabama, and the ants that have been his lifelong friends. Described as a \\"six-legged Iliad,\\" Wilson's Anthill draws parallels between human and ant societies. Though there are no ant bands, secret police, or schools of philosophy, both ants and man conduct wars, divide themselves into specialized classes of workers, build cities, maintain infant nurseries and cemeteries, take slaves and practice agriculture, though ant societies are more energetic, selfless, and efficient than human ones. The book's first and third sections deal with the adventures of an Alabama boy, Raphael Semmes Cody, who goes by the name Raff. The boy grows up knocking around the Nokobee woods; he's drawn to its natural wonders, and uses the forest to escape from his parents' unhappy marriage. In the woods he leaves almost no stone unturned as he discovers the forest's rich flora and fauna . Raff grows up and heads to Harvard to study law, but returns later in life to protect the Nokobee from crazy developers. But fans of Wilson's science will be most interested in the book's middle section, where the author inserts a mini-novel describing the trials and sufferings of the ants living in the endangered forest. Reviews of the book have been mixed. Writing for The New York Review of Books, Margaret Atwood praised Wilson for his first novel, saying that it is highlighted by a diversity of ideas and an imaginative plot. And -- with the exception of some dull preachiness -- it is entertaining. Answer: He has the same hobbies as many children. Student:","completion":"Question: What is one similarity between Edward O.

The Rasmussen family, who live in Utah County, now range in age from one month old to 95 years old. The latest addition, baby Krew Alexander Woodland was born on August 1. ‘It was very important to me after the birth of Krew, to have a six generation picture,’ said Krew's mother Haylee Woodland told the Daily Herald. ‘I feel so very blessed to have so many grandmas still living.’ Family portrait: Six generations of the same family pose for a photo - they range in age from one month old to 95 years old. Krew’s great, great, great, grandmother Ruth Rasmussen was born in January 1918. She and her husband Niels raised three children including daughter Vivian. Vivian Jensen Schramm was born in April 1936.

A few days later, Detective Giovanni Malloy questions her as he investigates the gruesome murder of a young woman, whose severed limb was found in her garden. They flirt despite the grisly nature of their introduction, and meet at the same bar later. Frannie is alternately thrilled and frightened by the detective's sexual aggressiveness, even as she grows more disillusioned with the attitudes and crude behavior of other men, including the detective's partner, Richard Rodriguez. Even as Malloy defends his partner, who can no longer carry a gun because he threatened his unfaithful wife, he promises he will do anything she wants except hit her. She leaves abruptly and is assaulted walking home, but calls Malloy and their affair begins that night. Frannie recognizes the detective's tattoo, from the man in the basement of the bar, and asks her sister Pauline if she would trust a man who got a blow job in a bar. Pauline says yes, but Frannie is still suspicious. After Malloy tells her that she and the first victim were in the same bar the night of the murder, and she might have seen the murderer, she begins to suspect that Malloy may actually be the killer, especially after a second victim is found. But later she goes with him to a woodsy spot by the water, where he scares her by shooting at garbage bags floating on the surface, then tells her she should learn how to shoot. She surprises herself by taking aim and shooting well, before they head back to the city. She finds her old boyfriend in her bed when she gets home, and goes back to her sister's apartment, where she finds the door open and Pauline's dismembered body. She is now more frightened of Malloy than ever, but goes home and gets drunk, and almost stumbles into bed with her student before throwing him out.

Answer:","completion":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what can develop into new haploid individuals without being fertilized?\\" is not \\"alpacas.\\" Alpacas are mammals, and their reproductive process involves fertilization between haploid gametes (sperm and eggs) to form a diploid zygote, which then develops into a new individual. The correct answer in this context would be the spores of certain fungi, such as Candida and Aspergillus, which can indeed develop into new haploid individuals without being fertilized. This process is called asexual reproduction, where new individuals are created without the fusion of gametes. In other terms, it involves the formation of spores, which are haploid cells (containing a single set of unpaired chromosomes), and these spores grow into new haploid organisms that are genetically identical to the parent organism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Logic test: Eric is trying out his rollerblades. He puts them on on the grass lawn and has a hard time skating. When Eric skates on the sidewalk, he can go fast and it is easy. The surface with the most resistance is the (A) grass lawn (B) sidewalk. A:","completion":"The answer they should choose to the question concerning resistance in skating is (A) grass lawn. This is justified by understanding the underlying physics and logic. Here we'll discuss why. The question refers to the concept of resistance in physics. When we talk about resistance in this context, we're discussing the resistance to motion that an object encounters when it's moving over a surface. This resistance, also known as friction, varies depending on the type and characteristics of the surfaces in contact. In the case of Eric rollerblading, the two different surfaces he's skating on are a grass lawn and a sidewalk. These surfaces are different in several ways that influence the friction they produce. A sidewalk, being a flat, hard, and smooth surface, produces less friction compared to the grass lawn. The wheels of the rollerblades can roll smoothly and with minimal obstruction over the sidewalk, therefore, making it easier and faster for Eric to skate. Essentially, Eric's rollerblades and the sidewalk don't have much of a resistance force between them, which means Eric has an easier time when skating. On the contrary, a grass lawn is a soft, uneven and rough surface. The grass blades and the soil unevenness create a greater amount of friction, thus slowing Eric down when he tries to skate on it. This is because the grass blades and other inconsistencies on the surface create more obstructions that the wheels of rollerblades need to overcome. Consequently, Eric's rollerblades and the grass lawn have a larger resistance force between them, which makes it more challenging for Eric to skate. The logic test question thus can be interpreted in this way: In terms of providing resistance to the motion of Eric's rollerblades, which surface (i.e., the grass lawn or the sidewalk) creates more friction and hence more resistance? From our explanation, it's clear that the grass lawn provides more resistance as compared to the sidewalk. So, if your students are learning about friction and resistance, this example with Eric trying out his rollerblades can be a practical illustration for them to understand the principle at work. Therefore, in response to the logic test question, the surface with the most resistance is the (A) grass lawn."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Jennifer is currently looking for a new city to move to since she is looking to change her life and just do something different. Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs. Will Dapperton have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown? Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. The answer is:","completion":"Dapperton will have a lower chance of acid rain compared to Jamestown. The primary reason behind this is the difference in their electricity generation methods. Jamestown uses coal for its electricity, which contributes to air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Burning coal releases sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which react with the atmosphere to form sulfuric and nitric acids. These acids then enter the atmosphere and fall to the ground as acid rain. In contrast, Dapperton relies on nuclear power for its energy needs. While nuclear power does have its disadvantages, such as limited radioactive elements and the management of nuclear waste, it does not release the harmful emissions associated with burning fossil fuels like coal. Nuclear fission does not emit sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides, resulting in cleaner air and a lower likelihood of acid rain. While both cities have amenities that Jennifer finds attractive, choosing Dapperton will align better with her environmental beliefs, since the city has a lower chance of contributing to acid rain and its associated environmental problems. This choice ultimately supports Jennifer's commitment to taking care of the Earth and reducing her personal impact on the environment."},{"prompt":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Ghost advises the villagers to flee, then he departs to take on the Vikings alone, but is joined by Jester, a mute admirer, who refuses to leave his side, and Starfire, who decides to leave the tribe for him. They defeat a few Vikings and collect their arms and armour. Pathfinder goes after his daughter and also joins the fight. Eventually, both Jester and Pathfinder are executed brutally, and Ghost and Starfire are captured. The Vikings threaten to torture Starfire if Ghost will not betray the location of the other villages. Ghost pretends to lead the Vikings to the tribe, and manages to kill most of them on the way, some drowning in a lake and others caught in an avalanche. Ghost eventually kills Gunnar in a duel on a cliff's edge Ghost returns to Starfire with Pathfinder's necklace, thus making Starfire the new Pathfinder after her father. Ghost, now finally respected as the bravest of the tribe and one of their own, assumes his position watching over the coast in case the Vikings ever return.

On their way home, at a stop sign, Paige unbuckles her seatbelt to lean over and kiss Leo. At that very moment, a truck rams their car from behind and Paige crashes through the windshield. Both of them are rushed to the emergency room, and as Leo, in a voice-over talks about how \\"moments of impact help in finding who we are\\" the movie cuts to how Paige and Leo first met. The scenes of how they courted, became engaged and married at the Art Institute of Chicago and share a kiss under the Cloud Gate are interwoven with the present. When Paige regains consciousness, she thinks Leo is her doctor, having lost all memories of the past few years. When her wealthy parents, Bill and Rita Thornton, learn about this, they visit her. This is the first time that Leo meets them, and they do not appreciate Leo taking their daughter, and not being informed. Paige does not understand why he would not have met her parents, after having been married to her. She finds it even stranger that he did not know why either. Nor did she understand why she left law school, broke her engagement with her previous fiancé, Jeremy, and why she has not been in touch with her family and friends. Her parents insist on taking her home with them and Paige agrees, thinking she might have married Leo for some mutual benefit. She seeks evidence of the marriage. Just as she is about to leave, Leo comes running to play her a voice message in which she sounds very happy and romantic. Paige decides to go back with Leo, hoping it will help her regain her lost memory.

Generate a question that has the following answer: Thet Sambath for the following movie plot: A personal journey into the heart of the Killing FieldsOne of the most harrowing and compelling personal documentaries of our time, ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE exposes for the first time the truth about the Killing Fields and the Khmer Rouge who were behind Cambodias horrific genocide. More than simply an inquiry into Cambodias experience, however, ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE is a profound meditation on the nature of good and evil, shedding light on the capacity of some people to do terrible things and for others to forgive them.Winner of a dozen top documentary festival awards, including a Special Jury Prize at Sundance and the Grand Jury Award at the Full Frame Documentary Festival, this is a riveting film that takes audiences as close to witnessing evil as they are ever likely to get. It is also a personal journey into the heart of darkness by journalist/filmmaker Thet Sambath, whose family was wiped out in the Killing Fields, but whose patience and discipline elicits unprecedented on-camera confessions from perpetrators at all levels of the Khmer Rouge hierarchy. This is investigative journalism of the highest order.In 1974, Thet Sambaths father became one of the nearly two million people who were murdered by the Khmer Rouge when he refused to give them his buffalo. Sambaths mother was forced to marry a Khmer Rouge militiaman and died in childbirth in 1976, while his eldest brother disappeared in 1977. Sambath himself escaped Cambodia at age 10 when the Khmer Rouge fell in 1979.Fast forward to 1998, and Sambath, now a journalist, got to know the children of some senior Khmer Rouge cadre and gradually earned their trust. Then, for a decade, he spent weekends visiting the home of the most senior surviving leader, Nuon Chea, aka Brother Number Two under Pol Pot. But he never used to say anything different from what he told Western journalists, says Sambath, I was low-ranking, I knew nothing, I am not a killer. Then one day he said to me Sambath, I trust you, you are the person I would like to tell my story to. Ask me...

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

In his chemistry lab David is learning about acids. He took three solutions to identify them correctly, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a strong acid; sample B is a weak acid; and sample C is not an acid. David needs to identify the content of each sample by learning about their attributes. Hint: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass. The answer is:","completion":"Sample C would have a pH higher than seven. To fully understand the answer, we must first analyze the information given in the paragraph. David's chemistry lab is focused on acids, and he has three samples: A, B, and C. Sample A is a strong acid, sample B is a weak acid, and sample C is not an acid. The paragraph also explains the relationship between the concentration of hydronium ions and pH levels. When the concentration of hydronium ions is higher than that of pure water, the solution has a pH lower than 7, and it is considered an acid. As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases, making the solution more acidic and lower in pH. Considering this information, we can deduce the pH levels of the three samples. Sample A, being a strong acid, will have a high concentration of hydronium ions, resulting in a pH lower than 7. Similarly, sample B, a weak acid, will have a lower concentration of hydronium ions compared to sample A but still higher than that of pure water, resulting in a pH lower than 7 as well, albeit higher than sample A's pH. Now, let's focus on sample C, which is not an acid. This means that it does not have a high concentration of hydronium ions, unlike the other two samples. Because the concentration of hydronium ions in sample C is not higher than that of pure water, its pH will not be lower than 7. Instead, it will have a pH higher than 7. In conclusion, sample C has a pH higher than seven, as it is not an acid and does not have a higher concentration of hydronium ions compared to pure water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

[+] Samantha had lived in the community since childhood.","completion":"Lindsey knew all their neighbors well, but Samantha did not, since Lindsey had lived in the community since childhood. Growing up in the community afforded Lindsey ample time and opportunity to establish strong connections and lasting relationships with the people around her. Throughout her formative years, Lindsey attended the local school, participated in community events, and took part in various neighborhood gatherings. This allowed her to get to know her neighbors on a personal level, understanding their stories, their families, and their preferences. As a result, Lindsey's extensive knowledge of the local history and culture made her an invaluable resource for her neighbors. In addition to being able to recall fond memories and shared experiences, Lindsey had an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the community's traditions, practices, and values. On the other hand, Samantha had not grown up in the community and was therefore unable to develop the same level of familiarity and connections as Lindsey had. Having moved into the neighborhood later in life, Samantha faced the challenge of establishing new relationships and adapting to the local customs and values. Though Samantha made efforts to integrate herself into the community by attending social events, participating in group activities, and engaging in conversation with her neighbors, her later arrival meant that she missed out on the years of shared experiences and memories that Lindsey had. Consequently, Samantha found it more challenging to form strong bonds with her neighbors in the same way that Lindsey had. Moreover, Samantha's lack of familiarity with the local culture and traditions occasionally hindered her ability to relate to her neighbors. While Lindsey could effortlessly recall a neighbor's child's graduation or reminisce about past block parties, Samantha had no personal experiences to draw upon, making it more difficult for her to foster the same level of connection as Lindsey. Given these circumstances, it is not surprising that Lindsey knew all their neighbors well, while Samantha did not. Lindsey's lifelong presence in the community fostered deep and lasting relationships with her neighbors, while Samantha, though eager to establish connections, faced both practical and social challenges in her efforts to do so."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Any Way the Wind Blows is Tom Barmans (who is also know as front man of the rock formation 'dEUS') debut movie. Entirely shot in Antwerp (Belgium), the movie starts on a sunny friday morning and skips rather superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters. When the movie ends, you have a lot of stuff to think about, because most of the different story-lines are left wide open. The movie has a (purely instrumental) sound track that will rock your socks off. In most scenes, the music truly enhances the general atmosphere and feel, really making the movie hallucinating to watch at certain points of time. The main scene in the film, the party, is very well shot. The director didn't hesitate to use video clip techniques, having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks I've heard lately. The screenplay is great stuff. Camera angles and colors are very well chosen. The 'costumes' are very hot and very 'seventies' too. And I loved (most of the) acting. The thing I liked most about the movie, are the subtle touches of absurd, surreal, very dry or even cynical humor that interleave. Without claiming to be a comedy (this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art), it still manages to have its audience giggling and even burst into laughter at some times. This is one more directors' debut that shouldn't be an ending. I hope to see more Tom Barman movies in the future because I had a good time. Cheers. What is the sentiment of this review?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Living things need non-living matter as well as energy. What do you think matter is used for? One thing is to build bodies. They also need it to carry out the processes of life. Any non-living matter that living things need is called a nutrient. Carbon and nitrogen are examples of nutrients. Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. You can see how in Figure 3.11. Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms. The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots. The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants. The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers. When living things die, the cycle repeats. Question: \\"How are the nutrients processed?\\" Answer: \\"The roots take up the nutrients they are passed on to those that eat the plants and then are passed to higher level consumer who eat the lower ones\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the provided answer is generally correct. Nutrients are processed in ecosystems through various stages. To elaborate on the answer, the nutrient cycle can be explained in the following steps: 1. Decomposers: Decomposers such as fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms break down dead plants, animals, and waste products. During this process, nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus are released back into the environment. 2. Absorption by plants: Plants absorb these nutrients through their roots, taking up essential elements for their growth and metabolism. Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy, also plays a role in integrating these nutrients into organic compounds within the plant. 3. Primary consumers: When primary consumers (herbivores) eat plants, they consume the nutrients stored within the plant tissues. The nutrients are then integrated into the primary consumer's body for various life processes, such as building new cells and tissues, growth, reproduction, and providing energy. 4. Higher-level consumers: As higher-level consumers (carnivores and omnivores) eat lower-level consumers, the nutrients transfer within the food chain. These nutrients are subsequently used to support the life processes of the higher-level consumers. 5. Death and decomposition: When living organisms die, their bodies decompose, returning the nutrients back to the environment and enabling the nutrient cycle to repeat. Decomposers once again play a crucial role in breaking down the dead organisms and releasing nutrients back into the ecosystem. It is important to note that this process is a continuous cycle, and nutrients are constantly being recycled through different organisms in the ecosystem. Additionally, some nutrients may be temporarily stored in the environment in different forms (e.g., in soil, water, or sediments) before they are once again made available to living organisms. Overall, the nutrient cycle is a critical mechanism that ensures the sustainability of ecosystems and supports life on Earth."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - Metrosideros is a genus of approximately 60 trees, shrubs, and vines mostly found in the Pacific region in the Myrtaceae family. Most of the tree forms are small, but some are exceptionally large, the New Zealand species in particular. The name derives from the Ancient Greek \\"metra\\" or \\"heartwood\\" and \\"sideron\\" or \\"iron\\". Perhaps the best-known species are the phutukawa (\\"M. excelsa\\"), northern rt (\\"M. robusta\\"), and southern rt (\\"M. umbellata\\") of New Zealand, and \\"hia lehua\\", (\\"M. polymorpha\\"), from the Hawaiian Islands. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - Myrtaceae is the myrtle family, a family of dicotyledonous plants placed within the order Myrtales. Myrtle, pohutukawa, the bay rum tree, clove, guava, acca (feijoa), allspice, and eucalyptus all are members of this group. All species are woody, with essential oils, and flower parts in multiples of four or five. One notable character of the family is that the phloem is located on both sides of the xylem, not just outside as in most other plants. The leaves are evergreen, alternate to mostly opposite, simple, and usually with an entire (not toothed) margin. The flowers have a base number of five petals, though in several genera the petals are minute or absent. The stamens are usually very conspicuous, brightly coloured and numerous. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Buenos Aires is the capital and most populous city of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. \\"Buenos aires\\" can be translated as \\"fair winds\\" or \\"good airs\\", but the first one was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name \\"Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre\\". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million. - A vine (Latin \\"vnea\\" \\"grapevine\\", \\"vineyard\\", from \\"vnum\\" \\"wine\\") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (\\"Vitis\\"), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or (that is, climbing) stems or runners. The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America. It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east, with the Río de la Plata (River of Silver) to the south and with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Uruguay is home to an estimated 3.42 million people, of whom 1.8 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo. With an area of approximately , Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America, only larger in size than Suriname. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Paraguay, officially the Republic of Paraguay, is a landlocked country in central South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. Paraguay lies on both banks of the Paraguay River, which runs through the center of the country from north to south. Due to its central location in South America, it is sometimes referred to as \\"Corazón de Sudamérica\\" (\\"Heart of South America\\"). Paraguay is one of the two landlocked countries (the other is Bolivia) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Paraguay is the smallest landlocked country in the Americas. - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - Metrosideros stipularis is a species of the myrtle family commonly known as tepú , trepú , or tepual . It is an evergreen tree or shrub that can attain a height of about seven metres . The plant is native to southern South America in the southern portions of Chile and Argentina and is a typical resident of very wet areas , especially peat bogs . Tepú has white flowers that emerge during the austral summer from January through March . The tree 's wood is used within its range as a firewood due to it high energy content . This species has often been placed in its own genus Tepualia , but recent works include it in Metrosideros \`\` WCSP '' . World Checklist of Selected Plant Families . . - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress.

It's not exactly a suite, but it will be good enough to make you folks comfortable for the night.\\" When the couple declined, the young man pressed on.\\"Don't worry about me; I'll make out just fine.\\" the clerk told them. So the couple agreed. As he paid his bill the next morning, the elderly man said to the clerk,\\"You are the kind of manager who should be the boss of the best hotel in the United States.

Step 1: Connect the two situations - In order to link these situations, we should find something in common between them. In this case, the \\"man\\" is the common factor. Step 2: Establish the sequence - In the question, there is no information about the sequence of these two events. It is not clear whether the man was naked in the bathtub before or after walking in the large field of grass. Without proper context or a timeline, it is hard to establish a direct connection between the two events. Step 3: Assess the context of the man's actions - In statement 1, the man is described as carrying a backpack in a large field of grass. In statement 2, the man is described as naked in a bathtub. These two actions seem unrelated to each other, as they could happen at different times or on different days.

Summarize the following: Your smoke bomb can be any shape you like. For puck-shaped smoke bombs, wrap the bottom of a soda can in aluminum foil and then remove the soda can. The foil will hold the shape. You may also want to use a ball, something square, or a simple design of your choosing. Shape the aluminum foil so the opening is facing up, then set the mold aside. Measure the sugar using a dry measuring cup to ensure you have the correct amount. Pour it into a standard sized 12 in (30 cm) skillet but don’t turn the heat on yet. Do not use a measuring cup meant for fluids, as the measurements are different. Pour the potassium nitrate into the sugar. Use a wooden spoon to mix the two powders together until they are well blended with one another. Make sure the ingredients are mixed thoroughly otherwise you could end up with an unusual burn once you’re done. Spread the mixture out in the pan once it’s thoroughly mixed. You can purchase potassium nitrate at online chemical retailers or even at some large retail stores. Place the pan on the stove with the burner set to low and continue mixing the ingredients using long, slow strokes. Eventually, the sugar will begin to melt. Continue stirring the mixture as the sugar melts and mixes with the potassium nitrate. As the sugar melts and mixes with the potassium nitrate, the two will begin to form a liquid sludge. Once it has become liquid enough to roll around the pan, pick it up off of the heat and turn off the burner. Keep stirring the mixture as you remove it from the heat. Move quickly. The mixture will begin to harden soon after it is removed from the heat. Be careful not to spill any of the mixture as you do. Once there’s a thick layer of the mixture on the bottom of the mold (it can be any depth you choose) set the remaining mixture aside. If there’s enough left over you can always make another smoke bomb. Do not touch the foil once the mixture is inside it. It will be very hot. Leave the mixture in the foil overnight, then peel it off the smoke bomb. The smoke bomb itself is entirely flammable, so there’s no need for a fuse. Do not ignite the smoke bomb indoors or breath the smoke that it produces when lit. Be extremely careful when lighting the smoke bomb, as it may produce more smoke than you expected. There is no fuse on the smoke bomb. To set it off, simply ignite any portion of it using a lighter or match, then set the bomb on the ground or another horizontal surface to burn. The smoke bomb may not burn with a visible flame but keep it away from anything flammable for safety anyway. Do not hold the smoke bomb while it burns.","completion":"To make a smoke bomb, create a mold in your desired shape using aluminum foil, and set it aside.

Cnidarians include organisms like jellyfish, sea anemones, and coral. They have a body structure that includes a gastrovascular cavity that acts as both a stomach and a digestive system.

They stun or kill their prey using stinging cells called cnidocytes that are located in the tentacles. The prey is then passed through the mouth into the gastrovascular cavity where digestion occurs. Unlike many other organisms, cnidarians do not have a separate exit for waste products; instead, wastes exit the body through the same opening that is used for feeding.

Write highlights for this article: NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Police imposed a curfew in Jaipur on Wednesday, a day after near-simultaneous bomb attacks in the ancient Indian city killed at least 63 people and wounded more than 200. Indian women mourn the death of their relatives in the May 13 serial blasts in Jaipur. Vasundhara Raje, chief minister of Rajasthan -- the state of which Jaipur is the capital -- blamed an \\"unnamed international terror group\\" for the attack, but said it was too early in the investigation to specify which one. H.G. Ragavendhra, Jaipur's superintendent of police, told CNN that police found nine newly-purchased bicycles at the scene, and think they were used to carry the explosives. The owner of the bike shop is helping police draw a sketch of the person who purchased them. Police have also picked up six suspects and were questioning them. Jaipur, known as the \\"pink city\\" for its rose-colored forts and palaces, is a popular tourist attraction. The majority Hindu city of 2.7 million people has a sizable Muslim population. The day-long curfew, authorities said, was meant to prevent \\"communal violence.\\" It was intended to prevent large crowds from gathering at the blast site and hampering the investigation, said Jaipur police director Kanhaiya Lal. Also, tempers could flare as mourners spend the day carrying bodies to their home villages and to crematoriums, he said. Home ministry officials suspect the Islamic militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami (HuJi) of being behind the attacks, according to CNN's sister network CNN-IBN and the Press Trust of India. No one has claimed responsibility. In the past, officials have blamed attacks within its borders on \\"foreign\\" Islamic extremist groups fighting against Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir. It is a term that is commonly understood to refer to Pakistan. Kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between India and Pakistan. Both control parts of the region, which is predominantly Muslim. Pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks. See the aftermath of the explosions. ». Raje told reporters Wednesday that the military had been placed on alert and security tightened around the borders of the state, the western edge of which lies next to Pakistan. She also took to task the central government, saying it had provided no advance warning about the possibility of such an attack. Furthermore, Raje said, the central government left a state-proposed organized crime bill unapproved for two years. The bill would have allowed local police more leeway to interrogate suspects plotting attacks, she said. On Tuesday evening, eight bombs tore through crowded markets and a packed Hindu temple in Jaipur's walled city. The blasts went off within a 12-minute span and within 500 meters (0.3 miles) of each other. Police defused a ninth bomb. The Jaipur blasts bear an eerie resemblance in its pattern to a deadly attack two years ago in India's financial capital, Mumbai. In July 2006, more than 200 people were killed when seven explosions targeted commuter trains in Mumbai, formerly Bombay. In that incident, the explosions went off within a span of 11 minutes. Both attacks used RDX, one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives, and ammonium nitrate, an oxidizing agent in explosives. And both attacks took place during the evening hours and on Tuesdays. The Jaipur blasts occurred near the temple on a day when devotees pray to Hanuman, the Hindu monkey king. Nearby markets and bazaars that were also targeted were filled with tourists and locals. In the Mumbai attack, the blasts were timed to go off during the height of rush hour. And authorities said the bombs all appeared to have been planted on trains that left the Churchgate station -- used daily by thousands of commuters in the metropolis of more than 11 million people. Indian officials blamed Pakistan's intelligence services and a Pakistan-based militant group, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, for the attack. Pakistan, which banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in 2002, denied any involvement. The Jaipur blast has one more element in common with yet another deadly attack: the use of bicycles. Just as on Tuesday, assailants used bombs strapped to bicycles in an attack at a mosque in the western Indian city of Malegaon in September 2006. At least 33 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in that explosion, which took place on a Friday -- when the mosque is filled with Muslim worshippers. That attack was also blamed Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Authorities have not connected the Jaipur blast to any previous attacks. HuJi -- or the Movement of Islamic Holy War -- is considered a terrorist organization by the United States. It is banned in neighboring Bangladesh, where it is accused of carrying out several attacks, including a foiled plot to kill the country's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2000. And it has been blamed for several attacks inside India, including one at the American Center in Calcutta that killed five policemen in 2002. India ranks among the countries where terrorism is most common, the U.S. State Department said. \\"The conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, attacks by extreme leftist Naxalites and Maoists in eastern and central India, assaults by ethno-linguistic nationalists in the northeastern states, and terrorist strikes nationwide by Islamic extremists took more than 2,300 lives this year,\\" the agency said. CNN's Tess Eastment and Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report. Highlights:","completion":"1. A curfew was set in Jaipur, India, after bomb attacks happened, leaving 63 people dead and more than 200 hurt. 2. The city's leader thinks a terror group from another country did this, but isn't sure which one yet. 3. Police found 9 bicycles that might have been used to carry the bombs. 4. They're also talking to 6 people who might know something about the attacks. 5.

Please answer the following question: The collaborative process between me and Claire Bridge has been good so far. Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows: How would you define creativity? What does it mean to you to be an artist? Do you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy? Change and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography. You seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like “Dark Matter”, “Touching Infinity”, “We are made of Stars”, “Rising tides” and “A drop in the ocean” or “Alchemy”. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences? What continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist? We both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire’s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire’s practice.

Hypothesis: The benefits include two weeks paid time off and free health care. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise and the hypothesis provided do not seem to be referring directly to the same topic or provide information that allows a direct entailment; therefore, it might not be correct to state that the premise entails the hypothesis. To better understand the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, it is important to analyze both in more detail. Premise: The premise mentions the FDA, or the Food and Drug Administration, which is an agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The role of the FDA is to regulate and authorize the sale and distribution of food, drugs, medical devices, and various consumer products to ensure safety. In this context, the statement suggests that the FDA believes there are substantial health benefits provided by a particular product or intervention, although these benefits cannot be quantified directly. Hypothesis: The hypothesis introduces an unrelated concept to that described in the premise. It talks about the benefits including two weeks of paid time off and free healthcare. These can be considered perks typically offered by a company to its employees as part of their compensation package. While it can be argued that receiving paid time off and healthcare benefits could indirectly impact an individual's overall health and well-being in a positive way, it is important to highlight that this association is not directly linked to the role of the FDA in regulating food, drugs, or medical devices. Connection between the premise and the hypothesis: While the hypothesis addresses a societal aspect that can, in a broader sense, affect the health status of a population, it does not specifically refer to the FDA-quantified benefits of a product or intervention, as mentioned in the premise. The FDA focuses on ensuring that food and drugs are safe and effective, whereas the hypothesis talks about employee benefits provided by a company or organization. Therefore, based on the information provided, there does not seem to be a direct entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. While both statements involve a general idea of health benefits, the nature of these benefits, as well as the context in which they are being referred to, differs significantly. For an accurate entailment, both premise and hypothesis need to be directly related and linked, which does not appear to be the case in this situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Gaddafi's earliest education was of a religious nature, imparted by a local Islamic teacher. Subsequently moving to nearby Sirte to attend elementary school, he progressed through six grades in four years. Education in Libya was not free, but his father thought it would greatly benefit his son despite the financial strain. During the week Gaddafi slept in a mosque, and at weekends walked 20 miles to visit his parents. Bullied for being a Bedouin, he was proud of his identity and encouraged pride in other Bedouin children. From Sirte, he and his family moved to the market town of Sabha in Fezzan, south-central Libya, where his father worked as a caretaker for a tribal leader while Muammar attended secondary school, something neither parent had done. Gaddafi was popular at school; some friends made there received significant jobs in his later administration, most notably his best friend Abdul Salam Jalloud. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why was Gaddafi made fun of in elementary school?","completion":"Gaddafi was made fun of in elementary school because he was a Bedouin. This identity made him a target for bullying by other children who may have seen the Bedouin lifestyle as inferior or different.

And I was wondering How would you describe Bailey? Select from the following. *happy to be done with work. *tired and ready for bed. *busy. Answer:","completion":"Bailey can be described as a hardworking and dedicated individual who is most likely simultaneously experiencing a mix of the given emotions and states. It is important to note that one description may not be sufficient to encompass Bailey's situation entirely. However, a detailed analysis of the given options will provide a clearer understanding of Bailey's experience. 1. Happy to be done with work: Bailey, who works at night, may feel a sense of accomplishment and relief upon completing their work, which could contribute to their happiness. Being happy to be done with work means that Bailey values the efforts they put in and recognizes the importance of winding down after a long night shift. Moreover, it represents Bailey's ability to find satisfaction in fulfilling their responsibilities. 2. Tired and ready for bed: Given that Bailey works night shifts, it is natural for them to feel physically and mentally exhausted at the end of their shift. Working at night entails fighting against the body's natural sleep cycle, which might leave Bailey drained and longing for rest. In this case, Bailey could be described as tired and ready for bed as they head towards recuperating their energy in preparation for future work shifts or daily tasks. 3. Busy: Bailey, who not only works at night but also goes to the store early in the morning, evidently has a tight schedule. This suggests that Bailey is constantly engaged in various activities that demand their time and attention, making them a busy person. Balancing work and personal life can be challenging, especially with packed schedules. Hence, describing Bailey as busy highlights their ability to remain productive while managing the demands of life. In conclusion, Bailey's situation can be best described as a combination of these three states. They are likely happy to be done with work while at the same time feeling tired and ready for bed after their night shift. Furthermore, the fact that they continue to run errands in the morning, such as going to the store, showcases their busy nature. Balancing their professional and personal life, Bailey demonstrates dedication, resilience, and effective time-management skills, making it essential to consider all three descriptions in order to accurately portray their character and daily experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it does not necessarily entail the hypothesis \\"The simplicity of the project could not be established.\\" In order to understand the relationship between the given premise and the hypothesis, let us analyze each statement in detail. Premise: \\"The project was not a simple one.\\" This statement suggests that the complexity level of the project was high or it involved multiple intricate aspects that could not be classified as simple. This assertion implies that the complexity of the project is a known fact, and it has been established to some degree. Hypothesis: \\"The simplicity of the project could not be established.\\" This statement proposes that it was not possible to determine if the project was simple or complex. It implies that there is no available information or evidential basis to conclude whether the project's complexity is low or high. The given premise and hypothesis differ in the amount and certainty of information they provide about the project's complexity. The premise states that the project was not a simple one. Here, we are operating with factual information, as there is an established understanding that the project is complex. The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies uncertainty regarding the project's complexity. It suggests that we do not have sufficient information to derive a conclusion about whether the project is simple or complex. Given the differences in the level of information and certainty provided by the premise and hypothesis, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. They are not congruent in their portrayal of the project's complexity. If the project's level of complexity is known, as suggested by the premise, there would be no room for uncertainty in determining the project's simplicity, as implied by the hypothesis. In conclusion, the premise \\"The project was not a simple one\\" does not necessarily entail the hypothesis \\"The simplicity of the project could not be established.\\" The premise implies an understanding of the project's complexity, while the hypothesis suggests a lack of information or evidence to determine the simplicity of the project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is?","completion":"The name of the national currency of Thailand is the Thai Baht. The Thai Baht, represented by the symbol \\"฿\\" and the ISO code \\"THB,\\" is the official currency used in the Kingdom of Thailand. The Thai Baht has a rich history that can be traced back to the Funan and Dvaravati kingdoms, which used silver coins known as \\"pod duang\\" as their currency. The pod duang was later adopted by the Sukhothai Kingdom, after which the Ayutthaya Kingdom began minting its silver bullet coins. Over centuries of political transitions, the Baht went through various revisions, including the introduction of the Tical currency during the Rattanakosin Kingdom. In 1897, the decimal system was incorporated into the Baht during King Rama V's reign, leading to the issuance of coins in denominations of satang. 100 satang are equal to 1 Baht. Currently, the Thai Baht consists of both coins and banknotes. Coins are available in denominations of 1, 2, 5, and 10 Baht, as well as 25 and 50 satang. Banknotes come in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 Baht. The Bank of Thailand is responsible for issuing Thai currency and managing its circulation. Additionally, the bank handles monetary policy, sets interest rates, and oversees the overall stability of the Thai financial system. The Thai Baht's value has historically been linked with various commodities and currencies such as rice, silver, gold, and even the United States Dollar. In 1997, Thailand experienced a financial crisis that resulted in a significant devaluation of the Thai Baht. This event, however, prompted economic reforms that have since bolstered the country's financial resilience. In recent years, the Thai Baht has enjoyed relative stability and is internationally recognized as a freely convertible currency, enabling trade and foreign investments. It is also one of the most widely used currencies in Southeast Asia and serves as a benchmark for several emerging market economies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article with the title: \\"Peace centre with a panic room\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Peace Centre with a Panic Room Introduction: The concept of a peace centre has always inspired tranquility, healing, and spiritual growth for individuals seeking refuge from the chaos of the world. Traditionally, these havens have focused on mindfulness and meditation practices. However, with the growing complexities and uncertainties of modern life, there has been a considerable rise in anxiety and stress-related issues. Recognizing these shifting landscapes, a new peace centre has emerged, combining the serenity of meditation practices with the security of a panic room. This article explores the unique approach of the innovative peace centre addressing the new-age mental health requirements. Step 1: Defining the Concept A peace centre can be a space specifically designed to promote mental wellness through various techniques such as meditation, yoga, and energy healing. Peace centres are commonly known for their calming atmosphere, natural surroundings, minimalist design, and a deep emphasis on personal growth and wellbeing. A panic room, on the other hand, is a secure and fortified space, typically installed within a residential or commercial property. It is designed as a protection measure against potential threats, such as burglaries or natural disasters. Essentially, a panic room serves to provide occupants with a safe space to retreat during emergencies. Step 2: Fusing the Concepts To cater to a growing, anxious population, the peace centre with a panic room aims to combine the best features of both elements. The calm, supportive environment encourages mindfulness practices, while the fortified and secure design ensures a feeling of safety and security. This innovative fusion creates the perfect setting for individuals to practice relaxation techniques while also offering solace during anxiety-inducing events. Step 3: The Design & Layout The peace centre with a panic room consists of different sections to facilitate various components. The meditation room, designed with large windows for natural light and a minimalist aesthetic, offers opportunities to practice mindfulness and meditation. An adjoining tranquility garden serves as a natural extension of the meditation room for those who prefer an outdoor setting for their healing process. The panic room is designed as a secluded, separate section within the premises, featuring state-of-the-art security measures such as reinforced doors, video monitoring, and communication devices. While the panic room's essential purpose is to provide safety, it is also integrated seamlessly into the peace centre's overall design, linking thematically through the choice of calming artwork and furniture. Step 4: Target Demographic & Outreach The peace centre with a panic room caters to individuals experiencing heightened levels of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other stress-related ailments. Through targeted outreach programs and collaborations with mental health practitioners, the centre aims to raise awareness about available support options and the benefits of combining traditional mindfulness techniques with modern safety features. Step 5: Preparing for the Future As mental health becomes an increasingly pertinent topic in society, the peace centre with a panic room hopes to evolve and expand its services and offerings. This includes developing partnerships with mental health organizations, hosting workshops on coping strategies, and potentially creating a network of similar centres across various locations. Conclusion: The unique fusion of a peace centre with a panic room signifies a bold and innovative approach to addressing the mental health challenges faced by modern-day individuals. By combining therapeutic practices with cutting-edge security measures, this centre offers a sense of solace, safety, and relief that individuals can embrace in their journey towards improved well-being and peace of mind."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\"). According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Did Bin Laden's selectees know one another?\\" is \\"Yes\\"?","completion":"Yes, that's correct! Bin Laden's selectees, like Khalid al Mihdhar and Nawaf al Hazmi, did know each other. They were both experienced fighters, or mujahideen, and had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in 1995.

A:","completion":"To answer the question about how deep drilling can be done underwater, we should research the limitations of offshore drilling technologies, the depth of the world's continental shelves, and the pressures that the equipment can withstand. Step 1: Understand the question The user wants to know how deep it is possible to drill underwater. They also provided a statement about the global deepwater infrastructure market and want to know if it is a reasonable answer to the question. Step 2: Research offshore drilling technologies and limitations We must look into offshore drilling techniques and equipment. For example, dynamic positioning systems are essential for deepwater drilling. Additionally, blowout preventers (BOPs) and riser systems must be designed to withstand the pressures and harsh environments at great depths. Step 3: Research the depth of continental shelves Continental shelves are areas where the land meets the sea. We need to know the depths of these shelves since they determine the limits for drilling. Step 4: Research the equipment used for deepwater drilling In order to understand how deep we can drill, we need to consider the technological limitations of the equipment used for deepwater drilling operations. This includes pressures and environmental conditions. After conducting this research, one can conclude that the current maximum depth for deepwater drilling is around 12,000 feet (3,658 meters) [source: Shell Offshore Inc.]. This information is a more suitable answer to the question of how deep we can drill underwater. In conclusion, while the provided statement about the global deepwater infrastructure market is informative, it does not directly answer the question about how deep drilling can be done underwater. The appropriate answer should discuss the technological limitations and depths of drilling operations, which is currently around 12,000 feet (3,658 meters)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Airport '77 Movie plot: A privately owned luxury Boeing 747-100, Stevens' Flight 23, flies invited guests to an estate in Palm Beach, Florida, owned by wealthy philanthropist Philip Stevens, who also owns the jetliner. Valuable artwork from Stevens's private collection is also on board the jetliner, to be eventually displayed in his new museum. Such a collection motivates a group of thieves led by co-pilot Bob Chambers to hijack the aircraft. Once Captain Don Gallagher leaves the cockpit and is knocked unconscious, the hijackers' plans go into action. A sleeping gas, which one of the hijackers secretly installed before the flight, is released into the cabin and the passengers lose consciousness. Knocking out the flight engineer, Chambers moves forward with the hijacking, and Stevens' Flight 23 \\"disappears\\" into the Bermuda Triangle. Descending to virtual wave-top altitude, Flight 23 heads into a fog bank, reducing visibility to less than a mile. Minutes later, a large offshore drilling platform emerges from the haze, Flight 23 heading straight for it at nearly 600 knots. Chambers pulls back on the yoke in a banking left turn, but an engine clips the derrick and catches fire. Chambers immediately hits the fire extinguishing button, and the flames are momentarily extinguished. Because the aircraft is at such a low altitude, the sudden loss of airspeed threatens to stall the airplane. As the engine reignites, Chambers is forced to use another fire suppression bottle. But by this time, the aircraft stall alarm is activated and the aircraft's tail hits the water. All the passengers wake up, and realizing what is happening, most panic. Chambers is able to pull up, but the plane's right wing hits the water again. The plane lifts into the air for a moment, then hits the water. Because of the hard impact, the plane becomes grounded in the ocean and begins to sink. The ocean floor is above the crush depth of the fuselage. Many of the passengers are injured, some seriously.

Read this article and answer this question On April 6, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson, recently sworn into a second term of office for which he had run behind the slogan \\"He Kept Us Out of War,\\" appeared between a joint session of Congress to ask for a declaration of war against Imperial Germany. Congress readily obliged the President's request, voting to declare war on Germany by a margin of 373-50 in the House and 82-6 in the Senate. This decision of the United States government to enter World War I was backed up with additional legislation imposing military conscription in America to staff the nation's wartime Army and Navy. On May 18, 1917, a draft bill became law. The bill called for all eligible young men nationwide to register for the draft on a single day — June 5, 1917. While isolated hotspots of anti-conscription activity sprang up in some urban centers, the registration process was generally an orderly affair, with the vast majority of young American men accepting their fate with what has been characterized as \\"a calm resignation.\\" On July 20, 1917, a blindfolded Newton D. Baker, the Wilson administration's Secretary of War, drew numbers choosing certain registered young men for mandatory military service. Opponents of American participation in the war continued their efforts to change the country's course, holding meetings and distributing pamphlets. Among the leading organized forces in opposition to conscription and the war was the Socialist Party of America, which at its April 1917 National Convention had declared its \\"unalterable opposition\\" to the war and urged the workers of the world to \\"refuse support to the governments in their wars.\\" How widespread was resistance to the conscription upon the introduction of the new law?","completion":"Upon the introduction of the new conscription law on May 18, 1917, resistance to the draft was not widespread in the United States.

Movie title: Tsotsi Movie plot: Because his mother is dying of a terminal disease, David (Benny Moshe) runs away from an abusive father and lives with other homeless children in a series of large concrete construction pipes. A few years later, David, who now goes by the name Tsotsi (Presley Chweneyagae), is the leader of a gang which includes his friends Butcher (Zenzo Ngqobe), Aap (Kenneth Nkosi) and Boston (Mothusi Magano). After getting involved in a murder committed by Butcher during a mugging, Tsotsi and Boston get into a fight which leaves Boston badly injured. Tsotsi later shoots Pumla (Nambitha Mpumlwana), a young woman, while stealing her car, only to discover a three-month-old baby boy in the back seat. Tsotsi hastily strips the car of its valuables and takes the baby back to his shack. Pumla survives the attack and works with a police artist to create a composite sketch of Tsotsi's face, which is then run in the newspapers. Realizing that he cannot properly care for the baby on his own, Tsotsi spots Miriam (Terry Pheto), with a young child strapped to her back, collecting water from a public tap. He follows her to her shack and forces her at gunpoint to feed the kidnapped child. Meanwhile, rich gang leader Fela (Zola) begins attempting to recruit Aap, Boston and Butcher to work for him. When Tsotsi takes the child to Miriam a second time, she asks him to leave the boy with her so that she can care for him on Tsotsi's behalf, and Tsotsi agrees. Tsotsi decides to take care of the injured Boston, and has Aap and Butcher take Boston to his shack. Boston, who is called Teacher Boy by his friends, explains that he never took the teachers' examination. Tsotsi tells him that the gang will raise the money so that Boston can take the exam, which means they will have to commit another robbery. Tsotsi and Aap go to Pumla's house. When Pumla's husband John (Rapulana Seiphemo) returns from the hospital, they follow him into the house and tie him up. Aap is assigned to watch John while Butcher ransacks the bedroom and Tsotsi collects items from... A:","completion":"No I can't."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A belembaotuyan, in Guam, is actually a traditional musical instrument. It is a hollowed-out bamboo tube with a hole at one end and resonating apertures on the other. A belembaotuyan is played by striking the tube against an object or the ground, creating a unique sound which accompanies various cultural events such as storytelling, ceremonies, and other performances. The belembaotuyan serves as an important cultural symbol for the Chamorro people of Guam, representing their deep connection to the land and their roots. Incorporating the aforementioned phrase into a proper answer might look like this: A belembaotuyan is a traditional bamboo musical instrument used by the Chamorro people of Guam. It is used in cultural events that involve storytelling, ceremony, and performance, which serve to connect the community to their traditions and history. These events often revolve around the passing down of legends, chants, and courtship rituals, as well as seeking permission from ancestral spirits before entering sacred spaces such as the jungle or ancient battle sites. The practice of sniffing the hands of elders (called mangnginge) is another significant cultural tradition in Guam, showing respect to the wisdom and knowledge of the older generations. Together, the use of the belembaotuyan and these other traditions emphasize the importance of preserving and honoring the Chamorro cultural heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To answer the question \\"When was the first lighting used on an airport?\\" a more detailed and historically accurate response should be provided. Airport lighting has been evolving since the early days of aviation. One of the first instances of airport lighting can be traced back to the 1920s, when rotating beacons were used to assist pilots in locating airfields during night flights. These beacons would emit a powerful light beam that would revolve 360 degrees, allowing pilots to spot the airfield from a distance. In 1926, the United States implemented the Air Commerce Act which regulated air navigation, including the installation of airport beacons. The advancement of airport lighting progressed as air travel became more common. During the 1930s, runway edge lights were introduced, providing visual guidance for pilots during takeoffs and landings in low visibility conditions. These lights were placed along the edges of runways, and different colors were used to indicate specific points like the beginning and end of a runway. In the 1940s, approach lighting systems were introduced to aid pilots in identifying the correct path to the runway during instrument approaches. These systems incorporated different types of lights, such as sequential flashing lights, which guided pilots towards the runway, and threshold lights, which marked the beginning of the landing runway. The Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI) emerged in the 1950s and 1960s as a valuable instrument to guide pilots in maintaining the proper glide path during landing. VASI used lights arranged on either side of the runway, which changed colors according to the pilot's position, ensuring they were on the correct approach slope. Today, airports continue to use upgraded lighting systems that aid pilots in guiding their aircraft during various phases of flight. Technologies like the Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) and Instrument Landing System (ILS) have further enhanced pilots' abilities to navigate and land safely at airports, even in challenging weather conditions or low visibility environments. In summary, airport lighting has a rich history dating back to the 1920s and has continuously evolved to meet the needs of pilots and enhance flight safety. The first lighting used on an airport consisted of rotating beacons, with more complex systems like runway edge lights and approach lighting systems being introduced later on."},{"prompt":"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... Question: What does David Meyer do for a living?

He was sad for the rest of the day..","completion":"Once upon a time in a small town on the outskirts of the city, a young boy named Mark lived with his sister Sarah. Mark was a shy, introverted young man, who found solace in reading books and drawing. Though he had a few friends, he didn’t have the confidence to explore new things, unlike his older sister Sarah, who was ambitious, outgoing, and loved adventure. Over the years, Sarah had noticed Mark's incredible talent for drawing and often tried to get him out of his shell by encouraging him to share his artwork with others. Despite her constant support and persuasion, Mark always declined, fearing ridicule from his classmates and judgement from those around him. One day, their school announced an upcoming art competition. With prizes and accolades at stake, Sarah saw an opportunity to help her brother gain the recognition he deserved. She submitted one of Mark's best paintings to the competition without him knowing, hoping that she could surprise him with the news of his victory later. As the day of the event approached, Mark found out about Sarah's well-intentioned deed from one of his classmates. He was livid, berating her for meddling with his life and causing him nothing but embarrassment. Sarah, disappointed in his reaction, apologized and tried to reassure him that his artwork deserved to be appreciated by others. Even still, Mark refused to attend the competition ceremony, feeling completely overwhelmed by the prospect of public exposure. Sarah, wearing her best dress, attended the ceremony on Mark's behalf, her heart heavy with her brother's disdain. As she sat in a row brimming with anxious contestants, she couldn't shake the feeling that Mark was going to miss out on an incredible opportunity to take the first step in conquering his fears. To no one's surprise, Mark won the first prize for his exceptional painting. When the crowd applauded for Mark's talent, Sarah smiled through her tears and felt an overwhelming sense of pride for her younger brother. She accepted the award on his behalf and vowed to do her best to mend things between them. After the ceremony, Sarah rushed home, excited to finally give Mark the good news, and hopefully start rebuilding the trust her brother had lost in her. She found Mark in his room, huddled up on his bed, looking forlorn and downhearted. \\"Mark,\\" Sarah said softly, \\"you won first prize, just as I knew you would. Your painting was incredible, and everyone could see that.\\" Mark's eyes widened in disbelief, and for a moment, he looked unsure of what to say. Slowly, he felt his fears and insecurities give way to an unfamiliar sense of pride and excitement. He glanced at his sister, whose undisguised happiness for him filled him with warmth he didn't know he had inside. In that moment, Mark finally recognized and appreciated her unwavering belief in his abilities. With tears in his eyes and a smile slowly creeping across his face, he reached out and hugged Sarah, thanking her for having faith in him even when he didn't.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who sends emissaries to movie producers? Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa finds himself without adequate funding to finance his war against the military-run government. He also finds himself at odds with the Americans because of the Hearst media empire's press campaign against him. To counter both of these threats, he sends emissaries to movie producers to convince them to pay to film his progress and the actual battles. Producer D.W. Griffith is immediately interested and convinces Mutual Film Studios boss Harry E. Aitkin to send a film crew. Aitkin's nephew Frank Thayer is initially a mere errand boy for the studio, but he makes a good impression with Villa, who demands that Thayer be placed in charge of the project. Thayer and a camera crew team film Villa leading his men to victory in battle. Despite the failure of this initial footage (which draws derisive laughter from potential backers) Thayer convinces Aitkin to invest even more money in a second attempt, and also convinces Villa to participate in making a more narrative film. Thayer returns to Mexico with a director, actors, producers, cameramen and screen writers, and begin to film Villa's previous exploits using a younger actor, future film director Raoul Walsh. The filming goes well, although Villa becomes angry that the screenwriters and the director have changed history to make a more dramatic film. However, he agrees to do a cameo appearance as an older version of himself. Meanwhile, Thayer begins a romance with actress Teddy Sampson whom he's had a crush on since they first met. One night Villa announces that they will attack a Federal held fort at Torreon and win the revolution. The film's director and his crew tell Villa that they are not coming with him to film the battle. Villa scares them into going to the battle by having a firing squad shoot over their heads.

The founder of a chain of academies who raised funds for the Archbishop of Canterbury has been investigated over ‘highly unusual’ payments. Officials highlighted a series of dubious financial practices at 16 schools set up by Sir Ewan Harper in the Education Fellowship Trust. These included £90,000 paid to himself and £28,000 to his wife Jane. Department for Education officials who investigated the group of 16 academies - the Education Fellowship Trust (EFT) - also criticised £45,000 expenses awarded in a year to just two governors, a £20,000 fact-finding trip to New York and excessive spending on hotels, meals and alcoholic drinks. Dubious: Payments from the Education Fellowship Trust included £28,000 in rent of office space in Titchmarsh, near Kettering, (pictured) to the wife of founder Sir Ewan Harper. Further concerns were raised over family members being given unadvertised jobs - including a director of communications on £70,000-a-year - while £1,000 was spent on Christmas cards and £630 on customised umbrellas. The EFT admitted that wine was purchased for a workshop with head teachers - as part of a training exercise designed to show that children, like grapes, can mature into ‘exceptional wines’ given the right nurturing or merely end up as ‘plonk’. Sir Ewan’s links both to education and the Church of England stretch back decades. He was tutored at Cambridge by Robert Runcie, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury. In the 1980s, he helped set up the Lambeth Fund, which raises funds to support past and present Archbishops of Canterbury. Marlborough-educated Sir Ewan, 74, was knighted in 2003 for services to the Church of England, having been recommended by another former Archbishop, George Carey. Commended: Sir Ewan Harper was knighted in 2003 for services to the Church of England, having been recommended by former Archbishop, George Carey (pictured) Before founding the EFT, he led the United Learning Trust - one of the biggest backers of academy and independent schools in the country. A former businessman, he ran the family’s export firm, which he later sold. Sir Ewan became chairman of the Lambeth Fund in 2011 but retired in March. The EFT said he had also now retired from the trust. Officials from the DfE’s Education Funding Agency probed financial practices at the EFT after a review of 2012/13 accounts highlighted ‘highly unusual’ payments. These included nearly £28,000 in rent and insurance premiums to Lady Jane Harper, who is listed as owning cottages which the trust uses as an office. In a report, the agency said there was evidence ‘that the lease rental was a fair market price from an estate agent’ and that alternative premises were checked. ‘However there was no documented evidence provided to record the outcome of the inspections or the basis for the final decision to lease the current accommodation,’ it said. Checks by the Daily Mail revealed the two grade II listed stone cottages with thatched roofs under Lady Jane Harper’s name were leased to the EFT after failed attempts to find a private residential tenant. Official documents from East Northamptonshire Council show they were used by the United Learning Trust - the schools chain Sir Ewan previously headed - until it moved to larger premises. Internal changes were made to make it suitable for residential use and it was put on the market through a letting agent in September 2011. The council documents state: ‘As of 16th December no tenant had been found. ‘The applicant’s husband discovered the need to use the building as an office once again for his personal business.’ Another cottage in the same lane in the picture postcard village of Titchmarsh, near Kettering, is registered to Lady Jane Harper. All the properties are next to the couple’s home, which is in both their names and was valued at £1 million in 2010. It is hidden at the end of a long gravel driveway and is set in extensive landscaped grounds with a swimming pool. A woman who answered the door of the cottages said they were still being used by the EFT. The Government probe also raised concerns about £90,000 awarded to Sir Ewan as chairman of the trust - as well as ‘transactions with companies in which the chairman has a controlling interest’. The trust said £90,000 was paid to Sir Ewan because he was also chief executive at the time. But the investigation found that Sir Ewan was forbidden from holding both roles under trust rules. The trust, which has a turnover of £10million per year and lists 16 member schools on its website, was found to have committed ‘significant breaches of the Companies Act 2006, Charity Commission regulations and the Academies Financial Handbook’. A report on the findings, which is redacted in places, makes 26 separate recommendations. It highlights a series of questionable uses of public money including a £20,000 trip to New York by a group of heads. The report said it may not have been ‘the best use of public funds’. Expenses exposed: The Education Fellowship Trust runs a chain of 16 academies (stock image) Two governors ‘claimed £45,000 in expenses and other supplies and services’ while one academy in the group suffered a £38,000 fraud because IT security software was not up-to-date, enabling a transfer out of its bank account. The money is reportedly being reimbursed by the bank. The report also highlights that expenses policy allowed for ‘moderate consumption of alcohol’ - even though alcohol spending is considered an ‘improper use of public funds’. ‘A number of claims were made that included the purchase of alcohol,’ the report said. Meals and hotels were also claimed ‘in excess of the staff expenses policy’. Concern was also raised over unadvertised posts for family members. ‘We found that a number of the appointed head office staff were family members of either trustees or senior members of staff,’ said the report. There had been no ‘competition or advertising’ of the posts, which included a director of communication at a salary of £70,000 per year plus benefits. Meanwhile a finance manager had been appointed on £100 an hour with no formal tender for the work. It was ‘questionable’ whether this was value for money, said the report. More than half of secondary schools - and growing numbers of primaries - now have academy status which allows them to operate outside local council control. But there have been a series of financial scandals involving some of the groups which run academies, leading to calls for tighter controls. The agency issued the trust with a financial notice to improve. A spokesman for the EFT said: ‘The EFA are very clear that all issues found are from pre-September - before significant structural changes were made and Johnson Kane was appointed as CEO. ‘The Fellowship had already commenced on change of policies and governance in November 2013, before the review took place. ‘The EFA acknowledged to The Fellowship that it was under a different structure and clear evidence was showing that there was a positive change in the operation since September 2013.’ Sir Ewan wasn’t available to comment and his wife refused to comment when approached at their home. ‘I haven’t got time,’ she said.

Summarize: The C36 gives the first indications of how teams will approach the major rule changes introduced this year aimed at creating faster, more dramatic cars. The Swiss team, who finished 10th of 11 teams last season, have introduced a new blue, white and gold livery along with the new-look machine. These are the first pictures of a 2017 car following Williams releasing graphics of their model last Friday. Sauber's new technical director Jorg Zander says he expected \\"a clear improvement compared to last year\\". This content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser The car looks superficially similar to the one used in 2016 but features the delta-shaped front wing, the lower, wider rear wing and bigger tyres. Underneath, the cars feature a wider and revised floor area to enable them to generate much more downforce - predictions are of at least 30% increases, which will lead to vastly increased cornering speeds. Zander, 53, joined Sauber after two years as technical chief of Audi's successful programme in the World Endurance Championship. He previously worked for the Toyota, BAR, Williams and Brawn F1 teams as well as Sauber. Zander said: \\"Our objective is to establish ourselves in the mid-field. In comparison to last year, we will implement our development plan for the whole season, but we have to be realistic as our reference is at a lower level than the ones of our competitors.\\" The car will be driven by Swede Marcus Ericsson, who enters his third season with the team, and German Pascal Wehrlein, a Mercedes protege. Wehrlein is to miss the first pre-season test next week because of a neck injury sustained in the Race of Champions event in Miami in January. Ferrari third driver Antonio Giovinazzi will stand in for him. The new Sauber features many of the design cues expected of the new 2017 cars - a tail fin [disguised in black], and reshaped front and rear wings. Additionally, for the aficionados, the rules around aerodynamic appendages have been tweaked. Expectations are not high, though. After a difficult few seasons, Sauber is now on a surer financial footing and consolidation is the name of the game for now.","completion":"Sauber has unveiled its C36 car, designed in response to this year's major rule changes aimed at creating faster, more dramatic vehicles.

Sentence 1: \\"An orange tabby cat sleeping on the sofa.\\" 1. Subject: An orange tabby cat 2. Action: Sleeping 3. Object: On the sofa Sentence 2: \\"Man wearing a bib sitting on a green couch.\\" 1. Subject: Man wearing a bib 2. Action: Sitting 3. Object: On a green couch Now let's compare the elements of each sentence. 1. Subject: - In the first sentence, it's an animal (an orange tabby cat). - In the second sentence, it's a person (a man wearing a bib). - The subjects are not similar (difference: animal vs. person). 2. Action: - In the first sentence, the action is \\"sleeping\\". - In the second sentence, the action is \\"sitting\\". - The actions are somewhat similar (both are stationary/resting actions). 3. Object: - In the first sentence, it's a sofa. - In the second sentence, it's a green couch. - The objects are very similar (both are places to sit, and a sofa and couch can be considered synonyms). Considering the differences and similarities listed above, I would rate the similarity between the two sentences as a 2 out of 5, where 2 corresponds to \\"somewhat similar\\". The actions and objects in the sentences are somewhat similar since the actions are both resting actions, and the objects are places to sit.

Part #3: Determine which profession the gendered pronoun refers to. Usage: In the sample sentence, the word \\"he\\" refers to the person who \\"asked.\\" Since it is the \\"counselor\\" who asks the driver to transport to the hospital, the pronoun \\"he\\" refers to the counselor.

They describe two different scenarios regarding the migration of the ancestors of \\"Mansourasaurus.\\" Sentence 1: \\"The ancestors of 'Mansourasaurus' would have reached Africa from Europe.\\" In this sentence, it is suggested that the ancestors of \\"Mansourasaurus\\" originated in Europe and migrated to Africa. This implies that the species evolved and developed primarily in Europe, and later moved to Africa as a result of some factors, such as changing environmental conditions, competition for resources, or opportunities in an unexplored ecosystem. Sentence 2: \\"The ancestors of the 'Mansourasaurus' would have reached Europe from Africa.\\" In the second sentence, the opposite migration pattern is suggested. Here, the ancestors of \\"Mansourasaurus\\" are considered to have originated in Africa and then migrated to Europe. This indicates that the species evolved primarily in Africa and moved to Europe for any of the reasons previously mentioned. In this scenario, we would expect to find fossil evidence and earlier evolutionary forms of the species in Africa. In summary, while both sentences deal with the migration of the ancestors of the \\"Mansourasaurus\\" species, they propose different directions of movement.

With the November election just over seven weeks away, Obama seeks to maintain the momentum of a perceived \\"bounce\\" in support following this month's Democratic National Convention while Romney wants to gain ground on his rival ahead of the three presidential debates next month. Meanwhile, a pair of television ads released Monday by the","completion":"Obama campaign and a pro-Romney Super PAC amplified each candidate's message as they vie for undecided voters in crucial swing states. In the ads, the Obama campaign highlighted the president's efforts to protect American jobs by challenging China's unfair trade practices and accused Romney of having a history of outsourcing jobs to China during his tenure at Bain Capital. Conversely, the pro-Romney Super PAC ad focused on the sluggish economic recovery under the Obama administration and argued that Romney's experience in the private sector made him better equipped to spur job growth and revitalize the American economy. Both candidates continued to make appearances in key battleground states, where they tailored their messages to appeal to the specific concerns of voters in those regions. President Obama, during his speech in America's car country, emphasized his administration's successful efforts to revive the auto industry, including the controversial bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, and underscored how these actions saved thousands of American jobs. He also touted his administration's most recent action against China's auto industry subsidies, claiming it was a necessary step in leveling the playing field for American workers and businesses. In contrast, Romney, during his address to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, sought to connect with the Latino community by focusing on issues like education, job creation, and immigration reform. Acknowledging the crucial role that Latino voters play in determining the outcome of the election, Romney promised that his policies would create a brighter future for the Hispanic community, emphasizing his commitment to fostering economic opportunity and addressing the skills gap. He also criticized the Obama administration for its failure to deliver on its promise of comprehensive immigration reform, while outlining his plan to streamline the legal immigration process. As the November election drew nearer, both campaigns intensified their ground game efforts, deploying thousands of volunteers to mobilize supporters, register new voters, and encourage early voting. These efforts were particularly concentrated in swing states such as Ohio, Florida, and Virginia, where the race was expected to be closely contested and where every vote could potentially make the difference between victory and defeat. While President Obama's approval ratings appeared to have received a modest boost following the Democratic National Convention, polls indicated that the race still remained highly competitive. The candidates' performances in the upcoming presidential debates, set to take place in October, loomed large as potentially make-or-break moments in their campaigns. Political observers and analysts eagerly awaited the debates, which would provide voters with an opportunity to directly compare the competing visions and policy proposals of the two candidates and could ultimately prove crucial in swaying undecided voters, who were deemed vital in determining the final outcome of the election. In an increasingly polarized political landscape, both the Obama and Romney campaigns continued to vie for any advantage they could find, employing strategic messaging, targeted advertisements, and an exhaustive ground game to connect with as many voters as possible. With the clock ticking down and no clear frontrunner emerging, the final stretch of the 2012 presidential race promised to be a tense and unpredictable contest that would capture national and international attention."},{"prompt":"Question: - instrument is bass guitar - birth name is jonothan william bramley - origin is new zealand - birth date is 1983 - background is non_vocal_instrumentalist - birth place is hong kong - associated acts is betchadupa - occupation is musician Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Movie title: The Adventures of Baron Munchausen Movie plot: The film begins in an unnamed war-torn eastern European city in the 18th century (dubbed \\"The Age of Reason\\" in an opening caption), where, amid explosions and gunfire from a large Turkish army outside the city gates, a fanciful touring stage production of Baron Munchausen's life and adventures is taking place. Backstage, city official \\"The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson\\" reinforces the city's commitment to reason (here meaning uniformity) by ordering the execution of a soldier (Sting in a cameo) who had just accomplished a near-superhuman feat of bravery, claiming that his bravery is demoralizing to other soldiers. Not far into the play, an elderly man claiming to be the real Baron interrupts the show, protesting its many inaccuracies. Over the complaints of the audience, the theatre company and Jackson, the \\"real\\" Baron gains the house's attention and narrates through flashback an account of one of his adventures, of a life-or-death wager with the Grand Turk, where the younger Baron's life is saved only by his amazing luck plus the assistance of his remarkable associates: Berthold, the world's fastest runner; Adolphus, a rifleman with superhuman eyesight; Gustavus, who possesses extraordinary hearing, and sufficient lung power to knock down an army by exhaling; and the fantastically strong Albrecht. When gunfire disrupts the elderly Baron's story, Jackson cancels the acting troupe's contract because of the Baron. The Baron wanders backstage, where the Angel of Death tries to take his life, but Sally Salt, the young daughter of the theater company's leader, saves him and persuades him to remain living. Sally races to the wall yelling for the Turkish army to go away, and the Baron accidentally fires himself through the sky using a mortar and returns riding a cannonball, narrowly escaping the Angel of Death once again. Insisting that he alone can save the city, the Baron escapes over the city's walls in a hot air balloon constructed of women's underwear, accompanied by Sally as a stowaway. The balloon...

Answer: Modern team formations usually include one to three forwards; two is the most common. Question: what is a forward in soccer The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, modern team formations in soccer, also known as association football, usually include one to three forwards, with two being the most common. However, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the forward role in soccer, let us discuss it in greater detail. A forward in soccer, also referred to as a striker or attacker, is a player positioned at the front and center of a team's offensive line. Their primary responsibility is to score goals and create scoring opportunities for their teammates. Forwards play a crucial role in breaking down the opponent's defense and converting offensive plays into points on the scoreboard. Different types of forwards with specific skill sets exist within this position. These include: 1. Centre forward: Also known as the target man, the centre forward is usually the team's main goal-scorer. They are often tall, physically strong, and possess excellent heading abilities. Centre forwards excel at holding up the ball, linking up with teammates, and winning aerial duels. 2. Second striker: The second striker, or support striker, is a versatile player who operates behind the main striker. This player is typically mobile, agile, and has excellent dribbling skills, allowing them to create and maximize scoring opportunities for themselves and their teammates. 3. Winger: A winger is a forward who operates on the flanks of the attacking line. They are fast, skillful, and have the ability to send in crosses for their fellow forwards to finish. Their agility also allows them to beat defenders and cut inside to either shoot or play through balls. Forwards must work in sync with the rest of the team, including the midfielders and defenders. Proper communication and understanding of each other's movements are essential for a team's forward line to effectively break down the opposition's defense. In modern soccer, coaches and managers often employ various tactical systems and formations that dictate the number of forwards on the field. The most common formations include one, two, or three forwards: 1. Single forward: The single forward formation, often seen in a 4-3-3 or 4-5-1 system, relies on a lone striker who has the task of scoring goals and creating chances. This forward is typically strong, fast, and skillful in order to fulfill their responsibilities effectively. 2. Two forwards: The two forward formation, often seen in a 4-4-2 or 3-5-2 system, employs two main strikers who work in tandem to exploit the opposition's defense. This setup may feature one target man and one second striker or two complementary forwards with different skill sets. 3. Three forwards: The three forward formation, often seen in a 4-3-3 or 3-4-3 system, involves two wingers flanking a central striker. This attacking trio maximizes attacking potency by stretching the opposition's defense and providing multiple avenues for goal-scoring opportunities. In summary, a forward in soccer is a key offensive player responsible for scoring goals and creating chances. Modern team formations usually include one to three forwards, with two being the most common. The type of forward (centre forward, second striker, or winger) deployed is determined by the tactical system and formation chosen by the team's coach or manager."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are distinct from \\"Microdon\\" by the presence of an appendix on vein R4+5. Many species have erroneously been placed in this genus. Some authors place \\"Ceratophya\\" as a subgenus of \\"Microdon\\". - Afromicrodon is an African genus of hoverflies . The species of the Afromicrodon genus were previously and erroneously placed in the genus Ceratophya . Afromicrodon species are recognized among the Microdontinae by them lacking an appendix on vein R4 +5 , having short antennae about as long as the face or shorter , and a simple basoflagellomere and simple scutellum without calcar . The abdomen is oval . - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Hover flies (family Syrphidae) of the genus Microdon are unusual among the Diptera. Like other members of the subfamily, they are myrmecophiles, meaning they inhabit the nests of ants. There are 249 species are known worldwide, with the greatest diversity being from the tropics; 30 species are known from North America, though it is expected that many of these species will be placed in other genera in time, as \\"Microdon\\" has been used as a catch-all for various unrelated species not placed in other genera. 'afromicrodon' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'parent taxon'? Choices: - animal - homo - microdon - plant - syrphidae Answer:","completion":"The object entity related to 'Afromicrodon' through the relation of 'parent taxon' would be \\"Syrphidae\\". Syrphidae is a family of hoverflies, which constitutes a large group of insects within the order Diptera. Afromicrodon is a genus belonging to this family of hoverflies, and as mentioned, it was previously and erroneously classified under the Ceratophya genus. In this taxonomic context, Syrphidae stands as the parent taxon for Afromicrodon, providing a biological classification umbrella for this specific genus. To better understand the taxonomic relationship, it is helpful to look at the hierarchy of biological classification, which consists of a series of ranks: 1. Domain 2. Kingdom 3. Phylum (or Division for plants) 4. Class 5. Order 6. Family 7. Genus 8. Species In the case of Afromicrodon, the classification follows this hierarchy: - Kingdom: Animalia (Animals) - Phylum: Arthropoda (Arthropods) - Class: Insecta (Insects) - Order: Diptera (True Flies) - Family: Syrphidae (Hoverflies) - Genus: Afromicrodon As seen in this hierarchy, Afromicrodon is placed within the family Syrphidae, making Syrphidae the parent taxon of Afromicrodon. Additionally, while Microdon is another genus within the Syrphidae family, it is not considered the parent taxon, as both Afromicrodon and Microdon are separate genera sharing the same family rank, and neither is a direct ancestor or descendant of the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Through the credible threat of violence, the racketeers deter people from swindling, robbing, injuring, sabotaging or otherwise harming their clients. Protection rackets tend to appear in markets where the police and judiciary cannot be counted on to provide legal protection, either because of incompetence (as in weak or failed states) or illegality (black markets). - The term magistrate is used in a variety of systems of governments and laws to refer to a civilian officer who administers the law. In ancient Rome, a \\"magistratus\\" was one of the highest ranking government officers, and possessed both judicial and executive powers. In other parts of the world, such as China, a magistrate was responsible for administration over a particular geographic area. Today, in some jurisdictions, a magistrate is a judicial officer who hears cases in a lower court, and typically deals with more minor or preliminary matters. In other jurisdictions (e.g., England and Wales), magistrates may be volunteers without formal legal training who perform a judicial role with regard to minor matters. - Historically a mandamento was the part of Italian territory under the jurisdiction of a \\"pretore\\" which is a kind of magistrate. These divisions were abolished in 1923. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Mazara del Vallo is a town and \\"comune\\" in southwestern Sicily, Italy, which lies mainly on the left bank at the mouth of the Mazaro river, administratively part of the province of Trapani. - Jurisdiction (from the Latin \\"ius, \\" meaning \\"law\\" and \\"\\" meaning \\"to speak\\") is the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility, e.g., Michigan tax law. In the federations like USA, areas of jurisdiction apply to local, state, and federal levels; e.g. the court has jurisdiction to apply federal law. - The Sicilian Mafia, also known as simply the Mafia or Cosa Nostra (\\"Our thing\\"), is a criminal syndicate in Sicily, Italy. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share a common organisational structure and code of conduct. The basic group is known as a \\"family\\", \\"clan\\", or \\"\\"cosca\\"\\" or \\"cosche\\" in Sicilian. Each family claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village or a neighbourhood (\\"borgata\\") of a larger city, in which it operates its rackets. Its members call themselves \\"men of honour\\", although the public often refers to them as \\"mafiosi\\". The mafia's core activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. - Sovereignty is understood in jurisprudence as the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies.

Given the fact \\"humans changing animal habitats usually causes harm to those animals\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"Something that could cause harm to an animal could be\\"","completion":"Something that could cause harm to an animal could be the destruction or modification of their natural habitats due to human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, agriculture, and industrialization. These activities often result in the reduction or degradation of the ecosystems in which animals live, making it difficult for them to survive and thrive. Deforestation, for instance, is a significant factor in habitat destruction. As humans clear forests for timber, agriculture, and infrastructural development, they directly affect the homes of countless animal species that rely on these ecosystems for their survival. The removal of trees and plants eliminates the protective cover, shelter, and food sources for animals, leaving them vulnerable to predation and exposure to harsh environmental conditions. Moreover, the reduction in the number of trees affects water cycles and the quality of soil, which can lead to further degradation of the habitat. Urbanization entails the expansion of human settlements and infrastructure, invading natural habitats and pushing animal species out of their homes. As urban areas grow, they remove or alter vast areas of natural landscapes, transforming them into artificial environments that are unsuitable for many animal species. This leads to loss and fragmentation of habitats, forcing animals to adapt to new surroundings or face potential extinction if unable to do so. Further, urbanization stretches resources for animals, leading to fierce competition for food, shelter, and mating opportunities. Agricultural practices also lead to habitat destruction when natural ecosystems are replaced with monoculture crops or large-scale livestock operations. Pesticides and chemical fertilizers used in agriculture contribute to the pollution of water sources, soil, and air, degrading the quality of habitats for animals. Furthermore, intensive agricultural practices result in soil erosion and loss of organic matter in the soil, which decreases the fertility of the land and undermines the ability of ecosystems to support diverse animal life. Industrialization is yet another factor that threatens animal habitats. Construction of factories, power plants, and transportation networks often requires the removal of natural habitats, which displaces or kills the local fauna. Additionally, industrial activities contribute to pollution through harmful chemicals, gases, and waste products that contaminate the environment and harm animals living nearby. These pollutants can accumulate in food chains and have long-term impacts on the health and reproductive success of animals. In conclusion, something that could cause harm to an animal could be human-driven activities such as deforestation, urbanization, agriculture, and industrialization, which have severe implications for the destruction and modification of animal habitats. These actions lead to the loss of natural ecosystems, reduction of resources, and environmental pollution, making it increasingly difficult for animals to maintain viable populations and fulfill their ecological roles. Consequently, it is essential that we recognize our impact on animal habitats and work towards sustainable practices to preserve the welfare of these species and the ecosystems they rely on for their survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Introduce yourself to someone you recognize. Interact with your group of friends. Exchange phone numbers with someone. Article:","completion":"Title: Making Connections: A Night to Remember Introduction In today's fast-paced society, social events can be a great way to unwind and connect with others, sharing experiences and creating valuable memories. Parties, in particular, present numerous opportunities to meet new people, strengthen bonds with friends and expand your social circle. This article shares a personal experience of attending a party with a friend, and how it led to meaningful interactions and valuable takeaways. 1. Preparing for the Party A great way to ensure a fun and smooth party experience is by going with a friend. This helps to build confidence and create a sense of camaraderie, as well as providing a wingman to rely on for moral support when needed. In this instance, my friend and I decided to attend a coworker's party together, looking forward to an evening filled with laughter and conversations. 2. Making an Entrance Upon arriving at the party, it's essential to take a moment to survey the space, absorb the atmosphere, and observe the various groups of people. This not only helps you get acclimated to the environment but also assists in identifying familiar faces or potential new acquaintances. In my case, I spotted someone I recognized from work and promptly approached them, hoping to make a connection. 3. Building Connections When introducing oneself, it's vital to be genuine, relaxed and engaging. These qualities help to set the tone for a memorable conversation and ensure that both parties feel at ease. After offering a friendly greeting, I introduced myself to the individual I recognized at the party, mentioning our shared workplace. This commonality acted as a foundation for our conversation, allowing us to discuss various interesting topics and discover our shared interests. 4. Spending Time with Friends As the party progressed, I made it a point to engage with my friend and other acquaintances, reinforcing already established connections and creating a sense of belonging. Spending quality time with friends at a party can be a great way to deepen relationships, forge shared memories, and maintain the bond that brought you together in the first place. During this time, my friend and I engaged in numerous conversations, laughed at jokes, and even participated in group games, making the evening all the more enjoyable and memorable. 5. Expanding Your Social Circle One of the main goals of attending social events is to widen your network by meeting new people. In this particular instance, I had the opportunity to exchange phone numbers with the person I had met earlier in the evening. This simple gesture of exchanging contact information not only solidified our connection but also opened the door for future gatherings and interactions. Conclusion Attending a party can be a thrilling and rewarding experience when approached with the right mindset and willingness to connect with others. By going to the event with a friend, making a memorable entrance, introducing yourself genuinely, engaging with acquaintances, and exchanging contact information, you plant the seeds for lasting friendships and networks that can enrich your life both personally and professionally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(1) Belson as an audio director programmed live kinetic visuals and Jacobs programmed electronic music and visual experiments . (2) Belson as Visual Director programmed live kinetic visuals and Jacobs programmed electronic music and audio experiments . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"I will analyze both sentences step-by-step to determine if they mean the same thing: Sentence 1: - Belson works as an audio director. - Belson programmed live kinetic visuals. - Jacobs programmed electronic music. - Jacobs programmed visual experiments. Sentence 2: - Belson works as a Visual Director. - Belson programmed live kinetic visuals. - Jacobs programmed electronic music. - Jacobs programmed audio experiments. Justification: While both sentences share some similarities, they are not exactly the same. The primary difference is in Belson's role and responsibility in each sentence. In Sentence 1, Belson is an audio director but has programmed live kinetic visuals. In Sentence 2, Belson is a Visual Director, which fits better with their responsibility for programming live kinetic visuals. Jacobs' responsibilities remain the same in both sentences, focusing on electronic music and experiments. However, in Sentence 1, Jacobs is responsible for visual experiments, while in Sentence 2, they are responsible for audio experiments. Based on these differences, the two sentences do not mean the same thing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Final Night of the RNC Showcases All Things Trump After four long days of speeches and spectacle, the Republican delegates assembled in Cleveland finally got what they came here for — a night centered on party unity, balloon drops, and a full fledged appearance by GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Before the man himself took the stage, though, there was a full menu of speakers to build up to him. Tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel gave a short speech endorsing Trump and obliquely warning the Republicans that if they continue to focus on social issues like gay marriage and transgender bathroom rights, they will miss what really matters — issues like the economy and foreign policy. Though Thiel may not be as well known as some other speakers, his inclusion in prime time could prove to be a shrewd move. Thiel is something of a libertarian hero. Given that Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson is doing better than expected in the polls, the presence of Thiel could help win over some from that wing of the party. Other than the candidate himself, the most well-received speech of the night came from Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. Her speech introducing her father was more policy focused than many of the other addresses on Thursday evening — though that policy was mostly about childcare and the gender wage gap, not bread-and-butter Republican issues. Though the final night of the convention will not completely erase the chaos of the first three, it was certainly a better look than what Trump and the Republican National Committee had offered so far. Next week, the Democrats will host their own convention. Given the discipline of the Clinton campaign, it is likely to be the exact opposite of this week’s shindig — it will be focus-group tested and punctual, perhaps even over-managed. In what has thus far been a highly unpredictable election season, it’s unclear which event will appeal more to voters: Trump’s unpredictability or Clinton’s perfectionism. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The final night of the Republican National Convention (RNC) showcased all things Trump, focusing on party unity, balloon drops, and a full appearance by the GOP presidential nominee, Donald Trump.

Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone.

Chicago Cubs The \\"Bleacher Bums\\" is a name given to fans, many of whom spend much of the day heckling, who sit in the bleacher section at Wrigley Field. Initially, the group was called \\"bums\\" because it referred to a group of fans who were at most games, and since those games were all day games, it was assumed they did not work. Many of those fans were, and are still, students at Chicago area colleges, such as DePaul University, Loyola, Northwestern University, and Illinois-Chicago. A Broadway play, starring Joe Mantegna, Dennis Farina, Dennis Franz, and James Belushi ran for years and was based on a group of Cub fans who frequented the club's games. The group was started in 1967 by dedicated fans Ron Grousl, Tom Nall and \\"mad bugler\\" Mike Murphy, who was a sports radio host during mid days on Chicago-based WSCR AM 670 \\"The Score\\". Murphy alleges that Grousl started the Wrigley tradition of throwing back opposing teams' home run balls. The current group is headed by Derek Schaul (Derek the Five Dollar Kid). Prior to the 2006 season, they were updated, with new shops and private bar (The Batter's Eye) being added, and Bud Light bought naming rights to the bleacher section, dubbing them the Bud Light Bleachers. Bleachers at Wrigley are general admission, except during the playoffs. The bleachers have been referred to as the \\"World's Largest Beer Garden.\\" A popular T-shirt (sold inside the park and licensed by the club) which says \\"Wrigley Bleachers\\" on the front and the phrase \\"Shut Up and Drink Your Beer\\" on the reverse fuels this stereotype.

Drake has just received a Black Ace, with the words: \\"At seven tomorrow night\\", the time he is to be killed. Two plainclothes cops arrive from police headquarters, having had a call, Clancy and Dugan (both incompetents). Martha suggests that they leave for Drake's Louisiana plantation tomorrow morning and be far away from there at seven tomorrow night. Drake agrees and suggests they all go. On the flight, the lights go off for some seconds and when they come on again, Austin Winters is dead without a mark on him. At the plantation, Clancy ineptly questions the suspects till Neil points out that they are now in another state, so out of their jurisdiction. Neil goes to another room and makes a phone call, then signals to someone outside. After he finishes his call, the line is cut. Meanwhile one of the pilots has taken off in the plane, leaving the other pilot, Henderson, behind who claims he does not know anything though he was out of the cockpit when Winters was killed. The coroner finds a letter on the dead man which is to be read if Winters dies. It will reveal the identity of the Black Ace. Clancy starts reading it aloud and unsurprisingly the lights go off and the letter has vanished when the lights are turned on again. People locked in their rooms that night and Neil has a hidden car outside signal to him. A:","completion":"The full name of the person that has a daughter named Martha is Thornton Drake. In the given article, it is mentioned that Neil Broderick met Martha, Austin Winters' daughter, on the train and was on his way to see Thornton Drake for more information about the \\"Black Ace\\" killer.

Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. Which group of larvae had fewer germline mutations? Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect.

Performing karaoke in public suited Dennis but not Justin because OPT: (a). Dennis had considerable talent and trained successfully. (b). Justin had considerable talent and trained successfully.","completion":"Performing karaoke in public suited Dennis but not Justin because Dennis had considerable talent and trained successfully. Dennis and Justin were best friends who always supported each other in every aspect of their lives. However, when it came to performing karaoke in public, there was a stark contrast in their abilities. Dennis was a natural born performer, while Justin was more skilled with his fingers on guitar strings than in front of a mic. Step 1: Introducing the characters' backgrounds Dennis had been singing since he was a child, with his mother, a former professional opera singer, as his mentor. He trained relentlessly, perfecting his vocal techniques and taking every opportunity to showcase his talents at school recitals and local talent shows. This consistent practice and experience helped him develop the confidence needed to take center stage, wowing audiences with his powerful voice and magnetic presence. Step 2: Highlighting the main reason for their differences Justin, on the other hand, was a self-taught, highly skilled guitarist. He had a great ear for music and spent hours learning chords and playing along to his favorite songs. Despite his considerable talent, Justin's on-stage presence was more subdued, lacking the kind of charisma and stage presence that made Dennis a natural at karaoke. Step 3: Showing the contrast between the two friends in performance situations Whenever the two friends would visit a karaoke bar or attend a party with a karaoke machine, Dennis would usually be the first to volunteer and belt out his favorite tunes. Inspired by his friend's infectious enthusiasm, Justin would sometimes muster up the courage to join him on stage, strumming his guitar as backup. Step 4: Demonstrating Justin's attempts to overcome his fear Though Justin admired Dennis' karaoke prowess, he often grappled with stage fright and had trouble hitting the high notes. Aware of his shortcomings, he started attending vocal lessons in an attempt to gain more confidence and hone his singing abilities. Step 5: Emphasizing the continuous support between the friends Despite their differences in talent and comfort on stage, Dennis remained supportive of Justin's endeavors to master the art of karaoke. He would offer encouraging words and constructive feedback after each practice session. Their friendship served as an unwavering foundation, allowing them to grow and learn together as they continued to pursue their shared passion for music. In the end, Dennis' karaoke skills may have outshined Justin's, but their bond as friends only grew stronger. They appreciated each other's talents, and embraced the fact that each had their own unique way of enjoying and contributing to the world of music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Winston was Chloe's mentor in what they referred to as \\"The Life,\\" this being a euphemism for a whole range of different activities, groups and lifestyles that fell under the general category of living underground and off the information grid. Paul, after defrauding his former partners and then running afoul of the law in a very public way, had been living The Life for almost a year and a half now. Chloe, as near as he could tell, had been doing it for almost a decade. Winston had started in the late '60s as a 16-year-old member of the notorious Weather Underground.

A profession in film direction can be invigorating and rewarding, given the right guidance and dedication. Breaking into this field comes with its fair share of challenges, but taking the following steps can help pave your path to success in becoming a professional film director. Step 1: Enroll in an Undergraduate Art Program The first step towards a successful film directing career is to get a strong foundation in arts. Enrolling in an undergraduate art program will provide you with an in-depth understanding of various art forms, composition, and aesthetics. Relevant programs may include film studies, media production, screenwriting, and cinematography. Doing so can help you develop your visual and story-telling abilities, as well as sharpen your artistic vision. Moreover, it will give you a chance to network with like-minded individuals and professionals in the industry, which could open up opportunities in the future. Step 2: Watch a Lot of Films Film direction demands a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of cinema, its history, and evolution. Watching a wide range of films – from different genres, eras, and cultures – will help you analyze storytelling styles, cinematography techniques, and character development methods. These insights can aid in refining your own directorial style and improving your ability to communicate with actors and crew members. Step 3: Cultivate the Necessary Personal Skills Becoming a professional film director requires a certain set of leadership and interpersonal skills. You must possess qualities like adaptability, resilience, creativity, and strong communication. Patience and teamwork are also essential, as film production involves long hours and collaboration with various professionals. Taking up workshops, attending conferences, or engaging in student organizations can help inculcate these skills. Gaining practical experience through internships or on-set roles can also be beneficial in preparing you for the world of film direction. Step 4: Get Your Driver’s License While this step may seem unrelated, a driver's license is often a requirement for budding film directors.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Background: The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators, including birds and bats and arthropods like bees, butterflies and moths, and beetles and other insects. Paragraph: Two villages had many inhabitants practicing horticulture. People from Valley village grew flowers and used arthropodes and other insects for pollination and crop protection. Granite village used arthropods and snails, they cultivated them for food. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village knew less about bee pollination? Answer:","completion":"It is not possible to definitively determine which village knew less about bee pollination based on the information provided in the paragraph. However, it can be inferred that Valley village specifically focused on using arthropods and other insects for pollination and crop protection, while Granite village focused on cultivating arthropods and snails for food. Based on this, it could be suggested that Granite village might have been less focused on bee pollination, but there is not enough information to conclusively determine their knowledge level on the subject."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: A Singular Mercedes Aims for Another Record DOMINATOR The Mercedes W196 at the 1954 German Grand Prix; a streamlined W196 can be seen farther back. More Photos » A 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 grand prix car raced by the five-time world champion Juan Manuel Fangio of Argentina will go on the block Friday at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in Britain. The rarity and historical significance of the car make it a contender to set a record for an automobile sold at auction. Driven by Fangio to wins at the grands prix of Germany and Switzerland in its debut year, it is the only one of the 14 built for the Mercedes racing team in 1954 and 1955 that found its way to a private owner. The current high-water mark for a car sold at public auction is 16.4 million, brought by a 1957 Ferrari Testa Rossa racing sports car of unimpressive provenance at a sale in Pebble Beach, Calif., in August 2011. The Mercedes auction, to be conducted by Bonhams, has attracted considerable attention because of the carâs breakthrough engineering and its dominance in both seasons of its competitive career, taking Fangio to consecutive world drivers championships. The W196 â the factoryâs internal designation for the cars â was built in two versions, open-wheel and with a streamlined body, and with three different wheelbases. The car was powered by an in-line 8-cylinder engine that had its power takeoff in the middle, making it the equivalent of two 4-cylinder engines, a measure intended to minimize crankshaft whip. The engineâs valvetrain used a desmodromic system for positive mechanical opening and closing, and it was equipped with fuel injection, an innovation at the time. Ten of the original 14 cars still exist: six remain with Mercedes and three are in museums, in Indianapolis, Vienna and Turin, Italy. The continuing surge in the prices paid for classic cars has given rise to speculation of a sale price of around 20 million. Other factors â the car canât be driven without a support staff of mechanics, it canât be licensed for the road â may keep it out of record territory, though. A veteran collector and car dealer, Don Williams, head of the Blackhawk Collection, has maintained for years that the âheavy hittersâ with millions to spend donât go to auctions. But, he said in a telephone interview, âIf you donât buy this one, you wonât be able to find another.â The top prices in recent private sales â generally accepted as correct by experts close to the transactions but not confirmed by the parties involved â are on another scale: 40 million in 2010 for a 1936 Bugatti Atlantic by Peter Mullin, who specializes in French cars, and 35 million for a 1964 Ferrari 250 GTO coupe by the collector Craig McCaw last year. The W196 for sale at Goodwood was presented by Daimler-Benz to the Beaulieu National Motor Museum in Britain in 1973 with the understanding that it would be kept in the museum. But there was no binding agreement. The museum eventually sold it to the British heavy equipment manufacturer Sir Anthony Bamford. It later went to a French collector, then to a German, and about 10 years ago was bought by a member of the ruling family of Qatar. Whatever the sale price, the value escalation in the vintage and classic car market has been little short of staggering. When Henry Manney, a Road & Track editor, brought his Ferrari GTO to California from Europe in the 1960s, he had no takers at 8,000 and had to lower the price to 6,000. By these standards, the Bugatti collector Dr. Peter Williamson paid what must have been considered an exorbitant price when, in 1971, he gave 59,000 for the car now owned by Mr. Mullin.

The three Rawlings children, Charlie (Ian Weighill), Carrie (Cindy OCallaghan) and Paul (Roy Smart) are reluctantly taken in by Miss Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury). The children are also unhappy, not least at Miss Price's vegetarian lifestyle, and plan to run back to London, but unexpectedly discover, through her attempts to fly on a broomstick, that Miss Price is a trainee witch, complete with black cat (\\"Cosmic Creepers\\") and fully fitted magical laboratory (\\"poisoned dragons liver\\"); and to ensure their silence about this, she presents Paul, the youngest, with a magical bed-knob with which he can cause the bed to travel anywhere.Miss Price is eagerly awaiting the last installment of her magic correspondence course from 'Professor' Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson) of the College of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and is very disappointed when it fails to arrive, the College having closed.

In the 1974 comedy TV series 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum', who played the part of 'Rangi Ram'????","completion":"In the 1974 British comedy TV series 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum', the character of 'Rangi Ram' was played by the talented actor Michael Bates. The show, created by David Croft and Jimmy Perry, aired from 1974 to 1981, and consisted of 56 episodes spanning 8 seasons. The series followed the misadventures of the Royal Artillery Concert Party, a group of soldiers stationed in India and Burma during World War II. Michael Bates was a versatile British actor who appeared in various TV shows and films, but gained significant recognition for his role as Rangi Ram in 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum'. Rangi Ram was the concert party's bearer, responsible for serving the officers and sometimes acting as a translator. The character was portrayed as an Indian, often speaking in a mix of English and Hindi, and was known for his colorful clothing, including a bright turban. However, it is important to note that Michael Bates was not of Indian descent; he was actually a white British actor performing in \\"brownface\\", which entails a Caucasian actor darkening their skin to portray a character of a different ethnicity. While this was accepted at the time, it is now considered highly inappropriate and offensive as it perpetuates racial stereotypes and marginalizes actors of color. Michael Bates' portrayal of Rangi Ram has been criticized in recent years for perpetuating racial stereotypes and, because of this, the show isn't aired as frequently on British television. While the series was popular in its time, it is important to recognize the issue of racial representation in media and continue to strive for authentic and respectful portrayals of diverse characters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The text discusses the jurisdiction of the VSP, the individuals responsible for directing policy and command, as well as the number of sworn state troopers. However, it does not provide any specific insights into the make or model of vehicles predominantly utilized by the force. To substantiate such a claim, we would require additional details such as: 1. Vehicle procurement data or contracts between VSP and car manufacturing companies. 2. An official statement by VSP indicating a preference for Ford vehicles. 3. Statistics highlighting the fleet composition of the police's motor pool. 4. Observations or surveys showcasing a significant number of Ford vehicles being utilized by the VSP. Without this type of data, any conclusion about VSP's preference for Ford vehicles or any other brand would be speculative and unsupported. It's important to note that police departments typically select their vehicles based on a variety of factors, including vehicle functionality, performance, safety features, cost effectiveness, and in some cases even ecological impact. Large-scale procurement tend to be a result of well-balanced decisions involving multiple aspects as per the needs of specific law enforcement tasks. In the United States, several brands, including Ford, have been popular among law enforcement agencies over the years. For instance, Ford's Police Interceptor models, based on the Ford Explorer and Taurus, have been widely used. Additionally, Chevrolet's Tahoe PPV, Dodge's Charger Pursuit, etc., are also used frequently. Therefore, while Ford is a choice among these agencies, it does not automatically imply that it is the preferred or dominant brand utilised by the Vermont State Police. The use of a certain brand of vehicles can vary from state to state and depend on various factors and policies set forth by the respective departments.

Movie title: Susie the Little Blue Coupe Movie plot: Susie is a blue coupe with a tan-cloth top. Her journey starts as a brand-new model in an automobile showroom. Susie contends with the ups and downs of life, from driving on fast-moving roadways, to finding a suitable parking space amid the many other automobiles out there.But as time goes on, Susie begins to feel her age. When she becomes too much for her original owner to handle, she is sold to a used car lot. Her second owner is rather uncouth, and her new journey in life takes her down back-alleys in the dead of night.One evening, a stranger carjacks Susie, and the incident ends in her colliding with a streetcar. Now a wreck, she's towed to the junk yard. However, just when her life seems at an end, a young teenager buys her from the junk yard, and gives her a second life as a sleek and fast little hot rod. Answer:","completion":"The film proposal for \\"Susie the Little Blue Coupe\\" presents an anthropomorphic journey of a car named Susie, whose life follows a trajectory similar to a human's, from a shiny, new, cared-for item to a neglected, worn out one, and eventually experiencing a rebirth. The title character, Susie, embodies the car and the metaphorical representation of life stages. Though she starts off pampered on the showroom floor, like many objects and even humans, time takes a toll on her. In terms of the plot asking how 'time takes its toll on Susie', we can see this in a few key ways. Firstly, the wear and tear - as Susie ages, she moves from pristine newness to a state of degradation. This emphasizes the more general existential concept of aging and decay over time, which no one and nothing can escape. Not only does her physical condition deteriorate, she also shows signs of wear from all the journeys she has taken, the miles she has driven, and the elements she has endured. Secondly, the transitions - as she's bought, sold, and then bought again we see her level of care change as well as her purpose. She moves from a loved transport means to a tool for an uncouth owner and the victim of a carjacker. These instances show the fall from grace that can occur with time, and how value can be subjective and transitional. Thirdly, the emotional toll - Though unmentioned if Susie has consciousness or a personality, the narrative causes us to give her those attributes. We can assume that, just as life’s events impact us emotionally, they would also impact Susie. The carjacking alone could cause metaphorical trauma and emotional damage, not to mention the incident where she ends as a wreck. Lastly, the acceptance - It's a tale of resilience culminating in her resurrection as a hot rod. It shows that, in spite of the toll that time has taken on Susie, there's an opportunity for renewal. When deciding whether to invest in this project, consider the lovely metaphor of Susie's life. It could appeal to a wide audience through themes of nostalgia, life's ups and downs, the pain of neglect, and the joy of renewal. By prompting the audience to identify life's phases with this inanimate object, there's a possibility for the storyline to take on a deeper, evocative meaning."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Have you ever been stuck for hours on a hard math problem? If you sat there for some time you might eventually solve it, but scientists say that daydreaming might be a much better way to tackle difficult tasks. In fact, daydreaming has long been misunderstood. It's considered to be a bad thing and often associated with laziness. \\"We're harsh on ourselves if we catch ourselves mind wandering,\\" says Professor Kalina Christoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada. But the truth is that some of the most important scientific discoveries came about because scientists allowed their minds to wander. For example, Albert Einstein began his theory of relativity when he daydreamed about riding a beam of sunlight to the edge of the universe. And now, research has shown that normal people can also improve their problems solving ability in the same way, reported The Telegraph. In a study, 145 people aged between 19 and 32 were asked to list as many unusual uses as possible for everyday objects. Some of them were given a 12-minute break while the others were not allowed any break from the task. People on the break did not simply relax--some of them were told to carry out a tiring memory task while others did an easier task. Scientists found that people who did the easier task were daydreaming a lot. They thought about personal issues in the past or in the future because their mind was at ease. After the break, all participants were asked to return once again to the task of listing unusual uses for everyday objects. It was found that daydreamers improved their performance by 40 percent, while all the other people, including those who didn't have a break and who did tiring tasks during the break, performed the same as before. \\"People think that when the mind wanders away, it just gets turned off--but we show the opposite,\\" explained Christoff.\\"A more playful attitude might allow you to call in more resources .\\" So when you are struggling to solve complicated problems, it might be better off if you switch to a...

Most children and young adults have tooth decay . A study which come out on China Health Monthly magazine this year showed that 40.74% of a sample of 1,306 Chinese students under age 15 has decayed teeth. Food that is rich in sugar increases the risk of tooth decay. After you eat, bacteria go crazy over the sugar on your teeth. The bacteria turn sugar into acids that eat away at tooth enamel. This causes holes in your teeth. Another common problem is crooked teeth . When your new teeth begin to grow and the old teeth haven't fallen out, there isn't enough space for the new ones. This causes crooked teeth. Don't worry. Here are some ways to keep your teeth healthy. *Brush at least twice a day in the morning and in the evening. *Learn to use dental floss . The floss gets rid of food that's hidden where your toothbrush can't get it. *Visit a dentist.

If the ones digit is 5 or greater, round up by adding the difference between the ones digit and 10. 3. If the ones digit is less than 5, round down by subtracting the ones digit from the integer. 4. Repeat for each integer in the list. Now let's apply these steps to the given list of integers: 1. 131: The ones digit is 1, which is less than 5. So, round down by subtracting 1 to get 130. 2. -327: The ones digit is 7 (ignoring the negative sign), which is greater than or equal to 5. So, round up by adding 3 to get -330. 3. 871: The ones digit is 1, which is less than 5. So, round down by subtracting 1 to get 870. 4. -812: The ones digit is 2 (ignoring the negative sign), which is less than 5. So, round down by subtracting 2 to get -810. 5. 513: The ones digit is 3, which is less than 5. So, round down by subtracting 3 to get 510. 6. -239: The ones digit is 9 (ignoring the negative sign), which is greater than or equal to 5. So, round up by adding 1 to get -240. 7. -359: The ones digit is 9 (ignoring the negative sign), which is greater than or equal to 5. So, round up by adding 1 to get -360. 8. 816: The ones digit is 6, which is greater than or equal to 5. So, round up by adding 4 to get 820. 9. -580: The ones digit is 0 (ignoring the negative sign), which is already at the tens place. No rounding needed, so it remains -580. 10. -783: The ones digit is 3 (ignoring the negative sign), which is less than 5. So, round down by subtracting 3 to get -780.

Review: I'm far from a Sylvester Stallone fan and I guess the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French movie Taxi 3, which is an almost inexistent small role. And yet I must admit that this movie was actually not that bad, even though I feared the worst. When Gabe (Stallone) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top, he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger. For almost a year he doesn't set a food in the reserve, but than he returns. Soon after he's back, they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm. At least, that's what the rangers believe. In reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed. The cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them... This is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever, but in its genre it's an enjoyable one. I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers. I know him best from the TV-series \\"3rd Rock from the Sun\\", but I enjoyed his performance in this movie as well. Overall the acting is OK, it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one-liners, but it also offered a very nice decor. This movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment. I loved the snowy mountains and valleys, the mountain rivers and the forests... Perhaps that's why I give this movie a score higher than what I normally give to an action / adventure movie of this kind. I give it a 6.5/10. If you don't expect too much, this is an enjoyable movie. What is the sentiment of this review?

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Sam would cry when he watched Old Yeller. The movie was what? Possible A: were sad, distraught, unhappy, release tension and anxiety, miserable Why is \\"were sad\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Were sad\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it accurately captures the emotional response most people, including Sam, would have when watching a movie with a tragic or emotionally intense storyline like \\"Old Yeller.\\" The question states that Sam would cry when watching the movie, which is a clear indication of an emotional reaction. In this context, human common sense tells us that crying is often a response to sadness, indicating that the movie elicited a feeling of sadness in Sam. The term 'were sad' is a simple and relatable way to describe this emotional response, and it's a term that most humans can immediately understand and connect with their own experiences. Moreover, the other possible answers like distraught, unhappy, release tension and anxiety, and miserable also convey similar ideas but within varying degrees or contexts. Distraught and miserable, for example, seem to be more intense emotional experiences, and while they could also be applicable to Sam's feelings, \\"were sad\\" would be seen as the more common, everyday expression for this situation, and thus more aligned with human common sense. Unhappy could be another option, but it's a more general term and doesn't specifically convey the emotional response of sadness as much as \\"were sad\\" does. As for \\"release tension and anxiety,\\" while it is true that crying can sometimes serve as a way to release tension and anxiety, in the context of the question, it's less specific to the emotional experience Sam had while watching Old Yeller. So, \\"were sad\\" still stands as a more suitable answer. In summary, \\"were sad\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly represents the emotional response of sadness in a straightforward and relatable manner. It reflects a typical reaction one might have when watching a movie with emotionally heavy moments, like Old Yeller, and it is likely to resonate with many people's experiences, making it a relatable expression."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is \\"Who killed more people , Hitler or Stalin ?\\" asking about?","completion":"The question \\"Who killed more people, Hitler or Stalin?\\" is asking about the comparison of the number of deaths caused by the actions or policies of two historical figures: Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. To answer this question thoughtfully, I would consider the following steps: 1. Research about Adolf Hitler: Adolf Hitler was the dictator of Nazi Germany and the central figure of World War II (1939-1945). He is responsible for the Holocaust, which led to the systematic genocide of approximately 6 million Jews, as well as millions of other \\"undesirable\\" people in Europe, totaling the deaths to an estimated 11-12 million people. 2. Research about Joseph Stalin: Joseph Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953. Stalin's policies and decisions, including mass repression, purges, executions, and man-made famines, resulted in several millions of deaths, with estimates ranging from 6 million to 20 million people. 3. Compare the figures: By comparing the numbers of deaths attributed to each leader, we can identify who was responsible for a higher number of deaths. 4. Acknowledge the complexity: It's important to recognize that the calculations surrounding the numbers of deaths are often disputed, and that the direct involvement of each leader in these deaths may also vary. By following these steps, I can provide a well-informed response to the question about who killed more people between Hitler and Stalin."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Your hamster will do best in a cage larger than 600 square inches, although 450 square inches or 30 inches by 15 inches is the minimum. It should also be more than 12 inches tall so as to be able to fit an adequately sized wheel, 10-12 inches for Syrians and 8 inches for Dwarfs. A glass aquarium (as long as it meets the minimum floor space) is a great home for a hamster. The disadvantage is the lack of ventilation, so make sure the lid is a wire mesh to allow for air movement. An IKEA Detolf is an excellent choice too. Alternatively, the \\"cat tray with a wire top\\" type of hamster cage does have good natural ventilation. Make sure your cage is not in direct sunlight as your hamster could overheat due to the bright rays magnifying on the aquarium glass. Unless they're second hand, aquariums can be expensive. You can also purchase wire cages, which have great ventilation, just ensure that they are big enough. Many people make DIY cages, which are wallet-friendly and are great to make. One of the most popular and cheapest DIY cages is the bin cage, which is made with a 105-quart bin and mesh attached to the lid. Make sure there is plenty of ventilation. Don't place the cage in front of a hot window. Make sure to find a place that is quiet and free of any other household pets such as dogs and cats. This will reduce the stress of your pet hamster. At no point should you let your dogs or cats interact with your hamster. You’d be amazed at how clever hamsters are at escaping. Make sure all holes are sealed and that no loose or removable parts can be opened by your hamster. Be sure if you have a wire cage that your hamster can't fit through the bars or get stuck. The bar spacing of your hamster's cage should be no more than 0.7 cm apart for Dwarf hamsters and 1 cm for Syrian hamsters. It will need to be even smaller for a baby hamster. House Syrian hamsters and female Chinese hamsters alone. They are territorial starting at about the age of 5-8 weeks and will fight often to death with another hamster if placed in the same space. Some Dwarf hamsters can be housed together as long as they are properly bonded from a young age. The three species of Dwarf hamsters (Campbell's Russian dwarf, Winter White Dwarf, and Roborovski) can live alone or in pairs as long as they are introduced to each other properly. Don't pair different species of hamsters together. Mating pairs should not be permanently housed together as they may fight and injure each other. On the ground, there should be a layer of at least 6 inches of bedding. This might seem like a lot, but hamsters dig large tunnels in the wild. Many hamsters don't dig if there is too little bedding, so make sure to always add a big layer. Even if your hamster does not appear to be digging, leave the bedding inside in case your hamster really is or would like to start. Softwood shavings such as pine and cedar are just not good for hamsters, as they cause many health issues. They can cause respiratory problems and may contain harmful oils. However, aspen bedding does not contain the same harmful oils and is perfectly safe for your hamster. Never use cotton bedding. This is very dangerous for your hamster because it is indigestible, and strands of the bedding can wrap around limbs and extremities cutting off circulation and potentially killing your hamster.","completion":"A hamster's cage should be at least 450 square inches (30x15 inches), and ideally larger than 600 square inches. The cage should be over 12 inches tall to accommodate a wheel (10-12 inches for Syrians, 8 inches for Dwarfs). Glass aquariums with wire mesh lids can be great hamster homes but avoid direct sunlight and ensure proper ventilation. DIY options like bin cages can also be a cost-effective choice. Keep the cage away from other pets, and make sure it is secured to prevent escape. Be cautious of suitable bar spacing for your hamster; 0.7 cm for Dwarf hamsters, 1 cm for Syrians. House Syrian hamsters and female Chinese hamsters alone, while some Dwarf hamsters can live in pairs. The cage should have at least 6 inches of bedding, but avoid using softwood shavings or cotton bedding. Aspen bedding is a safe option for hamsters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Step 1: Analyze both sentences closely. Sentence 1: \\"yeah i'll watch quite a few games on TV\\" This sentence suggests that the person is stating they will watch a significant number of games on TV. Sentence 2: \\"I will watch some games on TV, but I prefer going to the real game.\\" This sentence expresses two ideas: - The person will watch some games on TV. - The person prefers attending games in person over watching them on TV. Step 2: Compare both sentences. Comparing both sentences, we see that they both share the idea of watching games on TV. However, Sentence 2 also includes the person's preference for attending games in person. Step 3: Determine if the truth of Sentence 1 implies the truth of Sentence 2. If Sentence 1 is true (the person will watch quite a few games on TV), it implies that the person does indeed watch games on TV. In Sentence 2, the person also mentions watching some games on TV. The truth of Sentence 1 matches the first part of Sentence 2. However, Sentence 1 does not provide any information about the person's preference for attending games in person.

Soon after the conclusion of peace, important changes were made in legislation concerning industry and commerce, and the new freedom thus afforded produced a large number of limited liability companies. Plans were formed for building a great network of railways, partly for the purpose of developing the natural resources of the country, and partly for the purpose of increasing its power for defense and attack. The existence of serfdom was tackled boldly, taking advantage of a petition presented by the Polish landed proprietors of the Lithuanian provinces and, hoping that their relations with the serfs might be regulated in a more satisfactory way (meaning in a way more satisfactory for the proprietors), he authorized the formation of committees \\"for ameliorating the condition of the peasants,\\" and laid down the principles on which the amelioration was to be effected. This step had been followed by one even more significant. Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to send a circular to the provincial governors of European Russia (serfdom was rare in other parts), containing a copy of the instructions forwarded to the Governor-General of Lithuania, praising the supposed generous, patriotic intentions of the Lithuanian landed proprietors, and suggesting that perhaps the landed proprietors of other provinces might express a similar desire. The hint was taken: in all provinces where serfdom existed, emancipation committees were formed. The emancipation was not merely a humanitarian question capable of being solved instantaneously by imperial ukase. It contained very complicated problems, deeply affecting the economic, social and political future of the nation. Alexander had to choose between the different measures recommended to him and decide if the serfs would become agricultural laborers dependent economically and administratively on the landlords or if the serfs would be transformed into a class of independent communal proprietors. The emperor gave his support to the latter project, and the Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in Europe to shake off serfdom. The architects of the emancipation manifesto were Alexander's brother Konstantin, Yakov Rostovtsev, and Nikolay Milyutin. On 3 March 1861, 6 years after his accession, the emancipation law was signed and published.

Write some highlights for the following article: A 5-year-old boy was sent home on his first day of kindergarten after school officials said his hair was too long. Malachi Wilson, who is half Native American and a member of the Navajo Nation, was dismissed from F. J. Young Elementary in Seminole, Texas for violating school policy that states boys can't have hair that is longer than the collar of their shirt, or wear ponytails. Many Native Americans believe that hair is scared, and cutting it is a manifestation of loss. Scroll down for video. Kicked out: 5-year-old Malachi Wilson was sent home from F. J. Young Elementary in Seminole, Texas on his first day of school because of his long hair, and told he needed to cut it to return. Heartbreaking: 'How do you explain to a 5-year-old that he’s being turned away because of what he believes in?' asked April Wilson, Malachi's mother. 'After we had enrolled him he was excited. He was ready to go. Everyday it was the question, \\"Mom, [am I] going to school?\\"' his mother, April Wilson, told KOSA. No sooner had he arrived however, than Malachi was sent home, with an order from the school's principal, Sherrie Warren, to cut his hair if he wanted to return. Adding insult to injury, when his mother protested his dismissal, noting her son's Native American religious beliefs, Miss Wilson demanded she show proof of his heritage. Once she had provided formal proof Malachi was indeed Native American, he was allowed to return to school, but the young boy still seems hurt. 'It was a sad day,' he said of being sent home. 'It’s kind of heartbreaking because how do you explain to a 5-year-old that he’s being turned away because of what he believes in? Because of his religion, because of what’s part of him,' his mother added. 'Our hair is sacred to us.' Proof: Malachi's mother April was asked to obtain formal paperwork of her son's Navajo heritage, and bring it to the school. School policy: The Seminole Independent School District does not allow boys to have hair that goes past their collars, or wear ponytails. She said she has not ruled out filing a discrimination lawsuit against the district. School district officials say they followed procedure, and pointed out the rule in their handbook that says, 'certain recognized religious or spiritual beliefs may qualify for an exception from provisions of the dress code.' Interestingly enough, the school's mascot is a Seminole, with long hair. Similar case: Adriel Arocha, a member of the Lipan Apache, tribe was was also sent home from school for having long hair in 2008. His family took their case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and won. Malachi's story is very similar to that of another Texas kindergartner, Adriel Arocha, who is also Native American and was also sent home for having hair that was deemed too long by officials in his school district back in 2008. Adriel, a member of the Lipan Apache tribe, and his family were told by the Needville Independent School District that he must either cut or conceal his hair. The family eventually took their case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after the district refused to give Adriel an exemption for religious beliefs, and in 2010 a judge ruled in the family's favor.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What four ways are the oysters cooked by the Jola people? The island's proximity to the river and the ocean suggests that the area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet the indigenous people, mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise artisan fishing, just to supply their own daily needs. Pirogues cut from the trunks of kapok trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from Mali, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.The collection of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still takes place in Casamance, which is one of three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are an important component of the family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers. Answer:","completion":"The four ways the oysters are cooked by the Jola people are: 1. Boiled: Oysters are boiled in water, which is a common method of cooking them for local consumption. This helps to retain their natural taste and texture while making them safe to eat. 2. Grilled on a wood fire: Grilling oysters on a wood fire imparts a smoky flavor and slightly crispy texture to the oysters. They are typically served with a spicy sauce, which adds an extra layer of flavor to the dish. 3. Sun-dried: Oysters that are meant for sale or preservation are often sun-dried. This process involves placing the oysters in the sun to dry out, which extends their shelf life. The dried oysters can later be rehydrated and cooked in various dishes. 4. Smoked: Smoking is another method of preserving oysters for sale or later consumption. Oysters are exposed to smoke, which not only dries them out but also adds a distinct smoky flavor. This method also helps to preserve the oysters, making them safe for consumption at a later time. In some villages, including Carabane, oysters are also kept alive for several weeks before being transported to the market. This ensures their freshness and quality when sold to customers. Overall, the Jola people use a variety of cooking and preservation methods to make the most of the oyster harvest, incorporating them into their diet and local economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A baby delivered by emergency cesarean section after his mother suffered a brain hemorrhage just six months into her pregnancy is preparing to head home after more than a month in hospital. Brayden Ellison weighed just 3 pounds 6 ounces when he was delivered in Tarzana, California on July 21 - and family members have called him a 'miracle', KTLA reported. But his mother, 21-year-old Kayla Katler, did not survive. At six months pregnant, she had gone to the doctor with a bad headache and when it did not improve days later, she was taken to hospital, where doctors discovered she had a 3mm blood clot. Loss: Kayla Katler, left, died when she was six months pregnant with her son Brayden. The baby boy was delivered by emergency Cesarean section and is now going home with his dad Derek Ellison, right. Shock: Kayla, pictured with Ellison, suffered a seizure after developing a blood clot in her brain. She suffered a deadly seizure, forcing doctors to act quickly to save her unborn son. Her sudden death has shocked family and friends, who said she was active and healthy. 'I have my moments of, \\"Why me?\\"' her boyfriend Derek Ellison told NBC. '\\"Why would we be brought together just to be ripped apart?\\" I went into this looking forward to raising a son with Kayla and in one minute I became a single father.' But he said the overwhelming support he has received from the community has helped immensely. Strangers and friends have donated diapers, clothing, car seats and baby furniture through a Facebook page, Support Baby Brayden Ellison. Kayla's cousin Nicki Ciancio posted that the young mother-to-be had not even had time to have a baby shower before her sudden death - and strangers were soon donating gifts, she said. Strength to strength: Brayden was just three pounds six ounces when he was born, left, but he is becoming healthier by the day and is now ready to go home after six months in the hospital. Loved: Strangers have donated diapers, clothes and toys to the tot after hearing about his story. Ever since the boy was born, Ellison has visited him in the NICU at Tarzana Providence Medical Center, and on Tuesday, he will be taking the little boy home. 'With the support system I have, there's not a lot to be afraid of,' he told KTLA. But the day is bittersweet for other family members. 'It's really sad to know that she's not the one bringing him home,' Kayla's mother Christy Katler said. 'That's the way it’s supposed to be.' Ellison said he is learning to cope with the death of his beloved girlfriend, whom he met a year ago, one day at a time. He has taken some solace in knowing her organs were donated. The family has set up a Gofundme page to cover Brayden's medical expenses and college fund. See below for video.

Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

I am facing a new situation today: Two brothers got sick and weren't feeling well. Strangely enough they found out they were infected with viruses. Tom was infected with human papillomavirus, while Chris was infected with hepatitis. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which brother had a higher chance of developing a chronic viral infection? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer, while human papillomavirus (HPV) is an established cause of various cancers, such as those of the cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Between the two brothers, Chris, who is infected with hepatitis, has a higher chance of developing a chronic viral infection. This is because hepatitis has a more direct association with chronic infection, which can ultimately result in liver cancer. Hepatitis viruses, such as hepatitis B and C, may not clear from the system in some individuals and can persist for many years, leading to chronic liver disease and the potential for liver cancer. On the other hand, Tom, who is infected with human papillomavirus, may not necessarily develop a chronic infection. Although HPV is responsible for various types of cancers, not every infected individual will experience chronic infection or progress to cancer. In many cases, healthy individuals are often able to clear HPV infections on their own within one to two years without any serious complications. However, the risk of cancer development may increase in cases where HPV infection persists or if the person is infected with high-risk HPV types. In conclusion, while both viruses can lead to serious health complications and cancers, Chris is more likely to develop a chronic viral infection due to his hepatitis infection compared to Tom, who is infected with human papillomavirus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Japanese students work very hard, but many are unhappy. They feel heavy pressure from their parents to do well in school. Most students are always being told by their parents to study harder so that they can have a wonderful life. Though this may be a good idea for those very smart students, it can have terrible results for many students because they are not talented enough. As it is reported, a number of students killed themselves. Others try to get the feelings of taking drugs . Some join the groups of troublemakers and turn to crime . Many of them have tried very hard at school but have failed in the exams and have their parents lose hopes. Such students felt that they are hated by everyone else they meet and they don't want to go to school any longer. It is surprising that though most Japanese parents are worried about their children, they do not help them in any ways .Many parents feel that they are not able to help their children and it is the teachers' work to help their children. To make matter worse, a lot of parents send their children to those school opening in the evenings and on weekends-- they only help students to pass exams and never teach students any real sense of the world. It is a great surprise that almost three quarters of middle school students have been to such kind of schools. Many Japanese schools usually have rules about everything from the students' hair to their clothes and the things in their bags. Child psychologists now think that such strict rules are harmful to the feelings of the students. Almost 40% of the students said that no one had taught them how to get on with others, how to tell right from wrong, how to show love for others, even for their parents. What do child psychologists think is harmful to the feelings of children? A) Schools have too much rules about everything. B) The parents don't help their children.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: In what year did the colony established by Robert Cavelier de La Salle fail? The French colonization of Texas began with the establishment of a fort in present-day southeastern Texas. It was established in 1685 near Arenosa Creek and Matagorda Bay by explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle. He intended to found the colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River, but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused his ships to anchor instead 400 miles (640 km) to the west, off the coast of Texas. The colony survived until 1688. The present-day town of Inez is near the fort's site. The colony faced numerous difficulties during its brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny. Although a handful of men reached Illinois Country, help never made it to the fort. Most of the remaining members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony. Spain learned of La Salle's mission in 1686. Concerned that the French colony could threaten Spain's control over the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the unsettled southeastern region of North America, the Crown funded multiple expeditions to locate and eliminate...

News article: Why I'm worried about youth unemployment According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, since the beginning of this year, the percentage of young Americans working or actively looking for work has been hitting historic lows. This was very consistent with what I'd heard so, I wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal entitled \\"Why Young People Can't Find Work.\\" That next day, Derek Thompson, an editor from The Atlantic, posted a rebuttal entitled \\"The Real Reason Young People Can't Find Jobs.\\" Thompson criticized my op-ed for 1) not mentioning the recession as a reason why young people are out of work; 2) not understanding that college is a reason many young people aren't working; and, 3) not recognizing that young people have always had high rates of unemployment. I appreciate the fact that Thompson is engaging on this issue. Let's look at his three points. Read MoreThe surprising reason millennials won't get hired I didn't mention the recession as a reason for youth unemployment because it ended in July of 2009. I was writing about the current disturbingly low labor participation rates for Americans between the ages of 16 and 29. Of the historic lows I noted, all were well after the recession ended. One was from 2012, one was from 2013 and 11 were from 2014. In reality, the labor-participation rates for 16 to 29 years olds were all higher during the recession than they are now after five years of supposed recovery. I did mention that there are 94,000 fewer people employed now than in May of 2008, while the employable population has increased by 14,217,000 people (virtually all of whom are now between the ages of 16 and 21). The supposed recovery is failing to produce jobs sufficient even to match population growth and, while the recession is long over, large numbers of young Americans are still unable to find jobs. With regard to Thompson's point about college, more young people are choosing to pursue a higher education today than a generation or two ago. The question is: How many young people are going to college, or staying in college, because they can't find work? If the labor market were healthy, surely more young adults would, at the very least, prefer to work their way through college so as to graduate without crushing debt. But, to do so, they need jobs. Read MoreHalf of grads still use the Bank of Mom and Dad I invite Thompson to examine the BLS data for young people aged 25 to 29. By that age, most people have graduated from college and would like (or need) a job. In May, 18.5 percent of 20- to 24- year olds were in school and either unemployed or out of the labor force. That percentage drops down to 6 percent for 24- to 29- year olds. As I noted in my op-ed, the labor-participation rates for 25- to 29-year olds in April and May of this year were the lowest the BLS has recorded since it began collecting that data in 1982. Finally, Thompson claims that young people can't find work because they're young, and young people have a harder time finding a job than older people. But young people have always been young; a 20-year old is no younger today than a 20 -ear old was 30 years ago. The point of my op-ed was that young people today are having a more difficult time finding jobs than people of the same age in the past. To support his position that things aren't really getting worse for America's youth, Thompson offers a comparison between the unemployment rates for younger Americans and the overall unemployment rate. I didn't discuss unemployment rates because, in an era of declining labor participation, the official unemployment rate is a misleading statistic. The official rate fails to count people as unemployed if they've dropped out of the labor force. So, when the labor-participation rate is declining, the unemployment rate can improve even if the job market is getting worse. Read MoreBest and worst countries for youth unemployment For example, in April, the unemployment rate for the general population fell to 6.3 percent from 6.7 percent, even though 73,000 fewer people were employed in April than had been employed in March. In other words, the unemployment rate declined even though fewer people were working. It declined only because 806,000 people (basically the population of San Francisco) dropped out of the labor force. The youth unemployment rate may be holding steady but only because labor participation for America's youth is declining to historic lows. We should all consider what these statistics mean for real people. They mean that a whole cohort of young adults is falling behind in their careers and may never catch up. Even if the economy somehow started producing jobs in an amount sufficient to absorb population growth, these young people would have to compete with even younger workers who have comparable experience and education, creating a real danger that they will never achieve their potential — that they will never have the same chance that I and others like me had when we were starting out. That's why I'm so concerned. Commentary by Andrew F.

The author, Andrew F. Puzder, argues that the recession and increased college attendance cannot wholly explain the current state of youth unemployment. He addresses the misleading nature of official unemployment rates, which fail to account for individuals who have dropped out of the labor force, and highlights the potential long-term impacts of high youth unemployment, such as hindered career progression and difficulties in achieving economic potential. Puzder asserts that tackling the issue of youth unemployment is crucial for the future success and well-being of the affected population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: This article: With government subsidies promised, initially at 385,000 a year, and with the backing of the leading investment bank Brown Brothers, Collins founded the New York and Liverpool United States' Mail Steamship Company, familiarly known as the Collins Line. He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\". In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\", while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851–52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\". Luce was admired by passengers as much for his social qualities as for his seamanship; a reporter for Harper's New Monthly Magazine wrote approvingly: \\"If you ever wish to cross the Atlantic, you will find in the... contains an answer for the question: What was the nickname given to the largest of the four sister ships that completed a record eastbound crossing?, what is it ?

What is less known is that Japan, understanding that fast, efficient transport was the key to a global economy, was the first country in the world to introduce the \\"Bullet Train\\". Kawasaki Heavy Industries was duly appointed the manufacturer and the first high speed train went \\"on line\\" in 1964. The Shinkansen, as is known in Japan, made its first journey between her capital and Osaka, a distance of 301 miles, at a speed of 132 mph. The next country to introduce high speed trains was France. SNGF, the public rail system in France, was losing passengers to other forms of transport and introduced the \\"TGV\\" (Train a Grande Vitesse) to counteract the trend in 1981. As a result of Opec controlling the oil market in 1974, the train was designed to be powered by gas turbines. It ran on a specially built track between Lyon and Paris. Eight years later another TGV was introduced, this time between the coast and Paris. Soon, France became the most rail efficient country in the world with high speed train connections to Belgium, London, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and the Netherlands. There was another positive element that resulted from the introduction of high speed trains. Between 1964 and 1991, Japan's Shinkansen had transported in excess of three billion passengers without there being a single fatal accident and eleven years after France introduced the TGV, it still had a 100% safety record. This statistic has never been equaled by the traditional slow moving trains in any country. China has become the fourth country to produce such trains, after France, Germany and Japan.

However, recent reports have revealed far-reaching implications of this scandal, significantly broadening its scale. On a recent Thursday, the bank declared that an intensive review conducted by a third-party firm has concluded, revealing an even more shocking count of potential fake accounts. According to Bloomberg, the analysis has increased the total number of questionable accounts by a striking 67%, escalating the figure to 3.5 million. This investigation, which comprised a thorough examination of an estimated 165 million accounts opened between January 2009 and September 2016, has radically expanded the historical viewpoint of the contentious issue. CNBC provided further context, reporting that the initial count was rooted in a narrower exploration of a mere four-year period. The latest review, with an extended timespan, found approximately 450,000 additional suspect accounts within the initial four-year period, and discovered nearly 1 million more produced in the added years. Evidently, the controversy is more malignant and widespread than previously thought. CEO of Wells Fargo, Timothy Sloan, has considered the conclusion of the review to be an \\"important milestone\\" in the bank’s commitment to rectify its past mistakes and \\"make things right for our customers.\\" Moreover, CNNMoney reported a surge in the estimated number of accounts slapped with inappropriate fees. The projected figure has increased from 130,000, to a disturbingly higher 190,000 accounts. The extensive analysis also unearthed an entirely new dimension of the issue; reportedly half a million potentially unauthorized online bill-pay enrollments were identified. As a consequence of these findings, Wells Fargo has stated that it will refund its customers 910,000 in relation to these unapproved enrollments. Furthermore, another refund, amounting to 6.1 million, is scheduled in connection with the unauthorized bank and credit card accounts—a figure that has nearly doubled from the previous amount of 3.3 million. Sloan, addressing the gravity of the situation in a media conference call, stated per Bloomberg, \\"Today's announcement is a reminder of the disappointment that we caused to our customers and stakeholders. We apologize to everyone who was harmed.\\" In a nutshell, August has proven to be an intense month for Wells Fargo, with the recently concluded investigation revealing the disconcerting extent of the fraudulent practices that took place within the banking titan. Regaining the lost trust and loyalty of its customers will undoubtedly be a challenging journey that will test the sincerity of Wells Fargo’s commitment to amend its wrongdoings and maintain transparency in its operations moving forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"The man in a green shirt, returned a ball, while playing tennis, and won his match.\\", does it logically follow that \\"the man won his tennis match against serena williams\\"?","completion":"It is not logically sound to conclude that \\"the man won his tennis match against Serena Williams\\" based solely on the information provided, which is: \\"The man in a green shirt, returned a ball, while playing tennis, and won his match.\\" This statement alone does not give enough information to directly relate the man's win to a specific opponent or tennis match. To make a logical conclusion, we would need more details regarding the actual opponent, the event, and other relevant data. The initial statement tells us that a man wearing a green shirt played tennis, returned a ball, and eventually won his match. However, it doesn't mention who he was playing against or in what context the match took place. Furthermore, the statement does not clarify if the man played against a professional player or an amateur opponent, or if the match was part of a local club competition, national league, or international event. Mentioning a globally-renowned tennis player like Serena Williams in the derived conclusion without supporting evidence or links to the original statement is not a logically justified conclusion. In order to conclude that \\"the man won his tennis match against Serena Williams,\\" we would need additional information explicitly stating that the man's opponent was Serena Williams or tied to an event where he played against her. Without this supporting evidence, drawing such a conclusion based on the given statement would be speculative and not logically sound."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Usage: \\"Comment: ...and Zoolander will pull his usual stupid grin before the lenses of offshore produced cellphones.\\" This part provides the input that needs to be classified. The comment is a statement made by someone on an online platform. Part #2: Understanding the purpose of the task. Usage: \\"classify the comment into two classes: threat and non-threat.\\" This part asks you to categorize the given comment into one of the two categories, threat or non-threat. You need to determine if the comment contains any intention of harm or not. Part #3: Defining the 'threat' category. Usage: \\"Threat is a statement that someone will be hurt or harmed, especially if the person does not do something in particular.\\" This instruction sets the criteria for the threat category. A comment is considered a threat if it implies harm or hurt to someone, usually conditional on the person not taking specific actions.

In this case, the solution to the problem would be: Solution: Classify the comment as a non-threat. Reason: The comment \\"and Zoolander will pull his usual stupid grin before the lenses of offshore produced cellphones\\" does not contain any statement suggesting someone will be hurt or harmed. Instead, it is a sarcastic remark about someone named Zoolander and their typical behavior.

Q:John is a an ophthalmologist in a local hospital. Today, he has seen two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had hyperopia, but patient B didn't have any issues with eyes. John would now treat the patient that have eye problem. In patient A would images fall behind the retina or on the retina? Hint: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how do you boil potatoes?","completion":"Boiling potatoes is a simple and versatile cooking method that can be accomplished by following these detailed steps: 1. Choose the right potatoes: Select potatoes that are firm, with no green spots, sprouts, or blemishes. The most common types of potatoes suitable for boiling are Russet, Yukon Gold, and red potatoes. Each type offers different textures and flavors: - Russet potatoes are starchy and ideal for mashing or making potato salad. - Yukon Gold potatoes have a buttery texture, making them suitable for boiling and mashing. - Red potatoes are waxy and hold their shape well, making them perfect for boiling and serving in salads or side dishes. 2. Clean the potatoes: Rinse the potatoes thoroughly under cold running water to remove any dirt and debris from the skin. Use a vegetable brush to gently scrub the surface if necessary. 3. Peel or leave the skin on: Depending on your preference, you can either peel the potatoes with a vegetable peeler or leave the skin on. If leaving the skin on, just double-check to ensure that they are clean. 4. Cut the potatoes (optional): If you want to cook your potatoes quickly or plan to use them in a salad, you can cut them into quarters or smaller, even-sized pieces to ensure uniform cooking. If you prefer whole boiled potatoes, make sure they are of similar size for even cooking. 5. Fill a large pot with water: Use a large pot with enough cold water to cover the potatoes by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). 6. Salt the water (optional): Add a generous pinch of salt to the water for seasoning. This step is optional, but it can enhance the flavor of the potatoes. 7. Add the potatoes to the pot: Carefully place the potatoes or potato pieces into the pot of cold water. Starting with cold water allows for even cooking from the inside out. 8. Bring to a boil: Turn the burner up to high heat, and bring the water to a rolling boil. Keep an eye on the pot as it reaches boiling, as it may bubble up and possibly overflow. 9. Lower heat and simmer: Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to medium or medium-low, ensuring that it maintains a steady simmer. Cover the pot with a lid to help maintain the temperature and accelerate cooking. 10. Check for doneness: Boil the potatoes until they are fork-tender. Cooking times will vary depending on the type and size of the potatoes. As a general guide: - Small, whole new potatoes or fingerlings usually take 12-15 minutes. - Quartered or diced Yukon Gold, red, or other waxy potatoes may take around 15-20 minutes. - Large, whole Russet or baking potatoes might take 20-25 minutes or more. 11. Drain the water: Once the potatoes are tender, carefully remove the pot from heat and pour the contents through a colander to drain the water. 12. Let the potatoes cool (if required): If you are planning to use the boiled potatoes in a salad or prefer them to be served cold, let them cool down for about 15-20 minutes before using. Otherwise, they can be served hot as a side dish or mashed with butter and milk for a delicious mashed potato dish. By following these detailed steps, anyone can easily learn how to boil potatoes and enjoy their favorite potato recipes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The man was hiding behind a bus shelter as if he was waiting to attack the officers, according to a law enforcement official, who said it almost appeared as if he was stalking them. The officers were posing for a photo when the man pounced, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said. He struck one officer in the right arm and another in the head, according to the commissioner. The two officers who weren't hit then shot at and killed the attacker. The law enforcement official identified the suspect as Zale H. Thompson, who had a criminal record in California and had been discharged from the Navy for misconduct, according to the source. The police officer who was struck in the head remains in critical but stable condition. The other officer, who is 24, was struck in the arm and was expected to be released soon. A 29-year-old bystander who was struck by a bullet in the lower back was also taken to a hospital. Her condition was not known. When asked if the unprovoked attack was tied to terrorism or to recent calls by radicals to attack military and police officers, Bratton said, \\"there is nothing we know as of this time that would indicate that were the case,\\" and a senior law enforcement official told CNN on Friday that investigators do not believe that Thompson, a Muslim convert, was driven by any radical Islamic views. Nevertheless, Bratton acknowledged concern because of recent attacks on uniformed officers. \\"I think certainly the heightened concern is relative to that type of assault based on what just happened in Canada,\\" he said. On Wednesday, Cpl. Nathan Cirillo was shot and killed as he stood guard at Canada's National War Memorial before shots erupted in the halls of the country's Parliament minutes later. The Ottawa gunman had \\"connections\\" to jihadists in Canada who shared a radical Islamist ideology, including at least one who went overseas to fight in Syria, multiple U.S. sources told CNN on Thursday. And on Monday, another Canadian soldier -- this one in Quebec -- was run over and killed by another man who the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Martine Fontaine said had been \\"radicalized.\\" New York put its officers on alert after Thursday's attack, urging them to \\"maintain a heightened level of awareness against random attacks,\\" several law enforcement officials said. It's not the only city so affected. Washington's Metropolitan Police Department has also \\"increased security levels and visibility, so the public should expect to see an enhanced presence\\" of officers in light of the Canada and New York attacks, spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump told CNN.

He is 61 years old and he did some naughty things in the past. Bronson knew another man named Ronnie Kray, who was once married to a lady named Kate. Bronson is very good at making pretty pictures on paper, which we call paintings. One day, he asked Kate if she could sell some of his paintings for him. Now, the reason Bronson wanted to sell his paintings was to say sorry to his mommy, Eira. She is 85 years old and he wanted to gift her a holiday. You know how nice it is to go on trips to see new places and relax? That's what Bronson wanted for his mommy. Bronson is also a big fan of a soccer team called Tottenham Hotspur. But one day, their rivals, Arsenal, won an important game called the FA Cup. It made Bronson very upset and angry. He did something very weird and naughty. He covered his body in butter, like the ones we put on our toast, and was not nice to 12 people who worked in the prison where he lives. The paintings that Bronson wants to sell show what he thinks and how his brain works. Some people say it's very interesting to see inside the mind of someone like him. He hopes that he can get about £5,000, which is a lot of money, from selling his paintings. Then he can use that money to make his mommy happy and send her on the fun trip.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who is a former real estate developer? ? Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ravens running back Ray Rice in court on Updated MAY 01, 2014 12:33p ET MAYS LANDING, N.J. -- Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice pleaded not guilty Thursday to assault charges stemming from an incident with his then-girlfriend in an Atlantic City casino elevator. His lawyer said Rice is \\"ashamed\\" and \\"sorry\\" about his conduct but would not specify exactly what Rice did. After the five-minute court hearing, Rice applied for New Jersey's pretrial intervention program, which allows for charges to be dismissed against first-time offenders who participate in the program and meet certain conditions. The county prosecutor will decide whether Rice is allowed to enter the program. If not, prosecutors have offered Rice a plea bargain that would spare him jail time if he participates in anger management counseling. \\"He's ashamed of his conduct and he's sorry for what he did,\\" attorney Michael Diamondstein told reporters outside the courthouse. *By clicking \\"SUBSCRIBE\\", you have read and agreed to the Fox Sports Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. \\"There was a disagreement between him and his wife,\\" Diamondstein said. \\"He made a mistake. He loves Janay and wants to move forward. This was a momentary lapse of reason.\\" Security video obtained by TMZ Sports shows Rice removing the motionless body of Janay Palmer from an elevator at Revel Hotel Casino on Feb. 15. She did not comment as the two walked into the courthouse. The couple married a day after Rice was indicted. If convicted, Rice could face three to five years in prison. The former Rutgers star walked to the courthouse holding hands with Palmer. He said he is a \\"happy father and a happy husband.\\" When asked by reporters what he hoped would happen, Rice responded, \\"for you all to have a blessed day.\\" Originally, Palmer and Rice were charged with simple assault, but the Atlantic County prosecutor's office reviewed the case and dropped the charge against Palmer. A grand jury lodged the more serious charge of aggravated assault against Rice. Through her lawyer, Palmer has indicated she does not want the case to proceed. But prosecutor Diane Ruberton said Palmer's cooperation is not crucial to it. \\"I'm confident with the evidence we have that I could secure a conviction at trial, with or without her,\\" Ruberton said. She said prosecutors have additional video evidence beyond what was published by the website, but she would not describe its contents. Ruberton said Rice's celebrity played no role in the case, adding that plea deals are routinely offered to defendants charged with third-degree crimes, as is the case with Rice. Diamondstein said he expects a decision on whether Rice will be allowed into pretrial intervention within the next few weeks. \\"He's an excellent candidate for it,\\" he said. \\"He's just a high-character individual. He's a good guy.\\" The conditions of pretrial intervention would include staying out of trouble for a year, as well as undergoing counseling and remaining gainfully employed, the attorney said. \\"They've been going to counseling and working on some of the issues they have,\\" Diamondstein said. \\"They're very happy.\\" Summary:","completion":"Ray Rice, a football player on the Baltimore Ravens, is in court because he was accused of hurting his then-girlfriend, Janay, in an elevator. He says he feels ashamed and sorry for what happened. Ray Rice is trying to join a special program that could help him avoid more trouble if he follows its rules. If he can't join the program, he can do anger management counseling instead of going to jail. If he's found guilty in court, he could go to jail for 3 to 5 years. Ray and Janay are now married, and she doesn't want the case to continue, but the prosecutor thinks they have enough evidence to move forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Long before the conflict began, many Syrians complained about high unemployment, widespread corruption, a lack of political freedom and state repression under President Bashar al-Assad, who succeeded his father, Hafez, in 2000. In March 2011, pro-democracy demonstrations inspired by the Arab Spring erupted in the southern city of Deraa. The government's use of deadly force to crush the dissent soon triggered nationwide protests demanding the president's resignation. As the unrest spread, the crackdown intensified. Opposition supporters began to take up arms, first to defend themselves and later to expel security forces from their local areas. Mr Assad vowed to crush \\"foreign-backed terrorism\\" and restore state control. The violence rapidly escalated and the country descended into civil war as hundreds of rebel brigades were formed to battle government forces for control of the country. In essence, it has become more than just a battle between those for or against Mr Assad. A key factor has been the intervention of regional and world powers, including Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Their military, financial and political support for the government and opposition has contributed directly to the intensification and continuation of the fighting, and turned Syria into a proxy battleground. External powers have also been accused of fostering sectarianism in what was a broadly secular state, pitching the country's Sunni majority against the president's Shia Alawite sect. Such divisions have encouraged both sides to commit atrocities that have not only caused loss of life but also torn apart communities, hardened positions and dimmed hopes for a political settlement. Jihadist groups have also seized on the divisions, and their rise has added a further dimension to the war. Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, which was known as al-Nusra Front until it announced it was breaking off formal ties with al-Qaeda in July 2016, is part of a powerful rebel alliance that controls much of the north-western province of Idlib. Meanwhile, so-called Islamic State (IS), which controls large swathes of northern and eastern Syria, is battling government forces, rebel brigades and Kurdish groups, as well as facing air strikes by Russia and a US-led multinational coalition. Thousands of Shia militiamen from Iran, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen say they are fighting alongside the Syrian army to protect holy sites. Russia, for whom President Assad's survival is critical to maintaining its interests in Syria, launched an air campaign in September 2015 with the aim of \\"stabilising\\" the government after a series of defeats. Moscow stressed that it would target only \\"terrorists\\", but activists said its strikes mainly hit Western-backed rebel groups. Six months later, having turned the tide of the war in his ally's favour, President Vladimir Putin ordered the \\"main part\\" of Russia's forces to withdraw, saying their mission had \\"on the whole\\" been accomplished. However, intense Russian air and missile strikes went on to play a major role in the government's siege of rebel-held eastern Aleppo, which fell in December 2016. Shia power Iran is believed to be spending billions of dollars a year to bolster the Alawite-dominated government, providing military advisers and subsidised weapons, as well as lines of credit and oil transfers. It is also widely reported to have deployed hundreds of combat troops in Syria. Mr Assad is Iran's closest Arab ally and Syria is the main transit point for Iranian weapons shipments to the Lebanese Shia Islamist movement Hezbollah, which has sent thousands of fighters to support government forces. The US, which says President Assad is responsible for widespread atrocities and must step down, has provided only limited military assistance to \\"moderate\\" rebels, fearful that advanced weapons might end up in the hands of jihadists. Since September 2014, the US has conducted air strikes on IS in Syria, but it has not intentionally attacked government forces. Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to counter the influence of its rival Iran, has been a major provider of military and financial assistance to the rebels, including those with Islamist ideologies. Turkey is another staunch supporter of the rebels, but it has also sought to contain US-backed Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) fighters who are battling IS in northern Syria, accusing the YPG of being an extension of the banned Turkish Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). In August 2016, Turkish troops backed a rebel offensive to drive IS militants out of one of the last remaining stretches of the Syrian side of the border not controlled by the Kurds. The UN says at least 250,000 people have been killed in the past five years. However, the organisation stopped updating its figures in August 2015. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, put the death toll at 310,000 in December 2016, while a think-tank estimated in February 2016 that the conflict had caused 470,000 deaths, either directly or indirectly. More than 4.8 million people - most of them women and children - have fled Syria. Neighbouring Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey have struggled to cope with one of the largest refugee exoduses in recent history. About 10% of Syrian refugees have sought safety in Europe, sowing political divisions as countries argue over sharing the burden. A further 6.3 million people are internally displaced inside Syria. The UN estimates it will need 3.4bn (Â£2.7bn) to help the 13.5 million people who will require some form of humanitarian assistance inside Syria in 2017. More than 7 million people are affected by food insecurity and 1.75 million children are out of school. The warring parties have compounded the problems by refusing humanitarian agencies access to many of those in need. Some 4.9 million people live in besieged or hard-to-reach areas. With neither side able to inflict a decisive defeat on the other, the international community long ago concluded that only a political solution could end the conflict. The UN Security Council has called for the implementation of the 2012 Geneva Communique, which envisages a transitional governing body with full executive powers \\"formed on the basis of mutual consent\\". Peace talks in early 2014, known as Geneva II, broke down after only two rounds, with the UN blaming the Syrian government's refusal to discuss opposition demands. A year later, the conflict with IS lent fresh impetus to the search for a political solution in Syria. The US and Russia persuaded representatives of the warring parties to attend \\"proximity talks\\" in Geneva in January 2016 to discuss a Security Council-endorsed road map for peace, including a ceasefire and a transitional period ending with elections. The first round broke down while still in the \\"preparatory\\" phase, as government forces launched an offensive around Aleppo. The talks resumed in March 2016, after the US and Russia brokered a nationwide \\"cessation of hostilities\\". But they collapsed the following month as fighting intensified. The fall of Aleppo means the government now controls Syria's four biggest cities. But large parts of the country are still held by other armed groups. Rebel fighters and allied jihadists are estimated to control about 15% of Syrian territory, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. US officials said in early December 2016 that there were 50,000 or more \\"moderate\\" rebels, concentrated in the north-western province of Idlib and the western Aleppo countryside. Rebels also control smaller areas in the central province of Homs, the southern provinces of Deraa and Quneitra, and the eastern Ghouta agricultural belt outside Damascus. Kurdish forces, who say they support neither the government nor the opposition, meanwhile control much of Syria's border with Turkey, as well as a large part of the country's north-east. And although they have suffered extensive losses in the past two years, IS militants still hold large parts of central and northern Syria, including the city of Raqqa.","completion":"The Syrian civil war began with pro-democracy protests in 2011 and has evolved into a complex conflict involving regional and world powers, opposition forces, the rise of jihadist groups, and the fight against the Islamic State.

Heat the olive oil in a skillet. Cook the garlic in the oil until it's golden. Remove the garlic from the pan, and use or store it.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Golden Garlic Infused Olive Oil: The Flavor Enhancer You Never Knew You Needed Introduction: Garlic and olive oil have been staples in culinary traditions for ages. This dynamic duo carries incredible flavor and numerous health benefits. Allow your taste buds to be tantalized by the delectable combination of these essential ingredients in this easy-to-make dish that will become your go-to option for elevating your meals. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of making golden garlic-infused olive oil. Step 1: Smash and Peel the Garlic Cloves To extract the full flavor of the garlic, start by smashing the cloves. This releases various aromatic compounds responsible for its distinctive fragrance, making your final dish even more delicious. To smash the cloves, you can use a broad knife or a garlic press. After smashing the cloves, peel off the skin, leaving the tender flesh beneath exposed, which aids in the overall cooking process. Step 2: Heat the Olive Oil in a Skillet Using a skillet, pour in the desired amount of olive oil. Heating the oil is essential before adding garlic to ensure it cooks evenly and does not remain raw or burn. Olive oil, known for its heart-healthy properties and luxurious taste, forms the perfect base to infuse garlic flavors. Adjust the heat to medium-low, allowing the oil to warm up without smoking or overheating. Step 3: Cook the Garlic in the Oil Until It's Golden Once the olive oil reaches its optimal temperature, gently add the smashed and peeled garlic cloves. Cooking the garlic on low heat is crucial as it prevents it from burning, which results in an unpleasant, bitter taste. Stir those fragrant cloves occasionally as they slowly change color. In roughly 5 to 7 minutes, the garlic will turn golden – the ideal point of doneness. Step 4: Remove the Garlic from the Pan After achieving the perfect golden color, use a slotted spoon or tongs to carefully remove the garlic cloves from the oil. Be cautious, as the oil will be hot. At this point, the garlic will not only taste delicious but will also have a tender, almost buttery texture that makes it ideal to use in various dishes. Step 5: Use or Store Your Golden Garlic-Infused Olive Oil Now that you have your golden garlic in hand, it can be used immediately in various dishes, such as pasta or mashed potatoes.

Which experiment would be less appropriate for case C, case A or case B? John wanted to charge his electronic gadgets remotely. To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C. Hint: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge.

Question: The ancient nations, people and languages of the enhanced Fertile Crescent will always refer to what? Is The Ancient Near East is a term of the 20th century intended to stabilize the geographical application of Near East to ancient history.[citation needed] a good answer to this question?","completion":"Answer: The ancient nations, people, and languages of the enhanced Fertile Crescent generally refer to the various civilizations and cultures that emerged and developed in the region broadly known as the Ancient Near East. This area, which extended from modern-day Iraq and Iran through parts of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt, has been termed the \\"Cradle of Civilization\\" due to the significant contributions of these societies to the development of agriculture, writing, religion, and urbanization. The Ancient Near East, as a term, indeed emerged in the 20th century as an attempt to clarify the geographical scope of \\"Near East\\" when studying ancient history. This phrase helps to distinctly describe the historical and cultural landscape of the area, rather than merely serving as a geographical reference. To provide a more comprehensive response to the initial question, it is worth considering some key civilizations, people, and languages that emerged in the Fertile Crescent and the broader Ancient Near East: 1. Sumerians: The Sumerians established one of the world's first advanced civilizations in present-day Iraq, and are credited with pioneering the use of cuneiform script, one of the earliest known forms of writing. Their language, Sumerian, is considered a language isolate with no known relations to other language families. 2. Akkadians: The Akkadians emerged as a Semitic-speaking people in the region of ancient Mesopotamia, which encompasses modern-day Iraq. Under the leadership of Sargon the Great, they forged one of the world's first empires, the Akkadian Empire. The Akkadian language became the lingua franca of the Ancient Near East for centuries. 3. Babylonians: The Babylonians rose to prominence in Mesopotamia after the fall of the Akkadian Empire. Their greatest ruler, Hammurabi, is famous for his Code of Hammurabi – one of the oldest known legal codes. The Babylonians spoke a variant of Akkadian known as Babylonian. 4. Assyrians: The Assyrians were a powerful and influential civilization in Mesopotamia, known for their military prowess and architectural achievements. The ancient Assyrians spoke Akkadian and later adopted Aramaic, another Semitic language, as their official language. 5. Hittites: The Hittites were an ancient Anatolian people who established a powerful empire in modern-day Turkey. They spoke an Indo-European language called Hittite and developed their own form of hieroglyphic script, known as Hittite hieroglyphs. 6. Canaanites and Phoenicians: These Semitic-speaking people inhabited the Levant region, which encompasses modern-day Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, and western parts of Syria and Jordan. The Phoenicians, in particular, were renowned seafarers and traders who established colonies throughout the Mediterranean. They are credited with the development of the Phoenician alphabet, which served as the basis for the Greek, Latin, and Hebrew scripts. 7. Ancient Egyptians: The civilization of ancient Egypt is renowned for its monumental achievements in architecture, art, and religious practices. The ancient Egyptians spoke an Afro-Asiatic language known as Egyptian and used a writing system called hieroglyphs. In conclusion, the ancient nations, people, and languages of the enhanced Fertile Crescent refer to the diverse and influential societies that emerged and interacted within the culturally rich region known as the Ancient Near East. These civilizations made significant contributions to human history, the remnants of which continue to shape our modern world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize the following: Use anywhere from 5 to 15 sheets, depending on how thick your paper is and how many pages you want your notebook to have. Try printer paper, loose leaf, cardstock, scrapbook paper, drawing paper, handmade paper, or a variety of paper types. Use a stiffer piece of cardstock for the cover, in the color of your choice. Saddle-stitched notebooks work best when they’re left thin. Avoid overstuffing your notebook since it won’t lay flat when it’s done. If you’re using lightweight paper like printer paper, feel free to use up to 15 sheets. For thicker papers, use only 5 or 6 sheets for your notebook. To determine how many pages your notebook will have, multiply the number of sheets you’re using by 2. Each piece of paper will be folded in half, so if you start with 8 sheets of paper you’ll have a 16-page notebook. If you want to use differently-sized sheets of paper or cardstock for the cover, trim the larger sheets down to the same size as the smaller ones using a paper cutter. If you want a rustic-looking notebook, some slight variations in size can look nice in the finished product. The soft edges of handmade paper can look especially pretty amongst other types of cut paper. If you want a neat and orderly notebook of all the same paper type, stick with a standard paper size so you don’t have to do any cutting. Place the sheets of paper in a stack on a cutting mat, then lay the cover on top. Arrange the stack so that the long sides run parallel to your body. Adjust the pages until the top, bottom, and sides are perfectly lined up beneath the cover. Place 2 binder clips on either side to hold the stack in alignment.

Kelvin is about to embark on an interstellar journey to a space station orbiting the remote oceanic planet Solaris. After decades of study, the scientific mission at the space station has barely progressed. The crew is sending confusing messages. Kelvin is dispatched to evaluate the situation aboard the ship and determine whether the venture should continue. Henri Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky), a former space pilot, visits Kelvin. They watch film footage of Berton's own testimony years before of seeing a four-meter-tall child on the ocean surface of Solaris while searching for two lost scientists. However, the cameras of his craft recorded only clouds and the flat ocean surface; Berton's report was dismissed as hallucinations. After failing to convince Kelvin of the reality of his experience, Berton angrily departs, only to contact Kelvin later via videophone from his private car. He explains that he met the child of a scientist lost on that mission, and the child was like a much smaller version of the one he had seen on Solaris. Before departing Earth for Solaris, Kelvin destroys most of his personal mementos in a bonfire, noting the volume of keepsakes he has accumulated. In Kelvin's last conversation with his father (Nikolai Grinko), they realize that the father will probably not live to see Kelvin return. Although he readily accepted the mission, it is a choice that weighs heavily upon Kelvin's conscience. Upon his arrival at Solaris Station,[10][11] a scientific research station hovering above the oceanic surface of the planet Solaris, none of the three remaining scientists bother to greet Kelvin, who finds the disarrayed space station dangerously neglected. He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan), had killed himself. The two surviving crewmen are uncooperative and evasive.

Summarize the following: Take a belt that fits well – either one that you already have or go to a clothing store and try on belts until you find one that fits the way you want it to. You want the belt to have several notches on each side of the notch you use. A belt that fits well won’t use the last notch or the first notch when it closes. Be sure to wear pants that fit you well so that you can get an accurate idea about what size belt you need if you’re trying on a variety of belts. Put the belt on a flat surface like a table or on the floor. Lay it down so that the belt is completely flat and doesn’t have any bumps sticking out. Make sure the belt is fully extended and doesn’t have any slack. If the belt doesn’t want to stay flat (because of overuse, for example), you can place a heavy object on both ends of the belt to keep it stationary. Grab a retractable measuring tape or a fabric measuring tape. Measure from the base of the buckle prong to the center hole. If you don’t use the center hole, measure from the base of the buckle prong to the hole you use the most. This number will probably range between 30 inches (76.2 cm) and 60 inches (152.4 cm), depending on your waist size. The number (in inches) that you found for the measurement of the belt will be the size you use for ordering your new belt. For example, if the measurement number is 34 inches (86.4 cm), order a size 34 belt. If you are using the last hole on a belt, consider moving up a belt size (in this example, to a 36) so that there is room to adjust the belt in the future. A correctly fitted belt is usually sized to the center hole. If you are using the first hole on the belt, consider moving down a belt size to a 32. Alternatively, you can use a pair of jeans that fits you (one that is measured numerically by waist size in inches) and use that measurement to determine your belt size. Simply add two inches to the size of the pants and use that as your belt size. Remember that the pants must already be sized in inches, otherwise this method won’t be effective.","completion":"To find the right belt size, wear good-fitting pants and pick a belt that fits you well.

Firstly I think the main plus point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, it is definitely the making of the film. I have seen lots of comments regarding the film being sickly sweet and overly slushy. In response to this, I think to a certain degree this is a correct analysis, however considering this is a Barjatya film I think that compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH, it has been toned down significantly. HSSH was almost unbearable to watch in some places. In this film however, when the sentimental moments come along, you find yourself smiling, wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to them. Another major plus point is the performances of Shahid and Amrita. Both have acted very well, especially Shahid who looks great in the film. Amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major star. Although I really enjoyed the film as a whole, I do feel that it was too long. Some of the middle could have been trimmed off and it would maybe made even more of an impact. I also think the music, although it fits into the film when you see the situations is slightly old fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more up-to-date soundtrack had been available. Although the picturisation of the songs Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein are wonderful.

The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.

Background: Rammstein (German pronunciation: ['RamStaIn]) is a German Neue Deutsche Harte band, formed in 1994 in Berlin. Throughout its existence, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged--lead guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe, bassist Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Riedel, drummer Christoph \\"Doom\\" Schneider, lead vocalist Till Lindemann, rhythm guitarist Paul H. Landers, and keyboardist Christian \\"Flake\\" Lorenz. The band helped to found a subgenre within German hard rock and metal that became known as Neue Deutsche Harte. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages including English, Spanish, French, and Russian. Context: Rammstein started recording Sehnsucht in November 1996 at the Temple Studios in Malta. The album was again produced by Jacob Hellner. \\"Engel\\", the first single from the album, was released on 1 April 1997 and reached gold status in Germany on 23 May. This prompted the release of a fan edition of the single, named Engel - Fan Edition. This contained two previously unreleased songs, \\"Feuerrader\\" and \\"Wilder Wein\\". Release of the second single from the album Sehnsucht was \\"Du hast\\", which hit the German single charts August 1997 at number 5. Rammstein then continued touring in the summer while Sehnsucht was released on 22 August 1997. The album reached number 1 in Germany after two weeks in the charts. Simultaneously, Herzeleid and both Sehnsucht singles (\\"Du hast\\" and \\"Engel\\") were in the Top 20 of the German charts. Rammstein continued to headline sold-out shows throughout Europe in September and October. On 5 December 1997, they embarked on their first tour of the United States as the opening act for KMFDM. In August 1998, the band released a cover of the song Stripped, originally released by Depeche Mode in early 1986; it was included on the tribute album For the Masses, the Rammstein version obtained moderate success in Germany and Austria. On 22-23 August 1998, Rammstein played to over 17,000 fans at the Wuhlheide in Berlin; the biggest show the band had played there up to that date. Supporting acts were Danzig, Nina Hagen, Joachim Witt and Alaska. The show was professionally filmed, intended to be released on their upcoming live DVD, Live aus Berlin. Rammstein embarked on a live tour with Korn, Ice Cube, Orgy and Limp Bizkit called the Family Values Tour in September through to late October 1998. Continuing their success in the US, Sehnsucht received Gold record status there on November 2. The band was nominated at the MTV European Music Awards for Best Rock Act and performed \\"Du hast\\" live on 12 November that year. Rammstein had further success in 1999, starting off the year in February with a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 41st-annual Grammy Awards. A year after it was filmed, the Live aus Berlin concert was released on CD on 30 August 1999, with a limited edition double CD also available. Two weeks after it was released, Live aus Berlin went to number one in the German Album Charts. On 13 September and 26 November 1999 the video and DVD versions of the concert were released respectively. Further popularity ensued with the inclusion of \\"Du hast\\" in The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picture. Question: Who produced it? Answer:","completion":"Sehnsucht, the album by Rammstein, was produced by Jacob Hellner. He worked with the band during the recording process that began in November 1996 at the Temple Studios in Malta. Hellner's involvement as a producer was crucial in shaping the band's signature sound, and he continued to work with Rammstein on several of their subsequent albums."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I think that my favorite part of this movie, the one that exemplifies the sheer pointless, stupidity and inanity of the proceedings, comes at the climax of the film. DOCTOR TED NELSON and his unmarried friend the Sheriff have finally cornered the Melting Man on a landing on some stairs in an electrical generating plant. Keep in mind that Nelson has been looking for the MM for nearly the entire film, and that the MM has killed and eaten several people at this point (including his boss), and Nelson is very aware that MM is violently insane and hungry for human flesh and blood. So the Sheriff has his gun pointed at MM, who is, and I give the movie and Rick Baker props for this, the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form that we have ever seen. And he yells a very important question to DOCTOR TED NELSON: \\"WHAT DO WE DO NOW?!?!?\\" The camera cuts over to DOCTOR TED NELSON, and it's obvious that Ted has no idea what to do next. Apparently Ted was so intent on the problem of FINDING the Melting Man, he never thought to bring along some restraining devices, a lasso, or straitjacket, or a net, or some tranquilizer darts, or maybe a New Age tape by Vangelis to soothe the savage beast. So the sheriff panics and shoots, the Melting Man goes berserk, and hilarity ensues. Maybe this explains why NASA has been screwing around with the Space Shuttle program in sub-lunar space for the last 30 years instead of going back to the Moon or out to Mars like everyone knows they OUGHT to be doing. I dunno. Anyway, that's the kind of lousy, lazy writing and direction that undercuts every aspect of this movie. It's hard to say how good the actors actually are, because the movie has complete contempt for their characters. Two other incredibly painful sequences also ramp up the stupidity of the proceedings: There is a scene featuring the lumpiest old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove, only to be torn apart by the Melting Man. This scene is a nadir in 70s cinema. I can guarantee you've never watched a more pointless and irritating setup with odder looking people in your entire life. And the Melting Man's assault on the lady who lives in the house where they keep a horse who pees on the walls defies every attempt to process it.(BTW, I think famous film director Jonathon Demme has a walk-on in this scene as the redneck husband who goes in first to check on the house and never comes out again). The only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that, as I said, their horse has apparently been peeing on it. And we are forced to watch her hysterics for at least two minutes longer than any SANE film director would hold the shot. Burr DeBenning ought to beat the crap out of IMM's director and photographer. I remember him from an old Columbo episode where he looked MUCH better than he does here - no one's idea of a leading man, but solid and unobtrusive. But no one could possibly be as unappealing in real life as his director makes him look here. Everyone else comes off a little better except for the old couple (and shut up, I know they were being played for laughs, but I ain't laughing!) but not much. This definitely falls into the 'So Bad You Can't Look Away' category of cinema disasters. Still, I'd watch it again before I'd watch a lot of other 70's and 80's abortions ( \\"Track of The Moonbeast\\" and \\"It Lives By Night\\" come to mind), and MST's coverage of it is great fun, so if you get a chance, watch the MST version.

Michael never wanted to be the center of attention.; 2. Ian never wanted to be the center of attention.;","completion":"Michael was outgoing but Ian was shy, so Ian never wanted to be the center of attention. In this sentence, the two individuals, Michael and Ian, possess contrasting personality traits. Michael is described as outgoing, which means he is sociable, friendly, and enjoys interacting with others. Such people typically feel comfortable in large groups and social gatherings, and they often have an extroverted nature. On the other hand, Ian is characterized as shy, suggesting that he is reserved, introverted, and possibly anxious in social situations. Such people often prefer spending time alone or in smaller, more intimate gatherings. They may find it difficult to assert themselves or engage in conversations with new people, and they are more likely to feel overwhelmed or awkward when surrounded by large groups. Given these descriptions, it is clear that Ian would be the one who never wanted to be the center of attention. People who are shy would generally prefer to stay on the sidelines and observe rather than actively participate in activities that would place them in the spotlight. They might dread public speaking, performing in front of others, or attracting attention to themselves in any way. In contrast, outgoing individuals like Michael would be more likely to enjoy and thrive in situations that highlight their social skills and extroverted nature. They might actively seek out opportunities to engage with others, whether through group activities, conversations, or public events. This sentence emphasizes the stark differences in personality and how those differences can influence and govern an individual's actions, preferences, and desires. While Michael seems to embrace social interactions and might be comfortable in the spotlight, Ian's shyness leads him to avoid situations that would place him at the center of attention. Overall, this highlights the complexity and diversity of human personality, as well as the unique ways in which individuals navigate and interact with the world around them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Your ficus needs well-draining soil, preferably peat mix, to prevent it from becoming waterlogged. Add soil until the pot is about 1/4 to 1/2 of the way full—you will fill it up completely as you transplant the ficus. You can buy well-draining soil mixes at most nurseries or garden centers. Check the packaging for \\"well-draining\\" or ask an employee for assistance. To check soil drainage, dig a 1 foot (0.30 m) hole into the dirt and fill it with water. If the soil drains completely within 5-15 minutes, it is well-draining soil. Make sure that the new pot also has a few holes in the bottom to aid drainage. Use your hands to loosen the root ball as much as you can without breaking it. This will help the ficus absorb more water and nutrients when you transplant it and adapt better to its new container. Position the ficus tree upright into the pot. Fill the rest of the pot with soil until you reach the soil level of the plant's original level. Don't make your soil level any higher than the original container, which can suffocate the roots. Ficus trees prefer temperatures of around 60–75 °F (16–24 °C), or around room temperature.

One soldier, Nathaniel Burke (Judd Nelson), decides to show just what Irons' weapons can do and sets one of Irons' sonic cannons at the highest power setting, firing the device at an abandoned building. However, the weapon backfires and destroys the building the team is situated in. Irons' partner, Susan \\"Sparky\\" Sparks (Annabeth Gish), is crushed by a large slab of concrete in the ensuing chaos. In court, Irons reveals Burke's role in the incident and Burke is dismissed from the military. Because his weapons resulted in Sparks becoming a paraplegic, Irons resigns in disgust. Meanwhile, Burke hatches a plot to sell Irons' weapons to criminal gangs, recruiting a video arcade manager to help him carry out this deed. Irons witnesses a bank robbery organized by gang members wielding Burke's modified guns; they escape before he can interrogate them on where they obtained the weapons. The gang does not tell Irons anything when confronted directly in their hideout. Irons visits Sparks in a veteran's hospital and takes her to his own assembled laboratory, where he hopes he and Sparks can create weapons needed to combat the criminals.

Too hard;","completion":"Humans have the ability to change how much they weigh, but we cannot change how tall we are because that is (III) hereditary. This statement highlights the idea that height is an inherited characteristic, which means that it is determined by our genetic makeup rather than environmental or lifestyle factors. Height is mainly determined by the genes that we inherit from our parents. When a baby is conceived, they receive half of their genetic information from each parent, and this genetic makeup determines numerous aspects of their physical appearance, including height. While both parents contribute to their child's height potential, it has been found that the father's height has a stronger influence on the height of the offspring, whereas the mother's height has a stronger influence on the rate of growth during childhood. Height is not solely dependent on genetics, as other factors such as nutrition, health, prenatal care, and hormonal imbalances can also influence a person's height. For example, proper nutrition – especially during childhood – is essential for optimal growth. A well-balanced diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and essential nutrients can help to support bone growth and development. However, unlike weight, which can be influenced by a combination of diet, exercise, and other lifestyle factors, height is generally perceived as a fixed characteristic that cannot be easily altered. There are some medical interventions, such as the administration of growth hormones or limb-lengthening surgeries, that may lead to minor changes in height. However, these treatments are typically reserved for individuals with specific growth-related disorders and are not considered viable options for the general population to change their height. In summary, we cannot change our height due to the hereditary nature of this characteristic. Height is mainly determined by the genes we inherit from our parents and is not something that can be influenced by lifestyle choices or practices to the degree that weight can. Therefore, it is categorized as a hereditary characteristic rather than a modifiable one."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A burlap sack, used to protect trees, or carry potatoes and coffee beans, is perfect for making a scarecrow head. To make a burlap head: Stuff one plastic grocery bag full of other plastic bags until you have the right size for a head. Place the bag in the center of a piece of burlap then cut a wide circle around it. There is no need to measure it or cut a perfect circle. Gather the burlap around the plastic bag, and place on top of the vertical pole (the scarecrow's neck) before tying tightly with twine or wire. Use a jack o' lantern to make a seasonal scarecrow head. First, choose a nice, round pumpkin. Cut a large, round hole on the top of the pumpkin (around the stem) and scoop out the insides. Use a sharp knife to cut out the facial features of your scarecrow. Skewer the bottom of the pumpkin onto the scarecrows neck and secure with glue or tape if necessary. Do not place a candle inside the pumpkin as you normally do with jack o' lanterns. The rest of the material used to make your scarecrow is flammable. Other vegetables, such as gourds and turnips, could also be used for this purpose. Be aware that pumpkins and other vegetables will eventually rot, so if you want your scarecrow head to last longer, consider using an alternative method. A pillowcase is another option for making a scarecrow head and is something which you are likely to have around the house. To make your scarecrow head with a pillowcase: Half fill the pillowcase with straw or the stuffing material of your choice. Pin the pillowcase with safety pins to prevent the stuffing from falling out the bottom, but don't close the bottom up entirely. Insert your scarecrow head onto the vertical pole (neck of the scarecrow). Push until the top of the pole is at the top of the pillowcase, right through the straw. Secure the pillowcase to the pole using twine or wire, then cut off the excess material and remove the safety pins. The are any number of possibilities when it comes to making your scarecrow's head. If you're trying to keep the cost of building your scarecrow down to a minimum, just use whatever items you have lying around. Here are some ideas: Pantyhose. Select a natural skin tone pair of pantyhose. Cut the upper part of the leg off on one side, tie a knot in it, and fill it with stuffing, letting it taper to a \\"neck\\" before tying the other (lower) end onto the vertical pole. Bucket. Impale a bucket filled with dirt right-side-up on the scarecrow's neck, for an unconventional yet functional head. Milk jugs. One-gallon plastic milk jugs are another great choice for scarecrow heads. Their smooth surface is perfect for drawing facial features on and is waterproof. You're also sure to have one or two lying around the house. Again, just impale on the vertical pole, and secure with glue or tape if necessary.

Fact 2: Parasites thrive on tissues in living hosts. Options: 1. Animals - Parasites can live on animals, as they can be hosts. 2. Skin - Skin is a part of an animal's tissue, so parasites can live on skin tissue. 3. Plants - Plants can be hosts for parasites as well. 4. Fungi - Fungi can also act as hosts for parasites. 5. Tissue - Fact 2 specifically mentions that parasites thrive on tissues in living hosts, making tissue the most accurate option so far. 6. Food - Food, per se, is neither a living host nor a tissue, so it's not a suitable option. 7. Bacteria - Bacteria can be hosts for parasites, but this doesn't address the \\"tissue\\" aspect mentioned in Fact 2. 8. Orchids - Orchids are a type of plant, so they can also be hosts for parasites.

Article: Last week, my granddaughter started kindergarten, and I wished her every success. But part of me didn't. I actually wanted her to fail in some ways because I believe that failure can be good for our learning process. Success is proving that you can do something that you already know you can do, or doing something correctly the first time, which can often be a problematic victory. First-time success is usually a fluke . First-time failure, by contrast, is expected to be the natural order of things. Failure is how we learn. In Africa they describe a good cook as \\"She who has broken many pots.\\" If you've spent enough time in the kitchen to have broken a lot of pots, probably you know a fair amount about cooking. I once had dinner with a group of cooks, and they spent time comparing knife wounds and burn scars. They knew how much credibility their failures gave them. I earn my living by writing a daily newspaper column. Each week I am aware that one column I write is going to be the worst column. I try my best every day. I have learned to cherish that column. A successful column usually means that I am discussing my familiar topic, writing in a style I am used to or saying the same things as anyone else but in a fancy way. My younger daughter is a trapeze artist. She spent three years putting together a show, and she did it successfully for years. There was no reason for her to change it but she did anyway. She said she was no longer learning anything new and she was bored. And if she was bored, there was no point in subjecting (......) her body to all that stress. She risked failure and great public embarrassment in order to feed her soul. My granddaughter is a perfectionist. She will feel her failures, and I will want to comfort her. But I will also, I hope, remind her of what she learned, and how she can do better next time. I hope I can tell her, though, that it's not the end of the world. Indeed, with luck, it is the beginning. Question: The writer talked about his own experience to show that _ .

What's the best answer to this question: is new zealand part of the australia continent?","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"Is New Zealand part of the Australia continent?\\" is no, New Zealand is not part of the Australian continent. New Zealand is located on the separate, submerged continent of Zealandia. While they are both part of the Oceanian sub-region known as Australasia, geographically and continent-wise, they are distinct. New Zealand and Australia share a close geographical proximity and cultural similarities, which sometimes leads to confusion about their continental relationship. However, it is important to note that they are situated on two different continental masses. The Australian continent primarily includes mainland Australia, Tasmania, and some smaller coastal islands. On the other hand, Zealandia, a largely submerged continental fragment, consists of New Zealand's North Island, South Island, and numerous smaller islands such as Stewart Island. Both New Zealand and Australia belong to the greater Oceania region, which is a broader area comprising numerous island nations, territories, and the three sub-regions of Australasia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Oceania spans across the Pacific Ocean, largely covering the islands to the east of the Australia continent, New Zealand, and New Guinea. Although New Zealand and Australia are part of the same region, Oceania, they remain separate when it comes to the continents they occupy. In summary, New Zealand is not part of the Australia continent, as it is situated on the distinct continent of Zealandia. The two countries fall under the Australasia sub-region within the expansive Oceania region that encompasses numerous island nations in the Pacific Ocean.

Would \\"The activity is popular in many places with large snowfields, primarily Northern Europe , Canada , and Alaska .\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","completion":"Cross-country skiing is a versatile winter sport with various styles and techniques, making it accessible to participants with different preferences and skill levels. The main types of cross-country skiing are: 1. Classic skiing: This is the traditional form of cross-country skiing and is typically performed on groomed trails with parallel tracks. Skiers propel themselves forward using a diagonal stride technique, alternating their arms and legs in a smooth, coordinated motion. 2. Skating (or freestyle): Skating is a more recent technique resembling ice-skating, with skiers using outward V-shaped strides to push off each ski's inside edge. It is typically faster than classic skiing and requires well-prepared, smooth, wide snow surfaces. 3. Telemark skiing: This style combines elements of cross-country and alpine skiing, using free-heel bindings and a distinctive lunging motion known as the \\"telemark turn\\" to navigate downhill terrain. Telemark skiing is more challenging and physically demanding than classic or skating styles. 4. Backcountry (or off-trail) skiing: Backcountry skiing refers to cross-country skiing outside of groomed trails, often in more remote, mountainous areas. This style requires wider, more robust skis and can involve breaking trail through deep, fresh snow or navigating steep, ungroomed descents. 5. Ski touring: Ski touring is an extended form of cross-country skiing, often involving multi-day trips where skiers travel long distances through changing terrain. This can encompass various skiing styles, such as classic, skating, or backcountry skiing, depending on the environment and specific routes chosen. 6. Nordic skiing: Nordic skiing is a broader term encompassing various types of skiing, including cross-country skiing, telemark skiing, and ski jumping. It refers to skiing styles originating from the Nordic countries (Finland, Sweden, and Norway). As for your statement, \\"The activity is popular in many places with large snowfields, primarily Northern Europe, Canada, and Alaska,\\" it is a reasonable answer to describe the general locations where cross-country skiing is popular.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the title of the song whose central rift is in NWOBHM fashion? Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity....

Objective: To test a homemade facial mask in an inconspicuous spot in case of irritation Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Choose from: *A spot on your forehead; *A spot on below your ears;","completion":"When considering naive physics reasoning, it's important to evaluate the simplicity and practicality of a solution without diving too deep into scientific principles. In this case, we'll evaluate the two options for an inconspicuous spot to test a homemade facial mask in case of irritation: a spot on your forehead and a spot below your ears. 1. A spot on your forehead: Pros: - The forehead is an accessible area, making it easier to apply the facial mask. - You can see the test area directly, which allows for easy monitoring of any potential irritation or changes. Cons: - While this area is not prominently visible to other people, the forehead is still part of the face and generally within the field of view. It may be hard to hide the test area from others. - The skin on the forehead can be more oily in some people and might not be representative of how the mask would work on other areas of the face. 2. A spot below your ears: Pros: - This area is less visible as it's under your ear area and can be easily covered by hair or clothing. - The skin below the ears can have a similar thickness and sensitivity as other areas of the face. Cons: - It might be slightly more challenging to apply the mask to this area and to monitor any changes. - Access to this area might be limited due to the position below the ears. After analyzing the pros and cons of both options based on naive physics reasoning, it can be concluded that testing a homemade facial mask in a spot below your ears is the more sound solution. This is primarily because this area is less visible and can be easily hidden by hair or clothing, making it a more inconspicuous spot. Additionally, the skin in this area is more likely to have a similar thickness and sensitivity to other areas of the face, which can provide more accurate results regarding potential irritation or adverse reactions. Although applying the mask and monitoring the area might be slightly more challenging, this option is overall more practical and safer, taking potential allergies or irritation into account."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At first I was going to say giving them daily chores, but the “reward” part of that has actually not been realized yet (what with all the eye rolling and such). So I will have to go with family dinners at the table. Sometimes, “dinner” is fast food, sometimes it is a meal I slaved over for hours - that part doesn’t seem to matter. Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on. But when I look at that worn oak (outdated) table, that needs refinishing in the worst way - I am grateful for the evenings there, where my kiddos learned to be a family. Don’t be misled, we are not the Cleavers. We have “Fun Friday” where Mom does not get to badger them about their table manners (ugh - they revel in this), Sometimes we eat in the living room while we watch a movie, sometimes we eat in shifts because of our schedules. However, the majority of meals have been together ~ I feel like this is a gift we gave them. Question: What kind of discussions were had at the dinner table at times? Options: A.

Basic photo editing software is often sufficient if you only plan on creating simple collages, but it may not provide the right sort of tools needed to create more complex designs. If you use photo editing software you already have, you save on expense. Some special photo collage software is free, but the highest quality options do cost money and can be fairly expensive. Creating a photo collage with basic photo editing software can be labor intensive and time consuming. Special photo collage software often comes with templates and tools that make collage creation easier. Every program you might consider using has different tools, so you will need to look up a specific guide for your software in order to learn how to use it effectively. Begin by searching through the software help files or the software's instruction manual. If you find nothing within the help files, search the Internet. Tutorials can come in all-text form, pictorial form, or as video tutorials. Browse through a variety until you find one that seems helpful. Many programs allow you to undo your changes if you decide later that you do not like them, but just in case, it helps to save your collage each time you feel satisfied with your progress. That way, you can return to an earlier version if you later decide that you do not like the most recent changes you made to your collage. Saving frequently also helps to prevent you from losing your work. The quality of a digital collage can be dramatically affected by the quality of the paper you print it on. Standard printer paper is light and has a poor effect. You should at least consider using cardstock or photo paper.

To learn your chosen software effectively, search help files, instruction manuals, or online tutorials in various formats. Save your work frequently to avoid losing progress and to backtrack if needed. Print your digital collage on high-quality paper with a high-quality printer for the best result.

Question: \\"Which act granted occupied countries sovereignty?\\" Context: \\"The six Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe, while nominally independent, were widely recognized in the international community as the Soviet satellite states. All had been occupied by the Soviet Red Army in 1945, had Soviet-style socialist states imposed upon them, and had very restricted freedom of action in either domestic or international affairs. Any moves towards real independence were suppressed by military force – in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Prague Spring in 1968. Gorbachev abandoned the oppressive and expensive Brezhnev Doctrine, which mandated intervention in the Warsaw Pact states, in favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of allies – jokingly termed the Sinatra Doctrine in a reference to the Frank Sinatra song \\"My Way\\".\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The specific act that granted occupied countries sovereignty and led to greater independence for the Warsaw Pact countries in Eastern Europe was not a single act, but rather a series of events and policies introduced by the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during the mid to late 1980s. His reformist policies, particularly those aimed at liberalizing political structures and promoting greater autonomy for Soviet satellite states, were critical in paving the way for these nations to eventually gain their sovereignty. Gorbachev's policy of Glasnost, which means \\"openness\\" in Russian, was introduced in 1985 as a way to encourage transparency, freedom of information, and political liberalization within the Soviet Union. This policy led to a relaxation of censorship and greater public discussion of political and social issues, ultimately allowing for the open expression of dissatisfaction with the existing regime. Simultaneously, Gorbachev introduced the policy of Perestroika, which translates to \\"restructuring.\\" This policy aimed to overhaul and decentralize the Soviet economy and governance, with the ultimate goal of making the Soviet system more efficient, flexible, and modern. As part of Perestroika, Gorbachev reduced the power of central government authorities, giving more decision-making power to local and regional governments. These policies and the gradual withdrawal of Soviet military and political control in Eastern Europe prompted a series of movements and uprisings in the region. In 1989, events such as the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, and the Romanian Revolution marked dramatic shifts in political power as various Warsaw Pact countries began to take control of their own destinies. Perhaps the most significant aspect of Gorbachev's approach to Eastern Europe was his abandonment of the Brezhnev Doctrine, which had essentially dictated that the Soviet Union would use force if necessary to prevent Warsaw Pact countries from deviating from the socialist path. Gorbachev, instead, embraced what became known as the Sinatra Doctrine, in reference to Frank Sinatra's song \\"My Way.\\" This doctrine signaled a policy of non-intervention, allowing Warsaw Pact countries greater autonomy in determining their own political destinies. As a result of these reforms and the broader changes in the geopolitical landscape, the eventual dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union itself occurred in 1991. The former occupied countries in Eastern Europe could now fully assert their sovereignty and establish their own political, social, and economic systems. While not attributable to a single act, Gorbachev's reformist policies played a vital role in granting sovereignty to the occupied countries of Eastern Europe and ultimately reshaping the region's political landscape."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) did not officially acknowledge the involvement of special forces, issuing a press release which made no mention of the SAS, but when it was made public that Brad Tinnion was a Lance Bombardier originally from 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, it became clear to experts that Tinnion had been serving with special forces. Operation Barras was Tinnion's first operational deployment as an SAS trooper.Also confirmed to have died in the operation were 25 West Side Boys, although the true figure is probably far higher. The gang's resistance was stronger than had been expected and there was speculation that more bodies lay undiscovered in the jungle. Several other West Side Boys were captured, while others fled into the jungle. Many of those who fled later surrendered to Jordanian peacekeepers. The Jordanians had received 30 by the end of the day, and 371—including 57 children—had surrendered within a fortnight of Operation Barras, to which Julius Spencer, Sierra Leone's Minister for Information, declared that the West Side boys were \\"finished as a military threat\\". Some of those who surrendered went on to volunteer for the new Sierra Leone Army and those who were accepted went into the British-run training programme. Kallay, the gang's leader, recorded a message for broadcast on Sierra Leonean radio urging the remaining West Side Boys to surrender to UNAMSIL.

People who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures. There are over 600,000 registered migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand, and millions more work illegally. Burmese migrant workers account for 80% of Thailand's migrant workers. Population density is 76 per square kilometre (200/sq mi), among the lowest in Southeast Asia.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the 2014 Myanmar Census, there are significant portions of workers in various sectors and locations. With a population of 51,419,420, we can infer that a substantial number of people are employed in different industries throughout the country. The census includes an estimated 1,206,353 persons in northern Rakhine State, Kachin State, and Kayin State who were not counted, implying that the actual worker population may be even higher. Additionally, it is important to note that people who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures, which further suggests that the total number of workers from Myanmar could be greater than the mentioned population. One prominent location where a significant portion of Myanmar's workers can be found is in Thailand. There are over 600,000 registered migrant workers from Myanmar in the country, and millions more are working there illegally. Burmese migrant workers account for a whopping 80% of Thailand's migrant worker population. This massive presence of Myanmar's workers in Thailand demonstrates the significant contribution of Burmese citizens to Thailand's economy and workforce. Within Myanmar itself, workers are likely distributed across various industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, services, and construction. The country has a population density of 76 per square kilometer (200/sq mi), which is among the lowest in Southeast Asia. This low population density suggests that people are spread out across the country, working in different sectors and regions. Agriculture has traditionally been the backbone of Myanmar's economy, employing a large percentage of the population. With its fertile soils and abundant natural resources, Myanmar has been able to support a predominantly agricultural-based workforce that grows rice, pulses, beans, and other crops, as well as engaging in livestock rearing and fisheries-related jobs. The manufacturing sector in Myanmar has also been expanding with the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in the textile and garment, food processing, and construction industries. Consequently, a significant number of workers are employed in these manufacturing operations. The services sector also employs a large segment of the population, with jobs in areas such as education, healthcare, and hospitality catering to both the domestic and international markets. Additionally, the growing tourism industry has contributed to increased opportunities for those employed in the service sector. Construction is another sector that boasts a significant portion of Myanmar's workforce. With continuous investments in infrastructure development, such as transport, energy, and urban improvements, the demand for skilled and unskilled laborers has risen. In summary, there are significant portions of workers from Myanmar both within the country and abroad, particularly in Thailand. These workers are employed in various sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, services, and construction, contributing to the overall economic growth and development of Myanmar and its neighboring countries."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Taking the above analysis into account: Answer: Maybe Although the review contains positive language, it is not clear enough to provide a strong recommendation. Therefore, a \\"Maybe\\" recommendation is more appropriate, indicating the app could be worth trying, but further information is needed before making a confident recommendation to a friend."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who dies in Terry's arms? Terry asks his boss's wife Sylvia to his apartment after an office party and the two go to bed. Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window. At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms. He takes refuge with Denise, who first seduces him and then offers him a chance to redeem himself. She wants revenge, and with him devises a plot to provoke Carl into another attack. Disguising herself, she goes to a bar where Carl is drinking and signals her availability. Terry follows her as she leaves to go home and, when Carl attacks, the two are able to repel him. He escapes, only to be caught by the police who Terry forewarned. Answer:","completion":"Sylvia"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Question: What does Joe teach his students about love? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Enduring Love Context: One fine spring afternoon, Joe (Daniel Craig) and his girlfriend Claire (Samantha Morton) get away for a romantic picnic in the countryside near Oxford. Joe pauses before he surprises Claire by producing a bottle of Dom Perignon. The moment appears portentous, but before Joe can pop the cork and say whatever is on his mind, a huge red hot-air balloon drifts onto the field.A young boy cowers in the basket of the balloon which is being dragged along the ground quickly while an older man, his grandfather, trails behind, pulling on one of the ropes and urging the frightened boy to jump out. Joe races to assist, and he is joined by several other men coming from all directions. It looks like they've got the situation under control, but before the boy can climb out of the basket, the wind picks up, setting the balloon suddenly aloft; the men hang on reflexively. As the balloon rises higher and higher, four men let go one by one, tumbling safely to the ground. They recover from their panic only to realise that one man never let go and is now dangling from the end of a rope hundreds of feet in the air, the balloon still rising and floating away from the field. The group watch in helpless horror as the man finally loses his grip and falls to his death in the distance.While the onlookers all gape in shock, Joe, rational and practical to a fault, decides to walk over to where the man fell and see if anything can be done. One of the men from the group (Rhys Ifans) follows behind him. A grisly sight awaits Joe and the other man, and it is immediately obvious that the man who fell is quite beyond assistance. The man who tagged along suggests that Joe pray with him. Joe resists, grumbling that prayers won't help, but the other man pleads with him until he finally kneels down. Eventually the authorities arrive and everyone leaves the tragic scene.Shortly afterwards, Joe and Claire are dining at the home of their married friends Robin (Bill Nighy) and Rachel (Susan Lynch), retelling the story of what happened on that fateful...

Choices: - after excretion - before digestion - after digestion - during digestion A: The answer is:","completion":"- during digestion Nutrients are absorbed into the body during the process of digestion. To fully understand this process, it's essential to break down the stages of digestion and see how nutrient absorption occurs throughout these stages. 1. Ingestion: The process of digestion begins with ingestion, which is the consumption of food. The food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that start breaking down carbohydrates. 2. Movement into the stomach and gastric digestion: The partially broken down food, called a bolus, moves from the mouth into the esophagus and then into the stomach. In the stomach, it is mixed with gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid and enzymes, such as pepsin, to break down proteins. This process creates a semi-liquid substance called chyme. 3. Movement into the small intestine and intestinal digestion: Chyme moves from the stomach into the small intestine, where it is mixed with pancreatic juices containing enzymes that break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. In addition, bile from the liver and gallbladder helps emulsify and digest fats. 4. Nutrient absorption: It is during intestinal digestion in the small intestine where most of the nutrient absorption occurs. The inner lining of the small intestine, called the mucosa, is covered in finger-like structures called villi. These villi increase the surface area for absorption and contain specialized cells called enterocytes that transport nutrients into the bloodstream. Here's a breakdown of nutrient absorption during digestion: - Carbohydrates: Broken down into simple sugars like glucose, which are absorbed through the enterocytes and transported into the bloodstream. - Proteins: Broken down into amino acids and small peptides, which are also absorbed through enterocytes and then transported into the bloodstream. - Fats: Broken down into fatty acids and glycerol, which are absorbed through the enterocytes and transported into the lymphatic system before entering the bloodstream. - Vitamins and minerals: Absorbed through the enterocytes via passive diffusion or active transport, depending on the specific nutrient. 5. Movement into the large intestine and water absorption: Finally, the indigestible components of the food, such as fiber, move into the large intestine, where water is absorbed, and the remaining waste is formed into feces. In conclusion, nutrients are absorbed into the body during digestion, primarily in the small intestine, where specialized cells called enterocytes transport nutrients into the bloodstream. This complex process ensures that the body receives the essential nutrients it needs for energy, growth, and overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You can find it on buildings, street signs and trash cans from Tokyo to Paris, from Moscow to Cape Town. Street art has become a global culture and even art museums are collecting the works of street artists. People have different opinions about street art. Some think it is bad, but others think it is a very beautiful new culture. Street art began in New York in the 1960s. This style of drawing and writing became know as graffiti. Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. One well-known New York street artist is Swoon. She cuts paper pictures of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start as street artist. She studied art but, later, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. Nowadays the Internet has a big influence on street art. Artists can show their pictures to people around the world. Many people in the city, however, say that seeing a picture on the Internet is never as good as seeing it live . Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? Options: A: The people in New York like Swoon's works. B: The Internet has little influence on street art. C: Young people all think street art is a very beautiful new culture.

Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do bighorns' hollow hairs do?\\" is \\"plant growth is reduced\\", given that bighorns' hollow hair prevents heat loss? Choices: (I) Yes. (II) No. Answer:","completion":"(II) No. The right answer to the question \\"what do bighorns' hollow hairs do?\\" is not \\"plant growth is reduced\\" given that bighorns' hollow hair prevents heat loss. Bighorns, also known as bighorn sheep, have this unique hair structure that serves as an insulation mechanism to help them survive in their natural habitat. Bighorn sheep live in mountainous regions in North America, where they face extreme weather conditions and temperatures. To combat these environmental conditions, they have developed specialized adaptations, such as hollow hairs, in order to maintain their body heat and overall well-being. Hollow hairs are a type of hair structure found in the coat of bighorn sheep. These hairs are filled with air, which acts as a good insulator, helping the animal to minimize heat loss and maintain an appropriate internal body temperature. This insulation provided by hollow hairs contributes to their ability to withstand the cold in their natural environment. These hollow hairs are a crucial feature for bighorn sheep in their survival, as they provide essential protection against harsh weather conditions such as cold, wind, and moisture. Additionally, their unique hair structure helps to regulate the sheep's body temperature, enabling them to survive in various climates and elevations. Although the hollow hairs of bighorn sheep do not directly impact plant growth, it's important to note that bighorns play a role in their ecosystem. They graze on a variety of plants, and their grazing patterns may influence plant growth indirectly. However, connecting their hollow hair specifically to the reduction of plant growth would not be accurate. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question \\"what do bighorns' hollow hairs do?\\" is not \\"plant growth is reduced.\\" Instead, the primary function of bighorns' hollow hairs is to insulate the animal and prevent heat loss, ensuring their survival in challenging environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"\\"Playing around\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because it refers to a light and informal form of fun, often physical, which complements the act of wrestling mentioned in the question. Here is a step-by-step justification of choosing \\"playing around\\" as an answer: 1. Read the question and understand the context: The question describes two individuals wrestling and having fun. Thus, we're looking for an answer that continues the description of a playful, lighthearted interaction. 2. Eliminate inappropriate options: We can exclude these answers: - \\"making things\\" and \\"constructing\\" as they relate to creation or building, which is not consistent with the playful wrestling context. - \\"hug\\" and \\"kiss\\" are actions showing affection, but they don't necessarily suggest an extension of the playful, fun activity of wrestling. 3. Identify the most suitable answer: \\"playing around\\" fits well with the wrestling and fun context as it refers to casual, lighthearted, and often physical, activity that two people may engage in together. Thus, \\"playing around\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it highlights an informal and playful interaction consistent with the given context of two people wrestling and having fun."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: \\"Latinos are perceived to be on what in regards to negative stereotypes?\\" Context: \\"According to a study by Dr. Paul Brest, Hispanics or \\"Latinos\\" include immigrants who are descendants of immigrants from the countries comprising Central and South America. In 1991, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans made up 80% of the Latino population in the United States. Latinos are disadvantaged compared to White Americans and are more likely to live in poverty. They are the least well educated major ethnic group and suffered a 3% drop in high school completion rate while African Americans experienced a 12% increase between 1975-1990. In 1990, they constituted 9% of the population, but only received 3.1% of the bachelors's degrees awarded. At times when it is favorable to lawmakers, Latinos were considered \\"white\\" by the Jim Crow laws during the Reconstruction. In other cases, according to Paul Brest, Latinos have been classified as an inferior race and a threat to white purity. Latinos have encountered considerable discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and education. Brest finds that stereotypes continue to be largely negative and many perceive Latinos as \\"lazy, unproductive, and on the dole.\\" Furthermore, native-born Latino-Americans and recent immigrants are seen as identical since outsiders tend not to differentiate between Latino groups.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Latinos, including Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans, are often perceived negatively due to prevailing stereotypes. According to Dr. Paul Brest's study, these stereotypes tend to portray Latinos as \\"lazy, unproductive, and on the dole.\\" This means that they are generally seen as unproductive members of society, dependent on public assistance, and uninterested in contributing positively to the community. These stereotypes can be attributed to historical discrimination and social disparities experienced by this particular demographic group. Latinos have faced substantial discrimination in various aspects of life, such as employment, housing, and education. In terms of education, Latinos are the least well-educated major ethnic group in the United States. Between 1975 and 1990, the high school completion rate for Latinos dropped by 3%, while African Americans experienced a 12% increase. In 1990, though they constituted 9% of the population, Latinos received only 3.1% of the bachelor's degrees awarded. This educational disparity often leads to increased poverty rates and further marginalization, reinforcing negative stereotypes. Additionally, many people do not differentiate between native-born Latino-Americans and recent immigrants, which could lead to a homogenization of perceptions and stereotypes regardless of individual circumstances. The historical context of Jim Crow laws during the Reconstruction period, where Latinos were sometimes considered \\"white\\" and at other times classified as an inferior race, also contributes to the complex perception of this ethnic group. Overall, Latinos are often perceived negatively due to the impact of historical discrimination, social disparities, and stereotypes, which continue to persist in various aspects of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? enjoyably","completion":"Based on the single word \\"enjoyably\\" that you provided, it is quite challenging to fully determine whether the review is positive or negative as the word is taken out of full context. However, the isolated word itself, \\"enjoyably\\", generally has a positive connotation. Delving a bit into semantics, \\"enjoyably\\" is an adverb that is derived from the verb \\"enjoy,\\" which means to take pleasure or joy in something, indicating satisfaction or a positive experience. Consequently, if a movie is described as \\"enjoyable,\\" it could be assumed that the reviewer took pleasure in watching it, suggesting a positive outlook. Nevertheless, a review typically contains more details and context that would help to definitively determine whether its opinion of the movie is positive or negative. The single word 'enjoyably' could be used in various contexts, some of which might not be positive. For example, if this word were used in a sentence like \\"The film was enjoyably bad,\\" the overall sentiment might be more negative, despite the use of 'enjoyably'. In conclusion, while the word 'enjoyably' usually has a positive connotation, without more context, it's difficult to make a definitive call regarding the overall sentiment of the review. A larger section or the full review would provide better insight into the reviewer's overall opinion. For future reference, when examining a review's sentiment, it's important to consider the full statement or piece since individual words can sometimes be misleading when taken out of their original context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Joe Jackson Gibbs (born November 25, 1940) is a former American football coach, current NASCAR Championship team owner, and former NHRA team owner. He was the 20th and 26th head coach in the history of the Washington Redskins (1981-1992, 2004-2007). Well known for his long hours and work ethic, Gibbs constructed what Steve Sabol has called, \\"The most diverse dynasty in NFL history\\", building championship teams with many players who have had mediocre to average careers while playing for other NFL teams. During his first stint in the National Football League, he coached the Redskins for 12 seasons and led them to eight playoff appearances, four NFC Championship titles, and three Super Bowl titles. Context: Although Gibbs helped craft a passing-oriented attack during his time in San Diego, his Redskins teams were known to incorporate a smash-mouth, rushing-oriented attack like the counter trey. By building a strong offensive line (known as \\"The Hogs\\") Gibbs was able to control the line of scrimmage, allowing workhorse running backs such as John Riggins, George Rogers, and Earnest Byner to power the ground game. Gibbs added a deep passing attack to this which complemented the ground game, utilizing agile receivers such as Art Monk, Gary Clark, and Ricky Sanders. Gibbs' offense was aided during his tenure by aggressive defensive units under the direction of defensive coordinator Richie Petitbon. Gibbs' system and offensive scheme were robust enough to be successful without a Hall-of-Fame-caliber quarterback at the helm. The Redskins' Super Bowl victories were won featuring Joe Theismann, Doug Williams, and Mark Rypien--capable players who were very successful along with their strong supporting cast. Gibbs is credited with inventing the single back, double or triple tight end set. He used it to neutralize Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor, realizing that to successfully block him with a running back was impossible; an extra tight end and a tackle were required as well. The extra tight end provided additional protection for the quarterback. Gibbs was also credited for creating the Trips formation; stacking three wide receivers to one side. Gibbs incorporated the shifting and motions for which his offenses were known. The formations created mismatches and confusion for the opposing defenses that would then be exploited. He is also one of few coaches that utilized the H-back position prominently in his offense. Question: How has Joe Gibbs style of play been described? Answer:","completion":"Joe Gibbs' style of play has been described as a diverse, robust and adaptive offensive scheme that incorporated a smash-mouth, rushing-oriented attack, such as the counter trey, with a deep passing game.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two animal collectors met online to talk about trading animals. Greg was a reptile collector and owned most reptile species. Danny collected rare birds but was thinking about buying some reptiles. and a hint : Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull.

A: Answer:","completion":"When heat flows into an object, its thermal energy increases, and so does its temperature. This rise in temperature is due to the increase in the average kinetic energy of its particles, such as atoms or molecules, which vibrate or move more rapidly as they absorb the heat. The temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these particles, and the higher the temperature, the more thermal energy an object contains. Additionally, depending on the material and its state, this increase in thermal energy may also result in changes in its size (thermal expansion), phase (solid to liquid or liquid to gas), or other physical properties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process of respiration and gas exchange, as outlined in the question, is the inhalation of air containing oxygen. As we breathe in, oxygen-rich air is drawn into our respiratory system to begin the essential process of supplying the cells in our body with the oxygen they require for cellular respiration and ultimately, to sustain our life. To provide a more comprehensive understanding, let us delve deeper into the entire process: 1. Inhalation: During inhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles (between the ribs) contract, leading to an expansion of the chest cavity and a decrease in air pressure within it. This creates a pressure gradient that causes air to be drawn into the nose or mouth, where tiny hairs called cilia and mucus aid in filtering out any dust or foreign particles. 2. Trachea and bronchial tubes: The filtered air then travels down the trachea, which divides into two primary bronchial tubes. These tubes branch into smaller secondary bronchi, which further divide into tertiary bronchi and eventually into bronchioles. These passageways warm and moisten the air and conduct it into the lungs. 3. Alveoli and gas exchange: At the end of the bronchioles are tiny air sacs called alveoli, which are surrounded by networks of capillaries. The alveoli are responsible for the exchange of gases between the air and the bloodstream. Oxygen present in the inhaled air diffuses through the alveolar walls and passes into the surrounding capillaries, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. Concurrently, carbon dioxide, a waste product from cellular respiration, diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be expelled. 4. Oxygen transport: Oxygen-rich blood is then transported to the heart, where it is pumped through the circulatory system to provide oxygen to all the cells in the body. The oxygen molecules are used by cells to produce energy through the process of cellular respiration, in which they convert glucose and oxygen into carbon dioxide, water, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 5. Carbon dioxide removal: As part of the cellular respiration process, cells produce carbon dioxide as a waste product. This carbon dioxide is transported back to the lungs through the bloodstream, where it diffuses back into the alveoli. 6. Exhalation: The carbon dioxide-filled air is expelled from the body during exhalation. As the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, the chest cavity contracts, increasing the air pressure within it. This pressure forces the air, now rich in carbon dioxide, up through the bronchial tubes, trachea, and finally out of the nose and mouth. In summary, the first step of this intricate process is the inhalation of oxygen-rich air, which initiates the cycle of respiration and gas exchange necessary to sustain life."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong.

The Munich Metropolitan Region is home to 5.8 million people. - A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. - The Invasion of Poland, also known as the September Campaign, or the 1939 Defensive War in Poland (or \\"Wojna obronna 1939 roku\\"), and alternatively the Poland Campaign or \\"Fall Weiss\\" in Germany (Case White), was a joint invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, the Free City of Danzig, the Soviet Union, and a small Slovak contingent, that marked the beginning of World War II in Europe. The German invasion began on 1 September 1939, one week after the signing of the MolotovRibbentrop Pact, while the Soviet invasion commenced on 17 September following the Molotov-Tg agreement that terminated the Russian and Japanese hostilities in the east on 16 September. The campaign ended on 6 October with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland under the terms of the German-Soviet Frontier Treaty. - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\").

In broad usage, the terms \\"armed forces\\" and \\"military\\" are often treated synonymously, although in technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country's armed forces may include both its military and other paramilitary forces. Armed force is the use of armed forces to achieve political objectives. The study of the use of armed forces is called military science. Broadly speaking, this involves considering offense and defense at three \\"levels\\": strategy, operational art, and tactics. All three levels study the application of the use of force in order to achieve a desired objective. - Bavaria is a federal state of Germany.

Chicago is an American rock band formed in 1967 in Chicago, Illinois as The Chicago Transit Authority before shortening the name in 1970. The self-described \\"rock and roll band with horns\\" began as a politically charged, sometimes experimental, rock band and later moved to a predominantly softer sound, generating several hit ballads. The group had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Since at least 2008, Billboard has shown Chicago to be the \\"greatest of all time\\" American band in singles chart success, and since 2015, the \\"greatest of all time\\" American band in album chart success as well. The original band membership consisted of saxophonist Walter Parazaider, guitarist Terry Kath, drummer Danny Seraphine, trombonist James Pankow, trumpet player Lee Loughnane, and keyboardist/singer Robert Lamm. Parazaider, Kath, Seraphine, Pankow and Loughnane met in 1967 while students at DePaul University. Lamm was recruited from Roosevelt University. The group of six called themselves \\"The Big Thing\\", and played top 40 hits. Realizing the need for both a tenor to complement baritones Lamm and Kath, and a bass player because Lamm's use of organ bass pedals did not provide \\"adequate bass sound\\", they added local tenor and bassist Peter Cetera. While gaining some success as a cover band, the group began working on original songs. In June 1968, at manager James William Guercio's request, The Big Thing moved to Los Angeles, California, and signed with Columbia Records. The band changed its name to \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\". It was while performing on a regular basis at the Whisky a Go Go nightclub in West Hollywood that the band got exposure to more famous musical artists of the time. Subsequently, they were the opening act for Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. As related to group biographer, William James Ruhlmann, by Walt Parazaider, Jimi Hendrix once told Parazaider, \\"'Jeez, your horn players are like one set of lungs and your guitar player is better than me.'\\" Their first record (April 1969), the eponymous Chicago Transit Authority, is a double album, which is rare for a band's first release. The album made it to No. 17 on the Billboard 200 album chart, sold over one million copies by 1970, and was awarded a platinum disc. The album included a number of pop-rock songs - \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\", \\"Beginnings\\", \\"Questions 67 and 68\\", and \\"I'm a Man\\" - which were later released as singles. For this inaugural recording effort the group was nominated for a Grammy Award for 1969 Best New Artist of the Year. According to Peter Cetera, the band was booked to perform at Woodstock in 1969, but promoter Bill Graham, with whom they had a contract, exercised his right to reschedule them to play at the Fillmore West on a date of his choosing, and he scheduled them for the Woodstock dates. Santana, which Graham also managed, took Chicago's place at Woodstock, and that performance is considered to be Santana's \\"breakthrough\\" gig. A year later, in 1970, when he needed to replace headliner Joe Cocker, and then Cocker's intended replacement, Jimi Hendrix, Graham booked Chicago to perform at Tanglewood which is considered by some to be a \\"pinnacle\\" performance. After the release of their first album, the band's name was shortened to Chicago to avoid legal action being threatened by the actual mass-transit company of the same name.

As far as we know, the earliest cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4. Bach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. He was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche. The first cantatas he composed in the new position were Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, for Palm Sunday, Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday, and Erschallet, ihr Lieder, BWV 172, for Pentecost. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, Salomo Franck, they contain recitatives and arias. When Johann Samuel Drese, the Kapellmeister (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.In Köthen, Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself. The court was Calvinist, therefore Bach's work from this period was mostly secular, including the orchestral suites, the cello suites, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos. He composed secular cantatas for the court for occasions such as New Year's Day and the prince's birthday, including Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV...

'Don't mention the Arctic': Shell embarrassed by video competition row Shell has been caught in an embarrassing spat over its plan for a 50,000 (£31,727) video competition aimed at 18-34-year-olds to promote its view that the world still needs fossil fuels despite climate change. Related: The real story behind Shell's climate change rhetoric The film project is being developed in partnership with US-based online ad agency Zooppa, and, according to a leaked email, was to be pitched at platforms such as Vice, the online news service. An email between Zooppa staff discussing the Shell brief makes it clear “you should NOT mention on your storyboard Arctic Oil”. Environmentalists say Shell’s involvement in exploiting reserves in the Arctic undermines its attempt to portray itself as a responsible oil and gas company keen to tackle global warming. While references to the Arctic are ruled out, the memo says “you can mention instead oil, gas, wind, nuclear energy”. Greenpeace – which received the leaked email – believes the competition is being run in a bid to influence younger people in the runup to critical climate change talks convened by the United Nations in Paris in December. Related: Shell accused of strategy risking catastrophic climate change The email appears to be written by one Zooppa staffer to another giving advice about how to approach the project after “I met on Monday with the Shell team”. While the Anglo-Dutch group has insisted it needs to drill off Alaska this summer as part of an effort to see whether it can find oil and replenish the world’s reserves, the email suggests Shell realises its operations in the Chukchi Sea could lose it support. A Shell spokesman said: “We said in our brief that we wanted to get these films noticed by Vice, but we didn’t expect it to happen this way. At no point was any direction given by Shell to our agency to advise entrants against mentioning the Arctic in their films. We’ve taken the agency outside and given it a stern talking to, and it is now absolutely clear on this. “Anyway, there’s no censorship, no boundaries other than the pretty basic ones set out in the brief, just a strong desire to get people thinking creatively about how to challenge preconceptions that fossil fuels, especially natural gas, have no part in our future energy lives, and how to communicate the reality of the future energy system. That system will include renewables, nuclear power and oil and gas, including from the Arctic, which is already a major source of energy.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

Please answer the following question: Article: What is an idiom? An idiom is a group of words which, when used together, has a different meaning from the one which the individual words have. For example, \\"---How do you know that Sid and Nancy have separated ?\\" \\"---I heard it on the grapevine \\". Of course, the second speaker does not mean he heard the news about John by putting his ear to a grapevine! He is conveying the idea visually of information spreading around a widespread network, similar to a grapevine. We use idioms to express something that other words do not express as clearly or as cleverly. We often use an image or symbol to describe something as clearly as possible and thus make our point as effectively as possible. For example, \\"in a nutshell\\" suggests the idea of having all the information contained within very few words. Idioms tend to be informal and are best used in spoken rather than written English. One of the best ways to learn an idiom is by looking at the context in which it is used. This can be done by concentrating on the rest of the sentence and try to guess the meaning. Many idioms are not that difficult to understand when considered in their context. For example: We are going to have a surprise party for Tom tomorrow. It's a secret so please don't let the cat out of the bag. 'Let the cat out of the bag' is an idiom. Imagine you don't know what this idiom means; by looking at the words preceding, it should be easy to guess that the speaker does not want you to tell Tom about the surprise party. Therefore, 'let the cat out of the bag' must mean something like' reveal a secret' or 'tell a secret'. Question: It is most probable that idioms will be seen _ .

One day last week, she used a pole to pick oranges off trees and collect them in baskets. It's the first time in her 15 years she's picked fruit from trees. \\"This is quite different from buying oranges in the supermarket,\\" said Christopher. \\"Every time I eat an orange, I'll remember this experience.\\" Christopher was one of the 30 student volunteers at Soil Born Farms. She volunteered as part of a project which was set up in 2009 to help homeowners in South Land Park pick oranges and other fruits out of their backyards. Before, the fruit would rot on the ground or get eaten by animals. Now the fruit is donated to those who need it. \\"It is good for many people\\", said Randy Stannard, who works for the project. \\"The homeowner gets fruit picked and more people can have healthy food.\\" \\"Two harvests ( ) were organized in 2009 and volunteers picked 3,000 pounds (1,360kg) of fruit\\", Stannard said.

Britain Bars Syrian Envoy From Royal Wedding LONDON — Just 24 hours before the event, Britain said Thursday that it had revoked the Syrian ambassador’s invitation to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, turning the ceremony into an unlikely focus of protest against violent repression in the Arab world. The prince and his longtime girlfriend are to marry on Friday at Westminster Abbey before an invited congregation of some 1,900 people ranging from what the British call commoners — that is, ordinary people without titles — to crowned heads of old monarchies and a smattering of the newer elite from show business and sport. Buried among the official list of those invited was a reference to “All Heads of Mission in London representing countries with which the United Kingdom has normal diplomatic relations.” That included Sami Khiyami, the ambassador from Syria, where Britain, along with other European countries, is pressing for stern diplomatic action to protest a crackdown on dissent that has claimed hundreds of lives as the authorities sent tanks and soldiers into the streets to crush opposition. After protests from human rights groups, William Hague, the foreign secretary, said in a statement he had decided that Mr. Khiyami’s presence “would be unacceptable and that he should not attend” because of “this week’s attacks against civilians by the Syrian security forces, which we have condemned.” “Buckingham Palace shares the view of the Foreign Office that it is not considered appropriate for the Syrian Ambassador to attend the wedding,” the statement said, denoting royal approval of the decision. It noted that only on Wednesday, Mr. Khiyami had been invited to a different encounter with British officialdom when he was summoned to the Foreign Office to receive a formal protest about the use of force against protesters. In a radio interview on Thursday, Mr. Khiyami said that he found the British snub “a bit embarrassing” but that he did not believe it jeopardize other aspects of Syria’s relationship with Britain. “I’m not a man who likes to attend events,” he said. “If it wasn’t for the importance of” the royal wedding, “I wouldn’t have thought about it,” he told the BBC. News of the invitation to the Syrian envoy had received a particularly sharp response from members of the opposition Labour Party since two former Labour prime ministers, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, have not been invited while a former Conservative prime minister, John Major, has accepted an invitation. Margaret Thatcher, another former Conservative prime minister, was reported to have declined an invitation because of poor health. The guest list had drawn earlier controversy when the crown prince of Bahrain volunteered not to take up an invitation because of protests in Britain over the harsh treatment of antigovernment demonstrators in his country. But some opposition figures on Thursday said Bahrain’s ambassador should also be denied an invitation to the wedding. British newspapers have also raised questions about invitations extended to diplomats from other countries where Britain has criticized human rights records, notably Iran, North Korea and Zimbabwe. “There is blood on the hands of other regimes who want to promote positive media coverage by walking down tomorrow’s red carpet,” said Denis MacShane, a Labour lawmaker and former Foreign Office minister, adding, “we are seeing crass insensitivity in allowing representatives of some of the world’s most odious regimes take part in the royal wedding.” Many other members of royal families — from lands as disparate as Belgium, Bulgaria and Brunei — are on the official list of guests, along with Elton John and the soccer player David Beckham and his wife, Victoria. Invitations to the wedding rank among the hottest tickets in memory, offering an exalted place inside Westminster Abbey as about 5,000 police officers patrol the city outside and broadcasters send images of the event around the world. Britons have organized about 5,500 officially approved street parties to accompany the event, and the wedding day has been declared a public holiday. Some enthusiasts are already camping out in the streets outside Westminster Abbey to secure a good view. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Britain has decided not to allow the Syrian ambassador to attend the royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, due to concerns about Syria's violent actions against its own people.

In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. Jimothy and Dwight are two brothers living in the same house. Jimothy is a freshman in high school and Dwight is a junior in high school. Their mother takes them to see a doctor and to have their testosterone tested. The tests reveal that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, but that is to be expected given their age difference. Which boy will start developing muscles later? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Jimothy will start developing muscles later than Dwight. This is because Jimothy, being a freshman in high school, is likely younger than Dwight, who is a junior in high school. As mentioned before, growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height, which is controlled by testosterone. Since Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, it is expected that he is further along in his puberty process. This higher level of testosterone indicates that Dwight has likely experienced or is currently experiencing his adolescent growth spurt. With this in mind, Dwight is at the stage where his muscles are beginning to develop and gaining strength. In contrast, Jimothy, who has lower levels of testosterone, is yet to experience his growth spurt and the associated muscle development. As he progresses through puberty, his testosterone levels will increase, and he will eventually experience his growth spurt and the subsequent development of muscles. However, as of now, it is safe to say that Jimothy will start developing muscles later than his older brother, Dwight."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

LaDainian Tomlinson made history by becoming the fastest running back to reach 100 career TDs by doing it in 89 games, eclipsing the mark set by Emmitt Smith and Jim Brown of 93 games. He also continued his march toward beating Shaun Alexander's single-season TD record by scoring 4 TDs to bring his total to 22, just 5 short of tying Alexander's mark. Philip Rivers had a good day as well, throwing 19 of 26 for 222&#160;yards and two TDs, although he did throw two picks including a 31-yard interception return for a TD by Denver cornerback Darrent Williams. The game started out with Tomlinson running it in from 3 yards out to make it 7-0 San Diego. Denver's Mike Bell ran for two TDs in during the 2nd quarter to make it a 14-7 Denver lead at halftime. After the break, Denver continued the scoring with an Jason Elam's 42-yd field goal and Williams INT return to make it a 24-7 lead for Denver. But just like last week against the Bengals, the Chargers wouldn't say die putting together two scoring drives including a 3-yard run by LT, his 100th TD, and a 51-yd pass to LT by Rivers to cut the lead to 24-21 at the end of the third quarter. Elam helped the Broncos' cause by hitting a 38-yd kick to extend the Broncos' lead to 27-21, but that only lasted until Rivers found Vincent Jackson open at the back of the end zone to put the Chargers up 28-27. On the ensuing Broncos drive, Drayton Florence then intercepted Jake Plummer's 4th and 4 pass to give the Bolts terrific field position that set up a 1-yard run by LT to make it 35-27; it was his 4th TD of the night and 102nd of his career. That left Denver 1:14 to try to tie the game. They started that drive from their 3 and made it all the way to the Chargers 32 in part to a personal foul on Chargers defensive end Igor Olshansky, who was ejected for punching Broncos center Tom Nalen. The Broncos' hopes for overtime ended when Plummer was sacked by Shaun Phillips and time ran out, giving San Diego their first win in Denver in 7 years as well as sole position of first place in the AFC West and improved their record to 8-2.

Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia.

In July 1873 the U.S. Navy dispatched USS Juniata to Greenland, to search for survivors from the Polaris expedition which had disintegrated after the death of its leader, Charles Francis Hall. Juniata's second-in-command was George W. De Long, a 28-year-old graduate of the United States Naval Academy, making his first visit to the Arctic. Ice conditions prevented Juniata from advancing beyond Upernavik; De Long volunteered to take the ship's tender, a small steamer named the Little Juniata, in the hope of finding survivors at Cape York, a further 400 nautical miles (740 km) north.The attempt failed; Little Juniata faced extreme weather conditions, and was forced to retreat a few miles from Cape York. De Long returned to Juniata in mid-August, having found no trace of the Polaris crew—who had meanwhile been rescued by the Scottish whaler SS Ravenscraig—but the experience had profoundly affected his outlook. Having earlier described the Greenland coast in a letter to his wife Emma as \\"a dreary land of desolation ... I hope I may never find myself cast away in such a perfectly God-forsaken place\\", he returned home captivated by the Arctic. Emma wrote: \\"The polar virus was in his blood and would not let him rest\\".The abortive Little Juniata mission brought De Long to public notice, and he saw himself as a possible leader of the next U.S. Arctic expedition. He approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions. Grinnell was not prepared to offer financial support, instead advising De Long to approach James Gordon Bennett Jr., owner and publisher of the New York Herald and a known sponsor of bold schemes. De Long met Bennett in New York early in 1874; the newspaperman was impressed by De Long, and assured him that his Arctic ambitions would have the enthusiastic support of the Herald. In the meantime De Long had applied to the Navy Department for an Arctic command, a request that he was informed would \\"receive due attention\\".

The correct answer is to wash all the fruits and vegetables and chop them up into small rationed pieces so the guinea pig can eat them easily. This is because washing the produce helps remove any dirt, bacteria, or pesticides that might be lingering on the surface, which could be harmful to the guinea pig. Chopping the fruits and vegetables into small pieces makes it easier for the guinea pig to eat and digest. Moreover, providing the correct portion size is essential for a balanced diet and to prevent overfeeding, which can lead to obesity and health issues. The other option, \\"Chop up the fruits and vegetables and feed them to your guinea pig and give them as much as they'd like,\\" is not recommended. While chopping up the food makes it easier for the guinea pig to eat, this option does not emphasize washing the produce or controlling portion size.

Read this and answer the question With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London ceased to be a capital and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued in the St Martin-in-the-Fields area until around 450. From around 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed in the same area, slightly to the west of the old Roman city. By about 680, it had revived sufficiently to become a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production of goods. From the 820s the town declined because of repeated Viking invasions.

Article:After a three night marathon on the quiz show Jeopardy, Watson emerged victorious to win a 1million (£622,000) prize. The computer's competitors were two of the most successful players ever to have taken part in Jeopardy. But in the end their skill at the game was no match for Watson. Ken Jennings had previously notched up 74 consecutive wins on the show - the most ever - while Brad Rutter had won the most amount of money, 3million (£1.9m). \\"I for one welcome our new computer overlords,\\" Mr Jennings wrote along with his correct final Jeopardy question. But the victory for Watson and IBM was about more than money. It was about ushering in a new era in computing where machines will increasingly be able to learn and understand what humans are really asking them for. Jeopardy is seen as a significant challenge for Watson because of the show's rapid fire format and clues that rely on subtle meanings, puns, and riddles; something humans excel at and computers do not. On the night of the grand finale, IBM announced a research agreement with speech recognition firm Nuance Communications, to \\"explore, develop and commercialise\\" the Watson computing system's advanced analytics capabilities in the health care industry. The technology behind Watson has the ability to scan and analyse information from many more resources than a human can in a short period of time, potentially aiding doctors in diagnosing patients quickly. \\"We can transform the way that health care professionals accomplish everyday tasks by enabling them to work smarter and more efficiently,\\" said Dr John E Kelly III, senior vice president and director of IBM research. Other possible applications for Watson's technology include dealing with big sets of data commonly found in the legal and financial worlds. There is little doubt that Watson's win stirred up a host of emotions. Paul Miller of the technology blog Engadget.com was moderately impressed. \\"It's obvious that IBM's DeepQA research programme has developed some of the most sophisticated natural language AI known to man. At the same time, Jeopardy questions aren't really that hard... all three contestants knew the answer most of the time, but Watson was just quicker on the draw. \\"Of course, it's no surprise that computers have quicker reflexes, so why shouldn't Watson get to use his inbuilt advantage to the utmost? It seems like a fair fight to us.\\" Daniel Terdiman of news website CNet watched the final with IBM staff at an event at the company's Silicon Valley research centre. \\"I was rooting for the humans,\\" he said. Twitter was alight with praise and condemnation for the machine's victory. The comments ranged from \\"Robot Apocalypse, here we come\\" to \\"IBM's Watson dominates Ken Jennings, turns attention to plotting our demise\\". One user wrote: \\"next challenge for #Watson: The Price is Right\\". The final Jeopardy category was 19th century novelists. And the answer: William Wilkinson's \\"An Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia\\" inspired this author's most famous novel. The question - which all three contestants got right was \\"Who is Bram Stoker?\\" Watson wagered 17,973 (£11,154) to cement his victory. In the end Watson accumulated 77,147 (£47,923) versus Mr Jennings' total of 24,000 (£14,907) and Mr Rutter's 21,600 (£12,416).

Hard questions are being raised about the Taliban in Afghanistan now that the United States will formally meet with the erstwhile al Qaeda ally. Why is the U.S. government engaging the hard-line Islamic fundamentalist group, a regime that once sheltered Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network and was eventually routed out of Afghanistan by a U.S. invasion after the September 11, 2001, attacks? Such tough questions were unleashed shortly after the announcement about upcoming U.S.-Taliban talks during a Tuesday news conference held by State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. She was asked point-blank: \\"In the eyes of the U.S., is Taliban a terrorist group?\\" The ability to open a formal line of communication with the Taliban is important to reaching an \\"end goal\\" of disassociating the Taliban from","completion":"al Qaeda and achieving a lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan. The U.S. government seems to be engaging the hard-line Islamic fundamentalist group for a number of strategic reasons. First, war-weary Americans and regional allies have reached a consensus that a military solution alone is not possible in Afghanistan. Therefore, the U.S. government aims to shift the focus to a political settlement, which is essential to avoid a potential security vacuum after the withdrawal of American and NATO forces from Afghanistan. Engaging the Taliban in dialogue is a crucial step in paving the way for a peaceful transition, as it would enable both parties to define common ground and work towards shared goals. Second, engaging the Taliban in talks also aims at hindering any further expansion of the group and preventing the growth of other extremist groups in the region. Through diplomatic negotiations, the U.S. hopes to reduce the Taliban's influence and eventually establish a stable government in Kabul, which can maintain law and order and protect the rights of its citizens, including women and ethnic minorities. Third, by opening communications with the Taliban, the U.S. also hopes to enlist their support in the fight against the global threat of terrorism. By driving a wedge between the Taliban and al Qaeda, the U.S. government seeks to eliminate the breeding ground for future terrorists in Afghanistan. Building trust and pursuing a common agenda with the Taliban can be beneficial for both parties, as the Taliban also desires to regain political legitimacy and authority in Afghanistan after decades of fighting. However, these talks carry risks and raise ethical questions. Critics argue that by engaging the Taliban, the U.S. government is sending a mixed message about its stance against terrorism and could be seen as legitimizing a group responsible for countless acts of violence against innocent people. Additionally, these talks could potentially undermine the progress made in the fields of democracy, human rights, and women's rights in Afghanistan, which were achieved at a considerable cost, both in terms of lives and resources. In conclusion, while the U.S. government's decision to engage with the Taliban raises several concerns, it seems crucial to pursue a diplomatic solution that entails a delicate balance between recognizing the realities on the ground and upholding democratic values. The U.S. must tread carefully in these negotiations and ensure that the gains made in Afghanistan are not compromised in the quest for a long-lasting peace. By disassociating the Taliban from al Qaeda and integrating them into Afghanistan's political landscape, perhaps a more sustained and inclusive peace can be achieved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: USDA draws the line on food stamps, rules against medical marijuana deductions It's the last dance with Mary Jane for states that had been illegally allowing food stamp recipients to claim deductions for medical marijuana. The Department of Agriculture last month sent out a memo ordering states to stop permitting the practice. Though 18 states currently allow medical marijuana use in some capacity, it remains illegal under federal law. And until recently, at least a few states were allowing food stamp users to deduct the cost of their medical marijuana in order to meet the income eligibility requirements. For instance, a family of four under USDA guidelines must earn less than 1,863 a month to qualify for food stamps. In limited cases, families were deducting the cost of their medical marijuana every month to bring their monthly income within that limit. That's a no-no, Lizbeth Silbermann, director of the USDA program development division, wrote in the memo last month. \\"FNS is now reaffirming its long standing policy that a household may not utilize the SNAP medical deduction for the cost of any substance considered illegal under Federal law,\\" she wrote. SNAP stands for Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. Silbermann called out violators, though not by name. \\"It has come to FNS' attention that some State agencies are allowing elderly or disabled households to deduct the cost of medicinal marijuana from their income for SNAP purposes,\\" she wrote. The states -- which include Maine, Oregon and New Mexico -- had been allowing the deductions under a 2008 law that permits \\"allowable medical expenses\\" to be deducted for elderly or disabled recipients. Marijuana, though, does not qualify as allowable, Silbermann wrote, warning that states must \\"cease this practice immediately\\" or face penalties. USDA spokeswoman Alyn Kiel confirmed to FoxNews.com that the states have since discontinued the practice and come into compliance. She said the deduction was not widely used though it had been on the books. Medical marijuana laws and enforcement across the country continue to be in flux. While the feds have cracked down on the practice, Los Angeles moved last month to ban the pot shops until the state's high court rules. The USDA memo came as the department faces regular criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill for allegedly encouraging food stamp enrollment. The food stamp rolls have swelled since the recession, growing roughly 40 percent since 2009. As of April, more than 46 million people were in the program, which costs 80 billion a year.","completion":"The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has issued a memo to states instructing them to stop allowing food stamp recipients to claim deductions for medical marijuana expenses.

But in September 1984, Maria is shot and killed, and Rob claims she was murdered by a robber while he was changing a flat tire. When the police commence their investigations, however, they discover unsettling truths about the Marshalls: Rob has secretly accumulated an enormous debt and has secured a second mortgage of 100,000 in Maria's name, and is having an affair with a married neighbor, Felice Richmond (Robin Strasser). Maria had known of the affair, and had considered divorce but decided to work on their marriage shortly before she was killed. Felice gives the police a statement that Rob wanted to get rid of his wife to collect on her life insurance, and he immediately becomes the prime suspect. At first, Rob's friends and sons support him. But they begin to notice that he does not seem to be in mourning over Maria's death, and Rob's best friend Sal (Joe Spano) is angry that he is more interested in building a future with Felice.

Five lead tablets buried in the grave of a young Greek woman about 2,400 years ago bear curses against four tavern-keepers in Athens, LiveScience reports. Apparently, burying the tablets was thought to put the curses closer to gods who could fulfill them. \\"Cast your hate upon Phanagora and Demetrios and their tavern and their property and their possessions,\\" reads one, against a husband-and-wife pair of tavern owners. The curse-writer then threatens to put Demetrios \\"in such a bind ... as strong as possible,\\" and \\"smite down a kynotos on [your] tongue.\\" Now Jessica Lamont, who teaches at John Hopkins University, has written about the 2003 find in an academic journal—and casts light on the phrase \\"kynotos on [your] tongue.\\" Meaning \\"dog's ear,\\" the kynotos was used in gambling as \\"the name for the lowest possible throw of dice,\\" says Lamont. \\"By striking Demetrios' tongue with this condemningly unlucky roll, the curse reveals that local taverns were not just sociable watering holes, but venues ripe for gambling and other unsavory activities in Classical Athens.\\" Lamont says someone \\"in the world of the tavern\\" may have hired a professional curse-writer to place the tablets—which are pierced by an iron nail—into the grave so that \\"chthonic\\" (or underworld) gods would act on them. A 1,700-year-old lead curse tablet found in a Roman mansion in Jerusalem is no less ominous: \\"I strike and strike down and nail down the tongue, the eyes, the wrath, the ire, the anger, the procrastination, the opposition of [curse target] Iennys,\\" it reads, per a 2013 article in Discovery.","completion":"Once upon a time, about 2,400 years ago in Athens, there was a young Greek woman who was buried with five special tablets. These tablets had curses written on them for four people who owned taverns. People believed that if they put the tablets in a grave, it would bring the curses closer to the gods who could make the bad things happen. One of the curses said something like, \\"Hey gods, make Phanagora and Demetrios, who own a tavern, have really bad luck and lots of trouble.\\" And then it asked the gods to make Demetrios feel really stuck and have a \\"dog's ear\\" on his tongue. A \\"dog's ear\\" was a term used in a dice game to mean the worst score ever. So, this curse was asking for bad luck and trouble for the tavern owners. A smart teacher named Jessica Lamont from John Hopkins University studied these tablet curses.

Everyone who is sane in Europe would think so. In the USA everything is different. The film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist bigot death penalty craving American justice. A young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense counseling for this particular case. But the film has a sequel. Justice in the USA is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance. Miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance. One person in the local Public Attorney Offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges. This Public Attorney's officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free. But he loses his college scholarship and he is castrated by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire. He hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance. But he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than hormonal for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer hormonal and he can only do that with little girls. He apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys. One day the local cops follow their intuition, guided by some vague circumstantial elements in the assassination of a young girl, and they arrest the young chap we are speaking of. They beat him up and interrogate him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and telephone books and guns and Russian roulette. He confesses. Sent to death row, he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in Massachusetts who is the husband of the Local Public Attorney's representative that had him falsely prosecuted some years ago and the vengeance is on the rails. It will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice, police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute legality, some unjust act is done that can ruin even the best accusation case and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance. To charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice. The best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention, just as much as the life of a person can be jeopardized by circumstantial elements inflated to the size of evidence, which in its turn will jeopardize the whole case by being just circumstantial, hence easily discardable, with a good lawyer. The film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and regulations all along the police and justice line if we don't want to make a mistake, which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief Americans are supposed to have: \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\\" (Declaration of Independence) Life is an unalienable Right that was given to man by his Creator, which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away. Only God can take the life of a person away. The death penalty is the arrogant appropriation of a power that we do not have. Even if we do not evoke God, we cannot justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance, and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace. If vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty. And there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of Happiness but of vengeance.

Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama, speaking at his summit on countering violent extremism Wednesday, sought to strike a balance between appealing for more acceptance of Muslim-Americans while emphasizing the need to remain vigilant against radicals who could turn violent. \\"We are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam,\\" Obama said during his remarks, adding later that Muslim leaders \\"need to do more to discredit the notion that our nations are determined to suppress Islam.\\" Obama went to lengths before the summit began to avoid linking extremism to the Muslim faith; his intent, aides say, was to avoid giving credence to the ideologies of Islamic State or al Qaeda terrorists. On Wednesday he sought to explain his wording, declaring al Qaeda and ISIS \\"desperate for legitimacy.\\" \\"They try to portray themselves as religious leaders, holy warriors in defense of Islam,\\" he said. \\"We must never accept the premise that they put forward because it is a lie. Nor should we grant these terrorists the religious legitimacy that they seek. They are not religious leaders. They are terrorists.\\" Obama called for resilience in the face of terrorist threats and pointed to efforts in U.S. cities where Muslim communities and law enforcement are making strides in addressing the root causes of violent extremism. \\"We all know there is no one profile of a violent extremist or terrorist. There is no way to predict who will become radicalized,\\" he said. \\"We are here at this summit because of the urgent threat from groups like al Qaeda and ISIL and this week, we are focused on prevention.\\" During Wednesday's session, the White House highlighted pilot programs in three metropolitan areas -- Boston, Los Angeles, and the Twin Cities -- where law enforcement and Muslim-American groups are trying to join forces to counter violent extremism. Officials say they hope to replicate those programs in other places around the country with populations that could be prone to radicalization. \\"This is really a moment to rededicate ourselves to efforts that really reach out to communities, and build that confidence that they need to have so that they feel comfortable working with authorities, both to prevent radicalization and also, when necessary, to intervene,\\" said one senior administration official. That strategy has drawn criticism from civil rights organizations, who say the government risks alienating Muslim communities by partnering with religious and cultural organizations to identify potential extremists. \\"From conceptualization to implementation, the CVE strategy raises significant constitutional and privacy concerns. It is not based on empirical evidence of effectiveness. It threatens to do more harm than good,\\" said Hina Shamsi, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union National Security Project. Officials attending the White House summit downplayed those fears, arguing the pilot programs established across the country were providing needed outreach to communities, and weren't spying on them. \\"This has nothing to do with intelligence, it has nothing to do with surveillance, this is about developing healthier, resilient communities,\\" said Michael Downing, the Deputy Chief and commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department's counterterrorism and special operations bureau. He also pointed to the case in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where Muslim Americans were the victims in a high profile murder case. The outcry from Muslim American groups led to a mass prayer outside the White House last week. \\"We do not yet know why three young people, who were Muslim Americans, were brutally killed in Chapel Hill, N.C. But we know that many Muslim Americans across our country are worried and afraid,\\" Obama wrote in the op-ed. ||||| CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Obama said Thursday he doesn't use terms like Islamic extremism because to do so would promote the false idea that the West is at war with Islam, thereby helping extremists recruit more terrorists.

(Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) WASHINGTON — President Obama said Thursday he doesn't use terms like Islamic extremism because doing so would promote the false idea of a Western war with Islam, which would help extremists recruit more terrorists. \\"No religion is responsible for terrorism — people are responsible for violence and terrorism,\\" Obama told delegates at the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism. Obama also said military force alone will not defeat terrorism, and the nation must work with local communities to reduce the influence of those who advocate violent extremism. \\"They are not religious leaders,\\" Obama said. \\"They are terrorists.\\" He also said: \\"We are not at war with Islam — we are at war with people who have perverted Islam.\\" The summit — in which officials from cities in the United States and across the globe discussed their attempts to dissuade young people from embracing hateful ideologies — takes place as conservatives criticize Obama for avoiding the term \\"Islamic extremism.\\" In his summit remarks, Obama cited the \\"fair amount of debate in the press and among pundits\\" about the words that used should be used to \\"describe and frame this challenge\\" of violent extremism. Groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda \\"try to portray themselves as religious leaders, holy warriors in defense of Islam,\\" Obama said, but \\"we must never accept the premise that they put forward, because it is a lie.\\" Obama also said Muslim communities have responsibilities to confront the abuse of religion. \\"Of course, the terrorists do not speak for a billion Muslims who reject their ideology,\\" Obama said. \\"They no more represent Islam than any madman who kills innocents in the name of God, represents Christianity or Judaism or Buddhism or Hinduism.\\" In fighting extremism, Obama said the United States and allies must also address the economic and political \\"grievances\\" that often fuel violent ideology. Governments must work to help provide economic opportunity, education, democracy, and the rule of law to their citizens, he said. The \\"best partners\\" for these efforts are local communities, Obama said. Family members, schools, churches and mosques, and law enforcement officials can help dissuade young people from falling for the \\"false promises of extremism.\\" That said, Obama warned that \\"engagement with communities can't be a cover for surveillance,\\" and governments should deal with vulnerable people \\"through the prism of law enforcement.\\" The nation must stay true to its heritage of tolerance and diversity and not target specific religious groups. \\"It will take time,\\" he said. \\"This is a generational challenge,\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1A6Zl2R ||||| A recent news bulletin announced that police in Nova Scotia broke up a plot by two men who aimed to carry out mass murder at a shopping mall and then commit suicide. Here is what the Associated Press said about the plot in its second paragraph: “Police and other officials said it was not related to Islamic terrorism.” Whew, that’s a relief. And a surprise. If you shared my instant reactions, you also are wondering what the hell is going on with the Obama administration. When the liberal Associated Press feels the need to address readers’ assumptions about Islam and terrorism, we have a reached a tipping point. Make that a worldwide tipping point. With the pope and Cardinal Timothy Dolan joining Jewish leaders and growing numbers of Muslim officials in Arab lands speaking honestly about the horrors perpetrated under Islam’s name, that leaves President Obama as the odd man out. Not every Muslim is a terrorist. But almost all terrorists are Muslims. Those two statements are both accurate, as even Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi tacitly conceded when he scolded Islamic clerics for failing to halt the spread of jihadists. But inconvenient truths don’t matter to Obama. The president’s ideological blinkers will be on vivid display this week, with 60 countries invited to a White House summit on extremism. But aides made clear there would be no change in the willful ignorance. “We are not treating these people as part of a religion. We’re treating them as terrorists,” an official told reporters. This is nuts. Although the Islamic State, al Qaeda, Boko Haram and the Taliban cite Islam as the basis of their death cults, Obama argues that their acts are contrary to Islam, and therefore, refuses to associate them with Islam. Thankfully, Christian leaders finally realize they cannot count on the president and must themselves sound the alarm about what is happening in Muslim countries. The beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya was the latest outrage linked to a genocidal religious cleansing. As the pope and Dolan made clear, the victims were killed because of their faith, with the Islamic butchers calling them “people of the cross” and “crusaders.” The fact that Jews are singled out for their religion is hardly in doubt — except at the White House. After Obama foolishly used the word “randomly” to describe the slaughter of four Jews in a Paris kosher deli, aides scrambled to defend him. They soon gave up, conceding what French authorities said all along — the slaughter was an anti-Semitic attack by a follower of the Islamic State. Obama’s hesitation to admit the obvious fact about the victims echoes the refusal to properly call Islamic terrorists what they are. At the same time, he has no problem standing up for Islam when he thinks its adherents are wronged. Although police have not concluded that the murder of three Muslims in North Carolina had anything to do with religion — the killer confessed and denied religion was an issue — the Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation and Obama issued a statement suggesting the murders were hate crimes. “No one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, or how they worship,” he said. Remember, too, that he recently singled out the Crusades to warn Christians about getting on their “high horse” over Muslim killers. If the issue were only semantics, it would be minor in the grand scheme. But the refusal to concede that Islamic terrorists are, in fact, Islamic leads to flawed understandings of the problem and missed chances for potential solutions. One example of the garbage-in, garbage-out dynamic is the ridiculous assertion by a State Department official that jobs programs are part of the answer. “We cannot win this war by killing them,” spokeswoman Marie Harf said on MSNBC, arguing that America should “help them build their economies so they can have job opportunities for these people.” The rot of denial runs deep, and starts at the top. It’s a rotten way to run a government There he goes again. Gov. Andrew Cuomo is still sending mixed messages about his commitment to cleaning up Albany, saying on TV that “You’ve always had and you probably always will have some level of corruption.’’ Technically speaking, he’s right. But the context — a parade of government perps, including the arrest of former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver — makes Cuomo sound too defensive and casts doubt on his latest promise to do something about the rotten apples. Earlier this month, he proposed ethics demands that he said the Legislature must pass before he would sign a budget. He conceded then that “we have not yet proven . . . that Albany writ large can be trusted.” He was right then, and wrong now. His suggestion that the crime wave is nothing extraordinary recalls Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s warning about “defining deviancy down.” As the late senator noted, rot becomes permanent when people accept the abnormal as normal and give up trying to fix it. Cuomo also said in the NY1 interview that there are no plans to hang the customary portrait of former Gov. Eliot Spitzer because he resigned in a prostitution scandal. The old Soviet system of erasing out-of-favor pols from history comes to mind. Sure, Spitzer was a disgrace, but he belongs on Albany’s wall of governors. If nothing else, his face will be a daily reminder of what happens when politicians think they are above the law. Let Client No. 9 take his place. And let his successors take their cue from his fall. A ‘law’ unto Dem selves In my next life, I want to come back as a progressive. That way, I’ll know everything for certain. After a federal judge put a temporary halt to President Obama’s immigration orders, Mayor Bill de Blasio and his Mini-Me, Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, declared the judge wrong on the law. Neither is a lawyer, but that didn’t stop them. The mayor called the president’s actions “lawful” and said he was confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal. Mark-Viverito chimed in to say Obama’s “plan is constitutional and necessary.” Inadvertently, the would-be tyrants point up a big potential for savings. With progressives in power, we don’t need judges, courts, checks and balances. We could just turn back the clock to the 18th century and go for a monarchy. Who needs elections?

So a simple procedure such as opening someone's airway can save their life while they're waiting for emergency medical help. This means you're more likely to give first aid to someone you know than a stranger. There are many misconceptions surrounding first aid. Below are the 'most popular' ones with details of what you should do. You should put butter or cream on a burn. The only thing you should put on a burn is cold water - keep the butter for cooking. Put the affected area under cold running water for at least ten minutes. The best way to treat bleeding is to put the wound under a tap. If you put a bleeding wound under a tap you wash away the body's clotting agents and make it bleed more. Instead put pressure on the wound with whatever is available to stop or slow down the flow of blood. As soon as possible call 999. Keep pressure on the wound until help arrives. Nosebleeds are best treated by putting the head back. If you put the head back during a nosebleed, all the blood goes down the back of the airway. Instead advise them to tilt their head forwards and ask the person to pinch the end of their nose and breathe through their mouth. You need lots of training to do first aid. You don't - what you mostly need is common sense. You can learn enough first aid in a few minutes to save someone's life - whether it's from a book, attending a course or watching videos online. Remember: anyone can save a life Question: The most important point to save a person's life is to ensure _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"his smooth breath\\"?","completion":"No, the answer is not \\"his smooth breath.\\" While ensuring that someone can breathe is certainly crucial in many emergency situations, your statement simplifies the matter too much. The most important point to save someone's life varies considerably depending on the nature of their medical emergency. For instance, if someone is choking or their airway is blocked, then yes, clearing the airway is the immediate priority. This is due to the fact that the lack of oxygen can cause significant brain damage or death in a matter of minutes. However, if someone has suffered a severe cut or wound, then making sure they can breathe smoothly is not the immediate priority. In this case, applying pressure to the wound to stop or slow the bleeding should be the initial focus. If too much blood is lost, it can lead to a state of shock, which can be life-threatening. Another common misconception is treating a burn with butter or cream. As the article points out, the correct action is to cool the burn under cold running water to prevent further damage and alleviate pain. Similarly, for nosebleeds, the correct thing to do is to advise the person to tilt their head forwards and pinch their nose, contrary to the misconception of leaning the head back. It's also important to remember that you don't necessarily need lots of training to perform first aid, and that anyone can help save a life. Of course, formal training can be helpful, but much can be learned from reading a book, taking a brief online course, or even watching videos. In a situation where professional medical help is not immediately available, basic first aid knowledge coupled with common sense can potentially save someone's life. So, while ensuring a person's smooth breath is important in certain circumstances, it is not the single, always applicable answer to saving a person's life. It's necessary to assess the situation at hand, apply the correct first aid measures, and seek professional medical help as quickly as possible. So, in this context, your answer \\"his smooth breath\\" is overly simplistic and not always applicable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

And the answer is?","completion":"The make of car used as the platform for the time machine in the Back to the Future franchise is the DeLorean DMC-12. The DeLorean Motor Company, founded by John DeLorean, produced this unique sports car. Known simply as the \\"DeLorean,\\" the DMC-12 was the only model ever produced by the company before it went bankrupt in 1982. The car featured distinct gull-wing doors, a brushed stainless-steel body, and a rear-mounted engine. It was manufactured between 1981 and 1983, with only around 9,000 units produced. The DeLorean became iconic and garnered significant attention after its appearance in the Back to the Future films, directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Spielberg. The first movie in the trilogy was released in July 1985, starring Michael J. Fox as teenager Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as the eccentric inventor Dr. Emmett \\"Doc\\" Brown. The DeLorean was transformed into a time machine by Doc Brown, who retrofitted the vehicle with a \\"flux capacitor\\" and later, \\"Mr. Fusion,\\" which allowed for time travel when the car reached the speed of 88 miles per hour. The DMC-12 became an integral part of the story throughout the Back to the Future trilogy, with Marty and Doc Brown traveling to various points in time, including 1955, 2015, and 1885. The DeLorean went through several modifications in each film, such as hover capabilities in \\"Back to the Future Part II\\" and a primitive 19th-century steam engine replacement in \\"Back to the Future Part III.\\" Although the DeLorean Motor Company ceased operating in 1982, the DeLorean DMC-12's cinematic role ensured its place in pop culture history. Today, the car remains a highly sought-after collector's item, particularly among fans of the Back to the Future franchise. Several restoration initiatives and companies now exist, dedicated to servicing and supplying parts for DeLorean owners around the world. Additionally, the vehicle's unique design and association with time travel have made it a mainstay in discussions of 1980s nostalgia and entertainment history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the actual person who began composing songs in a distinctive, original style on his return to England in 1918? Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

Paul and Audrey Safranek, a married couple in Omaha with financial problems, meet Dave and Carol Johnson, who have downsized. While the inventors advocate that downsizing is environmentally friendly through the reduction of waste, Dave argues that its benefits extend far beyond that and improve one's life through the increase in value of their money. Exploring the possibilities of downsizing, Paul and Audrey agree to undergo the process and move to Leisureland, New Mexico, one of the most popular communities for small individuals. After undergoing downsizing, Paul receives a call from Audrey, saying that she was unable to go through with the procedure and, by opting out at the last minute, will be leaving him. One year later, Paul finalizes the divorce with Audrey, and settles in to his new apartment (a downsizing of its own from the mansion he was to originally share with Audrey). Although Paul had anticipated a life of relative ease, the divorce left him without Audrey's share of their assets. In addition, Paul's share of the asset shrank further still due to divorce settlement negotiations. Paul, whose occupational therapist license had lapsed and faced a re-certification process due to Leisureland being in another state, now works as a customer service representative for Lands' End.

A cutting board, a flat baking sheet, or a peel will work for your surface. A peel is a wide flat tool for your pizza.

Options: - smiley - house clean - getting good grades - feeling satisfied - boredom Explain why a human would choose \\"feeling satisfied\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"feeling satisfied\\" to answer the question above due to the psychological and emotional impact housework has on an individual. Let us break down each option and analyze why \\"feeling satisfied\\" is the most suitable choice: 1. Smiley: Although seeing the desired results of housework might make the person smile, this option does not effectively convey the emotional state or the sense of accomplishment that comes from completing housework. Smiling is just an expression or action and does not necessarily imply satisfaction. 2. House clean: This option merely states a fact about housework; it is true that doing housework results in a clean house. However, it doesn't tell us anything about how the person feels after completing the housework, nor does it answer the question of how housework affects the individual emotionally. 3. Getting good grades: This option seems unrelated to the context of housework. Good grades are typically associated with an academic setting, and there is no direct correlation between housework and academic performance. 4. Feeling satisfied: This option aligns with how people can experience a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment after completing tasks in general, including housework. Satisfactory results from housework can provide a sense of control, orderliness, and pride in one's living environment. Additionally, satisfaction might arise from realizing that the effort invested in housework has directly improved the cleanliness and organization of the living space, creating a more comfortable and pleasing environment for oneself and others. 5. Boredom: This option is not a suitable answer because the question explicitly states that the person is seeing the \\"desired results\\" of housework, implying that the task had a positive outcome. Boredom doesn't fit within this context, as it typically results from a lack of interest or engagement in an activity. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"feeling satisfied\\" to answer the question because it best captures the emotional response and sense of accomplishment that people often experience when they have successfully completed housework. This satisfaction stems from the improved cleanliness, orderliness, and comfort of their living environment, as well as the pride they take in their ability to maintain and care for their home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is a question about this article: Alexander faced pressure from his brother, Duke Constantine, to make peace with Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms–demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia, and hand over the Ionian Islands to France. By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of 1,100 square miles called Westphalia. He then appointed his young brother Jérôme as the new monarch of this kingdom. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the Napoleonic era progressed.

Fat chance you say? Exactly. Nearly a third of Mexican adults are obese, a recent United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization report says, topping even the United States, which comes in a close second at 31.8%. The United States has long been a fixture atop the chubby list. The culprit? High-calorie, low-cost, processed foods and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle as Mexican incomes rise and more people move into metropolitan areas.

Q: In September, a new and widely advertised school opened its doors in the capital city - the Part-time Evening Elementary School. You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member. During the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC. Question: Who is Editor Frank? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"Editor Frank, mentioned in the passage, is not directly explained or introduced, and it is possible that the name has been incorrectly mentioned or that there is a potential typo. The context in which the name \\"Editor Frank\\" appears refers to \\"Editor Furtok\\", which could potentially be the correct name. Editor Furtok is a parent of one of the children who got accepted into the Part-time Evening Elementary School (PEES), specifically the group B2/platform PC. When a frustrated father whose child was not accepted into the school accused the school of only accepting VIP brats, Editor Furtok was offended and physically assaulted the disappointed father as a reaction. In the given information, it is not detailed on whether Editor Furtok is named Frank or if he holds a position at a newspaper, magazine, or any other publication. However, the fact that he is referred to as an \\"editor\\" suggests that he might be involved in that professional field. The PEES, as mentioned in the passage, is a school for children of wealthy families who spend their days playing computer games and need a school that operates during evening hours. Created by Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher and computer games fan, the school offers various classes focused on different gaming platforms. The institution was in high demand, resulting in a competitive and violent registration process. Parents were required to pass a joystick test and provide proof of income for their children to be admitted to the school. This uniquely tailored educational institution serves the needs of parents who seek peace and quiet while their children are preoccupied with computer games, making it a popular choice among affluent families. To sum up, Editor Frank might be an incorrect mention or a typo in the passage, and the relevant person could be Editor Furtok. He is a parent who successfully got his child into the PEES and is involved in an altercation with another parent during the admission process. There is no additional information provided about his professional background or his full name, but the title \\"editor\\" could indicate that he works in the publishing or media sector."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In Sentence 1, the river flows from Playgreen Lake, while in Sentence 2, the river flows into Playgreen Lake from Lake Winnipeg. This implies that the river is originating from Lake Winnipeg in Sentence 2, whereas the source of the river is not clear in Sentence 1. 2. In Sentence 1, the river flows into Cross Lake before flowing from two channels to Winnipeg Lake. In Sentence 2, the river flows from two channels into Cross Lake after coming from Lake Winnipeg.

Given the following context: Although the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141–87 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon. answer the following question: What did the Tibetans capture in 678?

Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: You do not have to express emotions with every person you talk with. When you are first expressing your emotions, you may feel silly or vulnerable, so you must choose friends and family that you trust to withhold judgments, and accept that you are striving to make changes. When you are conversing with others, exaggerate your facial expressions, hand gestures, and emotional responses. If you go over the top with your emotions, you can learn to rein in your emotional response over time. You may feel silly being over the top about your emotions, but if you choose the right people to do this with, it will not matter, and will be of ultimate benefit to you. Be cautions when being overly expressive. Ensure you think about your emotions and actions before you act on them. If you are overly emotive about being angry, you might come across as hostile or dangerous. So emote with caution! Emotions are felt stronger when a behavior is attached to them, even if the behavior is not a natural response. You can ‘fake’ cry when you know you feel sad. This will elevate and intensify your emotional sadness, and may lead to real crying or, at least, a greater show of emotion. Emotions contain certain impulses (fear elicits the fight or flight response, anger elicits retaliation) that you have no control over. When you have these impulses, do not fight against them; instead amplify them so they show outwardly. Using physical contact can be helpful in expressing your emotions. Physical touch can impart emotion in a way our facial expressions or verbal tone cannot. Recent scientific studies have shown that humans have an innate ability to decipher emotions through physical touch alone. When someone makes you happy, gently place you hand on their shoulder. When you feel disgust, squeeze someone’s arm. Physical touch is not welcomed by everyone, and if done incorrectly, may not be well received. Pick up on nonverbal cues from others about their acceptance of physical touch, and do it moderation. Not every situation calls for emotion, such as a work meeting, while others, such as talking with your significant other, require a more heightened emotive response. Judge each situation independently to decide the level of emotion you should show.","completion":"Sometimes, it's hard to show our feelings when we talk to people. It's important to choose special friends and family who make us feel safe to share our emotions with. Try using your face and hands to show more feelings, but be careful not to be too much. Also, sometimes touching someone gently can help show your feelings, but not everyone likes that. Remember, some places are not the best to show a lot of emotions, like at work. Always think about the right moment and people to share your feelings with."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Given the question: Given the below context: Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts.

But in September 1984, Maria is shot and killed, and Rob claims she was murdered by a robber while he was changing a flat tire. When the police commence their investigations, however, they discover unsettling truths about the Marshalls: Rob has secretly accumulated an enormous debt and has secured a second mortgage of 100,000 in Maria's name, and is having an affair with a married neighbor, Felice Richmond (Robin Strasser). Maria had known of the affair, and had considered divorce but decided to work on their marriage shortly before she was killed. Felice gives the police a statement that Rob wanted to get rid of his wife to collect on her life insurance, and he immediately becomes the prime suspect. At first, Rob's friends and sons support him. But they begin to notice that he does not seem to be in mourning over Maria's death, and Rob's best friend Sal (Joe Spano) is angry that he is more interested in building a future with Felice. Rob is advised by his lawyer not to contact Felice because it could influence his image; this troubles Rob, who is deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, the police have expanded their list of suspects to include Andrew Meyers (Jake Dengel), a Louisiana shop clerk who had contact with Rob concerning his financial problems, and Arnie Eggers, a rumored hitman. As all evidence seems to point to Rob, Felice breaks off their relationship, which leads him to unsuccessfully attempt suicide in a motel. By this point, Chris admits for the first time that he suspects his father might in fact be guilty. Roby and John are both shocked to hear this, strongly believing in their father's innocence.

Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Romans\\" correctly answer the question \\"Around 2000 b.c. what groups were settling in France?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"Romans\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Around 2000 b.c. what groups were settling in France?\\" According to the paragraph, around 2000 B.C., Celtic tribes from eastern Europe were settling in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Burgundy, while migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south.

What is the final step of the following process: - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood The answer to this question is:","completion":"The final step of this process is the restoration of blood sugar levels back to normal. Here's a detailed explanation of the process: When there's a drop in blood sugar concentration in the body, this is typically due to factors like prolonged periods of fasting, heavy exercise, or an insulin overshoot in the management of diabetes. This decrease is detected by alpha cells in the pancreas, which then secrete the hormone glucagon as a response. Glucagon acts on hepatic (liver) cells. Once it reaches these cells, it initiates a process known as glycogenolysis. This process involves the conversion of stored glycogen, a multi-branched polysaccharide of glucose, into glucose molecules. The liver, which can store considerable amounts of this glycogen, begins to break it down into glucose, thereby increasing glucose levels in the blood. The glucose that is produced by the liver in response to glucagon is then released into the bloodstream. This introduction of glucose into the blood helps restore the blood glucose levels back to their normal range (homeostasis). It is a critical action as the brain and other organs primarily use glucose for their energy requirements. Regulated by negative feedback, this glucagon-induced increase in blood glucose levels eventually signals the pancreatic alpha cells to stop releasing glucagon, preventing the glucose concentration from getting too high. Hence, the final step includes the re-stabilization of blood sugar levels to a normal range, which the body systems can effectively utilize for energy production. This process exemplifies the body's critical balance and regulatory mechanism to maintain the right amount of blood sugar, which is crucial for proper body functioning. The key here is the elaborate coordination between the pancreas, the liver, and the amount of sugar in your blood to ensure that your body maintains homeostasis. Without this intricate balance, one may experience detrimental health effects associated with blood sugar levels that are either too low (hypoglycemia) or too high (hyperglycemia)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Real Madrid, in Search of Perfection, Axes Ancelotti Real Madrid fired manager Carlo Ancelotti on Monday, making him the 12th coaching casualty since 2003 at one of the most trigger-happy clubs in Europe. Ancelotti paid the price for a spring without a major title, despite delivering Real’s coveted 10th European cup just a year ago. Real president Florentino Perez made the announcement at a news conference in Madrid on Monday evening. “It was not an easy decision but it is time to reinvigorate the team to conquer new titles,” he said in Spanish. He added that the club’s board would announce a replacement next week. Real finished its La Liga campaign as runners-up to Barcelona over the weekend, while its Champions League challenge fell apart in the semifinals against Juventus this month. Its failure in the domestic cup also helped eclipse a run of 22 straight victories for Real Madrid over the winter. In an interview published in his native Italy earlier in the day, Ancelotti, 55, said that he was due to have back surgery. Though he would have liked another year, he said that he would have required some time off to recover anyway. Ancelotti succeeded Jose Mourinho at Madrid in the summer of 2013 as the club sought to end a Champions League dry spell that had dragged on for more than a decade. He delivered the elusive 10th title, the so-called Decima, last spring in Lisbon. Real defeated crosstown rival Atlético Madrid in extra time of a nerve-shredding final. In 2014, Real also beat Barcelona in the final of the Copa del Rey, Spain’s domestic cup. But big results in the league were harder to come by. Ancelotti lost three of his four Clasicos in La Liga play. “He is part of our history because he was the coach with whom we have won La Decima,” Perez said. “But as we all know, Real Madrid’s standard is high.” Reports in Spain have mentioned former Liverpool and Chelsea manager Rafael Benitez as a potential successor. Benitez, who won two league titles in his native Spain with Valencia in the early 2000s, has spent the past two seasons in charge of Napoli in Italy’s Serie A.

For example, no other empress' residence was as decorated as Khas Mahal (part of Agra Fort), where Mumtaz lived with Shah Jahan. It was decorated with pure gold and precious stones and had rose water fountains of its own. Each wife of the Mughal emperor was given regular monthly allowance for her gastos (housekeeping or travelling expenses). The highest allowance on record is 10 lakh rupees per year given to Mumtaz Mahal under Shah Jahan. Shah Jahan consulted Mumtaz in both private matters and the affairs of the state and she served as his close confidante and trusted adviser. At her intercession, he forgave enemies or commuted death sentences. His trust in her was so great that he gave her the highest honour of the land -- his imperial seal, the Mehr Uzaz, which validated imperial decrees. Mumtaz was portrayed as having no aspirations to political power, in contrast to her aunt, Empress Nur Jahan, the chief consort of Emperor Jahangir, who had wielded considerable influence in the previous reign. A great influence on him, often intervening on behalf of the poor and destitute, she also enjoyed watching elephant and combat fights performed for the court. Mumtaz also patronized a number of poets, scholars and other talented persons. A noted Sanskrit poet, Vansidhara Mishra, was the Empress' favourite. On the recommendation of her principal lady-in-waiting, Sati-un-Nissa, Mumtaz Mahal provided pensions and donations to the daughters of poor scholars, theologians, and pious men. It was quite common for women of noble birth to commission architecture in the Mughal Empire, so Mumtaz devoted some time to a riverside garden in Agra, which is now known as Zahara Bagh. It is the only architectural foundation which can be connected to her patronage.

When she awakens she's considerably hotter (the parts played by Debbie Rochon in this sequel), and out for revenge on those that did her wrong. As the sub-title and box art implies this is indeed a take off on the \\"Kill Bill\\" films, but this being a Chris Seaver's film, it's a wildly incompetent satire (and I use that last term extremely loosely) I'd love to say this is better than the first film, but truth be told I was so impossibly drunk off my ass when I saw the previous film that I can't even hope to compare the two at this point in time. But I must have enjoyed it since I bought the sequel (see when I'm drunk I like, for lack of a better word, complete and total crappy movies) There are a few laugh out loud moments (very few) but I do remember Bonejack being funnier though.

Context: Li Zicheng and Tibetans were fought against by the Monguors, who supported the Ming, and when the Qing fought against Li's forces after 1644 they joined the Qing side. Late in 1646, forces assembled by a Muslim leader known in Chinese sources as Milayin revolted against Qing rule in Ganzhou . He was soon joined by another Muslim named Ding Guodong . Proclaiming that they wanted to restore the fallen Ming, they occupied a number of towns in Gansu, including the provincial capital Lanzhou. These rebels' willingness to collaborate with non-Muslim Chinese suggests that they were not only driven by religion, and were not aiming to create an Islamic state. To pacify the rebels, the Qing government quickly despatched Meng Qiaofang , governor of Shaanxi, a former Ming official who had surrendered to the Qing in 1631. Both Milayin and Ding Guodong were captured and killed in 1648, and by 1650 the Muslim rebels had been crushed in campaigns that inflicted heavy casualties. The Muslim Ming loyalists were supported by the Muslim Chagatid Kumul Khanate and the Turfan Khanate and after their defeat, Kumul submitted to the Qing.

Write a text based on this summary: depleted uranium threatens balkan cancer epidemic Text:","completion":"Title: Alarming Concerns Rise as Depleted Uranium Threatens a Cancer Epidemic in the Balkans Region Introduction Depleted uranium, a toxic waste product from nuclear power plants, is an alarming cause for concern as it threatens to fuel a cancer epidemic in the Balkans region. Known for its use as a radioactive material in the production of munitions and armor-piercing weaponry, depleted uranium has the potential to cause severe environmental and health hazards in areas where it has been used. I. The Growing Prevalence of Depleted Uranium in the Balkans A. Military Conflicts The use of depleted uranium in military conflicts in the Balkans region, such as the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, has significantly contributed to the dispersion of this toxic material. The radioactive waste generated in these confrontations has led to an increase in the number of contaminated sites throughout the Balkans, posing a dire threat to public health and the environment. B. Environmental Impact Depleted uranium can easily seep into soil and groundwater, contaminating essential resources for human and animal life. The pollution caused by discharged toxic materials and the decay of weapons systems results in the bioaccumulation of radioactive substances in local ecosystems. As organisms consume contaminated resources, larger predators and humans are ultimately affected, leading to severe health problems in both humans and wildlife. II. Health Dangers of Depleted Uranium Exposure A. Elevated Cancer Rates Long-term exposure to depleted uranium has been linked to a sharp increase in cancer rates among affected populations. Radioactive materials released from munitions and armor casings can infiltrate air, water, and soil, leading to the ingestion of hazardous substances by unsuspecting individuals. The high levels of radiation can cause DNA mutations, leading to the development of malignant tumors. B. Pregnant Women and Children Most vulnerable to the health risks posed by depleted uranium are pregnant women and children, as both groups are more prone to experiencing harmful effects from radiation exposure. In particular, unborn children exposed to elevated levels of radiation may face an increased risk of developing congenital defects, neurological problems, and other serious health complications. III. Current Measures and Efforts to Address the Situation A. Clean Up and Remediation Efforts In response to the threats posed by depleted uranium, international organizations and local governments are taking on the responsibility of clearing contaminated sites and implementing strategies for the safe disposal of material waste. These efforts play a crucial role in mitigating further contamination in the region, but challenges remain in terms of funding and stakeholder involvement. B. Public Awareness and Education Campaigns Public awareness and educational campaigns are essential for enabling affected communities to understand the risks associated with depleted uranium exposure. By providing vital information and resources, these organizations empower individuals to take informed action in safeguarding themselves and their families from potential health threats. IV. Conclusion: The Need for Concerted Action and Global Cooperation The perils of depleted uranium in the Balkans region underscore the necessity for robust global cooperation in order to successfully combat this looming cancer epidemic. It is imperative for countries to collaborate in the development and enforcement of effective measures, including the prohibition of manufacturing and using depleted uranium weapons. By acknowledging and confronting this escalating public health hazard, global leaders can effectively safeguard future generations and protect the environment from the detrimental effects of depleted uranium contamination."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - A papal bull is a particular type of public decree, letters patent, or charter issued by a pope of the Roman Catholic Church. It is named after the lead seal (\\"bulla\\") that was traditionally appended to the end in order to authenticate it. - The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem was a crusader state established in the Southern Levant in 1099 after the First Crusade. The kingdom lasted nearly two hundred years, from 1099 until 1291 when the last remaining possession, Acre, was destroyed by the Mamluks, but its history is divided into two distinct periods. The sometimes so-called First Kingdom of Jerusalem lasted from 1099 to 1187, when it was almost entirely overrun by Saladin. After the subsequent Third Crusade, the kingdom was re-established in Acre in 1192, and lasted until that city's destruction in 1291. This second kingdom is sometimes called the Second Kingdom of Jerusalem or the Kingdom of Acre, after its new capital. - An-Nasir Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (/ ALA-LC: \\"al ad-Dn Ysuf ibn Ayyb\\"; / ALC-LC: \\"Selahedînê Eyûbî\\"), known as Saladin (1137 4 March 1193), was the first sultan of Egypt and Syria and the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. A Sunni Muslim of Kurdish origin, Saladin led the Muslim military campaign against the Crusader states in the Levant. At the height of his power, his sultanate included Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, the Hejaz, Yemen and other parts of North Africa. - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God. - The Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem was a Roman Catholic military order founded by crusaders around 1119 at a leper hospital in Jerusalem , Kingdom of Jerusalem , whose care became its original purpose , named after patron saint Lazarus . It was recognised by King Fulk of Jerusalem in 1142 and canonically recognised as hospitaller and military order of chivalry under the rule of Saint Augustine in the Papal bull Cum a Nobis Petitur of Pope Alexander IV in 1255 . The titular seat was successively situated at Jerusalem , Saint - Jean - d'Acre and - after the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem - the Château Royal de Boigny - sur - Bionne in France . After several centuries , the order went into decline and ceased to perform its original functions after the French Revolution . In 1489 , Pope Innocent VIII attempted to merge the order and its land holdings with the Sovereign Military Order of Malta . This was resisted by the order in most countries where it still retained its premises . In 1572 , the Order of Saint Lazarus in Italy was merged with the Order of Saint Maurice under the Royal House of Savoy to form the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus , which still exists until today . In 1609 , King Henry IV of France linked it administratively to the Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel to form the Royal Military and Hospitaller Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem united , which remained listed as of royal protection in the French Royal Almanac until 1830 . Its last living member admitted before the turmoil of the French Revolution died in 1856 . Notwithstanding , the revived Order of Saint Lazarus ( statuted 1910 ) claims legacy from the suppressed French branch under spiritual protection of the Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church , disputed by officials of the Roman Catholic Church . - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world. - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. - The First Crusade (10951099) was the first of a number of crusades that attempted to capture the Holy Land, called by Pope Urban II in 1095. It started as a widespread pilgrimage in western Christendom and ended as a military expedition by Roman Catholic Europe to regain the Holy Land taken in the Muslim conquests of the Levant (632661), ultimately resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Abrahamic religions, emphasizing and tracing their common origin to the tribal patriarch Abraham or recognizing a spiritual tradition identified with him, are one of the major divisions in comparative religion (along with Indian, Iranian, and East Asian religions). Judaism, Christianity and Islam are the largest Abrahamic religions in terms of numbers of adherents. - Mamluk (Arabic: \\"mamlk\\" (singular), \\"mamlk\\" (plural), meaning \\"property\\" , also transliterated as \\"mamlouk\\", \\"mamluq\\", \\"mamluke\\", \\"mameluk\\", \\"mameluke\\", \\"mamaluke\\" or \\"marmeluke\\") is an Arabic designation for slaves. The term is most commonly used to refer to Muslim slave soldiers and Muslim rulers of slave origin. - Abraham (Avraham), originally Abram, is the first of the three patriarchs of Judaism. His story features in the holy texts of all the Abrahamic religions and Abraham plays a prominent role as an example of faith in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. - A patron saint, patroness saint, patron hallow or heavenly protector is a saint who in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy is regarded as the heavenly advocate of a nation, place, craft, activity, class, clan, family or person. Catholics believe that patron saints, having already transcended to the metaphysical, are able to intercede effectively for the needs of their special charges. What is the relationship between 'order of saint lazarus' and 'christianity'?","completion":"The relationship between the Order of Saint Lazarus and Christianity lies in their shared religious origins and the role the order played in protecting and supporting the Christian faith. The Order of Saint Lazarus was a Roman Catholic military order founded by crusaders around 1119 at a leper hospital in Jerusalem, then part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, a Crusader state established during the First Crusade. The order's original purpose was the care of those afflicted with leprosy and other diseases, reflecting the Christian values of charity and compassion. The Order was named after its patron saint, Lazarus, who, according to Christian belief, was raised from the dead by Jesus Christ. Over time, the Order of Saint Lazarus evolved into both a hospitaller and military order, committed to defending Christian lands and territories from external threats, particularly during the Crusades, when Christian forces sought to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslim control. The Order of Saint Lazarus played a significant role in defending the Christian faith and assisting fellow Christian military orders, such as the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller, during these religious conflicts. The Order of Saint Lazarus maintained a strong connection with the Roman Catholic Church, adhering to its doctrines and receiving canonical recognition as a military and hospitaller order from Pope Alexander IV in a papal bull in 1255. Throughout its existence, the order was closely tied to Christianity, as its members were religiously motivated to protect and serve the faith, as well as provide care to those in need. In summary, the relationship between the Order of Saint Lazarus and Christianity is based on their shared religious origins, the order's commitment to protecting and promoting the Christian faith, and its members' adherence to the doctrines, values, and guidance of the Roman Catholic Church. The Order of Saint Lazarus exemplifies the fusion of religious faith and military action that characterized much of the medieval era and the Crusades in particular, all in the name of Christianity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ever since Steven Levitt published “Freak-onomics,” in 2005, books explaining everyday pheno-mena in economic terms have been flying off the bestseller shelves and – proving that economists respond rationally to incentives – inspiring imitators. Tim Harford struck early with his celebrated “The Undercover Economist,” and he has now followed up with “The Logic of Life: The Rational Economics of an Irrational World,” which should do well for Harford’s personal economy, too. But why, exactly, are books like this so popular? And do they really deliver useful insights? At one level, the appeal is obvious: The world is a complex place, and any approach that lets us lay down some sort of a grid that makes sense of all that confusion seems pretty good. People are often ready to accept approaches that are fairly obviously bogus (astrology? aura readings?), so a simplifying and clarifying approach that has academic respectability is even more appealing. It helps even more that this approach often works. Lots of things that are confusing turn out to make sense in a reliable way when you apply economic reasoning. The laws of supply and demand matter; things seldom turn out to be worth more (or less) than the discounted present value of their future revenues; and people generally put out more effort for their own behalf than they do for the benefit of others. Systems structured around these truths tend to succeed, while systems that deny them tend to fail. Even better, it’s fun. Much that seems on the surface inexplicable turns out to make perfect logical sense once you understand the incentives and how people respond to them. And that’s the approach of Harford’s latest work. Though fun, it’s not Pollyannaish. Harford makes clear that people, acting rationally as individuals, can nonetheless act in ways that, from the standpoint of society, seem irrational and destructive. Thus, understanding the underlying rationales is the key to understanding and addressing the problems. At any rate, most of the fun in Harwood’s book is found in the specific topics he addresses, and the way he reveals – much like a magician or a mystery author – the solution to the questions he presents. Why do single women outnumber single men in Manhattan? Because women, seeking men who make a lot of money, converge on places that are rich in men who make a lot of money. Then those women complain that there aren’t enough good men. “Manhattan’s women may constantly grumble about the lack of marriageable men in the city, but it is their rational choice not to relocate to Alaska,” he writes. But it turns out that the imbalance causes more problems than sheer scarcity. Eligible males benefit from competition among eligible females, allowing them to commit later, expect sex earlier and so on, and even a slight imbalance in the gender ratio produces a big imbalance in dating power, since women don’t want to be left empty-handed at the end. Nor is this limited to the wealthy, as Harford observes a similar pattern in poor black neighborhoods where a higher percentage of men are in prison or otherwise poor marriage prospects, drastically strengthening the bargaining position of those who remain. (Of course, it’s a two-edged sword: When I was a single lawyer at a big Wall Street firm, I felt that many women saw me as a walking paycheck, more interested in my prospects than my personality, just as many women feel that some men are more interested in certain other attributes. I suppose that’s different for lawyers nowadays, with the much-richer hedge-fund guys around to play the walking-paycheck role.) On the other hand, while the dating market may favor men, Harford suggests that shifts toward easier divorce laws – generally thought to favor men by making it easier to leave a dutiful wife behind in favor of a mistress or future “trophy wife” – actually have benefited women. Formerly kept out of the workforce by the demands of raising a family, and the benefits that came from specialization, women – largely freed from housework by smaller family size and modern appliances – looked at things differently in light of easy divorce and readily available contraception. While promises that women could “have it all” may have been somewhat overstated, it doesn’t seem like hyperbole compared to what had come before. It was the threat of divorce that jumpstarted things, Harford argues: “Realizing that the economic unit might break up, at which point a woman who simply specialized in having children was in serious trouble, it became rational for a woman to maintain career options as divorce insurance. . . . Because divorce was conceivable, women preserved career options. But because women had career options, divorce became conceivable. It became less and less likely that a woman would become trapped in a miserable marriage out of pure economic necessity.” The result was a shift from the man’s world workplace of the 1960s and 1970s to a world in which the workplace in many ways favors women over men, as well as a decrease in domestic abuse in homes. There are downsides, of course – there are fewer unhappy marriages, but also more divorces. And there’s another downside that Harford doesn’t mention, but that goes with the theme of rational actors and societal downsides: The entry of women into high-powered careers seems to have led to more “assortative mating” where high-earning professional males, who if they married a coworker 50 years ago would have married a secretary or file clerk, now tend to marry other high-earners like themselves. That tends to cause the rich (or at least the upper middle class) to get richer and removes from the poor one major path of upward mobility; now the secretaries have a poorer shot at marrying the boss. Poor cities, on the other hand, face a different problem. As a first approximation, you might think that a city with a weak economy and plunging real estate prices might find those problems mitigated because the lower real estate prices would draw in new people. And you’d be right. But Harford notes that this can actually compound the problem. High-earning people would rather live in Manhattan, despite high rents, because that puts them in a better position to associate with (and perhaps assortatively mate with) other high-skill, high-earning people. The people who tend to move into the depressed neighborhoods of Detroit, on the other hand, usually move there because it’s cheap, meaning that they don’t have much money, and as a group tend to bring fewer skills and interests that might make those neighborhoods a better place. Worse yet, these tendencies tend to be self-reinforcing and long-lasting. Again, the better off tend to do better, and the poor tend to do worse – at least if “better off” means “well off enough to pay Manhattan rents.” On the other hand, high rents in Manhattan tend to be self-reinforcing and long-lasting, too. And this is because of the rational behavior of special interests, those who already own Manhattan real estate. Harford writes: “Back in 1970s, the price of a house anywhere in America – even an apartment in Manhattan – was not much more than the cost of building it.” But zoning regulations have driven those costs up in urban areas like Manhattan, to an estimated cost of nearly 10,000 per person per year, mostly as higher rents and mortgage payments. This is bad for Manhattan, but good for landlords and homeowners, who support regulation at the expense of renters. (Such restrictions are promoted as bringing environmental benefits, but Harford argues pretty persuasively that those environmental benefits are nonexistent, serving largely as a smokescreen for privilege.) There’s much more to Harford’s book – I haven’t even gotten to his explanation of why the increase in oral sex among teenagers is a sign of rational risk assessment rather than depravity – but these examples will have to do. So how well does Harford’s analysis hold up? Pretty well. At times, Harford can seem a bit facile – for every divorcee fulfilling herself in a high-powered corporate job, I suspect that there’s probably at least one divorced waitress in a truck stop who’d rather be home with her kids. But the benefit of books like “The Logic of Life” doesn’t come from the specific policy insights. The real benefit lies in exposing a large number of readers to the economic worldview, one in which people generally know what they want, and rationally try to obtain it, and in which human behavior isn’t easily changed by ham-handed government action and wishful thinking. This notion, together with its corollary – there is no free lunch – is something that our political classes tend to forget, or at least to want to ignore. In this election year, we should thank Harford for educating voters a bit more. Glenn Reynolds is the Beauchamp Brogan Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Tennessee, and runs instapundit.com The Rational Economics of an Irrational World Why do more women than men live in Manhattan? Studies of Internet dating have shown what we all suspect: that women look for high earners and men look for young, attractive women. It’s a carryover of evolutionary biology, when powerful men could protect a family better, and younger women could produce more offspring. Since a woman who earns more money isn’t important for men, unskilled men are more likely to move out of a city with rising rents. Unskilled women will stick around for the chance to land rich men. “In New York, there are 860,000 men between the ages of 20 and 34, but there are 910,000 women. Consciously or not, plenty of women seem to have decided they would rather compete for scarce, wealthy males than move where the males are poorer but more plentiful,” Harford writes. On the impact of the Pill There are many, but one is that it increased the number of women lawyers and doctors. Since women could delay having children for longer periods of time – but not give up sex – “that made it rational to invest in training for a career with a long prequalification period, such as law, medicine or dentistry. Female enrollment in law and medical school soared as the pill became available.” On the epidemic of teenage oral sex It doesn’t have to do with loosening morals or kids gone wrong. It’s that young people who would ordinarily be having sex have had the fear of AIDS drilled into them from puberty. “Regular sex is more costly than it used to be because of the spread of HIV/AIDS,” Harford writes. “The costs of oral sex are, quite simply, lower than the costs of regular sex.” Other economic studies show that where parental notification of abortion laws are passed, gonorrhea rates among teens drop. As unlikely as it sounds, apparently teens do think through having sex – particularly if the consequences are greater. On whether people are looking for “the one” Harford studied 2,000 speed dates, and noted that people’s standards depended on who showed up. “For example, men prefer women who are not overweight. You might think, then, that if on a particular evening twice as many overweight women as usual show up, it will be a night when fewer men propose a date. Not at all. The men propose a date just as frequently, so that when twice as many overweight women turn up, twice as many overweight women receive offers of a date.” While you would expect people to just give up and go home if they didn’t see anyone who fit their “type,” “instead, people respond to slim pickings by lowering their standards.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"\\"The Logic of Life: The Rational Economics of an Irrational World\\" by Tim Harford is a book that uses economic principles to explain puzzling social phenomena and encourages readers to understand the world through an economic viewpoint, where people know what they want and try to obtain it rationally.

After some observation, he discovers that all the ants travel down one of two distinct paths in order to find food to bring back to the colony. After taking some measurements, Ricky sees that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, and path B is approximately 150 meters in length. Ricky is now trying to make some scientific conclusions based on these observations. Which path will allow for more time for the pheromones on that path to evaporate? Hint: In the natural world, ants of some species (initially) wander randomly, and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down pheromone trails. If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see Ant communication). Over time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.[8] Answer:","completion":"Path B will allow for more time for the pheromones to evaporate. Since path B is longer (150 meters) compared to path A (100 meters), it will take ants more time to travel down the path and back again, which gives more time for the pheromone trail to evaporate. As a result, the pheromone density will be lower on the longer path (path B) than on the shorter path (path A)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction and disappointment with multiple aspects of their experience at the sushi place. They start by comparing the flavor of the sushi to other establishments in the Valley, implying that the taste is inferior. Additionally, they mention that the price is higher, which adds to their dissatisfaction. The sentiment turns more negative when the reviewer discusses their interaction with the chef regarding the extra eel sauce. The use of hyperbolic language (\\"acted like I had asked for his first born\\") emphasizes their discontent with the chef's attitude and the limited amount of the sauce they received. The words \\"total bummer\\" indicate that the entire experience failed to meet the reviewer's expectations. Finally, the reviewer expresses regret over the disappointing experience at a location that is conveniently close to them, which adds to their frustration and overall negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Answer based on context: Following their victory against the Panthers, the Bengals played another home game, this week, against the visiting Falcons. In the first quarter, the Falcons drew first blood, as kicker Morten Andersen nailed a 42-yard field goal. The Bengals responded with a 1-yard TD run by running back Rudi Johnson. Atlanta cut the lead to one point, when Andersen kicked a 40-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Cincinnati added to their lead with quarterback Carson Palmer's 12-yard TD pass to wide receiver Chad Johnson. The Falcons responded with quarterback Michael Vick's 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end Alge Crumpler. Bengal kicker Shayne Graham converted a 51-yard field goal with&#160;:20 left before halftime. In the third quarter, Vick completed a 26-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Michael Jenkins. Graham would kick a 26-yard field goal for Cincinnati's only score of the quarter. Vick scored another touchdown, on an 8-yard pass to fullback Justin Griffith. The extra point ended with a bobbled snap, and a failed two-point conversion. In the fourth quarter, Andersen converted a 39-yard field goal. Palmer responded with a 55-yard touchdown to WR Chris Henry. Cincinnati's comeback hopes ended with&#160;:13 left, when Carson Palmer was sacked, and fumbled, which was recovered by Atlanta. The Bengals record fell to 4-3.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Now, I have a new situation: Tim the seismologist studied data from two cities: Tokyo and Kansas City. Tokyo experienced many more earthquakes than Kansas City. Answer this question please: Which city experiences less energy release because of rocks breaking? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Kansas City experiences less energy release due to rocks breaking when compared to Tokyo. This is because Tokyo experiences many more earthquakes than Kansas City, and earthquakes involve the release of energy stored in rocks when they break. Therefore, with more earthquakes occurring in Tokyo, it is evident that the energy release is higher in Tokyo as opposed to Kansas City."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. You are given a new situation: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first. and a hint : It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. Please answer this question : Which group's cans had the air molecules inside move slower?","completion":"Group George's cans had the air molecules inside move slower because they vented their soup cans first, which allowed the pressure inside the cans to release as they were being heated. This prevented excessive pressure buildup and reduced the kinetic energy of the air molecules compared to the cans of Group Jones, which exploded due to increased pressure and faster-moving air molecules."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stealing Your Privacy -- It's Google Once Again After weeks of controversy, today Google will formally implement a new privacy policy that will enable the Internet giant to build more complete profiles of you when you interact with Google anywhere on the web. The company's abysmal track record on privacy demonstrates why consumers, elected officials and privacy experts are appalled by the change and by their continued indifference to privacy protections. In fact, when it comes to consumer privacy and Google, it's time to get angry. Google has made apologies and promises to the public, settled a suit with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) by signing a 20-year consent decree, and attempted to placate Congress with vague descriptions of its privacy and search practices. Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google deliberately circumvented privacy protections in Apple's Safari web browser when used on the iPhone and any computer running Safari. Even when consumers followed Google and Apple's instructions to protect their privacy, the Internet search giant secretly engineered special code to track a user's web browsing. And last week, a group of 36 state attorneys general -- from both political parties -- wrote to Google expressing serious concerns about their upcoming privacy policy changes: \\"[o]n a fundamental level, the policy appears to invade consumer privacy by automatically sharing personal information consumers input into one Google product with all Google products.\\" Adding, \\"It rings hollow to call their ability to exit the Google products' ecosystem a \\"choice\\" in an Internet economy where the clear majority of all Internet users use - and frequently rely on - at least one Google product on a regular basis.\\" This latest episode of privacy violations exemplifies Google's dismissive approach to consumer privacy and its willingness to defy legal agreements with government, as well as a firestorm of controversy over its announced privacy policy changes. Just last year, Google settled a suit with the FTC over deceptive privacy practices associated with the launch of its now defunct social networking service Buzz. At the time, FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said, \\"This is a tough settlement that ensures that Google will honor its commitments to consumers and build strong privacy protections into all of its operations.\\" Clearly, last year's settlement has not been tough enough. What could be more deceptive and intrusive than telling consumers how to avoid being tracked by using certain browser settings and then deliberately undermining those settings? Google's pattern of deceptive behavior and privacy violations raises a slew of issues with broader marketplace, consumer and regulatory implications. Google has a dominant market presence: its search page is the most visited website in the world and its backend data analysis tools are being used by leading websites. Inevitably, its behavior brings government and public scrutiny that impacts the entire Internet environment. In addition to the 36 attorneys general, a growing chorus of government officials and members of Congress are rightly voicing their concern about Google. Representative Mary Bono Mack (R-Calif.) has already said that she will ask Google representatives to return to Capitol Hill to explain the company's latest privacy violations. Unfortunately, it's easy to imagine Google yet again providing elected officials with another round of obfuscation that attempts to dismiss the problem. Time and again, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt and other company officials have brushed off critical questions with some version of this answer: \\"It's too technical. You wouldn't understand.\\" This lame appeal to technical functionality is extremely dangerous for the tech industry at large. It challenges government to developing new industry-wide rules that could include cumbersome oversight. Such a regulatory scheme could broadly stifle innovation, if applied overzealously, and it conveniently deflects attention away from Google. If given honest and accurate information about how much of their private information is being harvested by Google and how that information is being used, American consumers can decide which technologies are best suited for them. Unfortunately, Google has proven time and again that if left alone, the company cannot be trusted to be open and transparent with their customers. What, then, can consumers and government do that will improve online privacy protections without over-regulating the Internet? First and foremost, government needs to use current law and regulatory enforcement that truly works. Penalties against Google have not been sufficient to change its behavior, so tougher penalties should be enforced. These penalties -- including tight oversight -- should be focused on the single corporate perpetrator -- Google -- not the tech industry or the Internet at large. Maybe Google should be banned from collecting any online consumer information until the company can abide by its own stated privacy policies. Consumers must also remain vigilant. They need to raise their concerns with their elected officials and, if possible, even take their business elsewhere. Unfortunately, Google dominates so much Internet traffic that it remains virtually impossible to fully escape its reach. -- That's why we need complete answers by Google to explain the extent of their data collection methods across the web and how the information is used to target consumers for ads. To get these answers, lawmakers should demand that Google executives appear before Congress and testify under oath. Then U.S. consumers can make informed decisions about how much of their private information is being collected by Google and how it is being used. American consumers need the facts so they can be responsible for protecting themselves online.

It is truly saddening to see an artist's work and life being so unjustly misinterpretated. Inconcievably (or perhaps it should have been expected), Artemisia's entire character and all that she stands for, had been reduced to a standard Hollywood, female character; a pitiful, physically flawless, helpless little creature, displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here. Sadder yet, was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film, and reality. To portray the artist as someone in love with her real-life rapist, someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture, just plain pisses me off.

If \\"A man and woman watching a sports event in a stadium.\\", does this mean that \\"The two people are watching organized sports.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the phrase \\"A man and woman watching a sports event in a stadium\\" suggests that the two people, a man and a woman, are present in a stadium observing an organized sports event. Here, the context provided allows us to draw a few details and conclusions about the situation. Firstly, sports events are typically organized activities that involve competitive physical exertion or skill-based games, played according to a set of rules. Such events are part of a larger competition or tournament where teams and individual players participate to win or achieve a favorable outcome. The most common organized sports include games like soccer, basketball, football, tennis, baseball, and more. Secondly, watching a sports event in a stadium implies that the man and woman are physically present in the venue. Stadiums are large, open-air or enclosed structures with seating for spectators to view sports events or other entertainment activities. The atmosphere in a stadium is usually energetic, with fans cheering for their preferred team or player. People attend these events to witness the live-action, engage in social interactions, and enjoy the overall experience that televised or digital media may not fully capture. The presence of the man and woman in a stadium watching a sports event indicates that they are indeed observing an organized sports activity. They are likely experiencing the competitiveness, excitement, and camaraderie that such events bring. Sports events often foster a sense of community and belonging among spectators, whether or not they support the same team or athlete. As a result, attending these events can be an exhilarating and entertaining experience for all involved. To summarize, the statement \\"A man and woman watching a sports event in a stadium\\" means that \\"The two people are watching organized sports.\\" The organized sports events provide the context for their presence in the stadium, and their engagement in the spectacle highlights the appeal and enjoyment of sports-related activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which... answer the following question: What two compositions did Holst write in 1906?

On his way home, Ed is confronted by Jerry, who claims that he has been watching Ed and has been aware of Ed watching him. Jerry soon chases Ed into a nearby pool and convinces him into believing that his life would be much better if he was a vampire. Ed succumbs and willingly allows Jerry to bite him. The next day, Charley realizes that Ed is missing and decides to investigate, starting to believe Ed's claims when he discovers video recordings of objects moving on their own, with Ed's voiceover revealing that he is recording Jerry to prove that his reflection doesn't show up in recordings.

Multi-select: Knowing that \\"the circulatory system transports blood throughout the body\\", how would one answer \\"What makes sure that the tips of your toes have enough of the gas that plants put off?\\" Choose from: - your circulatory system. - your pancreas. - warm socks. - your nervous system....A:","completion":"The question refers indirectly to oxygen, the gas that plants release during photosynthesis, which is essential for life in many animals, including humans. The circulatory system in the human body plays a significant role in transporting this gas distributed by plants to all parts of the body, including to the tips of your toes. Let's take a detailed look at how this process occurs: The circulatory or cardiovascular system is comprised of the heart, blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries), and blood. Its primary role is to transport various substances throughout the body, and it acts much like a network of roads facilitating the movement of important elements from one location to another. Among the substances it transports are oxygen and nutrients to cells and takes away waste products like carbon dioxide for elimination. Breathing air into your lungs brings oxygen into your body, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream through tiny air sacs called alveoli within the lungs. Hemoglobin, a protein within red blood cells, has a particular affinity for oxygen, allowing oxygen molecules to bind to it. This oxygen-rich blood is then transported by the circulatory system throughout the body. After leaving the lungs, the oxygen-rich blood arrives at the heart, which pumps it out through the aorta (the large artery leaving the heart) and into a series of smaller arteries and arterioles, eventually leading to capillaries. It's in the network of microscopic capillaries that oxygen is released and diffuses into the body's cells — even those in the distant tips of your toes. Now, let's discuss the options you have given. - Your circulatory system: As explained above, this system plays a vital role in making sure that your toes — and the rest of your tissues, for that matter — receive enough of the gas that plants release, which is oxygen. The circulatory system is the answer to this specific question. - Your pancreas: This organ is part of the digestive system, and its primary functions are to produce insulin for blood sugar regulation and produce enzymes for the breakdown of food. While important, it's not directly involved in the transport of gases like oxygen. - Warm socks: While warm socks serve to keep our feet warm and could have an indirect role in promoting good circulation in cold conditions, they do not have any biological function in the transport of oxygen. - Your nervous system: This system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, controls and coordinates body's activities and enables communication within the body. While playing an important role in regulating heart rate and respiratory rate, it does not physically transport oxygen throughout the body. In conclusion, the circulatory system ensures that the tips of your toes, along with rest of your body's cells, have enough of the oxygen that plants produce and release into the atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

Sasha Bell-Newman, age 13 from Burntisland, a pupil at Balwearie High School, Kirkcaldy, bullied because she is English. An English-born schoolgirl was left in tears when she became the victim of vicious anti-English abuse in her Scottish secondary school. Sasha Bell-Newman, 13, was told to ‘f*** off back to your own country’ by a fellow pupil. According to Sasha’s mother, Teresa, the pupils have recently been taught about the forthcoming independence referendum and had been encouraged to think about a Scottish national anthem. The distressing incident has sparked fears that internet abuse which has already soured the debate over Scotland’s future is now spreading into everyday life. Yesterday former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the family’s local MP, contacted Mrs Bell-Newman to offer his sympathies. He also said he would contact the local education authority to discuss what happened. Sasha was born in Dorset, but the family moved to Scotland when she was just ten months old after falling in love with the country on holiday. She lives with her 44-year-old mother, 40-year-old father Robert Newman, and four-year old brother Ollie in Burntisland on the Firth of Forth. Mrs Bell-Newman said Sasha, a pupil at Balwearie High in Kirkcaldy, was reduced to tears on Wednesday following the abuse by a fellow classmate. She said: 'My concern is that the situation could possibly get totally out of control if nothing is done now before the referendum vote takes place later in the year. 'The authorities and even the politicians must do something immediately to try and defuse the whole situation before it gets out of hand.' The full-time mother said Sasha’s class recently heard from a minister who visited the school about what would happen in an independent Scotland, and she said the class was discussing an anthem that would ‘embrace Scottishness’ when the incident happened. She said: 'One of her classmates turned to Sasha and said he was glad to have her in their team because she had won several Burns poetry competitions. 'He mentioned that she had achieved this without even being Scottish, a comment that was overhead by another pupil who started to shout and swear at her, telling her to ‘f**k off back to your own country’. 'When I contacted the school later they were extremely apologetic and they have been really good in sorting this out. Balwarie high school in Kirkcaldy, Fife, where Sasha has lived since she was ten months old, after her family took a holiday to Scotland and 'fell in love' with the country. 'But I fear this could be the tip of the iceberg and possibly being experienced by many others because of the passion being whipped up surrounding independence. 'We’re a very British family, but I’m afraid to put a pro-Union sticker in my window.' Mrs Bell-Newman said her daughter was too upset to go to school yesterday, but may return today. On Wednesday evening she contacted Gordon Brown’s office, and yesterday received a personal phone call from the former Prime Minister. Mrs Bell-Newman said: 'He said he was very sorry about what had happened and would contact the education authorities. 'He pointed out that his wife is English and said he hopes that what is happening is by a small minority of Scots.' Mr Brown has shied away from public appearances following his defeat in the 2010 General Election, but has made something of a comeback in recent weeks with a series of attacks on Scottish nationalism. Last night, James More, rector of Balwearie High School, said: 'Any incident which may be motivated by prejudice is dealt with promptly. 'Discussion has taken place with the parents of both children involved to ensure that no repeat of this behaviour occurs and the matter is resolved in a restorative manner. As with all schools we deal robustly with incidents which may be motivated by prejudice as they occur, on a case by case basis, in line with Fife Council policy.' A Fife Council spokesman said all local authority schools have a ‘clear line of impartiality that they adhere to’ ahead of this year’s referendum. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Keane was born into a working class family in Ballinderry Park, Mayfield, Cork. His father, Maurice, took work wherever he could find, which led to jobs at a local knitwear company and at Murphy's Irish Stout brewery, among others. His family were keen on sport, football especially, and many of his relatives had played for junior clubs in Cork, including Rockmount. Keane took up boxing at the age of nine and trained for a number of years, winning all of his four bouts in the novice league. Keane made headlines again in the 2001 Manchester derby, when five minutes from the final whistle, he was sent off for a blatant knee-high foul on Alf-Inge Haland in what was seen by many as an act of revenge. He initially received a three-match suspension and a PS5,000 fine from The Football Association (FA), but further punishment was to follow after the release of Keane's autobiography in August 2002, in which he stated that he intended \\"to hurt\\" Haland. Keane's account of the incident was as follows: I'd waited long enough. I fucking hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you cunt. And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries. An admission that the tackle was in fact a premeditated assault, it left the FA with no choice but to charge Keane with bringing the game into disrepute. He was banned for a further five matches and fined PS150,000 in the ensuing investigation. Despite widespread condemnation, he later maintained in an interview that he had no regrets about the incident: \\"My attitude was, fuck him. What goes around comes around. He got his just rewards. He fucked me over and my attitude is an eye for an eye\\", and said he would probably do the same thing again. Haland later implied that the tackle effectively finished his playing career as he never played a full game afterwards. However, Haland did complete the match and played 68 minutes of the following game. He also played a friendly for Norway in between both matches. It was, in fact, a long-standing injury to his left knee that ended his career rather than his right.

It is one of the few owls that is neither nocturnal nor crepuscular, being active only during the day. This is the only living species in the genus \\"Surnia\\" of the family Strigidae, the \\"typical\\" owls (as opposed to barn owls, Tytonidae). The species is sometimes called simply the hawk owl; however, many species of owls in the \\"Ninox\\" genus are also called \\"hawk owls\\". - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Barn - owls ( family Tytonidae ) are one of the two families of owls , the other being the true owls or typical owls , Strigidae . They are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart - shaped faces . They have long , strong legs with powerful talons . They also differ from Strigidae in structural details relating in particular to the sternum and feet . The barn owls comprise two extant sub-families : the Tytoninae or Tyto owls ( including the common barn owl ) and the Phodilinae or bay - owls . The Sibley - Ahlquist taxonomy unites the Caprimulgiformes with the owl order ; here , the barn - owls are a subfamily Tytoninae . This is unsupported by more recent research ( see Cypselomorphae ) , but the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved . The barn owls are a wide ranging family , although they are absent from northern North America , Saharan Africa and large areas of Asia . They live in a wide range of habitats from deserts to forests , and from temperate latitudes to the tropics . The majority of the 16 living species of barn owls are poorly known . Some , like the red owl , have barely been seen or studied since their discovery , in contrast to the common barn owl , which is one of the best known owl species in the world . However , some sub-species of the common barn owl possibly deserve to be separate species , but are very poorly known . Five species of barn - owl are threatened , and some island species have gone extinct during the Holocene or earlier ( e.g. Tyto pollens , known from the fossil record of Andros Island in the Bahamas , and possibly the basis for the mythical Chickcharnie ) . The barn - owls are mostly nocturnal , and generally non-migratory , living in pairs or singly . - Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl. - The genus Tyto includes all barn owls (family Tytonidae) except for the bay owls (subfamily Phodilinae, genus \\"Phodilus\\") that is, the true barn owls, the grass owls and the masked owls collectively making up the subfamily Tytoninae. They are darker on the back than the front, usually an orange-brown colour, the front being a paler version of the back or mottled, although there is considerable variation even amongst species. \\"Tyto\\" owls have a divided, heart-shaped facial disc, and lack the ear-like tufts of feathers found in many other owls. \\"Tyto\\" owls tend to be larger than Bay-owls. The name \\"tyto ()\\" is onomatopeic Greek for owl. - The burrowing owl (\\"Athene cunicularia\\") is a small, long-legged owl found throughout open landscapes of North and South America. Burrowing owls can be found in grasslands, rangelands, agricultural areas, deserts, or any other open dry area with low vegetation. They nest and roost in burrows, such as those excavated by prairie dogs (\\"Cynomys\\" spp.). Unlike most owls, burrowing owls are often active during the day, although they tend to avoid the midday heat. Like many other kinds of owls, though, burrowing owls do most of their hunting from dusk until dawn, when they can use their night vision and hearing to their advantage. Living in open grasslands as opposed to forests, the burrowing owl has developed longer legs that enable it to sprint, as well as fly, when hunting. - Hawks are a group of medium-sized diurnal birds of prey of the family Accipitridae which are widely distributed and varying greatly in size. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'barn-owl' with the relationship of 'parent taxon'.

First, notice that we have 323*b and -368*b in the equation. We can combine these terms, as they both contain the variable \\"b\\". 323*b - 368*b = -45*b So, the simplified equation now is: -45*b = -37 - 278 Step 2: Combine the constants. Now, combine the constants on the right side of the equation. -37 - 278 = -315 The equation now becomes: -45*b = -315 Step 3: Solve for \\"b\\". To solve for \\"b\\", we'll need to divide both sides of the equation by -45. -45*b / -45 = -315 / -45 This simplifies to: b = 7 The solution for the equation 323*b - 368*b = -37 - 278 is: b = 7"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a detailed comparison of the two sentences: Sentence 1: Chandramohan showed an interest in the character, but the character was ultimately played by Sobhan Babu. Sentence 2: Chandramohan showed interest in the character, but the character was ultimately played by Sobhan Babu. 1. Use of the article \\"an\\": In the first sentence, the indefinite article \\"an\\" is used before the word \\"interest,\\" indicating a specific type of interest that Chandramohan had in the character. The use of \\"an\\" here makes the meaning slightly more emphatic and precise. In the second sentence, the article \\"an\\" is omitted, making the sentence sound more casual and less specific about the nature of Chandramohan's interest. 2. Use of the preposition \\"in\\": In the first sentence, the preposition \\"in\\" is used after \\"interest,\\" which means that Chandramohan showed interest \\"in\\" a specific character. This construction emphasizes the object of interest, i.e., the character. In the second sentence, the preposition \\"in\\" is missing, making the sentence less formal in structure. Although the intended meaning is still clear, the sentence appears more colloquial in nature without the preposition. To sum up, the two sentences do convey a similar overall message - that Chandramohan was interested in a character that was ultimately played by Sobhan Babu. However, the slight differences in word choice and structure lead to nuanced variations in their meanings. The first sentence comes across as more specific and emphatic, whereas the second sentence seems more casual and less precise in terms of the nature of Chandramohan's interest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pound cake mix provides a slightly denser texture compared to the sponge cake used in store-bought Twinkies, but it works great for this home-based version. Here's a detailed step-by-step process on how to prepare pound cake mix to make Homemade Twinkies: Ingredients: 1. One 16-ounce package of pound cake mix (such as Betty Crocker) 2. 2/3 cup water 3. 1/2 cup vegetable oil 4. 3 eggs 5. Cooking spray for greasing 6. Cream filling (recipe below) Tools: 1. Electric mixer 2. Twinkie or mini loaf pan (optional) 3. Pastry bag with a small round tip 4. Wire rack 5. Toothpick or skewer Cream Filling Ingredients: 1. 2 cups marshmallow fluff or marshmallow creme 2. 1 cup unsalted butter, softened 3. 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 4. 1 cup powdered sugar Instructions: 1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). 2. Spray your Twinkie or mini loaf pan with a light layer of cooking spray, making sure to grease the cavities evenly to prevent sticking. If you don't have a Twinkie or mini loaf pan, you can use a muffin tin or aluminum foil to create molds that have an elongated shape. 3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the pound cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs. Mix the ingredients together using an electric mixer, on low speed, for about 30 seconds. Increase the speed to medium, and mix for an additional 2 minutes, or until the batter is smooth and free of lumps. 4. Pour the pound cake batter into the prepared Twinkie, mini loaf, or muffin pan, filling each cavity about 2/3 to 3/4 full. Make sure not to overfill them, as the batter will expand when baking. 5. Bake in your preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick or skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. The cakes should be golden brown on top. 6. Remove the Twinkies from the oven and let them cool in the pan for about 5 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack, allowing them to cool completely. 7. While the Twinkies are cooling, prepare the cream filling. In a mixing bowl, combine the marshmallow fluff, softened unsalted butter, and vanilla extract. Using an electric mixer, whisk the ingredients together until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar and continue mixing until the filling reaches a smooth and creamy consistency. 8. Once the Twinkies have cooled completely, create small holes in the bottom of each using a toothpick or skewer. Be careful not to poke all the way through. 9. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a small round tip (about 1/4-inch in diameter) with the prepared cream filling. Insert the tip of the pastry bag into each hole at the bottom of the Twinkies and gently squeeze to fill them with the cream. You should feel the Twinkie expand slightly as you fill it. Wipe away any excess cream that comes out of the holes. 10. Your Homemade Twinkies are now ready to be enjoyed. Store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. Enjoy!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Mars rover's team aims to have it scooping up Martian soil samples within the coming weeks for analysis. A groundbreaking achievement for the rover includes its recent sampling of the Martian atmosphere. The first such experiment since the Viking landings in the 1970s, it aims to measure methane gas on Mars. Satellites have previously detected this short-lived gas, whose existence would indicate that some kind of replenishing source, whether geochemical or even biological, exists on the planet. The Mars Curiosity rover's achievements provide a solid foundation for further exploration and experimentation. With more system checks underway and new discoveries in store, this Martian mission promises to reshape our understanding of the Red Planet and its potential to support life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eric took their studies far more seriously than Derrick, because Options are: (1). Eric was more concerned with drinking.. (2). Derrick was more concerned with drinking..","completion":"(2). Derrick was more concerned with drinking. Eric and Derrick were polar opposites when it came to their approach to life. Eric was the introspective, diligent student who lost himself in his studies, while Derrick was more of a social butterfly, focusing more on his social life and the many parties college had to offer. With both of them being roommates in college, it soon became apparent that Derrick was more concerned with drinking and other indulgences. Perhaps it was his rebellious nature or just the need for another adrenaline rush, Derrick could always be found holding a red solo cup in a crowded room of screaming, dancing students. Unlike Derrick, Eric had his priorities straight, which included putting his education first. He understood that college was an expensive investment in his future and was determined to get the most out of it. This attitude drove a wedge between the two friends, as Derrick could never understand why someone wouldn't want to participate in the revelry that occurred every weekend on campus. This contrast in behavior began to create a rift between the roommates. There were times that Derrick missed important lectures and assignments because he was recuperating from the previous night's excessive drinking - and Eric was forced to deal with the ensuing mess. As the semester wore on, Eric's academic performance improved tremendously, so much so that he was on the verge of earning a prestigious scholarship. The professors recognized his hard work and dedication, which only served to motivate him to aim higher. Meanwhile, Derrick started to realize the consequences of his incessant partying. His grades were slipping, and he found himself struggling to maintain the desired GPA. No matter how much he studied, he was unable to catch up with the academics he had neglected. Worried for his friend, Eric tried to talk to Derrick about the future and the importance of focused efforts on academics. Yet, despite the seriousness of his intentions, Eric couldn't break through the barrier Derrick had erected around his beliefs. Derrick, in a moment of realization, began to evaluate his actions. He suddenly understood that he was jeopardizing his future for fleeting pleasures. At first, this epiphany put a temporary halt to his drinking, but it wasn't long before he was back to his old ways. After the semester ended, the differences between the two roommates continued to grow. Eric received numerous awards at the college's annual ceremony, including the prestigious scholarship that he had set his sights on. Derrick, on the other hand, found himself on the brink of dismissal due to his deplorable academic performance. With summer unfolding, both roommates returned home. From that point on, their paths diverged significantly. Eric continued with his dedication to academics, earning a degree with honors, and later pursuing a successful career in his chosen field. Derrick, unfortunately, spiraled deeper into the world of alcohol and parties. Their contrasting choices demonstrate the long-term effects of personal decisions. Eric's focus on his studies allowed him to establish a stable and thriving career, while Derrick's obsession with drinking resulted in a myriad of personal and financial issues. Through the lives of these roommates, the story serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of prioritizing academics and safeguarding one's future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Where is a good place to keep a saucer you don't use but want to look at? Possible A: kitchen, tea room, china cabinet, kitchen cabinet, cup Why is \\"china cabinet\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"A china cabinet, sometimes referred to as a china hutch, is an answer that aligns with human common sense because of several reasons. Firstly, it serves the dual purposes of storage and display for fine china, decorative dishes, and other ornamental items, including saucers. This makes it an ideal place to keep a saucer that you don't necessarily use, but want to have on display. China cabinets are specifically designed with aesthetic appeal and functionality in mind. They typically include glass or transparent doors, which allow the contents to be easily visible, showcasing the beauty of your saucer while also keeping it dust-free and protected. This feature makes it an attractive and safe option for displaying delicate or valuable items like a cherished saucer. Furthermore, china cabinets are usually placed in dining rooms, living rooms, or other social areas of the home, making it the perfect location to display your beautiful saucer where guests and family members are likely to see and appreciate it. By placing the saucer in the china cabinet, you demonstrate that the saucer has importance and sentimental value to you, and you want to share its beauty with others. Additionally, china cabinets are designed not only to display fine china but also to protect it from potential damage or accidental knocks. They often include built-in grooves or plate racks to keep your saucer and other pieces steady and secure. This solid support, coupled with the cabinet's enclosed design, provides a safe environment for your saucer, reducing the risk of damage over time. Unlike other possible answers like the kitchen, tea room, or kitchen cabinet, a china cabinet provides a dedicated space specifically designed for showcasing and preserving delicate and special items like saucers. While a cup may be used to display the saucer, it doesn't provide the same level of protection or visual appeal as a china cabinet. In conclusion, \\"china cabinet\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense because it offers an ideal combination of display, protection, and organization for your saucer. It enables you to showcase the saucer in a prominent location, where it can be appreciated by yourself and others, while simultaneously protecting it from dust, accidents, and potential damage. It is a purpose-built piece of furniture that caters specifically to the needs and desires of those who own and value fine china and other decorative items such as your cherished saucer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. recycled B. inclined C. disposed D. avid E. enthusiastic A:","completion":"C. disposed In the given context, the most suitable option is \\"disposed,\\" suggesting that the agent of change, who has a strong dislike or loath feeling towards the king, will set a plan to remove or dethrone the king. The term \\"disposed\\" implies that the agent would like to get rid of the king or eliminate his influence because of the aversion he possesses. It conveys a sense of intention and action. Let's look into the other options and why they do not fit: A. recycled Recycling means to convert material and reuse it to create a new product or use. In the context of the question, it does not make sense to apply this term to a plan against the king. This term is more appropriate for environmental contexts. B. inclined To be inclined means to have a preference or be disposed favorably towards an idea or a person. Since the agent of change has a loath feeling for the king, being inclined towards the king does not correspond to the intended meaning. D. avid Avid implies having an eagerness or enthusiasm for something. It is not suitable in this context, as the agent of change wants to take negative actions against the king, and being avid does not capture the intended sense of opposition or desire to dethrone the king. E. enthusiastic Enthusiastic indicates having zeal or excitement about something, but in the given context, the agent of change harbors hostility or animosity towards the king. Thus enthusiastic does not correlate with the negative sentiment the agent has for the king.

In short, the United States has to help defeat an ideology, not just a group of people, and we must do so under difficult circumstances. How can the United States and its friends help moderate Muslims combat the extremist ideas? Recommendation: The U.S. government must define what the message is, what it stands for. We should offer an example of moral leadership in the world, committed to treat people humanely, abide by the rule of law, and be generous and caring to our neighbors. America and Muslim friends can agree on respect for human dignity and opportunity. To Muslim parents, terrorists like Bin Laden have nothing to offer their children but visions of violence and death. America and its friends have a crucial advantage-we can offer these parents a vision that might give their children a better future. If we heed the views of thoughtful leaders in the Arab and Muslim world, a moderate consensus can be found. That vision of the future should stress life over death: individual educational and economic opportunity. This vision includes widespread political participation and contempt for indiscriminate violence. It includes respect for the rule of law, openness in discussing differences, and tolerance for opposing points of view. Recommendation: Where Muslim governments, even those who are friends, do not respect these principles, the United States must stand for a better future. One of the lessons of the long Cold War was that short-term gains in cooperating with the most repressive and brutal governments were too often outweighed by long-term setbacks for America's stature and interests. American foreign policy is part of the message. America's policy choices have consequences. Right or wrong, it is simply a fact that American policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and American actions in Iraq are dominant staples of popular commentary across the Arab and Muslim world. That does not mean U.S. choices have been wrong. It means those choices must be integrated with America's message of opportunity to the Arab and Muslim world.

The new person, whose name I later learned to be Alex, had caught me off guard, and I was immediately defensive. But that brief interaction sparked my curiosity about snoring, its causes, and how to control it. First, let's understand what snoring is. Snoring occurs when the flow of air through the mouth and nose is partially blocked during sleep. This blockage causes the surrounding tissues to vibrate, producing the familiar sound of snoring. Several factors can contribute to snoring, including nasal congestion, obesity, alcohol consumption, and sleep position. Now that we know what causes snoring, let's explore some ways to control it, especially in public settings: 1. Maintain a healthy weight: Obesity can lead to excess fatty tissue in the throat area, which narrows the airway and makes it more difficult for air to flow freely. Losing weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise can help alleviate snoring. 2. Sleep on your side: Sleeping on your back can cause your tongue and soft palate to collapse to the back of your throat, partially blocking the airway and increasing the likelihood of snoring. Sleeping on your side may help prevent this. 3. Nasal decongestants: If nasal congestion is causing your snoring, over-the-counter nasal decongestants and saline sprays can help clear the airway and reduce snoring. 4. Limit alcohol consumption: Alcohol relaxes the muscles in the throat, which can contribute to snoring. Reducing your alcohol intake, especially in the evening, can help minimize snoring. 5. Proper sleep hygiene: Establishing a consistent sleep schedule and creating a comfortable sleep environment can promote better sleep quality, which may, in turn, help reduce snoring. 6. Anti-snoring mouthpieces: In some cases, specially designed mouthpieces can help prevent snoring. These devices work by shifting the lower jaw forward or holding the tongue in place, thereby opening the airway. 7. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy: For individuals with sleep apnea, a medical condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, a CPAP machine may be necessary. These machines provide a steady stream of air pressure to the user, effectively eliminating snoring and other sleep apnea symptoms. 8. Surgery: In severe cases, surgery may be required to treat snoring. Surgical procedures aimed at treating snoring focus on removing excess tissue from the throat or reconstructing the airway to facilitate better breathing. Of course, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional if you are concerned about snoring or believe it may be related to an underlying health condition. They can recommend the appropriate course of treatment based on your individual needs. In conclusion, while it may have been embarrassing to be called out for snoring in public, this experience led me to research and better understand the causes and potential solutions for snoring. By implementing some of the strategies mentioned above, many people can successfully control their snoring and ultimately improve their sleep quality and overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is an article: For most of a week she was handcuffed, gagged and locked in a closet. The 15-year-old from Massachusetts endured seven days of beatings and sexual torture by a Long Island couple she met through the Internet, who later coerced her to New York - and then \\"loaned\\" her for two days to a Queens man who abused her as a sex slave as well, police said. The girl's first contact with the couple came months ago, when she met James Warren, 41, in an America Online chat room and told him she wanted to run away from the home where she lived with her parents. They arranged to meet in Wrentham, Mass., on Aug. 3, and Warren brought along Beth Loschin, 46. The teen got in their car, \\"and after about an hour, she knew she was in over her head,\\" said Nassau County Detective Lt. Vincent Robustelli. They spent one night at a motel near Providence, R.I., where the couple raped her, and then drove to Loschin's and Warren's homes, where the attacks continued, police said. On Wednesday, the couple even forced her to call cops in her suburban Boston hometown of Wrentham and made her say she was okay and heading to California. But, police said, she was headed instead to the Astoria, Queens, apartment of Michael Montez. Warren and Loschin \\"told her they were going to loan her to Michael,\\" according to the criminal complaint. \\"If she did not do what Michael wanted, they would beat her more . . . and would kill her and get rid of her.\\" The girl was told to wear high heels and black lingerie for Montez, prosecutors said. Montez allegedly stuffed the teen's ears with toilet paper, used bandages to cover her eyes and locked her in a closet. Prosecutors said he tied a rope around the girl's neck and anchored the other end to a clothes rack. It wasn't until Friday, the seventh day of her ordeal, back in Loschin's home in Farmingdale, L.I., that the girl managed to snoop around the cluttered residence, police said. With the couple outside, she found the cell phone they had taken from her and quietly called Wrentham police, who had been looking for her and left her a message checking on her well-being. When she asked for help but said she didn't know where she was, they told her to try to find some mail. She did, and minutes later Nassau County cops were at the house, arresting Loschin, a divorced mother of two, and Warren, a computer repairman from Hampton Bays, L.I. Law enforcement sources said the girl's injuries included trauma to her genital area, strangulation marks on her neck and hemorrhaging in her eyes, a result of choking. She was being treated at a Nassau hospital yesterday and expected to return home with her mother. Warren faces kidnapping, sodomy, rape and sexual abuse charges. Police said he had been convicted in Connecticut of a child-related offense in 1979 and served three years in jail. Loschin was charged with several counts of sodomy and sexual abuse. Cops arrested Montez, 35, on Saturday. He was expected to be arraigned last night on kidnapping, rape and sodomy charges. Loschin's neighbors said she was distant and rarely socialized outside the home. They noted that her lawn rarely is mowed and that her ranch-style house is dark and dreary.

Article: TRENTON — The state Supreme Court ruled today that notebooks filled with gangster rap lyrics written by a man accused of attempted murder cannot be used as evidence to help prove a motive. A trial court convicted Vonte Skinner of shooting and paralyzing a drug dealer, Lamont Peterson, during a 2005 incident in Willingboro Township — based in part on pages of violent and graphic rap lyrics that police found in a car Skinner was driving at the time. An appellate court later threw out Skinner's conviction, saying the judge shouldn't have allowed prosecutors for the state to read the lyrics to the jury. The Supreme Court voted 6-0 today to uphold the appellate ruling and ordered a new trial for Skinner. Justice Jaynee LaVecchia wrote that using the lyrics as evidence was \\"highly prejudicial,\\" \\"bore little or no probative value\\" as to any motive in the shooting, and \\"risked poisoning the jury.\\" \\"One would not presume that Bob Marley, who wrote the well-known song 'I Shot the Sheriff,' actually shot a sheriff, or that Edgar Allan Poe buried a man beneath his floorboards, as depicted in his short story 'The Tell-Tale Heart,' simply because of their respective artistic endeavors on those subjects,\\" LaVecchia wrote. \\"The Court reasons that defendant's lyrics should receive no different treatment.\\" Civil liberties advocates watched the case closely, saying lyrics are a form of artistic expression and should be protected as free speech. The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey wrote a brief in Skinner's support, arguing that rap lyrics are \\"often a vehicle for social and political commentary\\" and that admitting these as evidence would run \\"the risk of chilling otherwise valuable speech.\\" Skinner was convicted in 2008 of shooting Peterson seven times at close range, leaving the victim paralyzed from the waist down. Peterson testified that he and Skinner sold drugs as part of a three-man team and that the shooting happened after an argument arose. In his own testimony, Skinner said Peterson was shot by another man. As part of the trial, prosecutors read from Skinner's lyrics, which depict shootings, knifings, and rapes. One verse read: \\"A (racial epithet) wouldn't listen so I hit him with the Smithen; hauled off 15 rounds, seven missed him; Two to the mask and six to the ribs, lifted and flipped him. The safe street squad found him, half his shell mission.\\" But prosecutors did not tell jurors when Peterson wrote them. All the lyrics were written \\"long before\\" the shooting — some four or five years before, according to the ruling. Joseph Glyn, a state deputy attorney general, told the Supreme Court in April that the lyrics were evidence of Skinner's \\"continuing mindset.\\" \\"These lyrics explain why defendant did what he did,\\" Glyn said. Jason Coe, Skinner's public defender, argued that lyrics could be used as evidence only \\"when there are particular, detailed accounts about the crime charged.\\" In Indiana, a man who killed his mother and placed her body in the trunk of a car wrote lyrics describing the same actions. The court admitted those words as evidence. In today's opinion, LaVecchia wrote that lyrics can be used as evidence of guilt if they connect strongly to the details of the crime the defendant is charged with committing or if they mention the victim by name. But, she added, Skinner's lyrics did neither. \\"The lyrics can only be regarded as fictional accounts,\\" LaVecchia wrote. \\"The state has produced no evidence otherwise.\\" ||||| In 2005 prosecutors in New Jersey pointed to the violent rap lyrics written by a criminal suspect as evidence of that man's \\"motive and intent\\" to commit murder and other misdeeds. During the trial, those lyrics—which had zero connection to the actual crimes at issue—were read to the jury, which ultimately voted to convict the man of attempted murder. In an opinion issued on Monday, the New Jersey Supreme Court nullified that verdict, ordering a new trial on the grounds that \\"the violent, profane, and disturbing rap lyrics authored by defendant constituted highly prejudicial evidence against him that bore little or no probative value as to any motive or intent behind the attempted murder offense with which he was charged.\\" Unless such material has \\"a direct connection to the specifics of the offense,\\" the court ruled, prosecutors are forbidden from introducing it as evidence. The New Jersey Supreme Court got it right. As the ACLU noted in an amicus brief it filed in the case, \\"that a rap artist wrote lyrics seemingly embracing a world of violence is no more reason to ascribe to him a motive and intent to commit violent acts\\" than it would be \\"to indict Johnny Cash for having 'shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.'\\" The New Jersey Supreme Court's ruling in State v. Skinner is available here. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The New Jersey Supreme Court has ruled that rap lyrics written by a man accused of attempted murder cannot be used as evidence to help prove a motive.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which happened earlier, Newfoundland reverted to colonial status or the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration? Context: The ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the 1923 Imperial Conference. Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, declaring the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent. Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression. Ireland distanced itself further from Britain with the introduction of a new constitution in 1937, making it a republic in all but name.

News article: Bookkeeper steals 650K from Bronx real estate biz: DA A conniving bookkeeper looted 650,000 from a 114-year-old Bronx real estate company, nearly forcing the venerable family business to shut its doors, authorities charged Tuesday. Defendant Chetandeo (Ray) Brij-Raj pleaded not guilty in Bronx Supreme Court to three felony charges in the alleged massive five-year ripoff of Schmidt Realty, according to a Bronx criminal complaint. The suspect wrote himself hundreds of checks between May 2006 and September 2011, forging his boss' signature on each one, the Bronx District Attorney's office said. Brij-Raj, 45, who was responsible for handling the company's rents and expenses, then altered the books at Schmidt Realty to cover his crooked tracks, prosecutors said. The bookkeeper, in an unrelated case, already faces a federal discrimination lawsuit filed last year for his refusal to show available Bronx rental properties to potential black tenants. A WNBC-TV new investigation caught Brij-Raj's actions with a hidden camera. The defendant began working as a rental agent after he was fired from Schmidt when the financially-crippling scam was discovered, authorities said. The real estate company's owner, the third generation of the family business, was forced to sell more than half his properties and mortgage his home to keep Schmidt afloat. Brij-Raj entered his not guilty pleas to charges of grand larceny, criminal possession of stolen property and criminal possession of a forged instrument. The defendant, accompanied by a female friend, was released on 150,000 cash bail pending another court appearance on March 31. Both he and his attorney declined comment following the hearing. Brij-Raj faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the charges.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Firstly, let's break down the process step by step: 1. A forest fire starts 2. The trees and plants burn 3. The animals lose their homes 4. If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation 5. The plants that provide food are gone 6. The animals have little to eat Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: suppose there was no forest in the area, and the area is more dry than usual. In this scenario, - There would be no trees and plants to burn, so steps 1, 2, and 5 in the process would not occur. - Since there is no forest, the animals would either not inhabit the area or have adapted to living in a non-forest environment. Therefore, steps 3 and 6 in the process would not apply. However, if the area is more dry than usual, it might indirectly affect the process in the following ways: - The dry conditions increase the likelihood of wildfires in any nearby forests or grasslands, which in turn could start a fire closer to the animals' homes than it was initially. - If there were any plants present in the area, the dry conditions might cause them to wither and die, indirectly impacting the animals' food source. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis (no forest and the area being more dry than usual) would have a significant effect on the process. It would prevent the forest fire from directly impacting the animals in the area as they are not in a forest environment. However, the increased dryness may indirectly affect nearby environments where fires could then impact the animals' habitat or food sources."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Balakirev's despotism strained the relationship between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's King Lear, a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry of suggestions between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.Tchaikovsky allowed the first version to be premiered by Nikolai Rubinstein on March 16, 1870, after the composer had incorporated only some of Balakirev's suggestions. The premiere was a disaster. Stung by this rejection, Tchaikovsky took Balakirev's strictures to heart. He forced himself to reach beyond his musical training and rewrote much of the music into the form we know it today. Romeo would bring Tchaikovsky his first national and international acclaim and become a work the kuchka lauded unconditionally. On hearing the love theme from Romeo, Stasov told the group, \\"There were five of you; now there are six\\". Such was the enthusiasm of the Five for Romeo that at their gatherings Balakirev was always asked to play it through at the piano. He did this so many times that he learned to perform it from memory.Some critics, among them Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have wondered what would have happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not...

Article: SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) — Giving money to every panhandling homeless person you see in San Francisco would quickly bankrupt you, but social entrepreneur Anthony Bustos has a solution — he doesn’t give them money, he gives them a better marketing plan in the form of a clearer, more clever, and larger sign to hold. “Someone Thinks You’re Sexy,” “Law School Isn’t Cheap,” “Keanu Reeves Is My Homeboy,” and “Everyone Has A Dream — Mine Includes You Sparing Some Change” are among his favorites, but this sign, held by an older homeless man and posted to Instagram may have caught the most attention: “Hogwarts or Bust.” “At the core of this idea is a simple way to help a human being be more efficient at what they’re doing,” Bustos tells CBS SF. “My hope every time I pass out a sign is that it actually increases the person’s income.” The idea came while driving down Van Ness Avenue and seeing a typically small, shabby and poorly written sign saying, “Poor, hungry.” Bustos said, “I had no inclination to give alms to this man and wondered if I would feel differently were something different written on the sign.” As his Twitter profile says, “This man didn’t need money, he needed a better sign.” Still, he figures even if the signs don’t increase donations, at least a driver might smile a bit as they saw the transient. “The idea is just as much about sending positive vibes to the city’s commuters as it is helping the homeless,” Bustos said. Approaching a homeless person and offering an innovative marketing strategy is a delicate process. “The reactions have been mixed and have taught me a lot about homeless culture, and the individuals that are behind the signs,” Bustos said. Typically, Bustos will roll up to a panhandler, and say, “Hey man, I don’t have any money for you today, but I do have a bad-ass sign, would you like to take a look?” He always lets the person choose their own sign, and then he asks if he can take their picture holding it. “This is their favorite part, they always say ‘yes,'” he said. Some people get the humor in Bustos signs, and are thankful. Others may be intoxicated or mentally ill, but take the sign and hold it nonetheless. Bustos admits there are plenty who wanted money, not marketing, and they’re belligerent. Others have a sense of pride for the signs they already have. “They put the time and effort into making their own signs, and feel like it’s a way they can express themselves. They don’t want a sign that I made, because it doesn’t represent them as individuals,” Bustos said. Bustos, known on Twitter as @dailysmirks, is a bit of a wanderer himself. The one-time University of Utah student has been a caterer, bartender, oil field worker, street evangelist, dog trainer, and door-to-door salesmen. He dabbles in poetry and hip-hop, and loves golf. This eclectic background and mix of urban street smarts with higher pursuits puts him in a unique position to do some good. “I want to leave a positive footprint on our world during my short time here. If possible, I’d like to leave it in better shape than I found it. I love making people smile and laugh.” With the 15 signs he’s distributed in his first round, he’s already succeeded, and he has many more in the works. ||||| SAN FRANCISCO, CA (KPIX/CNN) - Anthony Bustos’s philosophy is simple: Getting a little change starts with a smile. “I thought this was an easy way I can help these guys increase their income,” he said. He’s talking about signs he’s made. “The Government stole my sunscreen,” one reads. Another: “I’m way too sober for this.” He’s handed out at least fifteen so far, giving the homeless a marketing makeover in hopes a laugh translates to a donation. He keeps spare signs in his car so when he’s driving and sees someone who needs it, he has it immediately ready. “I kind of just wait for the right person and if I feel like they’re standing out there with a sign that can be improved, I roll the window down and say, ‘hey, you guys want a new sign?’” This social experiment started a few months ago. He was driving down a street and saw a panhandler with a sign that just said “poor hungry.” “I had no inclination to give him any money, and I was wondering if something funny were written on the sign, would I give him some money, and I decided I probably would have.” And it’s working for some. One man told Anthony his sign was attracting a lot of tourists, some even asking to take pictures with him. Anthony says he’s not really in a position to help someone find a job, but says, “I’m a regular guy so I think we all kind of do what we’re capable of.” He says his friends want to help, too, by either making signs or inspiring catchy phrases. “We don’t always have to change the world. We can do something small to make a small difference, and that’s ok.” And Anthony says the signs have definitely changed him. Copyright 2014 KPIX via CNN.

Given the question: Process: - Sediment settles in a place due to gravity - The sediment breaks down into small particles - Wind or water picks up the sediment - The sediment travels along the same route as the wind or water - The sediment is deposited at new locations by the wind or water - The sediment is picked up again by new wind or water - The sediment travels further - The sediment is deposited again in a new place. Question: suppose water has no effect. happens, how will it affect the wind moves sediment. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","completion":"A: more. Without water to help move and transport sediment, wind becomes the primary agent responsible for this process. As a result, wind's role in moving sediment becomes even more significant. In a scenario where water has no effect on the sediment transportation process, wind has to take up the responsibility of moving those particles. Even though other mechanisms such as gravity might still play a part in moving sediment, wind would be the primary driver. Consequently, the wind moves more sediment in this scenario. Wind has the ability to transport fine particles over considerable distances, leading to the formation of various landforms, such as sand dunes and loess deposits. Wind erosion and deposition would likely increase when water is not present to transport the sediment. As more particles become suspended in the air, the wind's capacity to carry sediment increases, leading to increased sediment transportation. Moreover, without water to help compact and bind the soil particles together, the particles would be more vulnerable to the erosive forces of the wind. This, in turn, might accelerate the process of wind erosion and sediment transportation. It is important to note that both wind and water play crucial roles in shaping our planet's landscapes. They work together, and sometimes against each other, to move and deposit sediments that lead to the formation of diverse landforms. If one of these agents were no longer effective, as in the hypothetical scenario presented where water has no effect on sediment transportation, the other agent's role would be significantly amplified. In this case, wind would be responsible for moving more sediment than it would in a situation where water was also an active participant in the transport process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? Choose from: a). No b). Yes Answer:","completion":"a). No The suggested answer provided does not accurately answer the question about the start of the civil war and its location. Instead, it mentions various technologies that were employed during the war. A more appropriate answer would be: The American Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina. Fort Sumter was a United States military installation in the harbor of Charleston, held by Union forces. Its attack marked the opening hostilities of the Civil War, which lasted until April 9, 1865, when Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. The start of the war was mainly triggered by political and social divisions among American citizens, especially regarding the issue of slavery and states' rights."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],q={key:0},z={key:1};function E(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
